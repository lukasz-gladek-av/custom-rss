November is slowing things down a bit, but it’s not quite backlog month just yet. A new <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em>, <em>Flight Simulator</em>, and Lego game headline a month of stuff hitting just before the holiday rush. </p><p>We were originally getting <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> in November, one last big RPG for fans to sink into before the end-of-year slump. Instead, Ubisoft pushed that to the February gauntlet, giving <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em>, and people who somehow still haven’t finished <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> (that’s me!) a much needed reprieve. </p><p>Instead, this month is shifting gears firmly into family game mode. In addition to a light <em>Mario Bros. </em>adventure and Microsoft’s “sorry, dad’s in the middle of a transatlantic flight out in the garage” simulator, we’re also getting a <em>Lego Horizon</em> <em>Zero Dawn </em>adaptation and<em> TMNT </em>brawler just in time to occupy all those cousins after the Thanksgiving buffet. Here are 19 games we’re paying attention to this November. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Creature collector RPG</p><p>  <em>Farmagia</em> is a monster farming action RPG revealed back during the June Nintendo showcase. It’s from the company behind <em>Story of Seasons</em>, <em>Rune Factory</em>, and other RPG sims, though this one looks more anime-flavored with <em>Pikmin</em>-sized armies helping you defeat bosses. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Mystery deduction </p><p>An online social deduction game that channels <em>Death Note</em>? Time will tell if <em>Death Note: Killer Within</em> can translate <em>Among Us</em>-like murder mystery into the mood and language of the hit anime. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC</p><p>  <strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based tactics </p><p><em>Metal Slug</em> is back and trading its iconic side-scrolling run-and-gun action for <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> gameplay in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. The slick pixel art is a nice sweetener on-top of a solid genre mashup. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Construction sim<br></p><p>Managed roller coaster chaos is back with <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>. The sequel is adding new systems, including an entire water park section. The developers promise more robust tools will let you craft more complex theme parks than ever before. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Action roguelike</p><p>For a time there were no <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>. Now there’s a new one every year. <em>Splintered Fate</em> technically came out last year, but the Apple Arcade exclusive is just now arriving on every other platform in case you’ve already exhausted <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em> and are hungry for more Foot Clan butt kicking. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Strategy role-playing game</p><p>Tactical RPG <em>Phantom Brave</em> began life as a PS2 game in 2004. It’s first remake was for Wii in 2009. Even more content was added in the PSP version a year later. Now it’s getting an HD remaster ahead of the full-blown sequel, <em>The Lost Hero</em>, due out next year. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Animal sim</p><p>2014 is officially retro now. That year’s comedic open-world chaos simulator is now getting updated 10 year later. <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em> includes updated graphics, all previous DLC, and other updates including quality-of-life improvements. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Role-playing game</p><p>Long resigned to Nintendo’s secondary handhelds, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> brings the RPG-lite formula to the company’s home console hybrid. The Switch may be almost eight years old at this point, but the<em> Brothership</em> glow-up is still the best this spiritual spin-off to <em>Paper Mario</em> has looked yet, even if early reviews <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609">are more divided</a></span> on the depth and fun of the underlying gameplay. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror action-adventure </p><p><em>Silent Hill </em>creator Keiichiro Toyama has returned with a mashup of his lesser-known survival horror classic,<em> Siren</em>, and the breezy, colorful action game <em>Gravity Rush</em>. It sounds bold, if maybe a little under-polished for his new studio’s debut project. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC, mobile</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Word clue adventure </p><p><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em> takes the acclaimed first game’s devilishly clever investigative adventure game formula to the 1970s for an exploration of the criminal underworld and human depravity. I can’t wait. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based strategy </p><p>Already out on PC, Songs of Conquest is getting a surprise console port this month. Channeling <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em>, you explore an overworld like a strategy sim while unleashing your armies in turn-based combat across tile-based battlefields. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Puzzle</p><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is the latest in Digital Eclipse’s high-quality anthology of interactive documentaries. It includes the original game and several iterations of it across platforms and creators, as well as the brand-new four-player <em>Tetris Time Warp </em>that lets you compete across the game’s history in real-time. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS4, Xbox One, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sci-fi open world crafting sim</p><p><em>Astroneer: Glitchwalkers</em> is a paid expansion, but it’s a big one. The eight-year-old planetary colony sim is getting a new map to explore, more story, and plenty of additional things to craft. Players will use new gear and tech trees to protect themselves against the titular glitched storms that threaten to hack them. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Bullet hell action-RPG roguelike </p><p><em>Temtem</em> is a Pokémon style MMO, and <em>Temtem: Swarm</em> takes the creatures from that multiplayer RPG and turns them into fodder for a <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style bullet hell adventure. I’m not sure how many more <em>Survivors</em>-likes we can have at this point, but <em>Swarm </em>sure looks pretty. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Role-playing game</p><p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> looks like the overhaul every Square Enix fan wishes their favorite old-school RPG could get. The old systems and designs remain, down to the pixel art sprites, but the rest of the world has a HD2D update that looks gorgeous. We’ll see if the rest of the decades-old game holds up. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Co-op brawler </p><p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> is the first Lego gaming adaptation of another video game. It’s more of a kids’ abridged version of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>than a one-to-one, brick-by-brick remake of sci-fi dino hunting game. It does sport couch co-op and that familiar Lego charm. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sim</p><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> returns with a sequel four years after the current-gen reboot. It includes a ton of new missions, vehicles, and terrain details. The company has promised that almost all of the previous game’s add-ons will work with and carry over to <em>Flight Sim 2024</em>. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Survival horror shooter</p><p>It’s hard to believe <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> is actually coming out. The first Stalker game in 15 years, announced back in 2018 and developed through an invasion of GSC Game World’s home country of Ukraine, the survival shooter takes players back to the open-world Exclusion Zone for more harrowing ammo scavenging and surreal mysteries. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Metroidvania soulslike</p><p>  Red Candle Games’ horror adventure game <em>Devotion </em>was a 2019 GOTY contender. The studio decided to follow it up with a cute platformer that combines metroidvania exploration with punishing soulslike combat. <em>Nine Sols</em> came to PC in May and is tough as nails. This month, players can finally take on that challenge on console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
