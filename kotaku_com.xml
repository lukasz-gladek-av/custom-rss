              <p><i><span>Toy Story 5 </span></i><span>is probably right behind </span><i><span>Toy Story 4 </span></i><span>on the list of movie sequels we didn’t need, but the movie’s first trailer feels surprisingly timely and relevant in the age of AI threatening everyone’s jobs because rich people keep insisting it’s the future.</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148"><span>Pixar’s latest tale of toys and tablets</span></a><span> is coming to theaters on June 19, and picks up with most of Andy’s old toys living with their new owner Bonnie, who was first introduced as a toddler in </span><i><span>Toy Story 3</span></i><span>. She’s a little bit older now and she’s less interested in dolls and action figures than she is in the shiny new tablet her parents bought her. Like all the toys, Lilypad (voiced by </span><i><span>Past Lives </span></i><span>star Greta Lee) is a sentient object in the </span><i><span>Toy Story </span></i><span>universe, and she isn’t holding back about her intentions to replace Bonnie’s obsolete toys as her favorite plaything. A lot of kids are killing time with screens these days, so it’s a good, suitable setup for a </span><i><span>Toy Story </span></i><span>movie in 2026, even if this series should have ended twice already.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The trailer also reveals why Woody, who left the group to be with his long-lost love Bo Peep at the end of </span><i><span>Toy Story 4</span></i><span>, is returning for this outing. He seems to have been in contact with his old friends via a walkie talkie, and when he gets word that big tech is invading the playroom, he returns to try and help. The cowboy toy is starting to show some wear and tear, though, as he now has a bald spot where the brown paint of his “hair” has worn away over time. It’s a good bit.</span></p> <p><span>Check out the trailer below:</span></p>  <p><i><span>Toy Story 5 </span></i><span>isn’t the only Pixar movie coming out this year, as the </span><i><span>Avatar</span></i><span>-esque </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456"><i><span>Hoppers</span></i></a> <span>is coming to theaters on March 6. It is, however, the first in a line of sequels the company has announced, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-incredibles-jack-black-regrets-passing-on-syndrome-villian-role-pixar-2000656750"><i><span>The Incredibles 3</span></i></a><span> and </span><i><span>Coco 2</span></i><span> also in development and just as unnecessary as a fifth </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony and Santa Monica Studio announced a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356"><span>remake of the original </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>trilogy</span></a><span> during the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-sony-ps5-god-war-castlevania-kena-castlevania-2000668291"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span> last week, and details about the project are still pretty scarce. However, we may have gotten some information from an unlikely source: Christopher Judge, the voice of Kratos. No, not the one who was in the State of Play talking about the remakes, the one who plays the god of war in the series’ more recent, Norse-themed games.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber Fuzhpuzy posted </span><a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju"><span>a since-deleted video</span></a><span> from Fan Expo Vancouver 2026 in which she approached Judge and asked him a few questions about the upcoming remakes in which, the actor confirmed, he will not be playing Kratos, as original Kratos voice actor T.C. Carson is reprising his role.</span></p>

 <p><span>Judge confirming he won’t be playing Kratos is one thing, but it seems the actor is still privy to some unannounced details about the remake project. He said that the games will include a new “fighting system.” Could this mean that the remakes are leaning into modern </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>’s heavier combat systems rather than going back to the hack-and-slash mechanics of old? Judge didn’t get any more specific, so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ps5-remake-trilogy-sex-minigames-censored-2000669769"><span>we can only speculate</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The big reveal here, however, is that Judge says we’ll hear about what he is doing with Santa Monica Studio “late summer,” though he doesn’t say if this is a new </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> game or an unrelated project.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Fuzhpuzy has taken down the video, it has been </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596"><span>shared on social media</span></a><span>. Hopefully Judge doesn’t get into too much trouble over this. Last year, Ubisoft apparently threatened </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed </span></i><span>actor Matt Ryan </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-remaster-matt-ryan-1851787469"><span>with legal action</span></a><span> for discussing the still-unannounced </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag </span></i><span>remake with a fan at a convention.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Destiny 2 Is In Real Trouble After More Big Delays And Promises]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-shadow-order-roadmap-delay-update-2000671302</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s mid-expansion update<em> Shadow and Order</em> has been delayed by three months after weeks of silence leading up to its originally planned March 3 launch. Bungie blames the wait on “large revisions” to address months of player complaints but it puts the loot shooter in an even worse position after an already terrible year.</p> <p><em>Destiny 2</em> players are the fans who cried wolf. They’re always sounding the alarm even when things are going relatively well. But trust me when I say things have never been this bleak in the history of the soon-to-be 12-year-old sci-fi MMO. Its concurrent PC player count is at an all-time low. Last December’s <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion was a neat story campaign but did little to fundamentally patch up the broader game’s crumbling framework. And a long-promised roadmap of the game’s future has been MIA for months.</p>

 <p>Normally, a message from Bungie going, “Hey, we get it, we’re working on fixing things, it’s just going to take some extra time” would be the kind of thing that soothes some of the panic. Instead, <em>Shadow and Order</em>‘s February 18 delay announcement has only made everyone even more worried. “Our next Major Update, <em>Destiny 2: Shadow and Order</em>, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed,” it read. “This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed. </p> <p>This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed. This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. We…</p> <p>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/2024242522004836464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Bungie continued, “This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more. Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April).”</p>

 <p>This will be Greek to most folks, including any lapsed <em>Destiny 2</em> fans that have been out of the loop for the last year, but it essentially suggests the studio is trying to overhaul some of the main loot chase complaints players have had since the current Year of Prophecy launched last July. We don’t get a clear idea of how that progression will be fixed, however, or a sense that Bungie itself knows yet.</p>

 <p>The normal thing for Bungie to do right now would be a developer diary that lays out the team’s evolving design philosophy and explains what the next three months will be spent fixing. Instead, the announcement reads like a grudging, last-minute “the dog ate my homework” acknowledgement following weeks of fans begging for an update. Bungie actually deleted a weekly reset post recently because so many fans were dunking on it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cannot apologize enough for the delay here. Team's still jamming. Hope to have some comms out soon.</p> <p>Please continue to yell at me directly, and I say this without any sarcasm.</p> <p>They're focused on our immediate and long term future.</p> <p>I am happy to take 100% of the blame here in…</p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1985744704886227117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Some have wondered if Bungie is essentially trying to shift the spotlight from <em>Destiny 2</em>, its troubled but already long-established multiplayer hit, to the upcoming launch of <em>Marathon</em>, its first new shooter in over a decade. This way, the bad vibes surrounding the former don’t start contaminating the glowing potential of the latter. Maybe Bungie even hopes more <em>Destiny 2</em> players will give <em>Marathon</em> a shot now that they have nothing new to play for the next three months.</p>

 <p>Maybe, possibly, who knows? Either way, that only buys<em> Destiny 2</em> a little more time before it has to come out and impress players with&nbsp;<em>something</em>. June would normally be the time frame for fans to get excited for the next annual expansion rather than dreading a potential “too little, too late” approach to last year’s leftovers. The fact that the game’s current existential crisis has some players once again wishing for <em>Destiny 3</em> while others go back and re-grind through <em>Destiny 1</em>&nbsp;tells you how cooked things are right now.</p> <p>It doesn’t feel like there’s enough gas left in the tank to reignite the engine, and Bungie not coming out and confidently saying there is only adds to the doomerism.</p>
