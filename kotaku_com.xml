            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The question on every video game investor and analyst’s lips during the recent Nintendo earnings Q&amp;A was whether the Mario maker will have to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326">raise the price of the Switch 2</a> due to spiking memory prices amid <a href="https://kotaku.com/dell-ces-ai-hardware-llm-gpu-2000657729">AI-fueled shortages</a>. RAM is through the roof and graphics cards are getting delayed, but Nintendo is keeping a cool head through the market turmoil.</p> <p>“We are working to secure stable supplies of memory components by holding discussions from a long-term perspective with our business partners,” president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">said this week</a>. “As a result, the recent rise in memory prices did not have a significant impact on hardware profitability in the third quarter. In addition, we do not expect any significant impact in the fourth quarter.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “However, if this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability. If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond.” As a result, Nintendo confirmed that no decision on raising the price of the $450 Switch 2 has been made yet, but if and when that time comes, it will decide based on things like the “platform’s installed base, sales trends, and the market environment.”</p> <p>Not satisfied with that ambiguity and uncertainty, Q&amp;A members kept grilling Furukawa for more specifics. The company admitted that the recent spike in component prices “exceeds our expectations” but said that it’s been stockpiling inventory and arranging long-term deals to absorb the shocks. Even if prices continue to rise into the summer, Nintendo can put off any painful pricing changes for a bit longer. But not indefinitely.</p>

 <h2>Selling Switch 2 at a profit vs. growing the install base</h2> <p>If push comes to shove, will Nintendo maximize profitability or growing the hardware’s install base? “It is difficult to predict the changes in the external environment that are currently taking place, but I think it is not an appropriate approach to be excessively influenced by short-term trends,” Furukawa said. “The second and third years for Nintendo Switch 2 are very important, and if we can expand the hardware installed base, we can use that as a basis to greatly expand software sales.”</p>

 <p>It certainly sounds like Nintendo is going to do everything in its power to avoid making the Switch 2&nbsp;$500 by this time next year. At the same time, if sales momentum picks up even more after the announcement of a new 3D <em>Mario</em>, <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, or the long-awaited Gen 10 <em>Pokémon</em> games, well, maybe it’ll be in a position to do whatever it wants. Nintendo isn’t rushing to embrace one strategy or another just yet.</p> <p>Who knows what will happen to t<a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">he AI bubble</a> in 12 months, what new tariffs will hit consumers in the U.S., or if the company’s most lucrative sales market will be plunged into an unexpected recession? Predicting any of those things is as much a fool’s errand as trying to guess <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-country-dixie-free-update-switch-2-2000661812">what Nintendo’s next move is these days</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-studio-pro-matches-its-black-friday-pricing-at-51-off-now-the-cheapest-anc-headphones-from-apple-2000666197</link>
            <guid>1428130</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Solid headphones that offer a nice blend of quality sound, active noise cancellation, reliable battery life, and a comfortable fit are hard to come by. And even when you do find a pair, these options aren’t exactly the most affordable ones out there. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">Amazon just knocked a whopping 51% off the premium Beats Studio Pro over-ear headphones, which drops their price to $170, down from $350</a>. This discount applies to all color options, including black, deep brown, navy, gray, sandstone, and white – there are plenty of options to choose from. You’re saving an impressive $180 on a pair that’s going to take your listening experience to the next level, but the offer wraps up soon. We highly suggest acting fast to grab yours before the retailer decides to push the price back up (which could be any moment now).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Listening Modes, Multiple Sound Profiles</h2>
<p>This pair features upgraded UltraPlush over-ear cushions with seamless engineered leather to deliver all-day comfort. You can have these on for extended periods without a worry, which makes the pair perfect for long commutes, never-ending meetings, and gaming with friends. The multifunction on-ear controls make it easy to take calls, manage music, switch listening modes, and activate the voice assistant with a single tap on the headphones.</p>
<p>Sound delivery is incredible. Beats has redesigned Studio Pro to be the most powerful and precise over-ear headphones it’s ever made, and that shows. There’s an updated driver with a two-layer diaphragm, refined micro-venting, and 25% stronger magnets to deliver rich, crisp, and balanced sound with zero distortion. The advanced built-in sensors place the sound all around you, letting you experience that theatre-like sound that pulls you in. According to the brand, the spatial audio feature makes it feel like you’re being surrounded by 64 speakers at the same time!</p>



<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; Active Noise Cancelling and Transparency. The former monitors background noise around you, and creates a precisely-tuned filter to cancel it 48,000 times per second. The result? Distraction-free, fully immersive listening, even when you’re in a crowded area. The latter, on the other hand, lets some external sound in, and mixes it with your music. This mode is ideal for when you want to stay aware of what’s happening around, while also enjoying quality audio.</p>
<p>Beats Studio Pro can be connected to your device in multiple ways. You can enjoy wireless connectivity via Class 1 Bluetooth, use the 3.5mm analog input for wired audio sources/in-flight entertainment, or connect it via USB-C for lossless audio. While using USB-C audio, you can also choose between three distinct sound profiles; Beats signature, Entertainment, and Conversation – based on what you require.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as impressive. You’re looking at around 40 hours of listening on a single charge. And when running low, a quick 10-minute Fast Fuel charge offers an additional 4 hours of playback. In short, if you’ve been looking to enjoy better sound on the go, the Beats Studio Pro headphones are the best option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">These typically sit over $300, but you can now grab them for just $170 at Amazon</a>. Grab the pair now to avoid paying the full price later!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Larian Isn’t Involved With The Baldur’s Gate Show, Fans Are Not Happy: ‘I Genuinely Don’t Think Anyone Can Trump Our Writers’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-show-hbo-craig-mazin-larian-swen-vincke-2000666432</link>
            <guid>1428127</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last night, HBO announced what could best be described as a terroristic threat against me, specifically by revealing it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-hbo-show-craig-mazin-last-of-us-2000666189"><span>working on a </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate </span></i><span>TV show</span></a><span> that will take place after </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>and canonize the events of the choice-driven RPG, all while working with </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>showrunner Craig Mazin. The second part of the one-two punch came shortly after, when it was confirmed that Larian Studios, the team behind </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://x.com/i/status/2019563522339082576"><span>won’t be involved in the show at all</span></a><span>. The fans, and maybe even some of the folks at Larian, have been expressing disappointment about all of the above in the hours since.</span></p> <p><span>If you only passively pay attention to </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, the reason this arrangement is possible is because </span><i><span>BG </span></i><span>is a </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </span></i><span>property, and that means Larian doesn’t own the IP, Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast do. The original announcement outlines that the TV show is a collaboration between HBO and Hasbro, so Larian has essentially been excised from the production. Now that the news is out there, members of the studio have put out statements celebrating the fact that </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>reached such “heights” that it’s getting an HBO show, while others are advocating for the writers at the studio that brought these characters to life and are now being handed off to Mazin and the show’s team.</span></p>

 <p><span>Larian CEO Swen Vincke posted a lengthy statement </span><a href="https://x.com/laratlarian/status/2019646146587525143?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q"><span>on his X account</span></a><span> saying that Mazin has reached out to talk to the studio about their thoughts on the show, so it sounds like they may be able to weigh in at least partially about whatever the series is cooking up. He also says that he’s “eager to find out” which </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>endings and choices HBO picks for the series.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Crazy that a story that started out in a small hotel conference room eventually evolved into a narrative inspiring enough for it to become a HBO series. We worked incredibly hard on making </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> worthy of its legacy. Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they’ll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion. The endings of </span><i><span>BG3</span></i><span> were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures. There’s plenty of directions they could go. I’m eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He’s reached out for a chat so we’ll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts. Crossing fingers that the story we’re cooking up for </span><i><span>Divinity</span></i><span> will eventually grow to the same heights. Certainly putting in the hours.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Michael Douse, the publishing director at Larian, </span><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680?s=20"><span>responded to the announcement</span></a><span> by saying he hopes that, despite their not being involved with the show, the </span><i><span>BG3 </span></i><span>writers still get the credit they deserve, and that the characters they wrote are treated with the same respect.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I’ve spent the last 8 to 10 years of my life with the writers &amp; creators of </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> and they’re the most incredible storytellers &amp; creators in the space,” Douse wrote. “Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved &amp; the characters are represented at the same level as the game. I genuinely don’t think anyone can trump our writers. Our stories are built by fierce camaraderie and resolve. I have watched them write and write and write and through respect for audience &amp; material come up with some of the finest shit I have ever played. I hope TV allows for the same thoroughness. Don’t abandon hope, but do expect the world. That’s the job.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>fans are less hopeful, with many rejecting the concept of a non-Larian-led show that picks different endings and choices outright.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bg3 fandom reacting to the TV show announcement (but hey at least we all finally agree on something. ‘Tis rare) <a href="https://t.co/vs7AxpiFtV">pic.twitter.com/vs7AxpiFtV</a></p> <p>— Dragon connoisseur 🐉 (@LadySapphyre) <a href="https://twitter.com/LadySapphyre/status/2019594851675980117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fact both bg3 fans and bg3 haters really don’t want that show to be made LMFAOO</p> <p>— BULLRIDER (@hotelhosea) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotelhosea/status/2019623553977434468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wyll is gonna have two lines, Astarion is suddenly only used as a sex object, Lae’zel is going to be dressed in a skimpy outfit bc she’s gith, Shadowheart will mention girls being pretty and that’s the queer rep.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your TV doesn’t offer built-in streaming options and you’re looking to cut the cord, a streamer can be a smart investment. Google’s 4K TV streamer is one of the best options out there, and you can now grab it without paying the full price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/">It typically sits at $80, but you can now snap it up for $100 at the retailer, after a modest 20% drop.</a> The offer applies to both Haze and Porcelain models, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best. Just note that the offer is selling out fast (as you’d expect), so you don’t really have a lot of time left to save. Grab it before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Popular Streaming Platforms, Plus Live TV Channels</h2>
<p>This streamer sits neatly on your console and comes with a redesigned remote that makes it easy to navigate and access content. It supports voice commands, meaning you can also just speak to find shows, get answers, and control smart home devices.</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy a ton of movies and TV shows from all your services right from your home screen, plus get tailored recommendations based on your viewing habits. Popular streaming apps that come built right in include Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV, and more. Note that most of these require a subscription. If you’re looking to cut back on those, the streamer also gets you live TV, with access to over 800 free channels from Pluto TV, Tubi, and more. What’s even better is that if you find an interesting show or movie on your TV, mobile app, or Google, you can quickly add it to your watchlist and stream when you’re ready in just a few clicks. Additionally, casting content from multiple compatible Android and iOS apps on your phone, tablet, or laptop right to your streamer is possible, too.</p>



<p>Then there’s support for 4K HDR and Dolby Vision, which lets you view both the classics and latest releases in great detail with true-to-life colors. You can also connect external speakers that can support Dolby Atmos for 3D sound. The result? An immersive viewing experience that pulls you into whatever’s playing on the screen.</p>
<p>As for performance, Google has packed the streamer with a 22% faster processor and twice the memory of the previous generation. This translates into smoother navigation and faster app switching. Those with smart home devices will also appreciate how this thing doubles as a hub, making it easy to get things done around the house more conveniently. This can include managing lights, checking camera feed, adjusting temperature, etc.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to stream your favorite shows and movies better, the 4K Google TV Streamer is a top option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/">The current 20% discount makes upgrading a lot more affordable, but the offer won’t be around for long</a>. It’s best to place your orders while the discount is still live to avoid last-minute disappointments!</p>

              <p>If smart sunglasses have been sitting on your tech wish list, this might be the moment to finally make the jump. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/">Amazon is currently offering the first-generation Oakley Meta Smart Glasses at a 15% discount, bringing the price down from $449 to $382</a>. That $67 savings makes these futuristic frames far more tempting, especially for anyone hunting for a standout gadget or a gift that feels genuinely different.</p>

<h2>Tech and Style Come Together As One</h2>
<p>At first glance, the Oakley Meta Smart Glasses look like classic Oakley eyewear, but there’s a surprising amount of technology packed into the frames. Meta AI is integrated directly into the glasses, working alongside an HD ultra-wide 12MPl camera and built-in five-microphone array. Together, they let you capture photos and videos either by tapping or completely hands-free, using simple voice commands. You can also ask questions about what you’re looking at, save bits of information for later, or scan a QR code just by glancing at it.</p>
<p>Built-in open-ear speakers deliver clear sound without blocking out your surroundings. Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music connect seamlessly, so playlists and podcasts are always within reach. Calls sound natural on both ends. A quick double-tap on the frame lets you switch between your phone’s front camera and the camera in the glasses, giving callers a live view of your perspective. Voice commands also handle calls, texts, and voice messages across apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, keeping your phone in your pocket.</p>



<p>One of the more impressive additions is real-time language translation. Conversations across languages happen naturally, even if you only speak your native tongue. Support currently includes English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese, with more languages planned. All of this works locally, so Wi-Fi isn’t required to keep the feature running.</p>
<p>Battery life holds up well for daily wear. The glasses last up to eight hours on a single charge, while the included charging case extends total usage to 48 hours. Pairing them with a smartphone unlocks the Meta View app, where photos, videos, voice controls, and system settings are easily managed.</p>
<p>Style hasn’t been overlooked either. Multiple frame colors and lens options, including clear and tinted varieties, help these glasses fit a range of looks. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/">With the current Amazon discount dropping the price to $382, the Oakley Meta black frame smart glasses with polarized lenses feel far more accessible.</a> They even might just make for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift for someone who loves both fashion and tech.</p>
