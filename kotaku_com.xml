              <p>Apple AirPods 4 are wireless earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation in a compact form that is convenient to carry and use throughout the day. To enhance comfort and stability, Apple redesigned the AirPods 4 earbuds with a more defined shape and a shorter stem with easy-to-use press controls for playing music and answering calls. For a quieter experience, the Active Noise Cancellation feature helps reduce external sounds as they reach your ears. If you prefer to stay aware of your surroundings, Transparency Mode lets you listen to what is happening around you while continuing to listen to your music.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">You can purchase the Apple AirPods 4 at Amazon for $119. This is a savings of $60 and 34% off of their original price of $179.</a></p>

<h2>Some of Apple’s best earbuds for calls, music, podcasts, and more</h2>
<p>AirPods 4 have an optical in-ear sensor that ensures they play audio only when the earbuds are worn and pause when they are removed. They feature a vent system designed for pressure-balanced sound, which can make extended listening feel much more comfortable. Plus, there are physical controls that let you perform common actions, such as controlling music playback and managing calls, without having to access your phone.</p>
<p>With Active Noise Cancellation, the Adaptive Audio feature combines noise cancellation with Transparency Mode to adapt to your surroundings. Conversation Awareness can automatically lower the volume of what you are listening to when you begin talking with someone nearby, and then raise it back up after you stop speaking. Voice Isolation uses computational audio to minimize ambient noise and improve clarity in noisy environments.</p>



<p>For music, TV programs, movies, and video games, Personalized Spatial Audio features dynamic head tracking to place sound around you. The high-excursion driver, high-dynamic-range amplifier, and Adaptive EQ work together to deliver a consistent, balanced sound that adapts to how well each AirPod fits your ears. The H2 headphone chip supports the processing required for spatial effects and noise reduction.</p>
<p>The USB-C charging case provides additional battery life, extending how long you can listen. With Active Noise Cancellation, you can expect up to 4 hours of listening time and up to 20 hours with the charging case. Five minutes of charging can provide approximately one hour of listening time.</p>
<p>Hands-free Siri can be activated with either “Siri” or “Hey Siri.” Also, with Siri Interactions, you can respond with a nod yes or a gentle shake no. Audio Sharing lets you share audio with two AirPods. Find My lets you locate your AirPods 4 and the charging case<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">. The AirPods 4 and the charging case are both rated IP54 for dust, sweat, and water resistance. Now’s a great time to buy the AirPods 4, as they’re currently $119, down from $179.</a></p>

              <p>Workstation upgrades aren’t cheap. If your desk is in need of a refresh, but you don’t want to shell out big bucks, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/">Right now, the 24-inch Lenovo all-in-one desktop computer is down to just $400 at Amazon, after a whopping $199 discount</a>. This bundle comes with everything you need to get started right away, including a pre-installed copy of Windows 11 Home, a wired keyboard, and a wired mouse. However, as you’d expect, the offer is only available for a short time. It’s best to snap it up sooner rather than later, if you want to avoid paying the full $599 price.</p>

<h2>Ideal for Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a stunning 23.8-inch, spacious Full HD display that pushes 1920 x 1080 resolution. You’ll enjoy crisp, vibrant picture quality for all types of content, whether you’re streaming your favorite show or creating an important work presentation. Plus, the anti-glare coating keeps the screen easy on the eyes, which is great for long work sessions or never-ending meetings. Speaking of video calls, you’ll find a high-quality 720p HD camera right above the screen. This camera is paired with Mono microphones that isolate your voice from the background noise and deliver it clearly on the other end.</p>
<p>Performance is impressive for day-to-day use. The system runs on a modest Intel N100 processor that features four cores and four threads with a max Turbo frequency of 3.40 GHz. It’s not a powerhouse, but it’s still perfectly capable of supporting your everyday needs – like office work, streaming, browsing, checking emails, handling light creative projects – without slowing down. There’s an 8GB DDR4 RAM to keep things running smoothly as you work and play. Again, it’s not massive, so you won’t exactly be able to multitask comfortably. But as long as you’re not trying to work on a bunch of resource-heavy tasks at once, you will enjoy minimal lag and decent performance.</p>



<p>Storage is taken care of by a roomy 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, which is plenty for important work files, media content, research documents, and even some games. Note that the system is not expandable, so you won’t be able to increase the capacity as your needs grow, but you can always add external storage solutions to manage space better.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include Intel Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. On the wired side, you’re covered with an array of ports, including two USB-A (Hi-Speed USB / USB 2.0), two USB-A (USB 10Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 2), one HDMI-out 1.4b, one Ethernet (RJ-45), and one headphone or microphone combo jack (3.5mm) – that’s all you need to create a fuller, more productive setup. Getting the wired keyboard and wired mouse in the bundle means you’ve already got all you need to get started with work and entertainment right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/">The bundle now costs $400, after Amazon took 33% off its usual price.</a> Just note that we’re not expecting the offer to last long. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation without spending a ton, now is your chance to pick a solid, highly-rated option for less. Delivery is free, too, so $400 is all you’ve got to pay today.</p>
