            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-black-tiktok-theory-1851687912<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fox’s popular animated series “The Simpsons” has been on the air for 36 seasons, which means viewers have plenty of time to analyze and examine the show. Longtime fans have theories on everything from Springfield existing in its own space-time bubble, to Marge’s family financially supporting them, to the idea that they’re actually all geniuses. One particular theory that’s become popular on TikTok is that the family is Black.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197298,197284" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Technically, producers have never confirmed a specific race for the Simpsons, but most viewers assume they’re meant to be white. However, Black fans have been watching closely over the years and have been picking up on some interesting cultural traits.</p><p>TikTok user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cocoabutterofficial/video/7262069050564529450?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cocoabutterofficial/video/7262069050564529450?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cocoabutterofficial</a></span>, pointed out that Marge has an afro, which is why she and the kids have textured hair that grows upward. The clip also notes that Marge’s sisters, Patty and Sema, are “two cigarette smoking Black aunties” who have no time for the way Homer treats their younger sister.</p><p>We’ve also got theories about Marge’s hair, as we’ve seen her change it up in flashbacks and special episodes, much the way Black women like to do. Plus, the way Marge holds her chaotic family down gives Black mom energy. </p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@iamthekayelle/video/7205686816358288682?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamthekayelle/video/7205686816358288682?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iamthekayelle</a></span> also has ideas about Marge’s hair, reminding everyone that she wears bonnets to bed. But the real proof is found in a scene where she cuts the kids’ hair and saves it in the freezer. They think this could point to her creole origins.</p><p>In the post’s comments, someone brought up Marge’s family as proof, replying, “her sisters? her Mom, yeah they black.” While another pointed to her original last name, Bouvier, writing, “She creole fa sho w that French maiden name.”</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious example of them all comes in the Season 21 episode “The Color Yellow.” While working on a school project, Lisa discovers that her ancestor Eliza tried to help Virgil, a runaway slave, escape North. When the child fails, her mother Mabel is the one who gets him to Canada, where they married and start a family. These are the Simpsons they’re actually descended from. So apparently, it’s already canon that they have a Black ancestor.</p><p>Here’s the thing, we’re talking about cartoon characters in a fantastical setting where ridiculous things are constantly happening. Honestly, the Simpsons can be whatever you need them to be. So, if you need Homer to secretly be rich, or for it to all be a dream taking place in his head, or for the whole series to be one giant time loop, that’s fine. The important thing to remember is that my version of Springfield and its residents doesn’t diminish yours, so there’s no need for more intense fans to go on the attack just because we’re having fun exploring a cool, interesting fan theory.</p><p>If this has put you in the mood for a rewatch, you can relive the series’ entire run on Disney+.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Tuesday, November 1.</em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
