              <p>The Anker Prime Power Bank is a 26,250 mAh portable power bank with three ports, a compact Phantom Gray housing, and compatibility with laptops, tablets, and phones. The Anker Prime Power Bank allows you to charge up to 300W through two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so a notebook, phone, and additional items, such as headphones or earbuds, can charge at the same time without taking turns. It’s small enough to fit into backpacks and carry-on luggage and has a TSA-approved battery size, so you can generally fly with it. There is also a smart display screen on the front of the unit that shows charging information.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/">You can find the Anker Prime Power Bank on Amazon today for $171, down from its original $230, which represents a savings of $59 and 26% off the original retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hefty power bank with plenty of charging power</h2>
<p><span>The charging configuration on the Anker Prime Power Bank is optimized for rapid charging of larger items while supporting smaller items. One USB-C port delivers up to 140W with a compatible 5A cable for rapid laptop recharging, and the other two USB-C and USB-A ports recharge your phone, earbuds, or other accessories simultaneously. With a maximum of 300W, you can use the bank as a central charging station rather than just to recharge your phone.</span></p>
<p>The Anker Prime Power Bank was also optimized to charge quickly, allowing the unit to spend more time available for use rather than idling due to discharge. The dual USB-C ports will accept up to 250W of combined input and allow the bank to recharge to approximately 50% in around 13 minutes and fully recharge in approximately 1 hour if you have the correct chargers.</p>



<p>In addition to displaying how much capacity remains in the bank and the current amount of power it is supplying, a smart display will show the status of each device currently charging via a simple visual display, eliminating the need to guess whether a device is charging. When paired with Anker’s app, you can view charging activity in even greater detail and adjust your usage preferences for how you want power used.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the overall design allows users to place the Anker Prime Power Bank wherever they want to recharge their devices, including desks, bags, hotel nightstands, and many other locations. The bank’s compact frame is light enough for daily carrying but feels sturdy and substantial when placed next to a laptop with several cables plugged into it. In the box, you will receive the Anker Prime Power Bank, a 3.3-foot-long 240W USB-C to USB-C cable, a travel pouch, a welcome guide, and a 24-month limited hardware warranty. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/">With the entire package bundled at $171 instead of the usual $230, the Anker Prime Power Bank is an affordable source of portable power in one small unit.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Really Doesn’t Want You To See Its Canceled Prince Of Persia Remake]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-art-leak-canceled-remake-2000663501</link>
            <guid>1417468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been less than a week since Ubisoft announced it was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>cancelling several projects</span></a><span>, including the long-awaited </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake. That project had apparently been struggling since its 2020 announcement, having essentially started over from scratch </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ubisoft-1850470554"><span>back in 2023</span></a><span>. But while the remake itself may never see the light of day, some concept art and screenshots from the game’s 2024 pre-alpha version have started circulating online. Ubisoft, however, is doing its best to get them taken down before anyone can see what might have been.</span></p> <p><span>The art and images are from a 2024 workshop presentation, and though they don’t show the game in motion, there’s enough here to get a sense of what the team at Ubisoft was working toward before the project was canceled. The presentation was posted to YouTube, then subsequently copyright-struck by Ubisoft. Fans still managed to grab the images, though, and have been sharing them across social media.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake – the full workshop presentation 2024 was leaked on YouTube yesterday!</p> <p>I’ve put together some of what was shown during the conference — everything looks absolutely beautiful!😩😍 </p> <p>(Pre-Alpha, Early 2024)<br>Soundtrack is from the remake! <a href="https://t.co/3BDRlFlgHJ">pic.twitter.com/3BDRlFlgHJ</a></p> <p>— Prince of Persia Universe (@princeozzyX) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>From the sound of it, the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake was even further along by the time it was canceled earlier this month, as Eman Ayaz, an actor who has hinted she was playing a role in the game, had shot a marketing promo for the game just two months prior.</span></p> <p><span>“I pushed myself past old limits and discovered things I didn’t even know existed inside of me through the lives that I lived in this character,” Ayaz </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0hv4QFIak"><span>says in a YouTube video</span></a><span>. “It was something that’s completely out of the range of any character that I’ve been cast in in the past. And I got to do things I’ve never gotten to do before. And it brought out what I honestly believe is the best performance of my career. And now nobody is ever going to see that. I can’t stress enough how much I had kind of planned my life around the release of this project.”</span></p>

  <p><span>While the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake is probably the most high-profile cancellation at Ubisoft this month, the company shelved five other games and delayed seven more as part of a larger restructuring. Don’t worry though,</span><i><span> Beyond Good and Evil 2 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><span>is still coming</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-adds-the-looney-tunes-sweetheart-tweety-bird-to-its-valentines-day-deal-at-a-record-low-2000663257</link>
            <guid>1417420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure is a 412-piece kit that lets you turn the iconic yellow canary into a heart-inspired display you can pose and change up. Once you have completed the figure and used the posable head, wings, tail, and feet, you can choose to either position Tweety on the pedestal, cloud, as a matchmaker, or by removing Tweety from the base, placing the bouquet under his arm, and attaching the heart above his head so he appears to be providing a gift.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/">You can go to Amazon and purchase the LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure for $24, which is $11 cheaper than the original retail price of $35, and a 31% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A LEGO project featuring the Looney Tunes’ most iconic bird</h2>
<p>This Valentine-themed build of Tweety offers a couple of obvious options to style the figure so it continues to interest you after you finish the build. First, you can put Tweety on the pedestal cloud, place the bow and arrow within his wings, and create a fun playfulness by posing Tweety as Cupid to fit in with Valentine’s Day on a nightstand or desk. Second, when you want to tone things down a bit, you can take Tweety off the pedestal, give him the bouquet, and place the heart on top of his head so he looks like the giver.</p>
<p>The use of posable joints allows the LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure to appear more lively than a fixed decoration that never changes position. Additionally, since the model is made from LEGO elements, you can move some pieces around if you would like to slightly change how he looks or stands, without using a specialized tool or additional components.</p>



<p>The design features and functionality of this set also enable it to serve a dual purpose as a decorative item rather than simply a one-time build that you throw in storage. The pedestal is compact, so the space required for this item will be small enough to fit on a dresser corner, a bookshelf, or an office shelf.</p>
<p>The step-by-step instructions for building the model are intended to create a fun, satisfying experience as each part goes into place. The directions start by showing you how to form the body and head of Tweety, and then proceed to the pedestal and accessories so that you see the character develop in stages. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/">Once the figure is placed on display, you have a charming Looney Tunes figure that you can re-position as many times as you desire, and given the fact that the item is available for $24 on sale, down from the normal $35</a>, it makes for a simple and affordable little project that’s worth building.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Not even the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> community is safe from AI ensloppification.</span></p> <p><span>With the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252"><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update</span></a><span> only a few weeks old, players have been hard at work sprucing up their islands and posting pictures of all their hard decorating work. But some have been using generative AI to “enhance” their photos or fabricate them altogether, and fans are getting pissed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sharing stylistic edits of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> screenshots online is a foundational pillar of the game’s community. Photos are typically edited to enhance the game’s lighting and shadows, or put through filters to achieve a certain vibe. Photos with the best vibes are rewarded with likes, upvotes, or whatever the clout currency is for a particular social media website. However, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-ai-slop-aesthetic/"><i><span>Polygon </span></i><span>reports</span></a><span> that on X and elsewhere, </span><i><span>AC </span></i><span>screenshots enhanced with AI have started trending, often without disclosure that genAI was used.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think it’s time we talk about the AI use in </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>aesthetic posts that are trending,” </span><a href="https://x.com/cozyberru/status/2015462841139314792?s=20"><span>wrote user Cozyberru on X</span></a><span>. In a thread, they highlight how a number of recently trending&nbsp;<em>AC</em> screenshots were likely created with genAI, pointing out the usual suspects of funky-looking numbers and warped textures on background items. But their issue isn’t so much with using the tool itself. “All I am asking is to be honest and disclose your use of AI or editing,” they wrote.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> has thousands of little knick-knacks, pieces of furniture, and more. Not sharing that an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> photo has been enhanced with AI can lead to confusion in players who might want to get their hands on something they don’t know has been wholly made up.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the thread, one commenter </span><a href="https://x.com/salFreeApps/status/2015536285998625106?s=20"><span>thanked Cozyberru for their service</span></a><span>. “I’ve been sitting here thinking, ‘is there a mod or hack or glitch going around that I don’t know?’ Because there’s no way to place that item that close to the furniture as much as I want to.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Cozyberru doesn’t explicitly share their feelings about genAI, but others shared theirs in the thread’s comments and elsewhere online. Though it’s not called out specifically in the rules, it seems the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> subreddit has a strict “No genAI policy.” In a post regarding fanart, a moderator advised community members not to report anything that wasn’t </span><span>“</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1q4powt/please_stop_reporting_art_posts_as_low_quality/"><span>blatantly NSFW or AI.</span></a><span>”</span><span>&nbsp;In another post, a user reposted a video of their island after the original was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qaz4ms/nearly_3000_hours_and_35_years_later_my_island_is/"><span>taken down for using text-to-speech AI voiceover</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
