              <p>January is often a quiet month for big video game releases. So this cold, wintry month becomes a perfect time to evaluate your ever-growing backlog of video games and start chipping away at it. That’s what many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are doing right now, and so we figured hey, let’s turn our lives into content for the website.</p> <p>Welcome to the start of <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week</a>, a way to celebrate, critically evaluate, and document those massive lists of games we all have. Those lists of games we need to get around to…one day. Games we want to play. Games we want to finish. Games we want to give a second or even third chance to in the hope that maybe this time it will stick. Looking at you, <em>Cyberpunk 2077!</em></p>

 <p>So what should you expect over the next seven days? We’ll have new blogs from us and some talented freelancers about finally playing backlog games, dealing with that dreaded list, what a backlog even is in 2026, and some remastered old posts from our <a href="https://kotaku.com/welcome-to-backlog-month-1846621879">Backlog Month in 2021</a>. And with comments back, feel free to tell us about any games you’re finally getting around to after they lingered on your backlog for weeks, months, or even years.</p>

 <p>And yes, we are starting a theme week in the <em>middle</em> of the week and not on a Monday. It will even run over the weekend. We’re rebels. And like, a week is just seven days, baby. We can start that whenever we so please. And so we are starting…now. Well, actually, we started like four paragraphs up, but whatever, welcome to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/backlog-week-2026">Backlog Week 2026</a>!</p>
