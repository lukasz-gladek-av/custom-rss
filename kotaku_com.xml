              <p>You can’t really enjoy an immersive viewing experience without great sound to match the visuals. If you’re looking to make holiday movie nights better but your current TV doesn’t have solid built-in speakers, adding a soundbar to the setup can be a smart move. And thanks to Amazon, picking one up doesn’t break the bank today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony S100F 2.0ch soundbar is currently going for just $98 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 39% off its usual price of $160</a>. Shipping is free as well, so you’re not adding anything on top of the sale price. Even better, orders placed today will arrive before Christmas, so you can have fun streaming marathons with friends and family with fuller, richer audio that fills the room. Note that it’s only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab yours before the offer expires.</p>

<h2>Surround Sound Experience</h2>
<p>The slim design blends into every entertainment setup well, matching the aesthetics of any room. You can place it on your console right below the screen, or mount it on the wall if you prefer a cleaner setup. It punches well above its weight, though. Sony has packed the soundbar with a two-speaker setup that delivers front surround sound by handling the full audio range without requiring additional subwoofers or speakers. It produces audio as a stereo mix for a wider soundstage that fills the entire room, instead of just blasting from the front.</p>
<p>The bass reflex speaker does an incredible job of delivering punchy, deep bass without compromising on the details, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. You will be able to vibe to all your favorite tunes, plus immerse yourself in thrilling scenes like never before. S-Force Pro, on the other hand, emulates cinema-style sound fields for better clarity and a 3D experience. Translation? Cars in F1 race past your couch, gunfire erupts right in your living room, and the Grinch’s footsteps feel like they’re actually coming from behind you. Whether you’re planning to watch an action-packed series or stream some good old Christmas title, it makes you feel a part of what’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>There’s a voice enhancement feature that automatically improves dialog clarity, even in those loud, chaotic scenes. It also comes in handy when you’re catching up with friends on a bigger screen; you will be able to hear everyone on the conference call clearly. Connectivity couldn’t be easier. A single HDMI ARC connection between the TV and the soundbar gets the party started. You can control both the TV and the soundbar with a single remote. Best of all, it supports Bluetooth connections just as well, which is great for when you want to pair your smartphone wirelessly with it. Maybe play some songs or a podcast in the background as you set holiday decorations up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">On a regular day, this speaker would run you around $160, but this deal lets you grab it for $98, which is quite affordable considering all the features it gets you.</a> If you’ve been after better sound, this soundbar can be an excellent addition to your setup. Snap it up quick, though, as the discount is a limited-time one. The retailer hasn’t specified an end date, but we’re not expecting it to last long. Placing your orders now will also allow you to get it before Christmas!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meta Ray-Ban (Gen 1) Gets Cleared Out for Less Than Regular Sunglasses, Even Though They’re Smart AI Glasses]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-ray-ban-gen-1-gets-cleared-out-for-less-than-regular-sunglasses-even-though-theyre-smart-ai-glasses-2000652301</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The iconic Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses have been cool all the way back to Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison in the ’50s, and now 7 decades later, they’re getting a whole new life as advanced tech wearables thanks to Meta. These retro-cool glasses are now 21st Century marvels with speakers, camera, mic, and Meta AI all discreetly built in, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">they’re also a great limited-time deal at Amazon right now for just $224.</a></p>
<p>There are 10 different models of the Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers available as part of this limited-time deal, in regular and large sizes for men and women, with a variety of frame colors and lenses ranging from clear to transitions to different shades and colors of sunglasses. They’re the top-selling AI glasses in the world, and now you can find out why for $75 less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Tech, But With Style</h2>
<p>Futuristic tech mixed with impeccable classic style is the mashup we need right now, so seeing Meta team up with Ray-Ban rather than create some bizarre-looking goggles or helmet or other such thing is a hugely welcome development. The Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers looks like the regular Wayfarers made legendary by Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise in <em>Risky Business</em>, and the Blues Brothers, but these also take seriously good 12MP photos and 1080p video, which is probably why&nbsp;<em>Popular Mechanics</em> calls them the best AI glasses for social media. To engage the camera, just touch a button on the glasses’ arm, or use a voice command.</p>
<p>(Side note: While the Wayfarers spiked again in popularity when&nbsp;<em>The Blues Brothers</em> came out in 1980, there’s an ongoing debate about whether they both wore Wayfarers, or if Dan Aykroyd’s Elwood actually wore lookalike vintage sunglasses. Either way, they’re indelibly associated with the Wayfarers.)</p>
<p>The Meta AI features are probably the most mindblowing of all. The multimodal AI can translate signs, identify objects, and even look up and give you historical information on something you’re looking at, in real time. It’s all done discreetly — you gain all of the information while to the rest of the world, you’re just a person in Wayfarers. Real-time audio translations from 6 languages and counting are built in, with no Wi-Fi connection necessary.</p>



<h2>Outstanding Audio</h2>
<p>Even without any actual in-ear extension, the custom-built open-ear speakers sound amazing during calls or if you’re listening to music or a podcast. You get immersive sound that doesn’t intrude on the people standing near you, and you can call and text hands-free. The incredible amount of interactivity provided by the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers make them a content creator’s dream, a multitasker’s must-have, and they just look&nbsp;<em>cool</em> no matter which feature you’re using (or none.)</p>
<p>The opportunity to look like James Dean but have hidden tech worthy of James Bond is worth a heck of lot more than just $224, but that’s the Amazon price tag on the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers during this limited-time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">Save 25% and grab one of the best and coolest tech wearables available anywhere.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>Laptop upgrades can cost a pretty penny, depending on the features you’re after. If you’re a work professional or a student looking to upgrade their everyday machine, you need a model with a good display, a comfortable keyboard, a muscular processor, plus at least 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Most options offering these and more – especially the ones from known brands – sit well over $1,200, but that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6344/">We just spotted the 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop going for just $1,000 at Amazon, after the retailer generously took a whopping 67% off its usual $3,000 tag.</a> Orders placed within a couple of days arrive before Christmas, so you can also consider it as a gift for a loved one. Best of all, the retailer throws in a bunch of useful computer accessories worth almost $200 with your purchase – for absolutely nothing. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter to score the discount or the freebies. Just add the item to your cart, and the offers apply automatically. You’ll also save an additional 5% at checkout, which ultimately brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, discounts this good don’t stick around for long. It’s best to hurry to grab yours, as the price could shoot back up any moment now.</p>

<h2>Incredible Work and Play Performance</h2>
<p>The roomy 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) display offers plenty of space to work and play without feeling limited. It not only pushes vibrant, detailed visuals, but also features an anti-glare coating that makes the overall viewing experience quite comfortable on the eyes. Whether you’re using it out there in the sun or while sitting in a dimly lit room, picture quality stays consistent and balanced. Touch support makes navigation easy. You won’t have to rely on the keypad or the mouse to find your way around things; just use your fingers directly on the screen to pinch, tap, scroll, draw, and even type. Paired with the screen is a spacious, full-sized backlit keyboard. It makes typing long documents easy on the wrists, while the backlight lets you hit goals even after the shadows fall.</p>



<p>The laptop runs on the AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.3GHz. It’s powerful enough to support you through all your tasks, from those early-morning deadlines to late-night passion projects. There’s a massive 32GB RAM to keep everything (video calls, resource-intensive applications, games) running smoothly; something that makes a huge difference during busy days when you need to handle a bunch of tasks at the same time. The 1TB SSD lets you store all your important files in a single place. You can throw in a ton of videos, high-resolution photos, work documents, research files, and more with ease. Even better, the memory and storage are expandable up to <strong>64GB RAM and 2TB SSD</strong>, respectively, so you can always add more as your needs grow in the future.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as solid. A single charge gets you up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging it in. Recharging doesn’t take forever either, thanks to HP Fast Charge that juices the laptop from 0 to 50% in just about 45 minutes. Plug it in during a quick lunch break at work, and come back to a machine ready to help you power through the rest of your day.</p>
<p>The accessory kit includes a Redragon mouse, an external CD/DVD drive, and a clean cloth. <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> also comes pre-installed, so you’re literally getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-6-in-1-steam-deck-dock-falls-to-record-low-works-with-rog-ally-x-legion-go-macbook-and-more-2000652271</link>
            <guid>1379524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just a few years ago, Valve introduced us to a brand new way to play PC games with the advent of the Steam Deck. Sure, they just copy-pasted the Nintendo Switch, but the key difference here is you can play your Steam games on it. This kicked off a wholly new class of product with the PC gaming handheld. Taking your PC games with you on the go is something we’d only been dreaming of a decade ago. That kind of versatility is great for gamers. If you are a proud owner of Steam Deck, you can make it even more versatile with a Steam Deck dock. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">This one from UGREEN offers a lot of flexibility are is right now discounted down by 35%. Normally the dock goes for $46, so this ends up shaving off $16</a>. You only need to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Playing handheld with the Steam Deck is great. I mean, of course it is. That’s the thing it’s designed to do. However, maybe you don’t always want to play on just the 7.4-inch screen. Maybe you want to hook it up to your 65-inch screen in your living room. The Nintendo Switch can do that. So what about the Steam Deck?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Extensive Connectivity for Gaming</h2>
<p>Well, the UGREEN docking station will allow you to connect your Steam Deck to an external display like a monitor or smart TV and be able to play in 4K at up to 120Hz. That kind of visual fidelity isn’t possible when playing handheld. Even with the best model, you’re only getting a 1280 by 800 resolution in up to 90Hz.</p>
<p>This docking station powers your Steam Deck while its sitting in place over USB-C. It utilizes 100W PD charging to provide fast power to your gaming handheld. That makes this dock not just great for playing your games on the big screen, but just being your Steam Deck’s home when you’re finished playing. This way each time you reach for it, you know it will be at full charge.</p>
<p>The dock also has two USB-A ports, great for connecting a wired controller. You can, of course, always choose to use a wireless controller instead over Bluetooth. It connects to a display over HDMI. It also has a built-in Ethernet port so you can maintain a fast connection when playing online multiplayer or just hoping to download a big game super fast. The port is capable of up to 1,000Mbps.</p>



<p>The UGREEN docking station stands apart from other third-party docks on the market because of its overall design.</p>
<p>It can fold up for easy storage. This also makes it practical to take it with you while traveling. Game handheld while on the plane and then go full screen with the TV when you reach your Airbnb.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the viewing angle of your Steam Deck. This is great for using the Steam Deck as a stand and playing off that like a Nintendo Switch in Tabletop Mode.</p>
<p>Under the docking station are a series of non-slip silicone. This adds stability so the dock won’t slide around inside or on top of your media center. It’ll stay firmly in place while you game.</p>
