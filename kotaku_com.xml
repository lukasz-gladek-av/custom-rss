              <p>It feels like a long time ago that Saber Interactive and Universal announced<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/jurassic-park-survival--2"> Jurassic Park: Survival</a>.</em> And that’s because yeah, it’s been nearly two years! Since then, we’ve not gotten much else about the game, but earlier today, we finally got some fresh looks at <em>Survival </em>in action.</p> <p><em>Jurassic Park: Survival</em> is an upcoming first-person action-horror game set one day after the events of the original<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876"><em> Jurassic Park</em> film</a>. You play as a new character, Dr. Maya Joshi, who is left on the island after everyone else escapes. Now she has to survive (oh, I get the name of the game now) while trying to figure out a way off dino island, aka Isla Nublar. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053">The game was announced 19 months ago, all the way back in December 2023</a>, and since then, we’ve not seen much about it. That changed on Thursday with a new behind-the-scenes featurette from Universal and developers Saber Interactive.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Behind-The-Scenes Featurette" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLuxDHCY6kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>On August 14, the official <em>Jurassic World/Jurassic Park</em> YouTube account posted <a href="https://youtu.be/lLuxDHCY6kw">a nearly six-minute-long video</a> featuring interviews with various developers and others working on <em>Survival.</em> And sprinkled throughout this video, which is mostly focused on all the movie-accurate details in <em>Survival</em>‘s environments,&nbsp;how it connects to the film, and the new main character–are some new looks at how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dinosaur-games-dino-crisis-jurassic-park-horror-pc-ps5-1851771664">franchise’s iconic dinosaurs</a> will appear in the game.</p>

 <p>Look at that T. rex! I love it! And we get some more glimpses of how Velociraptors and the extremely tall Brachiosaurus look in<em> Jurassic Park: Survival,</em> too. As a massive <em>Jurassic Park</em> fan, all of this has me really excited to play the game. Sadly, we still don’t have a release date for <em>Survival</em>. And I’m not feeling good about it arriving this year. In a press release shared with <em>Kotaku</em> announcing this new video, Saber Interactive explained that “<em>J</em><i>urassic Park: Survival</i><i>&nbsp;</i>won’t be present at this year’s Gamescom.” Maybe it still shows up at Geoff Kielghley’s annual Opening Night Live ceremony later this month, but I’m not holding my breath about that.</p> <p>If you want to kill some time while waiting, you can always watch the original announcement trailer from 2023. It’s pretty cool.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UinsNBOTNyU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>Birdo is one of the primary unlockable characters in<i> Mario Kart World</i>. Being a relative mainstay in the <i>Super Mario</i> spinoffs since the Gamecube era, it’s a little surprising that she doesn’t show up in the game’s roster from the start. With icons like Donkey Kong and Daisy being unlocks too, though, I suppose it isn’t much of a surprise.</p> <p>On the bright side, uncovering her doesn’t take much effort: just four short races and she’ll be in your crew! Here’s what you need to know to get this unusual creature.</p> <h2><span id="the-best-karts-for-birdo"></span>The best karts for Birdo<span></span></h2> <p>As with many other characters, Reel Racer is hard to turn down as the best match for Birdo. That said, you may want to try your hand at the Biddybuggy given its improved acceleration and handling over the Reel Racer.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-birdo"></span>How to Unlock Birdo<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617863" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617863"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617863">© © Screenshot: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If you want to unlock Birdo, you just need to complete the Banana Cup! Unfortunately, if you don’t want to unlock Birdo, she will still unlock after you complete the Banana Cup. Placement doesn’t matter. Whether you win every race or never get higher than 24th, Birdo will still join your crew when the Grand Prix is concluded.</p>

 <p>Birdo is a middleweight character, like her counterpart Yoshi. That means that she is a very well-rounded character, not excelling at anything in particular, but not lacking in anything either.</p> <h2><span id="all-outfits-for-birdo-in-mario-kart-world"></span>All Outfits for Birdo in <i>Mario Kart World</i><span></span></h2> <p>In total, Birdo has two outfits to select from at launch. If you’re mad at that fact, just know that you can’t be nearly as mad as I am that Donkey Kong got a quite short end of the stick with only one outfit. Anyways, here’s a list of foods to unlock those outfits:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Pro racer: pancakes, donut, cake, burger, fruit salad, curry, ice cream</li> <li aria-level="1">Vacation: takoyaki, sushi, pizza, kebab, naan, fish and chips, popcorn</li> </ul> <p>Explore the open world in free roam, or travel the Mushroom Kingdom in modes like Knockout Tour to get access to a lot of different foods and increase your chances of finding what you need to unlock these costumes. Before long, you’ll find what you’re looking for and get these costumes for Birdo’s wardrobe!</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>One of the greatest racers in the Galaxy, Rosalina, has made her triumphant return to <i>Mario Kart </i>in <i>Mario Kart World</i>. However, she actually isn’t available to choose at the start. You’ll have to do a little bit of searching to find her.</p> <p>Luckily, it won’t take much. Here’s what you need to do to add Rosalina to your crew of playable drivers and which kart will see her speeding ahead of the rest.</p> <h2><span id="the-best-kart-for-rosalina"></span>The best kart for Rosalina<span></span></h2> <p>Luckily, your options for getting the most out of Rosalina are pretty simple: The Reel Racer offers excellent speed to keep you at the front of the pack. The Baby Blooper isn’t a bad second choice if the poorer handling of the Reel Racer doesn’t work for you.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-rosalina-in-mario-kart-world"></span>How to Unlock Rosalina in <em>Mario Kart World</em><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617859"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617859">© Screenshot: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Rosalina is unlocked after you complete the Star Cup of the Grand Prix mode, a fitting place to find the de facto queen of the cosmos. It doesn’t matter how well you do in the races; whether you walk out with a gold trophy or participation ribbon, finishing the four tracks in the Star Cup is enough to add Rosalina to your playable roster of characters.</p>

 <p>Rosalina is a heavyweight character, meaning that she can knock other racers around easier and has a higher top speed. As a tradeoff, she has worse acceleration and handling.</p> <h2><span id="all-unlockable-rosalina-costumes"></span>All Unlockable Rosalina Costumes<span></span></h2> <p>Rosalina has four unlockable costumes to find: touring, aero, aurora, pro racer. Each of these costumes can be found by eating a few different foods. Here’s a list of some of those foods and the outfits that they can unlock:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Touring: Burger, Fish and chips, pancakes, milk, chicken, kebab, pizza</li> <li aria-level="1">Aero: Donuts, curry</li> <li aria-level="1">Aurora: Ice cream, bread, popcorn</li> <li aria-level="1">Pro Racer: cake, fruit salad</li> </ul> <p>Explore the open world in free roam or during your races to find as many foods as possible to dig up each costume! Remember, once you find a costume, it will permanently be unlocked for you to choose on the character select screen to choose from the beginning of any race in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Over the last month, players from various countries have been reporting issues with trying to use PayPal on Steam. The popular online wallet for PC gaming’s most popular storefront seemed to go into permanent maintenance mode. Now, Valve has confirmed exactly what happened: <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">a recent censorship crackdown</a> led to the loss of global PayPal payment processing in all but six currencies.</p> <p>“In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam,” reads a new section of Steam’s purchasing issues FAQ first reported <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">by <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>. “This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies <i>other than</i> EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD. We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this.”</p> <p>There was no immediate explanation for <em>why</em> PayPal’s payment processing had changed, even as PC players across major countries like Norway and Mexico found themselves unable to purchase games. “Just when <em>Satisfactory</em> is finally on sale,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m15oki/why/">complained</a> on Reddit on July 16.</p> <p>But Valve has now confirmed that the changes were directly related to the ongoing censorship campaign against adult content on Steam and other PC gaming storefronts. The loss of payment processing support by one of PayPal’s banking partners “is regarding content on Steam, related to&nbsp;what we’ve previously commented on surrounding Mastercard,” a spokesperson for the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">told <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>. “In this case, one of PayPal’s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies.”</p> <p>While that campaign, initiated by an Australian anti-porn group called Collective Shout, was in response to a small slice of games that included content related to sexual abuse and incest, it’s now led to some players in certain countries being unable to buy&nbsp;<em>anything</em> from Steam.</p> <p>“Been noticing this for quite a bit now, it started off as Paypal being ‘temporarily unavailable at this time’ here in the Philippines when I was trying to purchase games a few weeks ago,” wrote another Steam user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mjto06/paypal_no_longer_available_in_the_philippines/">last week</a>. “Today, I wanted to pick up <em>Cyberpunk</em> on sale and then I get hit with [PayPal is currently unavailable in your country]. Seriously? Does anyone know when will this payment method be available again?”</p> <p>Steam’s FAQ suggest it’s hoping to get PayPal support for these countries back in the coming months, as well as exploring alternative payment systems. In the meantime, anti-censorship advocates are continuing to flood call centers <a href="https://aftermath.site/stripe-lgbtq-steam-itch-adult-games-delisted">of companies like Stripe</a> trying to reverse the pressure on storefronts like Steam and itch.io.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Folks have been modding lightsabers and <i>Star Wars</i> characters into Bethesda’s various open-world games for as long as modders have been poking around in the code of the developer’s Creation Engine. But it wasn’t until <i>Starfield</i> came along that we had a Bethesda game whose setting was naturally conducive to an ultimate <i>Star Wars</i> fantasy. <i>Starfield</i>’s 1000-plus star systems, its gorgeously rendered planets and customizable ships, have begged for modders to transform this vast digital space into a simulation of that beloved galaxy, far, far away. Since its launch in 2023, <i>Starfield</i> has received numerous mods, many of which are <i>Star Wars</i>-themed. But one project, <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/"><i>Star Wars Genesis</i></a>, aims to assemble the best that modders have put together.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="An Expanding Star Wars Galaxy — Cinematic Showcase and Release of Star Wars Genesis V8" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OC7wvzsH6Kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I recently went through the laborious install process (made even harder if you don’t own a Nexusmods Premium account) and had a chance to chat with the project lead, DeityVengy, about what inspired the project, what it’s been like putting it all together, and what the future holds for <i>Genesis.&nbsp;</i></p> <p>First, let’s back up a bit. <i>Star Wars Genesis</i> isn’t a mod itself, but rather a collection of mods all assembled with a handy installer known as wabbajack. The process of <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/install/">installing</a> will require a Jedi Master’s level of meditative patience. It’s extensive. Needing to click through so many mods, dealing with a few that failed on install the first time (wrestling with my damn storage drives that are always virtually at capacity didn’t help), and then finally running the game with this gargantuan list took me some time. So be prepared for a lengthy and fairly involved process–and know you still may run into some issues while installing or even when you try to run it.</p>

 <p>By some miracle of the Force, I, a woman who notoriously screws up mod installs, had <i>Star Wars Genesis</i> up and running on first boot and…<i>Wow</i>. Despite some framerate issues (I’m only running a 3070ti for a mod that recommends a darn 4090), it is impressive how readily <i>Starfield</i> can be transformed into a <i>Star Wars</i> sim. Some existing planets and cities are lightly transformed from their original state. Mars, for example, and its mining city from the base game serve as Geonosis now. Tatooine, which looks like it uses one of <i>Starfield</i>’s many desert worlds, is now home to a recreation of Mos Eisley–and walking around this dreaded hive of scum and villainy feels uncanny. But it’s not only textures, buildings, and new NPC models that fill the space. There’s a dedicated questline that does an impressive job of repurposing and tweaking the base game’s main quest, Constellation, with modified voicelines that swaps the UC Vanguard for the Empire and the Freestar Rangers for the Rebel Alliance.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617838" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617838"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617838">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Genesis</i> takes place in an alternate take on what happens roughly 10 years following the events of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. It’s a fitting spot in the timeline for DeityVengy as <i>Episode III</i> is their favorite <i>Star Wars</i> film. “I kinda grew up in the prequel era,” they told me, “and naturally I ended up liking <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>.” They credit “shows like <i>Clone Wars</i>, <i>Kenobi</i>, and <i>Ashoka</i>” with having helped rehabilitate the once-maligned prequel era. Bear in mind, though, that <i>Genesis</i> isn’t set on delivering the most lore-accurate <i>Star Wars</i> experience.</p> <p>It’s still working within the bounds of what <i>Starfield</i> has to offer, plus, as explained in <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/lore/">the project’s lore page</a>, setting this mod project in an alternate universe means the player doesn’t just need to “fight the Empire, Crime Faction 1, and Crime Faction 2” as players do in so many <i>Star Wars</i> games that try to stick more closely to the lore. “Just look at <i>Force Unleashed</i>,” DeityVengy says. “Is it canon? No. Is it better than <i>Star Wars Outlaws</i> or the <i>Jedi Survivor</i> series story-wise? Hell yes.”</p>

 <p>Some may take issue with that last assessment of the recent <i>Star Wars</i> games, but it speaks to DeityVengy’s vision of this mod project firmly being “fanon, including what [they] consider the best aspects of every era.”</p> <p>Given the name of the project, I was curious about how this all started. Where does one get the impulse and the fortitude to assemble such an ambitious collection of mods, each from different modders, into one, fully working <i>Star Wars</i> sim? The project, DeityVengy told me, “started as a simple one-off video for my YouTube channel about one-and-a-half years ago. After the initial video blew up and more people got interested in it, I just had more motivation to keep it going and started working on my mods. It really [kicked off] after I made my main quest which completely rewrote <i>Starfield</i>’s main quest, and then there was another spike recently when I replaced New Atlantis with Coruscant.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617843" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617843"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617843">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But even with a love of <i>Star Wars</i> and a host of fans eager to jump into a total conversion project, DeityVengy still had some big hurdles to overcome. “For the longest time,” they told me, “the biggest challenge was a modding limitation that <i>Starfield</i> had for about a year where you could only have around 100 or so mods installed until your game became unplayable.” That limitation proved to be an opportunity for DeityVengy, one “that ended up being the foundation for a few of my big overhaul mods such as Armor Compendium, which makes <i>Genesis</i> possible today. It really just forced me to be concise and organized when I was learning how to mod. Without that initial challenge, the project would be a lot less organized and a lot buggier.”</p> <p>For those of us eager to wield a laser sword (yes, I called it that), there’s a bit of disappointment awaiting you at the end of the install process. “There are a few lightsaber mods out there,” they told me, “but I really refuse to add them unless their implementation is perfect, and that’s just unfortunately not possible without Bethesda releasing their animation framework tools.” Dodging and better third-person melee animations are really what DeityVegny seems to need to make the experience of wielding a lightsaber feel as good as it presently does to touch down in Mos Eisley and chill with some Jawas.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617839"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617839">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Up next on their plate are some faction quest rewrites. The current mod list features a full rebranding of the game’s factions. House Va’ruun, for example, are now a roaming band of Sith zealots. “I’m taking a lot of inspiration from the success of <i>Andor</i> and am keeping it as a grounded story,” they said about the upcoming faction overhauls. “The Rebellion questline that I’m working on is going to be a much more <i>Andor</i>-esque story where you’re just a regular person solving a problem for the Rebel Alliance.”</p> <p><i>Star Wars Genesis </i>is currently on version 8.2.0, with the project having started in June of 2024 and receiving regular updates since then. The next version, 8.3, is just around the corner, promising over 1,000 new voicelines for the main quest. The install page recommends waiting for this new update if you’re new to the project. At the very least, it’s a good opportunity to do a fresh install of <i>Starfield</i> in anticipation as the process of getting everything up and running is made easier when you completely clear your computer of any trace of the old install.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617840" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617840"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617840">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve only spent a couple of hours poking around in DeityVegny’s take on the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, but from the opening moments on, with the iconic sights and sounds of <i>Star Wars</i> filling my eyes and ears, it’s clear I’ll be venturing to this version of one of the most beloved fictional galaxies of all time a hell of a lot more.</p> <hr> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755202910.217459" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755202910.217459"> <p><b data-stringify-type="bold"><i data-stringify-type="italic">Updated, 8/14/2025, 4:15 p.m. ET</i></b><i data-stringify-type="italic">:</i>&nbsp;It has been brought to our attention that&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Star Wars Genesis</i> currently makes use of ElevenLabs AI for much of its voice acting, a fact which was not mentioned in the original published version of this story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>I’ll be honest, this last week I spent most of it sitting around and feeling down because all I wanted to do was play more <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">Battlefield 6</a>.</em> And now, it’s back for one more open beta weekend, and this time around, there’s some new content, too. That will likely help its player count numbers grow even higher as <em>BF6</em>, months before launch, already feels like a blockbuster success for EA.</p> <p>Here’s everything you need to know about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>, including when it starts and ends, what’s included in this new beta weekend, where you can play it, and more.</p> <h2>When Does The <em>Battlefield 6</em> Open Beta Start And End?</h2> <p>On August 14, as EA and Battlefield Studios previously announced, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta returned on all platforms. And this time around, there isn’t any weird “early access” period where you’ll need a code to play. This weekend, anyone can hop in right away and start capturing control points and blowing up buildings.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700"><em>BF6</em></a> open beta started on Thursday, August 14 at 4 a.m. EDT and ends on Sunday, August 17 at 4 a.m. PDT. That means you, and over <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">350,000 other fans</a>, have around 72 hours or so to play more of what might be the best online shooter of 2025. And maybe, if EA is feeling generous, the beta will get extended a bit. It’s happened before. We can only hope.</p> <h2>Is There Any New Content In The Second Weekend Of <em>BF6</em>‘s Open Beta?</h2> <p>Yes! Earlier this week, ahead of the beta’s launch, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options">EA published an in-depth blog</a> about the second and final beta weekend, confirming that a new map and game modes were being added. There are also some changes to how playlists work, with new options that combine some modes and rotate out during the beta.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 EMPIRE STATE PS5 Pro Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7cl2WRcIYc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The big news in weekend two is a new map to explore and blow up. It’s called “Empire State” and it’s set in New York City. I played this map during a preview event last month and really enjoyed it. However, some players might be sad to learn that this new NYC-themed map is not a massive one. We know there are big maps in the game, but it seems we won’t be getting any during the beta.</p>

 <p>Also being added to the beta are two new modes: Squad Deathmatch and the <em>Battlefield</em> classic Rush. At the previously mentioned preview event, I got to play Squad Deathmatch, and it was no good due to tiny maps and <em>CoD</em>-like combat. That’s not the kind of experience I want from <em>Battlefield</em>. Rush, on the other hand, is a fan-favorite mode, and I’m excited to see it return in <em>BF6</em>. There will be some new beta-only challenges, too.</p> <h2>Does the <em>BF6</em> Open Beta Include A Server Browser?</h2> <p>No! However, EA has added a new way to join matches and find specific modes and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> beta. This new option is called “Custom Search.” Here’s how EA describes it:</p>

 <p>“Custom Search allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.”</p> <p>It should be noted that EA makes it very clear that this isn’t a server browser. We know Portal, a separate mode in <em>BF6</em> that will feature user-made content, will feature a server browser. But the beta and traditional multiplayer in BF6, for now at least, won’t include the old school tool.</p> <h2>Are people already cheating in the<em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">That is indeed a thing that happened during the last beta weekend.</a> Players online shared clips of people using what appeared to be wall hacks and other cheat software during the <em>BF6</em> open beta. EA says it has banned thousands of players and blocked even more attempts at cheating in the beta, but some people are annoyed that the game forces you to use Secure Boot on PC to help deter cheaters, which can be a hassle for some users, and yet still has a problem with people hacking it.</p>

 <p>I’ll say that in my time playing <em>BF6</em> last weekend, I never encountered anyone blatantly cheating. I did, however, run into people using flick aim, a controversial addition to <em>BF6</em> that some players say is unfair and makes the game too twitchy. The idea behind flick aim is that players on all platforms can assign buttons that almost instantly “flick” their character in a specific direction. For example, you could assign flick backward to down on the d-pad and be able to instantly pull a 180 spin at the touch of a button.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a must have setting in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Flick Look allows you to achieve an instant quick 180 in combat! <a href="https://t.co/ElMW1yvrhh">pic.twitter.com/ElMW1yvrhh</a></p> <p>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While some players aren’t happy about this and have reportedly even accused others online of cheating when seeing them use the in-game flick options, others point out that it gives console and controller users a way to compete with mouse players.&nbsp;Personally, I think flick aiming options in <em>Battlefield 6</em> are fine, but perhaps my opinion will change on that if and when more players start using it and how that changes up the flow of combat in the game.</p>

 <h2>So, Is <em>Battlefield 6</em> Any Good?</h2> <p>As someone who has played every mainline <em>Battlefield</em> game, as well as an incredibly long list of other online shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, I think <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is fantastic</a>. If the full game can match or even exceed what’s in the beta and what I played during that preview event in July, I think there’s a really good chance <em>BF6</em> is a massive hit with both players and critics.</p> <p><em>BF6</em>‘s combat is snappy and feels wonderful, but also doesn’t feel too fast or twitchy like modern <em>Call of Duty</em>. Instead, soldiers have a weight to them, and firefights can go on for an extended amount of time as players lay down cover fire using extremely loud and dangerous-sounding guns. This is the gritty, grounded modern warfare <em>Battlefield</em> game that we’ve been missing since <em>Battlefield 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>I literally felt sad for most of the week, playing or doing anything else. All I’ve wanted to do these last few days is load up <em>BF6</em> and blast some fools while helping my team win. So I’m excited that the <em>BF6</em> open beta is back for one more weekend. Sadly, after this, we’ll all have to wait until October 10 to play <em>Battlefield 6</em> again when it launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. As someone once said, <a href="https://youtu.be/-KJPP7GkuPU">“The waiting is the hardest part.”</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-newest-boss-fight-is-pure-chaos-and-i-love-hate-it.1270455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">rotating summer boss fight extravaganza</a> just reached peak chaos. Libra Creature of Night, AKA Equilibrious Beast, is the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-night-reign-libra-madness-orb-sigil-phase-1851782989">latest Everdark Sovereign</a>, turning what was already arguably the hardest boss fight in the game into something even more punishing. But not in the way players expected. Instead of simply multiplying the difficulty of the original encounter, Libra returned with completely new mechanics that revolve around summoning an army of clones that swarm players in the fight. I love it. And I hate it.</p> <p>One of the things I enjoy about FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">weekly Everdark Sovereign updates</a> is that they go live around 9:00 p.m. on Wednesday nights. Everyone logs into the game, goes about their usual runs, and runs into a brand new boss fight with no idea of what to expect. While it was relatively easy to muddle through recent boss fights with the right builds and the right amount of patience, Everdark Libra has been very different. His second phase begins early in the fight and revolves around summoning mirror images of the players facing him.</p> <p>Sure, okay, a trio of invaders. Straightforward enough. But they’re surprisingly tanky and lethal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpxsrq/solo_guardian_is_unplayable_against_everdark_libra/">especially the Guardians and Wylders</a>. Plus, not long after you defeat them, Libra summons even more. Then he starts pelting the battlefield with madness glyphs and projectiles. An added layer of bullet hell ensues. Confidence borne of dozens of back-to-back wins <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpnmhk/what_the_actual_fuck_just_happened/">immediately shatters</a>. Everyone starts running for their lives. They can barely survive the adds, let alone get chip damage here or there on Libra. Meanwhile, cryptic text keeps flashing across the screen as Libra performs different rituals. What does it mean? Oops, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpznvt/whole_village_chasing_our_revenant_we_are_truly/">you’re already dead</a>!</p>

   <p>What makes this whole ordeal exhilarating instead of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpp0z5/turning_the_best_boss_in_nightreign_into_a_summon/">just a cheap summon gimmick</a> is that there’s a method to the madness. It just requires you to approach the first couple of times fighting Everdark Libra like a researcher. It trains you to watch the battlefield carefully, analyzing cause and effect, poking and prodding his attack patterns for underlying vulnerabilities that can be exploited. You can feel the chaos change in real time if you’re a consummate lurker on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit.</p> <p>So what’s actually going on in the fight? Players have been trained to mostly eschew Libra’s “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ld9fg7/libras_deals_cheatsheet/">deals</a>” that give powerful buffs with unique and, in many cases, severe drawbacks. He offers them in the field during regular playthroughs and right before the beginning of his boss fight. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpp5cb/enhanced_libra_gimmicks_explained/">In the Everdark version, however, he also starts enforcing</a> them in the middle of the fight, whether you like it or not. You might get infinite flask heals that decrease your level each time or the passive frenzied fire attacks that also build up your own madness meter.</p> <p>Success in the fight requires constant awareness of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpojrc/all_of_everdark_libras_new_effects/">which rituals are in effect</a>. “Preaches Madness” imbues all attacks with madness, which can be used to break Libra as well (madness is one of his weaknesses). NPCs can get summoned almost every minute, but “Incites a Riot” will lead them to start fighting one another or even attack Libra. The longer into the fight you get, the more all of these effects begin stacking. And that’s before Libra uses one of his attacks to partition the battlefield with lines that punish the player when crossed.</p>

   <p>How do you win? Like in most FromSoftware fights, with a combination of patience and practice, which people with over a hundred hours in <em>Nightreign</em> aren’t accustomed to doing anymore. We’ve mastered the game, after all. We should be able to brute-force through any fight on skill and instincts alone. “You’ll need to completely rewire your brain from standard, rushed play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mq4bwu/heres_how_to_beat_libra_patience_and_planning/">one player noted</a> on the subreddit. Everdark Libra isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. This also requires players to approach how they normally do their daytime runs differently. More focus on stamina and buffs that help with swarms of enemies rather than upgrades aimed at bursting down a single target as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpw4xr/peak_chaos_thoughts/">are split</a> on whether the whole thing is genius or junk. Some love all of the complex moving pieces colliding into one frantic mess. Others hate fighting NPCs. “I want to fight Libra,” wrote one fan. “Not clones. I want a crazy grand attack. Not whatever that wet fart was.” I can sympathize! My favorite <em>Nightreign</em> fights by far are the ones that focus almost exclusively on the nuts and bolts of managing enemy aggro and frame-perfect dodging. The original Libra fight and Everdark Gaping Jaw both excelled at that.</p> <p>Eventually, winning those fights felt great, even if getting up to that point was sometimes a frustrating slog against my own limits. Everdark Libra is the opposite. Defeating him won’t feel like overcoming some great obstacle. But the experience of “solving” the fight and trying to find a way through all of the chaos more than makes up for it.</p>
