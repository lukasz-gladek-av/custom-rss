              <p>I often have to play a game for a few hours before I feel confident in saying I liked it or didn’t like it. Before I can say this is good or this is bad. Sometimes you play a game that, within 20 minutes or less, makes it clear that it ain’t very good. Sadly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-cthulu-sure-lets-do-it-1841477897"><em>Dead Static Drive</em></a> was one of those games.</p> <p><em>Dead Static Drive </em>has been in some form of development for <a href="https://www.killscreen.com/dead-static-drive-road-trip-horror-vintage-americana-style/">nearly a decade</a> and has repeatedly gone viral online thanks to its eye-catching art style. And now the isometric survival horror game is out on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass. Often marketed as “<a href="https://www.deadstaticdrive.com/">Grand Theft Cthulu</a>,” <em>Dead Static Drive </em>has you stealing cars, completing missions, and exploring a monster-infested world that provides a lot of freedom to go where you want to go while trying to gather the supplies you need to stay alive. It’s a cool idea, for sure, but it never comes together. Most of this game doesn’t really work, and with the exception of <em>Dead Static Drive</em>‘s wonderful low-poly art style, there’s little about this game that I enjoyed.</p>

  <p>The biggest issue I encountered is how horrible it feels to drive cars in the newly released game. In something describing itself as Grand Theft Chthulu, I expected the cars to handle well and feel fun to drive around desolate cities and highways. Nope! No matter what camera or controller settings I changed, driving in <em>Dead Static Drive</em> is a mess. I never felt in control of any vehicle I entered, and getting around corners without crashing proved to be the biggest challenge. I’m also baffled by the decision not to include any engine noises. The first time I got into a car and drove off, I assumed the game had bugged out and the car should be making noise. Restarted, tried a different car, and nope. Nothing. Silence. I looked at other people’s gameplay and it turns out that this isn’t a bug, but a design choice. And it’s odd! This robs the different cars you encounter of a lot of the personality and makes the game feel unfinished.</p>

 <p>A lot of this game feels unfinished, though, so that’s probably why I assumed the missing audio was a bug at first. Combat is a slog, animations are clunky, quests break all the time, and NPCs get stuck on geometry. The inventory screen seems half-finished, missing features like “Quick Move” which makes managing all the gubbins you find annoying as heck on a controller. Characters also don’t have voice lines, which could have been fine, but in a game where cars make no noise beyond tire squeals and the world around you is empty, it just leads to <em>Dead Static Driv</em>e being a boring experience.</p> <p>After about three hours of playing <em>Dead Static Drive</em>, I pulled over and got out. It’s a shame because the world looks amazing, and I like the premise a lot, but what’s here just isn’t worth any more time.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>is an incredibly dense RPG, and I’m sure there are still players who have yet to see everything in Larian Studio’s </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </span></i><span>adventure. However, for the sickos who have been combing through the game for two years and wish they had a reason to go back to it, a group of dedicated fan modders is working on what is essentially the expansion Larian chose not to make.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Path to Menzoberranzan” is an entirely fan-made campaign separate from the story and characters of </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. Around 130 modders are working on this original tale. Though the full campaign is still far off, the alpha is projected to launch in the “first half of 2026,” and will include the mod’s prologue chapter. As the name suggests, the mod’s campaign will take players to Menzoberranzan, a prominent Drow city in the fantastical world of Faerûn. Even if you’re a casual Forgotten Realms fan, you might have heard about the city from </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>companion Minthara, who originated from the city before becoming a pawn of the Absolute.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Though it remains to be seen if the campaign will have any overt references to the main game’s crew, “Path to Menzoberranzan” will feature an entirely new cast of characters, each with an original backstory and voice acting. While development is ongoing, the team is still actively recruiting team members, auditioning voice actors, and providing semi-regular updates on </span><a href="https://discord.com/invite/ptm"><span>its Discord server</span></a><span>. So if you’re looking for something to do while you wait for whatever Larian is working on next, here’s another </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>project to distract you.</span></p> <p><span>Despite </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>’s resounding success, Larian seems to be done with the series and is instead </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-director-teases-next-crazy-thing-sequel-2000614546"><span>working on two new </span></a><a href="http://projects.we/"><span>projects</span></a><span>. We don’t know what either of them is yet, but the team is likely much further along than the ideation phase it was in when Larian </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-next-game-excalibur-1851509450"><span>first started discussing these games last year</span></a><span>. Despite moving on from the game, Larian put out some massive patches and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-crossplay-photo-mode-1851776211"><span>free updates for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>, so if you haven’t played it since launch, there’s plenty new to see.</span></p>
