Some movies simply use Christmas as a sort of emotional backdrop for their naughty deeds. Meanwhile, other movies use the holiday as a narrative device meant to highlight a character’s road to redemption and triumph with a feeling of togetherness familiar to all. It’s easy to tell what’s a Christmas movie. It’s not so easy to tell which ones are naughty and which ones are nice.</p><p>A movie overflowing with cursing like <em>Friday After Next </em>is actually a nicer Christmas movie than the family-centric <em>Home Alone</em> because the former uses the feeling of Christmas goodness to overcome its vulgar obstacles while the latter is entirely about an innocent kid surviving a life-or-death situation. One film’s core is a quest to engineer a Christmas miracle to save characters from homelessness, and the other film is just a home invasion comedy thriller set during Christmas. </p><p>All of this and more will be explained once you dive into our examples of some of the best naughty and nice Christmas movies.</p></div></div><div><p><em>Die Hard </em>may very well be a wholesome Christmas movie, given its story about a man wanting to patch things up with his estranged wife. (At least that’s how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/die-hard-jeb-stuart-interview-35-year-anniversary-1850633919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/die-hard-jeb-stuart-interview-35-year-anniversary-1850633919">screenwriter Jeb Stuart</a></span> argues on its behalf.) But that doesn’t excuse the fact that John McClane racks up a body count of <em>ten</em> men by the time the end credits roll. Sure, they’re all international criminals posing as terrorists who would have killed far more without McClane to stop them. But if Snoopy and the Red Baron could set aside bloodshed on Christmas night, surely John and Hans could have done so too.</p></div><div><p>Disregarding the 3D-ness of it all, <em>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas</em> goes down smoother than fast food sliders ever could. John Cho, Kal Penn, and Neil Patrick Harris reunite for one more, seemingly final round as the estranged best friends rediscover their bond after taking their first steps into real adulthood. See past the R-rated vulgarity, gun violence, and claymation dongs and you’ll find <em>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas</em> to be the gift that keeps on giving.</p></div><div><p><em>Home Alone </em>doesn’t have nearly enough holiday cheer, nor its young star quite enough charm, to cover up the film’s child abandonment resulting from a faulty alarm clock. John Hughes’ seminal film may be a Christmas classic, but that doesn’t mean it’ll ever get off the naughty list. For children, Christmas is a time for the joyful innocence of awaiting Santa Claus’s arrival to  reward your good year with great presents, as you maybe leave him some milk and cookies to sweeten the deal. It’s not about a kid fighting for his life by leaving nails for thief Marv (Daniel Stern) to step on, and a scolding hot doorknob for Harry (Joe Pesci) to burn his hand on, as both try to rob the child’s home. Sorry to say, but one of the greatest Christmas movies ever is also one of the naughtiest.</p></div><div><p>Everything about <em>Elf</em> is a Christmas miracle. Springing from the mind of screenwriter David Berenbaum and executed by the dynamo duo of Jon Favreau and Will Ferrell—the latter considered a liability among executives at the time, given his previous starring role in the bawdy <em>Old School</em>—<em>Elf</em> defied expectations to become the premier holiday classic of the new millennium. Its spellbinding sense of unabashed joy and its story concerning one man’s search for family are powerful enough to thaw even the iciest hearts. And few can resist the simple hilarity of six-foot-three Will Ferrell in emerald stockings.</p></div><div><p>Never judge a book by its cover, but always judge a Christmas movie by its Santa. Billy Bob Thornton, as Willie T. Soke, portrays arguably the crudest department store Santa Claus in history. Telling a child on your lap that you contracted a disease from sleeping with Mrs. Claus’s sister and then showing up to work drunk is sacrilegious to anyone who celebrates Christmas. The movie takes an exceptionally dark turn when Willie attempts suicide—something no Christmas story should have to endure. While preteen Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) ultimately gains the gift of lasting friendship with Willie and the confidence to stand up to his bullies, it only comes after Willie is shot by the police while wearing his Santa costume and Thurman flips off his harasser. You can’t slap a few ornaments on a lump of coal and call it anything but naughty.</p></div><div><p>I know what you’re about to say, and you’re correct: <em>Friday After Next</em> had more F-words that weren’t “frolicking” or “family” in it than any Christmas movie should have. But it was all in service of preserving what makes Christmas great. Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Daymond “Day-Day” Jones (Mike Epps) make ridiculous attempts at paying rent after a thief dressed as Santa Claus robs them of their rent money and gifts. That, along with Katt Williams’ Money Mike character thwarting sexual assault by clinching Damon “Triple O.G.” Pearly’s (Terry Crews’) testicles with pliers, is antithetical to the Christmas spirit. However, gathering people for a Christmas Eve party to help them pay their rent, along with Christmas carolers getting retribution for those who harassed them while they spread holiday cheer, are beautiful examples of the power of Christmas. Plus, catching the robber in the ’hood, getting the money back, and leaving him on a roof for the cops to collect is nothing short of a Christmas miracle.</p></div><div><p>Nothing is more awkward than your boss hooking up with your crush. So imagine being Jack Lemmon in Billy Wilder’s <em>The Apartment</em>, whose boss isn’t just sleeping with his crush (Shirley MacLaine) but doing the deed in his own pad! (Even worse: Imagine the cleaning bill on all of his own bedsheets.) Beloved as it may be with its sweet happy ending and the triumph of personal happiness over professional ambition, the central predicament of <em>The Apartment</em> is just about the epitome of the holiday blues. The very kind Elvis sang about. </p></div><div><p>No, revealing someone’s sex work past and a cancer death aren’t really what Christmas is all about. Those are just the lowlights, however, in an illuminating Christmas classic, <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>. The sequel to 1999's <em>The Best Man</em> finds a fractured yet still familial group of friends spending the holidays together when infidelity, financial mismanagement, and betrayal strike. The performances from the film’s incredible ensemble, which includes Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Terrence Howard, and Regina Hall, are all rooted in the type of redeemable honesty that inspires the forgiveness that Christmas calls for. Coordinated displays of love, like wearing the same ugly Santa sweater as your partner and going Christmas caroling, are quintessentially in the Christmas spirit. Thanks to <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>, you can add four men doing a choreographed rendition of New Edition’s “Can You Stand the Rain” for the women in their lives (while decked in enough leather to cause a heat stroke in slightly hotter conditions) to that list.</p></div><div><p>Hot chocolate and pecan pie can set the Christmas mood perfectly—unless they’re consumed under duress while your kidnappers are seconds away from pummeling you. Starring Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, and <em>Forrest Gump</em>’s Gary Sinise, <em>Reindeer Games</em> follows ex-con Rudy Duncan (Affleck) as he assumes the identity of his late cellmate Nick (James Frain) to win over a woman named Ashley (Theron) and spend time with her family for Christmas after being released from prison. However, he soon finds himself entangled in a dangerous plot led by Ashley’s brother Gabriel (Sinise), who believes Rudy (posing as Nick) can help them rob a casino. Kidnapping, excessive blood and guns, and a deadly finale are all cardinal sins of Christmas movies, banishing this one to the naughty pile.</p></div><div><p>Paul Giamatti may be a perpetual Grinch in his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-dc-dune-penguin-golden-globes-1851716634?_gl=1*cq8jjv*_ga*MTQ2OTgzNDI5MS4xNzMyMjkzNzkx*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ1MzQ0Ni43MC4xLjE3MzQ0NjM0MTkuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-dc-dune-penguin-golden-globes-1851716634?_gl=1*cq8jjv*_ga*MTQ2OTgzNDI5MS4xNzMyMjkzNzkx*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ1MzQ0Ni43MC4xLjE3MzQ0NjM0MTkuNjAuMC4w">Golden Globe Award</a></span>-winning performance as boarding school <strike>dictator</strike> teacher Paul Hunham in <em>The Holdovers</em>, but that just makes the Christmas joy he helps engineer all the more sacred and earned. No one should be alone on Christmas, and <em>The Holdovers </em>immaculately demonstrates that as Hunham, petulant student Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), and grieving cafeteria manager Mary Lamb (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) are all stuck at Barton Academy boarding school over the holidays, life passing each of them by in particular ways. They band together and help each other reconnect with family and the joy of life. That’s as Christmas as it’s going to get.</p></div><div><p>As is the case anytime Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg collaborate on something, there is a heart of gold beneath the crude surface of <em>The Night Before</em>. But that still doesn’t mean it gets on Santa’s nice list. While this wildly underrated Christmas comedy champions the endurance of male friendships and taking personal accountability, there’s still a whole lotta lies, drugs, and unprotected sex in dive bar bathrooms during this oh-so-holy night. Also, while things ultimately work out for Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lizzy Caplan, it’s never a good idea to spring a public marriage proposal on your ex.</p></div><div><p>“Isn’t there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?” cries Charlie Brown. “Sure Charlie Brown, I can tell you what Christmas is all about,” a calm Linus says before cueing the stagelights and recounting the story of the First Christmas. It’s an iconic emotional climax to an equally iconic Christmas movie, one that stands the test of time thanks to just how much poor old Charlie Brown buckles under the weight of expectations and hollow artificiality. Linus’ Bible lecture isn’t religious dogma, not really. Just a calm reminder that the real intentions of these end-of-year celebrations are, as he puts it, “peace [and] good will toward men.”</p><h2 id="h112800"><a id=""></a></h2></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Depending on your playstyle and the build you’re after, you might need an early-game skill to clear standard mobs, but you’ll quickly realize that many of the Mercenary’s abilities prove potent well into the late-game, too. For now, let’s focus on three must-have skills.</p><p><strong>Tier I: Explosive Grenade</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-recommend-id="image://fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-recommend-id="image://fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most powerful early-game skills you can unlock for the Mercenary, specifically an AoE (area-of-effect) ability that deals Physical and Fire Damage to mobs, is the <strong>Explosive Grenade</strong>. It’s an effective party starter of a skill, as tossing one into a small group will whittle down an enemy’s health and soften them up. It’s also effective for keeping up the pressure against bosses.</p><p><strong>Tier III: Incendiary Shot</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-recommend-id="image://d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-recommend-id="image://d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Incendiary Shot </strong>is as effective as it is flashy. It’s slow to reload and cast, but the AoE effect of igniting everything in front of you on fire cannot be ignored. Igniting enemies and clearing low-level mobs are excellent ways to kick off a fight and simultaneously damage large groups.</p><p><strong>Tier V: Rapid Shot</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-recommend-id="image://0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-recommend-id="image://0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve been following along, you should now have two powerful AoE abilities, but now it’s time to focus on single-target damage that deals with rapid-fire DPS (damage-per-second) to quickly whittle down a boss’s health pool. <strong>Rapid Shot </strong>effectively turns your single-shot crossbow into a fast-firing machine gun, slinging steel bolts at enemies with an impressive clip size. This ability is how I finally bested Count Geonor at the end of Act 1.</p><p><br><em>Path of Exile 2</em> is currently available via paid Early Access via Steam on PC. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether he’s torching his own birthday cake with a flamethrower or dancing with himself through a field of lasers, it’s never easy to shake the sense that the movie was more focused on achieving GIF-able moments than telling any kind of coherent story.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>In the end, Zilko’s assessment is that <em>Sonic 3</em> might be fun for young kids and diehard fans, but it can’t end soon enough for everyone else. He might be right. But as the perfect mark for a Sega nostalgia cash-in with Sonic-loving kids of his own, I’m ready to revel in the franchise brain rot no matter what. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And equipped with that knowledge, you <em>can </em>succeed in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>and even compete against the biggest whales in the game without spending money.,With that said, here’s what free-to-play players should expect out of their experience and how they can make the most of it.</p><figure id="" data-id="90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-recommend-id="image://90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-recommend-id="image://90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h85156"><a id=""></a>Accept that you won’t get everything</h2><p>The first rule of every gacha game is to completely turn off any part of your brain that tells you you’re a completionist. While you do get free booster packs every day in <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, sheer economics will tell you that you won’t open enough booster packs to actually complete your card collection. After all, if you could get every card for free, what would you spend money on?</p><p>New cards will inevitably come out faster than you can collect them with the free resources the game provides. Naturally, this means you need to lower your expectations of what you should chase. Immersive three star cards have a paltry 0.222% chance of showing up in a pack. Crown rares only have a 0.040% chance! This doesn’t mean you’ll <em>never </em>get these cards, of course. It’s just that you shouldn’t necessarily choose which pack to open in hopes you’ll get a card that has a 1 in 2500 chance of appearing.</p><p>Instead, set your sight on cards that will help you win battles. This will help you get the most rewards during events, which will in turn help you collect even more cards. </p><h2 id="h85157"><a id=""></a>Chase cards that will help you build decks of each element</h2><p><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> doesn’t give you many options to chase down specific cards as of writing, but you can exert <em>some </em>control over which cards you can get. Right now, the three Genetic Apex card sets each contain distinct pools of cards. The fewer cards you own from a certain set, the greater the chance you’ll find a new card in your next pack.</p><p>As a free-to-play player, your first goal is to collect enough cards to build a competent deck of each element. You don’t need to make a <em>meta </em>deck of each element, mind you. Charizard EX and Moltres EX have great synergy, but if you played during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pocket-tcg-mass-outbreak-fire-type-bonus-rare-1851706732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pocket-tcg-mass-outbreak-fire-type-bonus-rare-1851706732">Fire Pokemon Mass Outbreak Event</a></span>, you already have a strong deck in Blaine, Ninetails, and Rapidash. Pick the packs you choose to pull strategically, with the goal of selecting packs that will most likely strengthen whichever elemental deck is weakest. For instance, if you can’t build a strong Dark deck, Genetic Apex Mewtwo has a strong core of Ekans, Grimer, Zubat, and Koffing evolution lines you can add to your collection.</p><figure id="" data-id="de7f9b869e45eb3d7f4ad24c090e6021" data-recommend-id="image://de7f9b869e45eb3d7f4ad24c090e6021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a battle against the CPU in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket.

The player is using Vulpix and Ponyta." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h85158"><a id=""></a>Take stock of what you have to build out your “main” deck</h2><p>Once you have strong elemental coverage under your belt, you’ll want to build a deck to take into online PvP battles. While online battling can feel intimidating at first, matches are mostly low-stakes in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>, and there’s no way for your opponent to send you mean messages about how you’re a bad player for not using the mythical Dunsparce card. I typically stay far away from PvP modes myself, so I can assure you that online battling isn’t nearly as scary as it sounds.</p><p>Look at the cards you already have and figure out which deck you can realistically build that can win online battles. Sure, in the game’s current meta, cards like Mewtwo EX and Gardevoir rule the roost when used together. However, if you don’t have any copies of either card, you’ll need a lot of luck with your card pulls to make that deck work. However, if you already have, say, two Exeggutor EX cards, you might be close to putting together a strong Grass deck bolstered by the Erika trainer card. Maybe your deck won’t be “meta,” but at least you’ll have a solid foundation to work with as you continue to collect cards.</p><p>On the plus side, less popular decks can thrive online <em>because</em> they aren’t meta. After all, if everyone uses decks with Pikachu EXs, then most players will learn how to best counter them. However, if you roll up with a Marowak EX deck, you may leave your opponent scrambling to come up with a counterplay. Just remember that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195">success in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> battles often comes down to sheer luck</a></span>, so don’t feel like your deck is bad just because you’re struggling to win!</p><h2 id="h85159"><a id=""></a>Show up for the daily grind</h2><p>With solid decks to play the game under your belt, or at least enough cards to get your feet wet, it’s time to do what every free-to-play game devolves into: daily grinding. To the game’s credit, <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is light on this front. Your literal “daily missions” can be completed in about 10 minutes. That said, if you want to collect as many free resources as you can as you play, participate in the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Use your <strong>free booster packs</strong> when they become available.</li><li>Check your <strong>Wonder Picks</strong>, especially if your Wonder Stamina is almost full. Events may dish out free Wonder Picks throughout the day, so check in whenever you open the game.</li><li><strong>Participate in any ongoing single-player events</strong>, and don’t sit on a full Event Stamina bar. You can often repeat these battles to grind out bonus hourglasses and unique event cards.</li><li>Battle other players in Versus mode. <strong>You can get up to five shop tickets a day from players who press the “thanks” button after battle </strong>(make sure to return the favor and thank them too!). Remember, Shop Tickets can be used to buy Hourglasses, which means more cards.</li><li><strong>You can also give Shop Tickets to your friends by liking their Showcases</strong>. Thank all your friends and they might return the favor, as long as you’ve set up your own showcase!</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="fd1283c2be463c0d30fceee43b0d1469" data-recommend-id="image://fd1283c2be463c0d30fceee43b0d1469" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pack Hourglass item in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pack Hourglass item in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd1283c2be463c0d30fceee43b0d1469" data-recommend-id="image://fd1283c2be463c0d30fceee43b0d1469" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pack Hourglass item in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h85160"><a id=""></a>Stockpile your resources once you have enough</h2><p>Admittedly, stockpiling resources somewhat relies on assumptions, since there’s no way to predict the future in a live service game. While we know that some resources will eventually expire (such as Pack Points used to get a card of your choice), nothing indicates that hourglasses can’t be used for future expansions. So if you’ve collected all the cards you need to win battles and have fulfilled most of your collection-based missions, consider following the advice of your elders who grew up in a much better economy and start saving for the future.</p><p>At the end of the day, there’s no hard science to playing games like <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>. No one’s going to knock on your door and take your phone away because you didn’t manage your free-to-play account optimally. But when shiny new cards drop and players begin to rack up hundreds of dollars on their credit cards chasing them, you’ll be happy to have a handful of pulls in reserve so you can enjoy the new stuff too. You’ll never own as many cards as a hardcore spender does. But you can at least rest easy knowing that you worked for the cards you got..</p><p>Video games are meant to be fun, so hopefully using your resources to best fill out your collection will help you get the most out of <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>. And if you aren’t having fun… well, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinity-nikki-release-date-dress-up-rpg-ps5-register-1851699258&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinity-nikki-release-date-dress-up-rpg-ps5-register-1851699258"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a></span> looks pretty good. </p><p><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is available now for iOS and Android devices.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
