              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger costs $20 and doesn’t even include a cable, forcing iPhone buyers to pay extra just to charge their new devices at proper speeds. Anker has positioned itself as one of the few third-party brands sold directly in Apple Stores and it earned Apple’s stamp of approval for quality and compatibility.</p>
<p>The good news is that right now, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">two-pack of Anker 20W chargers currently sells for just $15 on Amazon, down from the standard $18 price</a>, and each unit includes a 5-foot USB-C cable. You’re essentially <strong>getting two complete charging solutions</strong> with cables for less than the cost of Apple’s single charger alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why Anker Earned Apple’s Trust and Your Money</h2>
<p>The <strong>20W output provides the fastest charging speed currently supported by iPhones</strong> which brings an empty device to about 50% in roughly 30 minutes. That’s really fast and something important for those rushed mornings when you forgot to charge overnight or need to top up before going out in the evening. Power Delivery ensures compatibility across the entire iPhone lineup from the iPhone 8 forward and it will work seamlessly with iPads that support fast charging, AirPods cases, and various other USB-C devices.</p>



<p>But that’s not all: the <strong>dual-port design on each charger</strong> brings with it some unexpected versatility that Apple’s single-port adapter simply can’t match. You <strong>get both a USB-C port and a USB-A port on each unit</strong>, and lets you charge two devices at the same time without needing multiple wall outlets. If you’re using the USB-C alone, it’ll continue to pump out the full 20W while the USB-A adds additional charging capability for any older devices or accessories that haven’t yet made the switch to USB-C.</p>



<p>That compact form factor makes these chargers truly portable without the bulk that seems to afflict too many high-wattage adapters. The<strong> foldable prongs on the US version fold flat against the body</strong> so the sharp metal pins won’t catch on clothes or scratch other items in your bag. The size is small enough to fit in crowded power strips without blocking the adjacent outlets, which addresses one of the most annoying things about big charging bricks: they tend to monopolize multiple spaces.</p>
<p>The<strong> included 5-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> provide you with enough length to comfortably use your phone as it charges, even when the outlet is located inconveniently. Apple’s own cables are only 3 feet, which in turn makes you sit strangely close to wall outlets or sacrifice active use of your phone during charging. The extra two feet of cable length completely alters charging from a restrictive tether into something that allows natural movement and comfortable usage of the device.</p>
<p>For $15 for two charging solutions with cables included, this <strong>Anker pack is 75% less than buying two of Apple’s official chargers</strong> that would run you $40 plus the additional cost of cables.</p>

              <p>Compact desktop computers promise space-saving convenience but too many Windows-based mini PCs struggle with performance compromises that undermine their appeal. Apple’s latest Mac mini with M4 chip demolishes that equation entirely as this small computer delivers performance that embarrasses even high-spec Windows alternatives while occupying minimal desk space.</p>
<p>Currently<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/"> available for just $499 on Amazon for the 256GB option, down from its standard $599 price</a>, this is the lowest price this latest-generation Mac mini has ever reached. This early Black Friday deal makes Apple’s most affordable desktop even more accessible, and given how thoroughly the M4 chip outperforms competing mini PCs, choosing this over Windows alternatives becomes an obvious decision.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why the M4 Chip Changes Everything for Desktop Computing</h2>
<p>The 10-core CPU inside this Mac mini delivers <strong>processing power that rivals desktop towers costing significantly more</strong>. Apple’s ARM-based architecture realizes efficiency that x86 processors simply can’t match and translates raw performance into real-world speed across every task you throw at it. The 10-core GPU covers graphics from casual gaming to 3D rendering, processing visual information via dedicated hardware that integrated graphics in Windows mini PCs can’t approach.</p>



<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a core advantage of <strong>Apple Silicon over traditional RAM configurations</strong>. Essentially, Unified Memory allows the CPU, GPU, and neural engine to access the same pool of memory without copying data across different banks, which eliminates bottlenecks that slow down Windows systems with discrete components. The unified approach lets Apple include features like Apple Intelligence, which taps into on-device machine learning to improve everything from photo editing to voice recognition without shipping your data off to cloud servers.</p>



<p>The connectivity options packed into this small enclosure exceed what many full-size desktops offer: You get multiple Thunderbolt 4 ports capable of transferring data at 40Gbps, connecting high-resolution screens up to 6K resolution and daisy-chaining multiple devices through a single connection. The HDMI port supports connecting a second display without requiring adapters while USB-A ports accommodate those older peripherals that haven’t transitioned to USB-C yet. Gigabit Ethernet provides wired network speeds that blow away WiFi reliability for tasks such as large file transfers or video streaming, and the WiFi 6E wireless connectivity ensures fast performance when cables aren’t practical.</p>
<p>The Apple Intelligence integration is the future of computing, putting AI at your fingertips without reliance on the cloud. Local processing by the neural engine in the M4 enables advanced photo search features to recognize objects and scenes, voice transcription on the fly without requiring internet connectivity, and smart suggestions across apps that provide context based on your usage patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring just 5 x 5 inches</strong>, this compact construction occupies less desk space than a large coffee mug, while the performance would make full-sized towers envious. That minimal footprint makes this Mac mini perfect for small apartments, dorm rooms, or minimalist workspaces where every inch of desk real estate counts. Made from aluminum, it provides strong durability and allows heat dissipation while keeping the system running quietly even under high workload conditions.</p>
<p>At $499, this Mac mini delivers flagship performance at midrange pricing and makes Apple’s desktop computing accessible to buyers who previously found Mac hardware too expensive. This $100 discount is real savings on a machine that will serve reliably for years, supported by Apple’s legendary build quality and macOS’s stability.</p>
