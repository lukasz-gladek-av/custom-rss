 <p><span>“Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again,” Pondsmith said on the stream. “I have ways to do that, Keanu.

I’d be content to never hear from Johnny Silverhand again, considering my </span><i><span>2077</span></i><span> ending had him disappearing into the dark net as my V carried out his (probably) final heist in space.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A viral Reddit post on the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit this week gave a lot of angry fans and longtime vets of the series the proof they needed to back up their fears: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803"><em>Battlefield 6</em> has the franchise’s smallest maps.</a> The data is clear in showing that the recently released FPS does indeed have a lot of comparatively small maps, but a map being small doesn’t inherently mean it will feel tiny when played. And a past <em>Battlefield</em> game that many, myself included, adore proves this.</p> <p>When digging through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bfmaps-in-the-series/">newly shared map comparison data from Reddit user ClaratheRed</a>, the part that surprised me the most was learning how <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-the-kotaku-review-1788052226"><em>Battlefield 1</em>‘s maps aren’t as big as I expected</a>. If you had asked me, before looking at this data, which <em>Battlefield</em> game had the biggest levels, I probably would have mentioned <em>BF1</em>. Battles in EA’s 2016 WW1-themed FPS felt epic and massive. Yet the data shows that most of the maps in that game were around the same size as what’s on offer in <em>BF6. </em>So what’s going on?</p>

 <h2>Why maps feel bigger in <em>Battlefield 1</em></h2> <p>I think there are two main reasons my memory<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and judging by the comments on Reddit, that of many others as well<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->seems so distorted when it comes to <em>BF1</em>‘s maps. Number one: Combat and transport in <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-year-in-battlefield-1-is-still-going-strong-1820886816"><em>Battlefield 1</em></a> were much slower and more limited due to its WW1 setting. Tanks back then moved slowly, guns were inaccurate at far distances, and aerial vehicles were limited in what they could do. Getting anywhere in that game took time, and fights rarely happened across long distances. This made even “small” maps feel big, and made the few genuinely huge maps in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-s-multiplayer-undercuts-its-dramatic-sing-1787804290"><em>BF1</em></a> feel like small countries.</p>

 <p>And that leads me to the second reason <em>BF1</em> and most other <em>Battlefield</em> games feel so massive compared to <em>BF6</em> in my brain: Because they all actually did have some big maps, whereas <em>BF6</em>, at the moment, does not. While <em>BF1</em> arguably only had two or maybe three truly BIG maps, that was enough. These much larger levels provided players with the giant all-out warfare they so craved from <em>Battlefield,</em> and helped obfuscate the fact that the rest of the maps weren’t enormous. And other <em>BF</em> games often had even more really big maps, meaning you spent more time bouncing between small, medium, and big maps.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, when we look at<em> Battlefield 6</em>, our perception of its map size doesn’t benefit from slower, WW1 combat and tech. It’s set in the modern era, with jets, fast tanks, and powerful snipers that can reach out and pop someone from hundreds of meters away. So even the few medium-sized maps in <em>BF6</em> feel tiny, while small maps feel downright cramped. And <em>BF6</em> also lacks the one or two impressively big battlegrounds it needs that would let players really stretch their legs.</p>

 <p>Add that all up, and it means that every time you play <em>BF6</em> you’re playing on maps that feel small, and you never get to experience a bigger area to help cleanse the palette, or to provide those epic memories that get passed around friend groups for years and help a game like <em>Battlefield 1</em> feel bigger than it was.</p> <p>I truly do believe that if <em>BF6</em> had even one actually massive map, a lot of the doom and gloom in the game’s online community surrounding map size would start to go away simply because they’d have something big to break things up. It would also give them the all-out chaos they demand from the series at least once or twice a session. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">And while I really enjoyed <em>BF6</em>‘s next map, which is arriving later this month as part of season one</a>, I’m not sure it will be anywhere near big enough to help win back players who are fed up with all of the shooter’s small warzones. But hopefully, somewhere inside Battlefield Studios, that truly giant map is being designed or built and will see the light of day in a future update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is DeAndre “SouljaBoy” Cortez up to these days? I’m not sure anyone’s asking that in the Year of our Lord 2025, but if they were the answer would probably surprise them. According to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQlFjCpgLDq/">latest post on Instagram</a>, the rapper behind the 2007 hit “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” is once again trying to hawk someone else’s retro handhelds under his own own made-up brand.</p> <p>SouljaGame Flip appears to just be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2, except that it costs more than double ($435 vs $210) and will be shipped to you from some other warehouse. “Not a single gamer buying this. Especially at that price,” one person earnestly responded on Instagram. “Play some games on it. Where’s the gameplay? Is it an emulator??? Rather get a Steam Deck for less that does more.”</p>

 <p>The Instagram post promoting the scalper performance art was spotted by<em> Retro Dodo</em> <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/">which proceeded</a> to ask the company that makes Retroid about it. “I didn’t know about this,” a representative told the site. “This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves.”</p>   <p>This is far from the first time that Soulja Boy has pulled this stunt. In 2018 he started flipping other <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/soulja-boy-new-console-appears-to-have-stolen-games/">Chinese-made retro emulation devices</a>, only for some of them to come installed with ROMs for Nintendo games. The infamously litigious Mario maker did not take it well. He claimed Nintendo wouldn’t sue. “I had to boss up, I didn’t have a choice,” he <a href="https://x.com/souljaboy/status/1079141002198347782">posted on X</a> after being threatened.</p>

 <p>But that hasn’t stopped him from returning every couple of years with a new fake Soulja Boy handheld. In 2022, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUEntvOmk70&amp;t=293s">he was pushing</a> another stolen Game Boy knockoff. The retro handheld market has only gotten bigger in the years since. That makes getting in on the action more lucrative than ever, but also more likely to get called out.</p> <p>“[Soulja Boy] has been rebranding consoles before Xbox did with the ROG Ally X,” wrote one person on Instagram.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-loot-hack-cheat-embark-studios-2000640831</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Few things are worse in <i>Arc Raiders</i> than a crushing defeat that sees you lose some of your best gear. Losing it fair and square is all part of the compelling, sometimes heartbreaking push-and-pull of the genre, but some players in <i>Arc Raiders </i>have lost their hard-earned gear due to encounters with cheaters. Fortunately, developer Embark Studios is keeping an eye on <i>how</i> you died in a match and, if it’s determined it was the result of cheating, you’ll get your stuff back.</p> <p>As folks are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/">sharing on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://gamerant.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-unfair-play-items-stolen-refund/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>), <i>Arc Raiders</i> is happy to step in and return your loot if the game detects any cheating was at work. “Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you!” reads an example of the prompt rewarding players with their ill-received losses. “We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages.”</p>

   <p>Preventing cheaters has been a complex struggle in online games, especially on PC, where many developers are choosing to implement aggressive anti-cheat features that demand excessive control over your machine. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/comment/nmgy4l6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one Redditor put it</a>, “fighting cheaters will unfortunately always be an uphill and reactionary battle, unless the game goes full invasive mode and acts like a computer virus having more access than it should and we all know no one wants that.”</p>

 <p>That said, cheating doesn’t appear to be a rampant problem in <i>Arc Raiders</i> right now. As more and more folks chime in on the thread documenting <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ item refund policy, few of them mention having actually encountered cheating in-game themselves. I myself have invested just under 50 hours in the game so far and haven’t seen too many shenanigans.</p> <p>Now, Embark, if you’re willing to refund me that really nice Vulcano I lost because of a pair of aggressive Hornets, that’d be real swell. I hope whoever found that gun is enjoying themselves. So happy for you.</p>
