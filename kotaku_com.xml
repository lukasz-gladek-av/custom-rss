One track is set in the <em>TMNT </em>universe and will have us driving through sewers and New York City while encountering characters from the franchise, including Super Fly. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/F2Insider/status/1930000778418368520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/F2Insider/status/1930000778418368520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In another leak</a></span>, Insider shared video of the SpongeBob SquarePants-inspired level that includes Bikini Bottom locations like the Krusty Krab. </p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Sega for more information about the DLC characters and leaks. Non-<em>Sonic </em>characters have appeared in previous <em>Sonic</em> racing games, including <em>Team Fortress 2</em> mercs and more. But this seems an all-new scale.</p><p>According to Insider, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/F2Insider/status/1929995888774262947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/F2Insider/status/1929995888774262947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the footage showing off SpongeBob racing on a surfboard</a></span> comes from an earlier build of the game and isn’t representative of the final product. That also explains why SpongeBob is using Sonic’s icon, and some of the missing audio and performance issues.  How Insider got their hands on it is unknown.</p><p>Of course, until Sega officially announces any of this, this could all still fall apart, or some of this content might not ever see the light of day. Still, the leaks seem to indicate that Sega is heavily invested in developing this crossover content. It seems very likely that in the near future, SpongeBob, Sonic, and Alex from <em>Minecraft</em> will be racing each other in the sewers of <em>TMNT</em>. Slowly, everything merges together as we march to our grey goo pop culture future. Exciting times. </p><p><em>Sonic Racing Crossworlds</em> is launching sometime later this year for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After years of stuttering on the old console, it actually seems to run smoothly (for now):</p><h2 id="h14918"><a id=""></a><em>Mario Kart World</em> 1.1.0 update makes more characters playable at the start</h2><p>A day-one patch is also live for the open-world racing sequel launch title. <em>Mario Kart World</em> 1.1.0 adds support for Camera Play, online multiplayer, and the ability to upload and download time trial ghosts. More importantly, it looks like Nintendo made some last-minute tuning adjustments as well. “We’ve increased the number of characters that can be selected from the start,” reads one of the patch notes. “The time limit for deciding on a course has been removed when playing Locally or LAN,” reads another. </p><p>One big question on players’ minds: will blue shells actually be easier to dodge this time around than in past games?</p><h2 id="h14919"><a id=""></a>Here’s what the inside of a Switch 2 looks like</h2><p>For those interested in what’s actually going on inside the Switch 2, someone’s already uploaded a complete teardown of the new hardware. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@pro-modding&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@pro-modding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProModding</a></span>’s surgery on the console has already raised some important questions, like why is Nintendo hiding so many screws underneath hard-to-replace stickers on the side of the console?</p><p>For anyone who doesn’t already have the console, Switch 2's launch day could be a lot rockier. While many secured pre-orders months ago, some stores in the U.S. have promised limited day-one inventory for people who show up at the midnight launch. The Switch 2 is expected to sell out at launch, but there’s a big question around just how hard it will be to get and for how long. Walmart has already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pre-order-canceled-order-target-walmart-june-5-1851783357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pre-order-canceled-order-target-walmart-june-5-1851783357">begun cancelling some</a></span> fans’ early pre-orders, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-out-of-stock-pre-orders-launch-1851783435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-out-of-stock-pre-orders-launch-1851783435">“out of stock” signs</a></span> have  been sent out to many stores. </p><h2 id="h14920"><a id=""></a>Switch 2 launch day stock is available at some stores but not for long</h2><p>Another big question is when all of those online pre-orders will finally get delivered. My bundle from Target currently isn’t slated to arrive until June 11, so I’m heading to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532">GameStop today to join the masses to try to score a launch-day unit</a></span>. My local store said they’d have about 10 for people showing up without pre-orders. For now though, backroom inventory is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l35g2m/best_buy_is_ready/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l35g2m/best_buy_is_ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at long last going out on store shelves</a></span>. Hopefully, there aren’t too many horror stories of people failing to get theirs.</p><p>Plus we’ll have to see how Nintendo’s servers hold up once the console is out across the globe and millions of players are trying to download games and day-one updates simultaneously. It’ll certainly put the Switch 2's allegedly improved Wi-Fi speeds to the test. </p><h2 id="h14921"><a id=""></a>Switch 2 can store more than double the number of screenshots </h2><p><strong>Update 6/4/2025 11:02 a.m. ET:</strong> The original Switch limited players to 10,000 screenshots no matter how much extra room on an SD expansion card they had (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-allows-you-to-save-up-to-30000-screenshots/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-allows-you-to-save-up-to-30000-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>NintendoSoup</em></a></span>). The Switch 2 not only increases that limit to 15,000 for the console itself, it also lets you store another 15,000 screenshots on the auxiliary microSD Express card. It might be enough to document every square inch of Mario Kart World. At the very least, no more sorting through what screenshots to delete in the short term anyway. </p><p><em>We’ll be updating this story throughout the day so check back for more news on what players are finding as Nintendo’s most anticipated console launch ever finally gets underway.</em> </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
