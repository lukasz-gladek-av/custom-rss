              <p>Do you like <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em>,</a> but wish its gameplay loop of dropping into a hostile environment solo or with buddies, completing some side objectives, a main mission, and then escaping by holding back waves of enemies and extracting via vehicle was a bit more chill? Maybe a bit more cowboy-themed, too? Well, one of the most popular demos out now as part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-demos-free-seth-mythmatch-2000673268">Steam’s Next Fest</a>, for a game called <em>Far Far West,</em> makes it seem like exactly the game you’ve been wanting.</p>

 <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3819240/Far_Far_West_Demo/"><em>Far Far West</em> is from the indie devs at Evil Raptor,</a> the same small team behind the excellent <a href="https://kotaku.com/pumpkin-jack-is-colorful-halloween-action-game-1845056040"><em>Pumpkin Jack</em></a> and the good-if-a-bit-flawed <em>Akimbot</em>. Unlike those single-player action platformers, however, the studio’s next game is a co-op (or solo) mission-based first-person <em>Helldivers</em>-like robot cowboy adventure. And folks, it’s a blast to play even in this unfinished demo stage.</p>  <p>The basic gameplay loop of <em>Far Far Wes</em>t has you and up to three other players hopping into a large western-themed map to complete small side objectives and open-world activities before deciding to take on the map’s boss in a big final fight. Each run rewards you with a few different currenices and XP, letting you upgrade your rifles, pistols, and magic spells (robot magic!), and equip joker cards that offer bonus abilities and special traits. I found one card that let me do extra damage when I was low on health. Useful! Another card would sometimes make headshots spit out confetti. Useless, but very funny!</p> <p>Like <em>Helldivers</em>, you can explore the entire map and complete everything, or just go straight to the big finale mission and then (hopefully) escape alive via a hover train.</p>

 <p>This is a very rewarding loop, but that alone doesn’t make<em> Far, Far West</em> worth playing. The actual reason I enjoyed the demo so much was how well it plays. Guns feel both snappy and hefty in a way that makes blasting away skeleton armies a blast. I also really loved how movement feels in <em>Far, Far West</em>, with its air dashes and big jumps. You also have a horse you can ride whenever you want, which makes it easy to get across empty sections of the world.</p>

 <p>The magic spells, while a bit odd in this cowboy sci-fi world, add an extra layer of depth to the combat. The acid spell doesn’t just spit out damage-dealing green goo; you (or your buddies) can shoot a fireball at the puddles and blow it all up, and any enemies nearby along with it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000674577" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674577"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674577">© Evil Raptor / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Between missions, you return to a little Wild West-themed town, complete with a saloon, sheriff’s office, and a few different vendors and shops that let you upgrade your gear, guns, and abilities using the resources you collect from missions. There’s also a shooting range where you can try out new guns or upgrades, something I’d love to see in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, actually.</p>

 <p>The vibes in town, like in the missions, are a bit more laid back, at least on lower difficulties, compared to those in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. You don’t die as fast. Enemies don’t hit as hard. It’s a bit easier to stick around and fight, even if you make mistakes. But be warned: If you crank up the challenge, <em>Far Far West</em> will slap you down quickly and teach you a lesson.</p> <p>I’m excited to play the full game when it launches sometime later this year in early access. I also hope it gets a console port, as I know my friend group that plays primarily on console would sink hours and hours into <em>Far Far West.</em></p>

              <p><span>Leon Kennedy has become known for many things over the course of the </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>series, including his stylish fighting style, good looks, and the fact that he cannot shut the fuck up in even the most dire of circumstances.</span></p> <p><span>The Raccoon City cop turned anti-bioterrorism agent loves to crack wise even when a zombie’s got its teeth at his neck, and my guy does not let up on that in </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>. So I decided to take note of all his one-liners and decide which are the best ones. We won’t be getting into major story spoilers here, but in giving context to Leon’s remarks, we’ll be making vague references to some events. Here are all of his quips, ranked from the blandest to the most delightfully stupid. Reader discretion is advised.</span></p>

 <p><span><strong>“Just a few…potholes.”</strong> – Leon, speeding over a giant gap in the road when asked how the dilapidated roads of Raccoon City are to drive on</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Must be time for the evening service.”</strong> – Leon as zombies approach a church in which Grace is hiding</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Let me guess, you’re the town lumberjack.”</strong> – Leon as a crazed chainsaw-wielding zombie approaches him</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Should’ve worn a helmet.”</strong> – Leon as someone falls off a road on a motorcycle</span></p>

 <p><span><strong>“I remember you…I remember that, too.”</strong> – Leon after being thrown against a wall by a familiar enemy</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Sorry, I was a little tied up.”</strong> – Leon after cutting rope tied around his wrists</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Sorry, but I’m not on the menu.”</strong> – Leon after blowing up a weird baby creature that kept trying to eat him</span></p> <p><span><strong>“I guess this is my stop.”</strong> – Leon after an old subway train collapses under him</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Feel like a million bucks.”</strong> – Leon, puking up blood</span></p> <p><span><strong>“I think I want a second opinion.”</strong> – Leon, as a zombified doctor murders a woman with a chainsaw</span></p>
