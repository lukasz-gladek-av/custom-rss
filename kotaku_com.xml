              <p>Docking stations are a great way to manage multiple devices on your desk without cord clutter. You plug everything into a single unit and keep it beside your monitor for easy access. But what if we told you there’s an even more efficient way of doing things?</p>
<p>Anker’s 675 USB-C Docking Station doubles as a monitor stand and lets you connect up to 12 devices at the same time! <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/">On a regular day, it would run you around $250, but all thanks to Black Friday, you can grab one for just $170 today.</a> That’s after a massive 32% discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy free shipping with your purchase, whether you’re a Prime member or not. The main sale event is technically over, and Cyber Monday is still a couple of days away. This lingering deal is a great way to save on an efficient charging solution if you missed grabbing it yesterday and can’t wait for Monday!</p>

<h2>Saves Space</h2>
<p>It looks like a regular monitor/laptop stand, even though it’s anything but that. You’re getting a bunch of ports on the side, including a 100W max USB-C upstream port, 3 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, SD/microSD card slots, a 4K HDMI port, a wireless charging pad, and an Ethernet port. That’s everything you need to connect all your essentials, plus a few extras, without feeling limited. Place your monitor on the top, and then add a keyboard, external storage, headphones, and more. The wireless charging pad makes it easy to top up your smartphone while you’re busy being productive. All of us have our phones on our workstations anyway, so it’s a great way to juice them up instead of letting them sit idle. The 100W max USB-C upstream port charges your laptop as you work, just as well. Note that the dock does not support display via any of the USB-C ports. You can only do that using the single HDMI port. It shouldn’t be a problem, though, unless you’re looking for a bigger, multi-monitor setup with three or four screens.</p>
<p>There’s some space under the dock that you can use to store your keyboard and mouse when not in use. Just push them under once you’re done working, and come back to a clean, tidy setup the next day. Raising your monitor to your eye level also promotes a better posture, as you can easily sit up straight instead of slouching.</p>



<p>Exceptional stability comes from an Aircraft-Grade aluminum alloy body with an anti-slip silicone strip for sturdiness. The curved edge design makes the overall look and feel premium. It’s built to blend into any workstation, from the most basic ones to those that have quite a lot going on in terms of personality. Getting started is straightforward, as just plugging your laptop in wakes your entire workstation up. The dock plays nicely with a wide range of laptops and monitors, including Dell XPS, Lenovo, iMac, MacBook, and more. OS-wise, it works well with Windows 10 and 11, plus macOS 10.14 and above.</p>
<p>The package comes with the docking station, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/"> The current deal brings the price down to just $170, which is basically nothing for the features it offers.</a> You’re saving a nice $80 on a solution that’s going to make your workstation much more efficient and a whole lot cleaner.</p>

              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Week are upon us. Now is the time to save big on tech stuff, home good, and everything else under the sun. Been thinking about upgrading your laptop? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Amazon is offering the Apple MacBook Pro at its lowest price yet, with a 16% discount that slashes $251 off the regular price, bringing it down to just $1,349</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this powerhouse laptop, there’s no better time to grab it.</p>
<p data-start="484" data-end="1070">This particular model is the 2025 version of the MacBook Pro, featuring Apple’s latest M5 chip, built to handle even the most demanding tasks. The M5 is equipped with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, delivering exceptional performance for everything from creative work to software development. The 16GB of memory and 512GB SSD ensure smooth multitasking and plenty of storage space for your files, apps, and media. This MacBook Pro can tackle everything from heavy video editing project to coding to everyday tasks.</p>

<h2 data-start="484" data-end="1070">Built for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p data-start="1072" data-end="1516">AI has taken over the zeitgeist so its unsurprising Apple’s marketing around the M5 chip is leading with the buzzword. It’s been engineered for what Apple calls “Apple Intelligence,” making it powerful enough for automatically compiling tons of code, responding to AI prompts, and generating images based solely on descriptions. Whether you engage with AI or now, the chip’s power still translates into faster performance and more efficiency, so you can get more done in less time.</p>
<p data-start="1518" data-end="1947">Battery life on the 2025 MacBook Pro is exceptional. Thanks to the M5 chip, you can expect up to 24 hours of continuous use on a single charge, which is an incredible improvement over Intel-based MacBook Pro models. In fact, this is up to 14 times longer battery life than previous Intel versions, allowing you to work, stream, and browse for hours without worrying about finding an outlet.</p>
<p data-start="1949" data-end="2358">The MacBook Pro’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina display is another highlight. The screen boasts an impressive 1,600 nits of brightness and supports a wide color gamut, delivering vibrant, true-to-life colors that will make all your photos, videos, and creative projects pop. The display’s able to render one billion colors, ensuring incredible detail and accuracy when watching a movie or editing photos.</p>


<p data-start="2360" data-end="2782">For those who rely on video calls—whether for work, school, or just catching up with loved ones—the MacBook Pro has some great little features . The built-in 12MP camera shoots in full 1080p HD, ensuring that you always look your best during meetings or virtual hangouts. The three-microphone array works alongside the six-speaker system to create an immersive sound experience, using spatial audio technology to ensure clear audio on both ends of the call.</p>
<p data-start="2784" data-end="3289">The camera also features Apple’s Center Stage, which uses AI to automatically adjust the camera’s angle as you move, ensuring you remain centered in the frame throughout video calls. No matter where you are in the room, Center Stage keeps you in view. This feature is compatible with pretty much all the popular video call apps like FaceTime and Zoom.</p>
<p data-start="3291" data-end="3572">This model is available in two elegant color options: space black and silver, so you can choose the one that best suits your style. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Both are on sale for Cyber Monday at its all-time low price of just $1,349.</a></p>

              <p>Since Black Friday Week started, Amazon has sold hundreds of thousands of Xbox controllers. Even though it’s now the weekend after Thanksgiving, there are still great deals on these gaming essentials but the problem is that a lot of the color options are already sold out. However, the famous <em>Carbon Black</em> version is still available this Saturday morning and is now at its lowest price ever: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">$39, down from its usual price of $64</a>. This is the <strong>2025 model with all the newest features</strong> and at this price, you’re getting Microsoft’s best controller for almost 40% less than what you’d normally pay.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play on Any Platforms</h2>
<p>The new Xbox wireless controller has some important improvements over older models. For example, it works with more than just traditional gaming setups as you can can<strong> connect this controller to your Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC, Android devices, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong> without wires using Bluetooth. You only need to buy one controller that works with all of your devices so you don’t have to switch between different peripherals for different platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft improved the ergonomics by adding a <strong>textured grip to the triggers, bumpers, and back case</strong>. This makes it easier to control the game for long periods of time. The hybrid D-pad has a faceted design that makes it easier to make both sweeping and exact directional inputs. This makes a big difference in fighting games and platformers where every input counts. The <strong>controller also has a dedicated Share button</strong> that lets you take screenshots and video clips without stopping the game which makes it easier to make content if you like streaming or just want to save special moments.</p>



<p>The included AA batteries last a long time and <strong>give you up to 40 hours of gameplay</strong>. If you want to use rechargeable batteries instead, you can switch to the Play and Charge Kit. You can now keep a stable connection up to 30 feet away from your device, which gives you more options for how to set up your gaming area. Dynamic latency input technology makes the time between pressing a button and an action on the screen shorter. This makes the game feel more responsive, which competitive gamers will love, but casual gamers will also benefit from it.</p>
<p>The Carbon Black color is the <strong>classic Xbox look that never goes out of style</strong>: It has a matte finish that doesn’t show fingerprints as easily as glossy finishes. The housing is sturdy and doesn’t flex or creak, and the buttons give satisfying feedback without being too loud. You can also use the Xbox Accessories app to change the buttons on your controller to fit your needs for certain games or accessibility, which is more customization than most third-party controllers offer.</p>
<p>For $39, you get the newest controller technology from Microsoft which is less than what last generation’s model usually costs. The price is at an all-time low, and the improvements coming in 2025 will make it even better.</p>
