              <p>Microsoft <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">cut the price of its 2025 Xbox wireless controller on Amazon to $38</a>, which is the lowest price ever for hardware that just came out. That’s a $26 discount off the $64 list price, and here’s the best part: it’s a lot cheaper than Sony’s DualSense (currently selling for $54, down from $74). Yes, these controllers were made for different consoles, but if you play games on your PC or on more than one device, this price makes the Xbox controller the clear choice. Just so you know, Amazon’s shipping estimates say that the package <strong>won’t arrive until after Christmas</strong>, so this is better for treating yourself than for giving as a last-minute gift.</p>

<h2>Important for More Than Just Gaming</h2>
<p>The 2025 Xbox controller has some smart changes that make long gaming sessions feel less like finger workouts and more like natural extensions of your hands. Microsoft changed the shape of the geometry by adding sculpted surfaces that fit your grip better which may seem like a small change, but after holding the thing for three hours straight during a marathon session, you’ll see how big of a difference it makes. The hybrid D-pad gives you choices based on the game you’re playing and it has the accuracy of separate buttons and the smooth motion of a disc-style pad. The triggers, bumpers, and back case now have textured grips on them, so your controller won’t turn into a bar of soap when your hands get sweaty during intense moments.</p>
<p>With two AA batteries, the battery life can last up to 40 hours so you can play for weeks without needing to change them. That’s a lot better than controllers with built-in rechargeable batteries that wear out over time and make you play while connected to a cable. You have to carry extra batteries, but honestly, it only takes five seconds to change AAs instead of waiting hours for a charge and if you don’t like disposable batteries, you can also get rechargeable AA packs.</p>



<p>The new Share button is easy to find on the controller face and lets you take screenshots and recordings without having to search through menus or remember button combinations. This feature works directly with Xbox’s capture system, which makes making content feel less like a chore and more like something you’ll actually use. Streaming to friends or social media becomes something that everyone can do, not just people who make content for a living.</p>



<p>You can connect to almost any device you own: Xbox Wireless technology works right away with Xbox Series X, Series S, and Xbox One consoles while <strong>Bluetooth works with Windows PCs, Android phones, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong>. The pairing button makes it easy to switch between devices in seconds, so you can go from playing games on your console to playing games on your phone without having to go through settings menus. The 3.5mm headset jack works with any wired headphones or gaming headset you already have, so you don’t have to deal with proprietary adapters.</p>
<p>The Xbox Accessories app lets you change the functions of buttons to fit your playstyle or meet your accessibility needs. Players of racing games can change the functions of the back buttons to work with paddle shifters, and players of fighting games can move the functions of the face buttons around to make combos faster. You can use the app on Xbox consoles and Windows PCs.</p>
<p>Here’s the truth: A brand-new 2025 controller with a 40-hour battery life, compatibility with all devices, and ergonomic improvements for $38 is a great deal. Third-party controllers that are similar often skimp on build quality or don’t have official firmware support. On the other hand, first-party controllers from competitors are usually between $50 and $70, even when they’re on sale.</p>

              <p>If a workstation refresh is what you’re after, Amazon is making the upgrade easy. The retailer is offering some great discounts on multiple tech gadgets, PCs, laptops, tablets, headphones, and more. Those looking to grab a mini PC should consider the Kamrui Hyper H2, which is currently sitting at $510.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">That’s after a nice 38% discount, but that’s not the only offer here</a>. Using the code <em><strong>JEG1HLJI7VJK</strong></em> at checkout can save you an additional 10%, which brings the total down even further. Moreover, shipping is free, so there are no extra charges to worry about. Just note the discount is listed as a limited-time one at Amazon, which means it’s likely going to wrap up soon. We suggest acting fast to grab it before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Small But Mighty</h2>
<p>This mini PC is compact; so much so that it fits in the palm of your hand. At just 5.04 x 5.04 x 1.63 inches, it’s a fraction of the size of a traditional desktop, which makes it easy to fit into a tighter space. In fact, it can even be mounted behind your PC or under the desk for a cleaner, minimal look.</p>
<p>Don’t let the size fool you, though. The PC packs a muscular, 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor, capable of hitting speeds up to 4.9GHz. It’s made for heavy-duty, resource-intensive tasks, and offers 25–40% higher performance than the R7-8745HS (8C/16T) and i7-1280P processors. The 13th Gen hybrid architecture here distributes workloads efficiently, which results in better response times and a smoother operation, regardless of the job at hand. Pair all this with the massive 32GB RAM, and you’ve got yourself a machine that can support all your multitasking needs. You will be able to use a bunch of programs at the same time, jump through a ton of tabs across multiple browsers, take conference calls, stream while gaming, and more; all without a hint of lag.</p>



<p>There’s a built-in 1TB SSD to help you store all your important data, from work documents, to media content, research papers, and even a few games, in a single place. SSDs are also much faster than their traditional counterparts, so you’ll enjoy better boot and transfer times just as well. Note that the memory and the storage capacities are expandable up to 64GB and 4TB, respectively. You can easily upgrade the system as your needs grow. Those who prefer working with a multi monitor setup will appreciate how the mini PC supports three-screen 4k displays with its HDMI, DP 1.4, and USB4 ports. The USB4 port delivers up to 40Gbps transfer speed, as well, plus provides 15W of power delivery to charge smaller devices or accessories. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, 2.5GbE LAN, and a range of additional ports to create a full-fledged productive setup.</p>
<p>But despite all the power, the PC keeps things quite calm and cool as it works. That’s thanks to an upgraded silent centrifugal fan, dual copper heat pipes, and a dual-fin module. The all-copper structure improves the overall thermal conductivity and increases airflow by 35%. Translation? Exceptional performance even when you’re juggling heavy creative workloads on a busy day.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to grab a power mini PC that offers strong performance but doesn’t break the bank, the Kamrui Hyper H2 mini gaming PC is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">Don’t forget to use the discounted code <strong><em>JEG1HLJI7VJK</em></strong> at checkout to maximize your savings!</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fifa-new-game-netflix-2026-world-cup-delphi-interactive-2000654568</link>
            <guid>1387081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>FIFA </em>is coming back as a Netflix exclusive. I mean, not really <em>FIFA</em> per se. That franchise is now called <em>EA Sports FC</em> after soccer’s international governing body failed to get EA to keep paying for the licensing rights. This new<em> FIFA</em>, which will only be playable on the Netflix app, will likely be something very different. FIFA and Netflix promise it’s coming next year in time for the 2026 World Cup, but as of right now it’s not even really clear who’s actually going to develop this new soccer game.</p> <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix">Yesterday’s press release</a> points to Delphi Interactive as the publisher and developer. It’s only real credit up to this point is getting the licensing rights to James Bond for IO Interactive’s upcoming <em>007 First Light</em> game. The Beverly Hills-based outfit bills itself as building “AAA games based on the most desirable IP franchises in the world,” but only has 14 people associated with the company on LinkedIn.</p>

 <p>One of those is CEO <span><span dir="ltr"></span></span></p>

 <p>So who at Delphi actually knows about games? Well, the company did hire <a href="https://www.nordiskgames.com/">Nordisk Games</a> founder Mikkel Weider, who Daugaard previously lauded for having “essentially blitz-scaled Nordisk Games from one employee to 1,300 in just a few years.” Is that what’s going on here? An army of hundreds of developers and outsource teams, working for years in complete secrecy on what FIFA hopes will be the most popular sim soccer game in the world?</p>

 <p>From the outside at least, Delphi Interactive appears to be a financial instrument for hashing out deals. What does it mean to be an AAA publisher with no obvious development experience?&nbsp;“In the era of digital game distribution, we believe that if you have access to a beloved global intellectual property, and you have access to capital to develop and market games, and you have access to the best independent development talent, you can actually make a successful AAA game outside of what we now lovingly refer to as the ’publisher industrial complex’ that has sort of traditionally oligopolized the AAA space,” Daugaard <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/delphi-interactive-nordisk-games-mikkel-weider-strictly-business-1236192058/">told <em>Variety</em></a> last year. So there’s that, I guess?</p>

 <p>One possibility is that Netflix, FIFA, and Delphi Interactive will outsource most of the actual making of this new game to studios abroad, likely in cheaper labor markets where armies of developers can brute-force something into existence in record time. Or maybe the plan is to take a soccer sim that’s already in existence and reskin it with FIFA logos and the likenesses of international stars. “Stay tuned for more details soon,” Daugaard wrote this week.</p>

 <p>It doesn’t help instill confidence that the other two groups involved don’t have great track records. After throwing itself into gaming, including trying to make its own internal blockbuster studio with seasoned industry talent, Netflix has retreated into simple party games and branded cash-ins of its popular streaming franchises. FIFA, meanwhile, remains one of the grimiest international operators out there. It recently invented a fake peace prize to appease President Donald Trump ahead of the World Cup. It’ll be much harder to fake an alternative to <em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p> <p>Delphi Interactive and FIFA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Goes Rogue on Amazon, This Laptop (i5, 512GB, DDR5, WiFi 6) Drops Nearly 80% Off]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-goes-rogue-on-amazon-this-laptop-i5-512gb-ddr5-wifi-6-drops-nearly-80-off-2000654514</link>
            <guid>1387036</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shopping for a laptop usually means choosing between your budget and your wish list, but sometimes the universe throws you a bone: This Lenovo <em>IdeaPad Slim 3</em> laptop (512GB, Intel i5, (8GB DDR5 RAM) just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/">dropped to $439 on Amazon, slashing over three-quarters off its $1,999 list price</a> in what’s an all-time low. Lenovo’s own website isn’t even close to matching this deal, which tells you everything about Amazon’s year-end clearance desperation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>This Year-End Surprise Brings Together Power and Portability</h2>
<p>The IdeaPad Slim 3 laptop has an Intel 13th Gen Core i5-13420H processor inside and this octa-core chip lets you do a lot of things at once. This processor has a hybrid architecture with four performance cores that can run at speeds of up to 4.6GHz and four efficiency cores that can run at speeds of up to 3.4GHz which means it can do anything from streaming video to working on spreadsheets without any problems. The 12MB cache lets the system handle multiple browser tabs, documents, and applications at the same time which makes it great for students who have to write research papers or professionals who have to manage several projects at once.</p>



<p>The 15.3-inch screen has a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200 pixels, which gives you a little more vertical space than regular Full HD screens which is useful when you’re scrolling through long documents or web pages. With 300 nits of brightness and an anti-glare coating, the IPS panel lets you work comfortably in a wide range of lighting conditions, from dark rooms to bright coffee shops. The 60Hz refresh rate works fine for everyday computing tasks, and the narrow bezels make the laptop feel more modern than its price would suggest.</p>



<p>The 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD provides a lot of space for documents, photos, and apps, and it also boots up quickly and lets you access files quickly. With this solid-state drive, you won’t have to wait for programs to start or files to save like you would with older laptops that had regular hard drives. If you ever need more storage space, the M.2 form factor makes it easy to upgrade in the future. This laptop has also <strong>two USB-A ports, one USB-C port with Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2 support, an HDMI 1.4 output, a headphone jack, and an SD card reader</strong>: This means it can connect to just about any device you might need it to.</p>
<p>This laptop is a great deal at $439, especially since you’re getting hardware that costs less than a quarter of what it was originally asking for. That $1,560 discount turns what would be a mid-range purchase into an amazing deal, especially for people who need a good Windows computer but don’t want to spend a lot of money.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-67w-3-port-usb-c-wall-charger-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-dumps-stock-at-record-low-for-year-end-2000654544</link>
            <guid>1386982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Carrying multiple chargers for your phone, laptop and tablet turns any bag into a tangled mess of cables and bulky adapters. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6487/">Anker’s Prime 67W charger just dropped to $37 on Amazon, slicing $12 off its $49 list price to hit an all-time low right before Christmas</a>. This <strong>three-port GaN charger</strong> replaces at least two or three separate adapters you’re probably lugging around right now, saving both money and precious bag space. Compared to buying three individual chargers that would easily cost $60 to $80 combined, this deal makes financial sense even before you factor in the convenience upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6487/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the size of charging bricks really does matter</h2>
<p>GaN technology makes this charger <strong>51% smaller than Apple’s original 67W MacBook adapter</strong> which means it fits in your pocket or bag without making a bulge. Silicon-based chargers make more heat and need bigger parts to safely handle high wattage. Gallium nitride, on the other hand, runs cooler and more efficiently in a smaller space. When you pack for a trip or commute, you’ll notice right away that this small brick takes up about the same amount of space as older 30W chargers, but it provides more than twice as much power. The <strong>foldable prongs</strong> make it even easier to carry around because they don’t get caught on things like fixed-prong adapters do.</p>



<p>You can charge three devices at once from one wall outlet <strong>with the two USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong>: This changes how you manage your devices in coffee shops, airports, and hotel rooms. You can charge your phone and connect your older wireless earbud case to your MacBook Pro through USB-C. All of these devices get power from a single small adapter. The charger gives out the full 67W when you connect just one device and it is enough to charge a 14-inch MacBook Pro from dead to 50% in about 30 minutes.</p>



<p>When you use both USB-C ports together or one USB-C port with the USB-A port, <strong>the dual-port charging can only give you 65W of power</strong>. This is still enough power for most real-world situations. You can charge a laptop at 45W and a phone at 20W at the same time, or you can split the power more evenly between the devices you’ve plugged in. The charger automatically negotiates power delivery based on what each device needs, so you don’t have to worry about which port does what or damaging your devices with the wrong voltages.</p>
<p>Anker’s ActiveShield 2.0 <strong>checks the temperature more than 3 million times a day</strong> and changes the power output to keep your devices from overheating or having electrical problems that could damage them. This protection system runs all the time in the background, checking voltage, current, and temperature thousands of times per second to find problems before they happen. You won’t even know it’s working, which is the point, because good safety features work without the user having to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Anker backs the Prime 67W with a 24-month warranty</strong> that covers defects and failures which means that if something goes wrong, you can actually get your money back instead of just paying for it. That warranty period is longer than what most of their competitors offer, which shows that the company thinks these chargers will last instead of being thrown away.</p>
<p>This is the math that counts: A three-port 67W charger for $37 is a lot better than buying separate adapters, and it makes your charging setup more organized by putting everything in one piece of hardware. A single-port 65W charger usually costs $30 to $40 on its own, and adding two more chargers for other devices would make the total cost well over $60. That $12 discount may not seem like much, but when you think about how much money you’ll save by not having to buy multiple chargers, this deal is a smart way to spend your money instead of an impulse buy.</p>

              <p>Back in November last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Tencent revealed a game called&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Light of Motiram</a>&nbsp;</em>that was almost comically obviously lifting its entire aesthetic from Sony’s&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> game series. At the time we suggested the game was obviously a lawsuit waiting to happen, and sure enough in July this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Sony announced it was suing Tencent</a> over the “slavish clone.” Now, it appears that case has been quietly settled behind the scenes.</p> <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement"><em>The Verge</em></a>, a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">court document</a> reveals that the case is over, all parties are paying their own costs, and—as so often seems to be the case—the settlement is “confidential.” Which is to say, we’ll never find out what was agreed, but can draw inference from the fact that the game’s Steam page remains deleted.</p>

 <p>At the time of the reveal,&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em> was hilariously obviously knocking off&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. Every detail of the promo shots could be mistaken for a new entry in Guerrilla Games’ series, from setting to player character to robo-animal creature design. Sony claimed in its lawsuit that the company had recently declined to collaborate with Tencent on a new&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> game, and soon after Tencent revealed their remarkably familiar game anyway.</p>

Developers Polaris Quest also had previously started removing the most overt images and language, trying to portray a far more generic-looking game. This was thought at the time to perhaps be an effort to convince Sony to settle, but perhaps was laying the groundwork for <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">Tencent’s attempt to have the case dismissed</a> on the basis that Sony couldn’t claim a “monopoly on genre conventions” from a “well-trodden corner of popular culture.”</p>

 <p>Jump forward to today, and it seems the two companies have agreed to stop fighting and play in their own sections of the yard. In a statement provided to&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>, Tencent said “SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter.”</p> <p>What this all means will perhaps become more clear if <em>Light of Motiram</em> restores its store pages or resumes updates. Its <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/index.html#index">website</a> still has links to the long-deleted Steam store page, but its various social media accounts and Discord haven’t been updated since March, notably months before Sony filed the suit.</p>

              <p>For better or worse, it seems like everybody’s got a vlog now. And, to put it politely, most of them aren’t exactly known for their production value. That’s an opportunity for you if you’re considering jumping into the vlogging universe, because content that shows up in Instagram Reels or TikTok or YouTube with a clear and steady picture and crisp sound is going to get and keep far more eyeballs than one that looks like it was shot with a camcorder from the ’90s.</p>
<p>The best way to make those professional-looking and sounding videos for posting online or just sharing with friends and family is to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6481/">grab this Amazon deal on the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 while it’s still at a very healthy 35% off.</a> The new $518 price is a steep drop of nearly $300, and it’s a total steal for a 4K video camera as compact, powerful, and easy to use as the Osmo Pocket 3.</p>

<h2>Smartphones Can’t Compete</h2>
<p>Even the newest and best smartphones from Samsung or Apple which are rightfully proud of their camera and microphone quality can’t hang with the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. The smartphones are multitasking marvels, but all of the tech muscle of the the Osmo Pocket 3 is devoted to creating the best videos possible, achieving 4K resolution at an awesome 120 frames per second while staying absolutely rock-solid steady and perfectly framed.</p>
<p>That stability should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the DJI brand, which made its initial big splash with its fleet of drones that shoot amazing video while flying at top speed. Those drone cameras are held steady by mechanical gimbals that automatically compensate for motion by moving the camera, and the Osmo Pocket 3 has the most updated version of that tech, with 3-axis gimbal mechanical stabilization that eliminate the shaky effect most handheld cameras produce.</p>



<h2>Always Ready</h2>
<p>The real draw of the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 is its size, or distinct lack thereof. It’s literally pocket-sized and exceptionally lightweight, so it’s easy to control with just one hand. The 2-inch video screen rotates for vertical and horizontal shooting, and with the superior stabilization, you can shoot action while you’re on the move and it will come out steady and shake-free — including high quality slo-mo. That includes livestreaming, which the Osmo Pocket 3 can do effortlessly on YouTube and RTMP platforms. DJI’s ActiveTrack 6.0 and Dynamic Framing features will keep you or whatever else you’re capturing firmly centered for the best quality.</p>
<p>You can jump to the head of the vlogging class quickly when you’re shooting with the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. If you’re not looking for the spotlight and just looking for an outstanding video camera to capture the great family moments, the Osmo Pocket 3 will create the best-quality home movies yet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6481/">At 35% off, Amazon’s deal offering the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 for just $518 is a huge bargain.</a></p>
