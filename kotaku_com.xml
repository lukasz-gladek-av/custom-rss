            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Monday, Hypixel announced that it was back from the dead and had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248"><span>acquired the rights to its canceled </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-like game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i></a><span> from Riot. The </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>company canceled the game and shut down the developer back in June, and now the band is getting back together, and fans who had been eagerly anticipating the game can look forward to an Early Access launch in the near future. Hypixel has released a lengthy gameplay trailer showing </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>in motion, and if you were looking for a more fast-paced, action-packed version of </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>looks like it might be just that.</span></p> <p><span>The game has a similar blocky art style that will look familiar to anyone who’s ever taken a trip to the Overworld, but the 16-minute gameplay trailer also features a lot of smooth, stylish combat. </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>lets you whack enemies around, too, but it can feel a bit stiff. Which is fine. The best parts of Mojang’s game are its crafting and building mechanics, which more than make up for its simplistic combat. </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, however, looks like it focuses on the inverse. A lot of what Hypixel shows off here is the player using a whole arsenal of weapons. At first, it’s giving </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls </span></i><span>melee combat, but then the game switches to third person, and you see that you have some additional mobility options that make it look a bit more free-flowing.</span></p>  <p><span>Hypixel says it wanted to release footage of the game in motion as quickly as possible to “break the curse” after disappearing for several months, so this is essentially a proof-of-life reveal while the team prepares for Early Access. There’s no set date yet, but the </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><span>blog post announcement</span></a><span> says that it will be revealed “in the coming days.”</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Drops to Almost Free Ahead of Black Friday, Early Shoppers Are Already Draining Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/snag-the-lego-thestral-family-set-for-just-49-after-a-30-discount-at-amazon-2000645216</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-harry-potter-thestral-drops-to-almost-free-ahead-of-black-friday-early-shoppers-are-already-draining-stock.1358128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Harry Potter introduced us to a whole bunch of cool (and scary) creatures, but few are as quietly haunting as the Thestrals. In fact, these bat-winged creatures are only visible to those who have witnessed or processed death. And now, thanks to LEGO, you can bring a pair home – that too for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5694/">The Thestral Family set usually retails for $70, but we just spotted it for 30% off on Amazon, which drops the price to just $49</a>. It makes a great holiday gift for the Potterhead in your life, or even a fun treat for yourself if you’re looking to bring key elements of the Wizarding World home. Just note that Amazon has listed it as a limited-time markdown, which is why we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly. The sale is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5694/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>This set is designed for ages 10 and up. You get a total of 548 pieces, which come together to build two posable Thestrals (one adult and one baby), plus a mini Forbidden Forest tree. With under 550 pieces, it won’t exactly be a large project you need to dedicate your entire weekend to, but also not too short.</p>
<p>The attention to detail is impressive on the creatures with striking skeletal forms and distinctive bat-like features. The adult Thestral stands over 9.5 inches tall, and even both come with fabric wings that fold out for flight poses. The head, legs, and wings are articulated, meaning kids can adjust them according to the scene they are trying to recreate. Maybe fold out the wings when it’s roaming through the Forbidden Forest casually, or keep them up when it senses a threat nearby!</p>



<p>Speaking of the Forbidden Forest, the small tree adds to the atmosphere, pulling the set together nicely. Like all LEGO sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, but if you also have the option to install the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. It lets you zoom in on each step, see it from all angles, track your progress, and more.</p>
<p>All things considered, this set can be a great holiday gift for a Harry Potter fan in your life, and you can even get it for yourself. Just be sure to grab it up before the sale expires.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-clears-its-macbook-air-m4-to-new-all-time-low-now-officially-2x-cheaper-than-macbook-pro-2000645418</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-clears-its-macbook-air-m4-to-new-all-time-low-now-officially-2x-cheaper-than-macbook-pro.1358125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple doesn’t do Black Friday promotions, at least on its official website. It prefers to keep prices premium while offloading inventory quietly through Amazon during big sales events. That way, the company preserves its brand image and still moves units at competitive prices via third-party retailers. For Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">the 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage drops down to $749 on Amazon from its usual list price of $999</a>, an all-time low. That pricing makes the Air officially half the cost of the base MacBook Pro at $1,599 and creates a value gap which is impossible to ignore.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Performance Without the Pro Price Tag</h2>
<p>The M4 chip brings Apple’s recent silicon architecture to the Air lineup and delivers performance that rivals many Pro models. An eight-core CPU tackles multiple browser tabs and video calls simultaneously without the lag that plagues older Intel-based laptops. The ten-core GPU pushes enough power for casual gaming, 4K video editing in Final Cut Pro and 3D modeling in lighter applications like SketchUp. <strong>Apple Intelligence features run entirely on-device through the Neural Engine</strong> and it processes requests locally rather than sending data to cloud servers for privacy-conscious computing.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is double what Apple was offering in base configurations just two years ago and finally provides some headroom for professional workflows without forcing upgrades that can get very costly. The unified architecture allows CPU and GPU to share this pool of memory dynamically and allocates resources where they’re needed, rather than partitioning the RAM into separate zones.</p>



<p>The<strong> Liquid Retina display measures 13.6 inches, with a resolution of 2560 by 1664 pixels</strong> and up to 500 nits of brightness. That makes text and colors sharp enough for both content creation and consumption. True Tone automatically adjusts white balance according to ambient lighting to reduce eye strain during long work sessions. The screen supports P3 wide color gamut for displaying more saturated colors compared to standard sRGB panels, which makes photo editing and design work quite accurate.</p>
<p>This 256GB SSD has enough storage for operating system files, essential applications, and a working library of current projects, although creative professionals accumulating large photo or video libraries will want more external storage. Apple’s SSD delivers sequential read speeds of over 2000MB/s, launching applications and opening files almost instantly under heavy workloads that keep laptops responsive. The speed difference between SSDs and traditional hard drives is still dramatic, eliminating much waiting that used to characterize older laptops.</p>



<p>Going easier,<strong> it lasts up to 18 hours on light tasks like surfing the web</strong> or working in documents – a full workday plus evening use without having to hunt for chargers. It’s about 15 hours of video playback which should get you through the longest cross-country flights with runtime to spare. The fanless design ensures it runs silent no matter your workload, pulling off what Windows ultraportables promise but seldom deliver without thermal throttling or whine.</p>
<p>You’re getting M4 performance, 16GB of memory, Apple Intelligence integration, and that <strong>build quality that keeps MacBooks functional for 6-plus years for $749</strong>. That’s half of what the entry MacBook Pro costs, despite minimal real-world performance differences for the average user.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-cinematic-short-bungie-ai-plagiarism-2000645435</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/director-of-marathon%E2%80%98s-incredible-cinematic-short-can%E2%80%99t-believe-some-people-are-calling-it-ai-slop.1358068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whatever your feelings about <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935">Bungie, the state of<em> Destiny 2</em>, or the promise of <em>Marathon</em></a>, the cinematic short created to reveal the studio’s upcoming extraction shooter earlier this year was one of the coolest introductions to a video game world I’ve ever seen. It also looked like the complete antithesis of cheaply and amorphously generated slop, so I didn’t expect to see its director, Alberto Mielgo, recently try to defend it against accusations of being made with AI.</p> <p>“I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI,” the <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> art director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&amp;img_index=11">wrote</a> on Instagram on November 17. “HELLO. Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with huge team — 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months…Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940">The cinematic short</a> combines CGI, live-action footage, and <em>Marathon</em>‘s broader design language to convey a sci-fi short story about mercenary runners pillaging an alien planet who slowly lose themselves, their memories, and their humanity as they are cloned over and over again to serve their megacorp sponsors. It prompted some fans to dream of a version of <em>Marathon</em> that married that worldbuilding to a completely single-player, story-driven campaign.</p>   <p>“I truly love this little film,” Mielgo wrote on Instagram. “Many of you ask me what my opinion on AI is… Honestly, I have no idea. But one thing is certain: AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced. (This text was kindly edited with ChatGPT).”</p>

 <p>It’s not entirely clear where the allegations of the short being made with AI first sprang from. Were they serious critiques or simply online passersby assuming that it could only look so good and otherworldly with the help of AI, because increasingly that’s what the rest of the internet’s algorithms are teaching them?</p>

 <p>Mielgo also weighed in on <em>Marathon</em>‘s brief plagiarism controversy earlier this year in which <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">graphics lifted from another artist</a> online made it into marketing footage and playable builds of the game. Bungie apologized and promised a thorough review of what went wrong in its pipeline, but it left some wondering where the theft ended and <em>Marathon</em>‘s exciting aesthetic began, though it was also clear at the time that part of the backlash was coming from bad-faith critics looking for something else to pile on Bungie about.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Marathon</em> plagiarism controversy was ‘blown out of proportion’</h2> <p>“But you know what I hate the most?” Mielgo wrote in what now appear to be deleted comments, according <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">to<em> The Game Post</em></a>. “Working our asses off for years to create something cool, only for it to get eclipsed by sphincter smelly press and headline readers.”</p>

 <p>He continued, hitting back at people who didn’t believe him in the comments, “It&nbsp;was genuinely a mistake, blown out of proportion by people like you and hungry sphincter press. Regardless, to your pseudowistle, none of the text/fonts ever reached our team. The Bungie team is fantastic, and the work they did before us was f****ng outstanding. I loved working with them.”</p> <p><em>Marathon</em> was supposed to already be out but got delayed following negative feedback during an alpha test earlier this year. The team’s been making lots of changes to the game in the interim, including the highly requested addition of proximity chat. Sony says the game will release before April 2026. Hopefully, people take whatever gets released on its own terms rather than letting it be overshadowed by all of the other baggage swirling around its development.</p>
