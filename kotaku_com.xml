              <p><span>Someone over at Game Freak knows the gays are watching. The </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>series has become increasingly inclusive and queer-coded over the years, with this trend most visible in character design. There are a lot of hotties, of course, but there‚Äôs also a throughline of queer aesthetics for both trainers and their monsters that has shown up in recent games, especially since the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fairy-queer-lgbtqia-sylveon-pride-trans-flag-1850577955"><span>Fairy type</span></a><span> was introduced in Generation VI. So I have to believe that someone at Game Freak knew the toxic yuri shippers would latch onto Lebanne and Jacinthe, two of the strongest trainers in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The player first comes into contact with these two women </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><span>after a run-in</span></a><span> with members of the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, a group of snobby, elite competitive trainers who have never been told ‚Äúno‚Äù in their lives. Jacinthe, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>‚Äôs resident fairy-type expert, is a rich socialite who runs the SBC, and Lebanne is her personal maid. At least, that‚Äôs how it appears on the surface. In some of the early interactions with Jacinthe, Lebanne tries to warn the player of what will happen if they cross her. When she does this, her typically calm, collected demeanor changes to one of near-feral panic, but our heroes pay this no mind until it‚Äôs too late. After Team MZ blows off a tournament Jacinthe has organized, she traps them in a manufactured battle zone outside their home base and forces you to battle her lackeys, including Lebanne.</span></p>

 <p><span>When the dragon-type trainer finally enters the ring, she lets loose. All her poise goes out the window, and she reveals her true self: an angry, pent-up rage machine who commands some of the most vicious Pok√©mon in Lumiose City. This all juxtaposed against her keeping the maid outfit on while no longer maintaining the facade of being Jacinthe‚Äôs mild-mannered housekeeper. After you take her down, she levels with you. She wasn‚Äôt always waiting hand and foot on Jacinthe. Back in the day, Lebanne was a ‚Äúfighter‚Äù who only sought to fight ‚Äúthe strongest opponents‚Äù she and her dragon Pok√©mon could find. But two years ago, Jacinthe‚Äôs fairy-type Pok√©mon ‚Äútotally annihilated‚Äù her, and now she‚Äôs subjected to this daily humiliation ritual of pretending to be what Jacinthe wants her to be. It‚Äôs toxic as fuck‚Ä¶but the fanfiction writes itself.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">becoming a disposable henchwoman as punishment for losing a single fight,,, multiple years in a humiliating maid outfit; forced to bend to her every whim‚Ä¶ overwrought retribution for overconfidence,, im losing my mind‚Ä¶.. <a href="https://t.co/dE5RfOXTsk">https://t.co/dE5RfOXTsk</a></p> <p>‚Äî Tabitha ‚ú® (@_kikimari_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_kikimari_/status/1980002971275407548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Obsessed with these two <a href="https://t.co/zVuq3fK3MF">pic.twitter.com/zVuq3fK3MF</a></p> <p>‚Äî Ghost üëª (@Ghostblobbu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostblobbu/status/1979984586357825627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lebanne and Jacinthe yuri</p> <p>pokemon za spoilers this really happens after you beat the game three times blindfolded <a href="https://t.co/jfedPkboRY">pic.twitter.com/jfedPkboRY</a></p> <p>‚Äî Percy (@keyblot) <a href="https://twitter.com/keyblot/status/1980298162134003733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">))))<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemonlegendsza?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemonlegendsza</a> <a href="https://t.co/CVSPT2B6Pv">pic.twitter.com/CVSPT2B6Pv</a></p> <p>‚Äî Tuif (@Tuiffff) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tuiffff/status/1980719747626070449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haven't even played this game but I know yuri when I see it and Jacinthe and Lebanne feel real familiar‚Ä¶<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/KsCQ3eUI0H">pic.twitter.com/KsCQ3eUI0H</a></p> <p>‚Äî Kori.‚òæ || Garofano CEO (@Korichi_Celeste) <a href="https://twitter.com/Korichi_Celeste/status/1980446851368473007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">jacinthe + lebanne <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemonlegendsza?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemonlegendsza</a> <a href="https://t.co/4iwyQ7qaIQ">pic.twitter.com/4iwyQ7qaIQ</a></p> <p>‚Äî yawn‚Ä¶ (@yawntchi) <a href="https://twitter.com/yawntchi/status/1980932939430125871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Doodles of Lesbianne.

            <title><![CDATA[Game Pass Might Be Hitting Its Best 31-Day Stretch Of Releases Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-october-november-2025-powerwash-sim-2-2000638198</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-might-be-hitting-its-best-31-day-stretch-of-releases-ever.1331713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game Pass‚Äô history is full of peaks and valleys. That‚Äôs the nature of a subscription-based service, and also one of the challenges Microsoft has struggled to overcome as it seeks to grow that part of its gaming empire. But right now? October 2025 heading into November 2025? This is arguably the service‚Äôs hottest stretch ever. The big question, of course, is whether this will prove to be another anomalous blip in Game Pass‚Äô chaotic and ever pricier trajectory, or a sign Microsoft has finally purchased enough of the wider gaming industry to combat churn and fuel the service for years to come.</p> <p>The month-long period is question began on October 17 with the launch of <em>Keeper</em>, the first new Double Fine game in four years. It‚Äôs a beautiful, evocative, and weirdly clever puzzle adventure that echoes back to the Xbox Live Arcade days of <em>Limbo</em> and <em>Fez</em>. It concludes on November 17 with the launch of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which is likely to be the antithesis of <em>Keeper</em> in every way, including that it will probably go on to be the best-selling game of 2025.</p>

 <p>Within that 31-day window is a truckload of other day-and-date releases available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or its cheaper PC equivalent. Here‚Äôs every <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/22/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-2/">day-one game</a> coming over the next few weeks:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Keeper ‚Äì </em></strong><em>October 17</em></li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em></strong><em>‚Äì October 21</em></li> <li><em><strong>PowerWash Simulator 2 </strong></em>‚Äì October 23</li> <li><strong><em>Bounty Star</em></strong><em>‚Äì October 23</em></li> <li><strong><em>Super Fantasy Kingdom</em></strong> <em> ‚Äì </em>October 24</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> ‚Äì October 29</li> <li><strong><em>Football Manager 26</em></strong> ‚Äì November 4</li> <li><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></strong> ‚Äì November 17</li> </ul> <p>Most of these games haven‚Äôt come out yet so I have no idea if they will live up to the hype or actually be good. But many of them are also known quantities. <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>? I think I know what to expect. Will any of them be GOTY contenders? Maybe! But I wouldn‚Äôt bet my Game Pass allowance on it. They will probably deliver most of what players expect and make up the critical mass of remaining big console releases heading into the holiday.</p>

 <p>Don‚Äôt forget, we were also supposed to get <em>Moonlighter&nbsp;2: The Endless Vault</em> on Game Pass this week before it was delayed just out of the 31-day window to November 19 because there were just too many games coming out in October. Look further outside that period and you have great day-one games like <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Ball x Pit</em>. Look beyond the day-one criteria and you have the upcoming addition of <em>1000xRESIS</em>T, one of last year‚Äôs most mind-bending sci-fi interactive narratives, on November 4.</p>

 <p>Look, if Obsidian somehow totally flubs the quest design and character choices in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> or the latest <em>Call of Duty</em> single-player campaign crashes and burns, this period probably won‚Äôt go down as the strongest stretch in Game Pass‚Äô history. But it‚Äôll still be close. Microsoft usually tries to sprinkle its bigger day-one releases throughout the year. See the staggered cadence of<em>&nbsp;Starfield</em> and <em>Forza Motorsport</em> in 2023 and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> in 2024. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôre supposed to do it anyway. But the first half of 2025 also bucked this trend.</p>

 <p>Maybe the only other single-month stretch of Game Pass that can rival it was back in the spring. The end of April added <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, followed by <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> and<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em> in the first half of May. Microsoft brought <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> back to Game Pass during that period, too, just for good measure. Will the service stay in this high gear going into 2026 or was Microsoft just shoving a bunch of stuff out the door in advance of the biggest single price hike in subscription gaming history?</p> <p>The company has been claiming for years that it‚Äôs finally about to turn the corner on its uneven development timelines and shifting release calendars. Will that change the service‚Äôs stalling fortunes or convince console gamers that $360 a year for a buffet of rentals is a price worth paying? Who knows. But it‚Äôs probably the best the service has ever been. Maybe as good as it will ever be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2006‚Äôs <i>Scarface: The World is Yours</i> is back! Well, maybe. It‚Äôs complicated. Possibly illegal. See, the <i>Vice City</i>-lookin‚Äô open-world action-adventure game for PS2, Xbox, and Wii recently resurfaced on Steam and the Epic Games Store. That‚Äôs (possibly) good news if you like diving into some gaming deep tracks from the early 21st Century. But it‚Äôs bad news if you‚Äôre the rights holder to this game because you didn‚Äôt give anyone permission to do this.</p> <p>Arriving on Steam and EGS, the loose adaptation of the legendary gangster film is back courtesy of a publisher named EC Digital Entertainment, who promises some graphical upgrades to the 2006 game (yes, they‚Äôre ‚ÄúAI-assisted‚Äù). But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scarface-pc-re-release-unintentionally-pushed-live-early-on-epic-with-steam-to-follow-but-i-may-smell-a-rat">as <i>Rock Paper Shotgun </i>documents</a>, EC Digital Entertainment doesn‚Äôt have much of a history. Based in Hong Kong, their website is blocked for whatever reason, and their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ecdeasia/featured">YouTube page</a> is filled with so many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">tumbleweeds</a> it‚Äôs giving me <i>Arc Raiders</i> PTSD flashbacks. What‚Äôs more, this version of <i>Scarface</i> includes some QoL mods baked in <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823">without permission from its creators</a>, one of whom is clearly stating ‚Äúthe holder of the <i>Scarface </i>license wasn‚Äôt willing to re-release the game.‚Äù So how did this happen?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This release reportedly ships SilentPatch and Fusion Fix, and none of us were contacted about this in advance (which isn't necessary as per the license, but would be nice).</p> <p>I KNOW that the holder of the Scarface license wasn't willing to re-release the game, so this is suspect. <a href="https://t.co/eDCWkKys4p">https://t.co/eDCWkKys4p</a></p> <p>‚Äî Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>We love a mystery.</p> <p>As flummoxed as any of us by this strange news, the creator of <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/">SilentPatch</a> dug in a bit more to <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980979864707719465">find out that the author</a> of one of the included mods was contacted. However, they also found that the ‚ÄúMovie IP rights holder appears to be unaware [of the Steam and EGS listing]‚Äù and that the store pages launched prematurely.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's what I found out so far:<br>* TAG (Fusion Fix author) WAS contacted, they were unable to reach me because of a lost Discord friend invite (despite my e-mail being public)<br>* Movie IP rights holder appears to be unaware of this<br>* Store listings were put early in error</p> <p>Oh boy. <a href="https://t.co/1aaYiyOD2A">https://t.co/1aaYiyOD2A</a></p> <p>‚Äî Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1980979864707719465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Weird stuff for sure. You can buy the EGS version right now, though the Steam listing still says ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù</p> <p>As for the game itself, I faintly remember seeing the box art on store shelves back in the 2000s and at the time thought, ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I just play <i>GTA</i>?‚Äù Al Pacino lent his likeness and personally chose his voice replacement for Tony Montana, but a few other actors from the movie did reprise their roles. Critical reception of the game was mostly positive, hovering around 7‚Äôs out of 10‚Äôs, with the occasional 6 and one 4.5 out of 10 from <i>Official Xbox Magazine</i>. Sequels and a PSP and Xbox 360 version were planned, but later scrapped.</p> <p>I like seeing old games, possible hidden gems, return from eons past. But it sounds like this rerelease of <i>Scarface</i> might be best avoided for now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-dumps-the-1000xm4-at-50-off-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-or-bose-2000638177</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-dumps-the-1000xm4-at-50-off-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-or-bose.1331653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones typically demand $400 or more, and Apple‚Äôs AirPods Max is sitting at $549. Sony just quietly <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">dropped the WH-1000XM4 to an all-time low of $198 on Amazon (down from $348)</a>, which makes these legendary headphones <strong>roughly three times cheaper than AirPods Max</strong> and significantly less expensive than current Bose or Sonos models.</p>
<p>Sure, Sony released the newer 1000XM6 but the upgrades are incremental at best, and this model cost more than double what you‚Äôll pay for the XM4 right now. For daily commuting, office work or travel, the 1000XM4 delivers the same core noise-canceling technology that made Sony‚Äôs 1000X series the benchmark everyone else tries to match.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the XM4 Still Competes with Newer Models</h2>
<p>Dual noise sensor technology <strong>employs external and internal microphones on each earcup to pick up and eliminate ambient noise</strong> with surprising accuracy. External mics pick up external noise such as airplane engines, traffic, or air-conditioning systems, and internal mics are listening for what actually ends up in your ear and make adjustments on the fly. This dual-pronged attack creates an area of silence that‚Äôs truly impressive, eliminating low-rumble growl of engine noise and higher-pitched chatter of nearby conversations. <strong>Noise cancellation of the XM4 stays on par with the XM5 and XM6 in practical application</strong>, where the variance is slight enough most people would only pick up on the difference by direct comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 30 hours with noise cancellation active</strong>&nbsp;which covers multiple cross-country flights or weeks of daily commuting before you need to recharge. Quick charging adds another convenience layer: a 10-minute charge via the included USB-C cable delivers five hours of playback, so even if you forget to charge them overnight, a quick top-up during breakfast gets you through the day. <strong>This battery performance beats AirPods Max</strong>&nbsp;which manage around 20 hours and lack any fast-charging capability.</p>



<p><em>Speak-to-Chat</em> is one of those features where you think it‚Äôs just gimmicky until you actually use it every day. The <strong>headphones sense you beginning to speak and instantly mute your music</strong> and lower noise cancellation so you can hear the person on the other end perfectly. Once you‚Äôve finished speaking, music plays again instantly once silence has lasted for some seconds. This comes in super handy for short conversations with baristas, coworkers visiting your desk, or your family questioning you, so you don‚Äôt have to physically mute and take off your headphones to have short conversations.</p>



<p>Excellent call quality results <strong>from five integrated microphones and sophisticated audio signal processing</strong> that separates your voice from noise. Those on the receiving end of calls are able to hear you naturally even where the situation is noisy, e.g., on busy roads or windy situations. Beamforming technology in the microphone array zeroes in on your voice and mutes the noise, and this is key where you are working from home or where you take your calls while commuting.</p>
<p>Multipoint connection <strong>allows you to pair the XM4s with two devices at once</strong> so you can be connected to your laptop to get your job done and your phone so you can take calls. Audio seamlessly switches to whatever device actually has content playing, so the phone call cuts your laptop music without you having to switch it by hand. This ends the constant dance of re-pairing your single-connection headphones have to go through every time you switch between devices.</p>
<p>At $198, the <strong>1000XM4 represents roughly 36% of the price you pay for AirPods Max</strong> but provides the same or superior noise cancellation, increased battery life, and additional features.</p>

              <p>Missing a package delivery because you didn‚Äôt hear the doorbell or weren‚Äôt sure if someone actually rang feels frustrating, especially when you‚Äôve been waiting days for that shipment. The Ring battery doorbell <em>Plus</em> solves this by giving you real-time alerts, two-way communication with visitors and a full head-to-toe video view of whoever‚Äôs standing at your door ‚Äì all accessible from your phone no matter where you are. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/">just slashed it to an all-time low of $79 (down from $149), making this one of the most affordable ways to add smart home security</a> to your front entrance.</p>

<h2>Why Video From Head-to-Toe Really Matters</h2>
<p>The wider-angle view through the Ring <em>Plus</em> doorbell captures visitors from the head down to the heel, rather than cutting them off at chest level, like most standard doorbells. That makes all the difference when delivery personnel deposit packages at your feet and go or when you‚Äôll be able to determine whether someone‚Äôs holding something. <strong>HD+ video resolution gives you higher definition than standard HD</strong> so you‚Äôll be better able to distinguish faces, read package labeling, or make out identifying characteristics on cars parked nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Color night vision</strong> eliminates the guesswork of nighttime visitors. Old-time infrared night vision provides you with grayscale video, making it harder to distinguish clothing colors, type of vehicle, or other details useful for identification. Color night vision performs better under ambient light and amplifies what light you have, providing usable color video even where the light gets low.</p>



<p>Motion detection triggers alerts the moment someone enters your field of view of your doorbell camera so you have early notification even before they press the button. You have the ability to block off some of the zones within the camera view, like your neighbor‚Äôs window or the busy sidewalk, so you only get alerts of motions you actually are interested in.</p>
<p>The Quick Release Battery Pack makes recharging simple: You remove the battery,<strong> charge indoors through the normal USB cable and click the battery back into place without removing the whole doorbell</strong>. This setup eclipses hardwired doorbells where your current doorbell cabling is poor or doesn‚Äôt exist, and eliminates the requirement to call an electrician to install the doorbell. <strong>Recharge time covers several weeks to months</strong>, dependent on the level of use, and some owners have a second battery kept charged so they can switch immediately without downtime.</p>



<p>Installation involves setting up the doorbell to your door frame or wall by using the hardware provided and plugging it into your WiFi through the Ring application. <strong>Installation typically takes 15-30 minutes</strong> or so for the average person, and you won‚Äôt require any special equipment aside from the use of a screwdriver.</p>
<p>With two-way audio, you can speak to delivery people, say to visitors you‚Äôll be there in just a minute or deter suspicious individuals without having to open your door. The quality of the speaker and microphone is good enough for average conversation, and the lag between someone speaking and you hearing it is negligible. Your real-time communication makes the doorbell system an intercom system you can use anywhere you have internet access.</p>
<p>At $79, the Ring doorbell <em>Plus</em> is cheaper than most of the bare-bones doorbells available without any smart features whatsoever.</p>
