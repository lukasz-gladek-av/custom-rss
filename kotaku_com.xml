              <p>Power outages, camping trips or simply wanting energy independence at home all share one common need: reliable portable power that doesn’t tie you to the grid. The Jackery Explorer 1000 solves this problem beautifully and right now Amazon is offering an incredible deal that changes the game entirely: The power station normally retails for $799 on its own, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4930/">Amazon has slashed it down to $699 and is throwing in two 100W solar panels completely free</a>. That <strong>bundle would typically cost you $1,299, meaning you’re saving a massive $600 on this package</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4930/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Is This Generation Station Different From Others?</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 represents a major upgrade from Jackery previous products: LiFePO4 battery chemistry on this item produces <strong>4,000 charge cycles and yet delivers 70% of original capacity</strong>&nbsp;or roughly 10 years of typical use. Compare this to previous lithium-ion products, which eventually start to fade even after 500 to 800 cycles, and you’ll understand why this style of battery chemistry is rapidly becoming the industry standard for heavy-duty portable power use. That long life translates to your purchase today still keeping your gear powered 10 years later.</p>
<p>The 1,070Wh capacity provides you with extensive runtime on multiple devices: You’ll be able to power a full-size refrigerator for approximately 10 hours, charge a laptop approximately 10 times or power a portable AC unit for several hours through a hot summer power outage. The <strong>unit supplies clean 1,500W of uninterruptible AC power continuously</strong> through three pure sine wave outlets, and <strong>3,000W of surge to power appliances</strong> and devices with high startup surges like power tools or air compressor appliances. Pure sine wave output is essential because it emulates the power you get from your household outlet, and it prevents the damage of computer equipment and new appliances.</p>



<p>The charge rate on this unit is absolutely stellar: Plug into any standard household outlet and you’ll be <strong>topped off 100% within the hou</strong>r thanks to the advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology. That’s 7.5 times the charge rate of the original Explorer 1000 (v1) model and makes all the difference should you need to recharge rapidly between uses. Two 100W included solar panels recharge the unit 100% within 6 to 8 hours of favorable sunlight, giving you 100% fully off-grid power generation. These collapsible panels are compact and lightweight enough to bring along on any adventure and rugged enough to handle the elements.</p>
<p>Port selection keeps all your current charging demands met, thanks to <strong>three AC plugs, two 100W USB-C ports for fast laptop and tablet charging, one USB-A, and 12V auto port for accessories</strong>. That 100W USB-C outlet is strong enough to charge through a MacBook Pro full speed without the use of any of those big power adapters. You’ll be<strong> able to charge six gadgets all at once</strong>&nbsp;and this makes it ideal for camping excursions with the family or even as an emergency power hub.</p>



<p><strong>Weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>, this power station remains light even though it packs a big punch. Its ergonomic handle ensures it can be conveniently moved from your automobile to your campsite or down the storm cellar. Its compact size won’t hog your valuable trunk space on long car rides or dominate your storage closet inside the house.</p>
<p>At $699 with two solar panels included, you’re getting emergency preparedness, camping power and energy independence for less than many standalone power stations cost without any solar capability.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-droideka-model-is-selling-for-pennies-star-wars-droid-figure-has-never-been-this-cheap-2000638337</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever watched Star Wars and found yourself mesmerized by those rolling, shield-generating battle droids that gave the Jedi such a hard time, you’re definitely not alone. The <strong>Droideka</strong> has always been one of the most visually striking droids in the entire saga with its menacing tripod stance and devastating firepower.</p>
<p>Now LEGO brings this iconic destroyer droid to life in a way that lets you display it proudly on your desk or shelf. And here’s the kicker: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4929/">this premium collectible is currently down to just $48 on Amazon, slashed from its original $64 price tag</a>. This is the first time this set has gone on sale since its release, and with a stellar 4.9 out of 5 star rating, it might run out of stock quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4929/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why should you pay attention to this Droideka?</h2>
<p>The LEGO Star Wars Droideka brings interactivity to your collection with <strong>movable arms that replicate the realistic shooting motion</strong> these droids are famous for in <em>The Phantom Menace </em>and<em> The Clone Wars</em>. You can pose it in full attack mode, arms extended and ready to unleash a barrage of blaster fire or you can fold it into its iconic ball configuration for that classic rolling transport mode.</p>



<p>The construction of the build itself is very rewarding for the adult constructor looking for something interesting but not intimidating. Articulation points are well-crafted and provide solid movement within the arm joints without the flimsiness or looseness. You are able to remove and reattach the legs easily which makes the wheel transformation seamless and natural.</p>
<p>Apart from the actual main Droideka model, the set comes with thoughtful additional pieces to make it go beyond just an ordinary build and become an actual display item. You receive your<strong> own exclusive stand</strong> along with an information plaque to provide context of the Droideka within Star Wars history. You also get a <strong>special Lego Star Wars 25th-anniversary brick</strong> to commemorate a quarter century of the popular sets. For good measure, the set even comes with your own buildable, but smaller, Droideka model to sit atop the display stand.</p>



<p>The color scheme remains true to the original with metallic and bronze shades that evoke the threatening demeanor of these war droids. They are proportioned just right too, the tapered shield generators and signature head shape instantly recognizable to any Star Wars buff. That attention to detail makes it ideal for display with your other Star Wars collectibles or even just as a display item that’ll spark conversations.</p>
<p>At this lower price, you are getting wonderful value for the upscale LEGO set designed specifically for adult fans. That original price of $64 was already quite reasonable for the number of pieces and quality of display, but at $48, this is the absolute bargain for any Star Wars fans.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nfl-ravens-baltimore-losing-record-coaches-took-video-games-away-2000638322</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <a href="https://defector.com/why-your-team-sucks-2025-baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> haven’t had a great season so far in the NFL. Their current record is an abysmal 1-5, tied for the team’s worst in 30 years. And a new report claims the team’s coach, John Harbaugh, is understandably not happy about this and has removed many fun items from the locker room, including the team’s video games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/10/20/whats-wrong-with-the-baltimore-ravens/">On October 20, <em>The Baltimore Sun</em></a> reported that after going 1-3 and a player posting a photo of them playing games to social media, team officials and Harbaugh removed several “recreational staples” from the Ravens’ locker room. These included a basketball hoop, a ping pong table, a few corn hole boards, and some “video game consoles.”</p>

 <p>The report doesn’t specify which consoles, but it does mention that the team often played “intense rounds” of<em> Super Smash Bros</em>, so I’d assume some Switch or Switch 2 systems were removed. The outlet also says that these <em>Super Smash</em> sessions drew “small crowds of teammates late in the day.”</p> <p>Ravens players told <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> that the football team’s coaching staff wanted to “remove distractions” and help players focus more on playing, practicing, and, I assume, eventually winning. This isn’t the first time the team has done this, either. In past seasons when the team struggled to win, so-called “locker room freedoms” and benefits were scaled back or removed entirely. For players who need a break from having to focus and work all day, that can be tough. After all the fun toys and consoles were removed, the team lost two more games.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-server-slam-embark-studios-ferro-2000638324</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-thank-you/">a blog post</a> thanking everyone who participated in last weekend’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">super fun Server Slam</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ developer Embark Studios commented on a few topics of note, three of which address some changes the team is making in light of the experiences folks shared online.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>Those who played during the Server Slam and previous technical tests have raised a number of questions and concerns, mostly over the fine edges of what is shaping up to be one of the best and most approachable extraction shooter experiences yet. So let’s get into some of what Embark is looking to fix, and some fun data points from the test over the weekend.</p>

 <h2>Flying Arc are getting a gentle nerf</h2> <p>Let’s jump straight into the most consequential change Embark is looking to make for launch: The flying Arc drones are too damn perceptive. While many people, including myself, felt that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oarm5m/please_dont_nerf_the_arc/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">dealing with our robot overlords</a> above Speranza was appropriately challenging, those damn drones were quick to find and harass enemy players. Embark is changing that. In the post the studio said:</p>

 <p>It turns out their <b>awareness was a bit too high</b>, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we’ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</p> <p>As a multiplayer game, I’ve no doubt this isn’t the end of difficulty tweaks for <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But preserving the tension and difficulty of the game is important. I mean, Leapers need to be able to scare the shit out of us, as one does to some hapless players in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa6sr6/mistakes_were_made/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">this absolutely hilarious clip</a>.</p>

    <p>That said, diminishing just how quickly a drone can catch sight of you sounds like a reasonable adjustment.</p>

   <h2>Fairness adjustments</h2> <p>Embark is also making it a little tougher to get into the Dam Control Tower on the Dam Battlegrounds map. Seeing so many players easily access it during the Server Slam “was fun to watch,” the post says, “but [it’s] a bit too accessible for a key loot location. That’s been fixed to keep the challenge sharp.” That <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1odcjy5/good_or_bad_change/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sounds like a wise change</a>.</p>

 <p>On a similar topic, it will be interesting to observe how the devs respond to the various ways players end up using in-game gadgets. There’s a fine line between an OP tactic and, well, griefing. While it doesn’t sound like there were too many abusive uses of gear during the Server Slam, one technique comes to mind as a possible indicator of things that might become controversial: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1obv44e/barricading_the_tower_zipline/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Placing a barricade in front of a zipline</a>.</p>

    <p>There are plenty of vertical and horizontal ziplines all over the map, and if you place a barricade in front of one, it blocks an approaching player with sometimes hilarious results; watch the video above to see a downed player get stuck at the top of the barricade. I’ve seen other players just fall to their deaths with this. Is it fair? Is it ripe for toxic abuse? The devs will no doubt have a lot of interesting decisions to make in the future.</p> <h2>Addressing the “graphical downgrade”</h2> <p>Though it may have been the first time for some, the Server Slam wasn’t the first chance folks had gotten to play <i>Arc Raiders</i>. There have been two previous technical tests and during those, it seems the game had some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oagvwj/dear_embark_please_explain_or_undo_this_graphical/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">more visual spectacle</a>, a discrepancy some players noted.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ocnp9m/devs_respond_to_graphics_downgrade_just_make_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Embark has replied</a> to this concern, stating that it had “done optimization to ensure higher and more stable framerates on low and mid spec hardware.” As someone with a temperamental PC, I really appreciated how smooth the game ran. But the game does <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ociyyf/dear_embark_studios_please_dont_forget_players/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">look notably fancier in previous builds</a>. Embark says it will try to find the “right balance” to this discrepancy. And players have another concern regarding the graphics: Foliage.</p>

 <p>On lower graphical settings, the dense bushes that are perfect for hiding just vanish. It brings up a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1odehgm/petition_to_remove_low_foliagegraphics_settings/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">serious concern about fairness</a>. If I can just turn my graphics settings to low, then I can see anyone hiding in the bushes. It’s an odd situation in which having a lower-end machine could mean an advantage over someone cranking their RTX 5090.</p> <h2>800k ducks and everyone’s favorite single-shot menace of a rifle</h2> <p>Embark shared a number of fun stats from the Server Slam, including which Arc was deadliest (obviously it was the Rocketeer. Somehow, though, ya’ll took down 77 Queens. I only faced it once, and that was because some genius in my party said “Let’s go take the Harvester!” and I couldn’t muster an “Are you nuts?” in response.</p>

 <p>That “77” number is put into perspective when you realize that collectively, we destroyed 58 million other machines. Yeah.</p>  <p>Also, the Ferro, the game’s single-shot gun that melts shields, was the most-crafted weapon and it sounds like rubber ducks were among the most commonly found treasures in the Rust Belt.</p>   <p>Honestly, I can’t wait for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ release. One more week, ya’ll. Drink some water and spend time with your loved ones while you still can.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ghost Of Yotei Seems To Have Sold Just Fine Despite Reactionary Boycott]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-september-2025-sales-borderlands-4-final-fantasy-tactics-2000638319</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-seems-to-have-sold-just-fine-despite-reactionary-boycott.1332190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was the fourth best-selling game in the U.S. for September with just three days out on the market, according to the latest figures from Circana. Sony’s latest open-world blockbuster appears to be doing just fine despite an attempted boycott by online grifters and their followers.</p> <p>“With one week in market, the US sales performance of<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was basically flat to that of <em>Ghost of Tsushima,” </em>the research firm’s Mat Piscatella wrote on Bluesky. “It did great. <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> launched in July 2020 (if you’ll recall, stuff was happening at the time that significantly boosted gaming), and the PS4 installed base at the time was significantly higher than the PS5 is today. Like, anyone with ‘concern’ about this title should be looked at with a side eye.”</p>

 <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was behind <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>NBA 2K26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26</em>, which isn’t surprising considering those are multiplatform best-sellers and the samurai revenge tale remains exclusive to PS5 right now. Sales were still enough to make <em>Yotei</em> the 18th best-seller of the year so far by revenue and the second best-selling game on PlayStation during the period, just behind <em>NBA 2K26</em> but ahead of <em>Borderlands 4</em> which had two additional weeks on the market.</p>   <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> has been on the receiving end of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">slow-burn reactionary backlash</a> from online culture warriors ever since it revealed its protagonist was a woman named Atsu. She’s played by Erika Ishii who was attacked by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">usual suspects</a> for being queer and for posting about about defunding the police during the 2020 George Floyd protests. The flame war intensified after a Sucker Punch developer posted a joke about the Charlie Kirk assassination, with some calling for a boycott of <em>Yotei</em> even after the developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-sony-2000627290">was fired for the remark</a>.&nbsp;Boycott or no, it seems to have had little meaningful impact on <em>Yotei</em>‘s trajectory, at least at launch.</p>

 <h2>Is<em> Borderlands 4</em> still a sales juggernaut?</h2> <p>The September sales figures have some other interesting nuggets to chew on. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> posted some impressive Ws but with a few major caveats. It was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the month and instantly hit number three for the entire year, with 30 percent higher dollar sales at launch than <em>Borderlands 3</em>. But <em>Borderlands 3</em> was $60 instead of $70, didn’t have a Super Deluxe Edition selling for $130, and wasn’t initially available on Steam, where <em>Borderlands 4</em> appears to have sold a good portion of its copies.</p>

 <p>2K Games hasn’t released any official sales figures yet. <em>Borderlands 3</em> sold <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1kns4wo/borderlands_3_is_2ks_fastest_selling_title_with/">over 22 million copies and before that, <em>Borderlands 2</em> hit 30 million</a>. My guess is that<em> Borderlands 4</em>, a return to form hampered somewhat by PC issues at launch, ends up tracking somewhere in-between.</p>

 <p>In other news, the PS5 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x">already outsold</a> the entire PS3 generation in under five years. It has a couple of years left to beat the PS4 globally. I don’t think anyone’s ever beating the PS2. Not even the Nintendo Switch.</p> <p>But my favorite sales data point of all from last month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a>. It came in ninth overall, and second on Switch, which is extra impressive when you remember it’s selling for only $50. Square Enix hinted at <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">a possible sequel</a> if it does well enough, or at least more strategy RPGs. I’m buying everyone I know a copy for Christmas.</p>

              <p>Companions in the original <em>Outer Worlds</em> were kind of stiff. You could build up your relationships with them. They’d tell you when they were unhappy. But none of it ever led anywhere. They amounted to a fire-suppressing peanut gallery that helped you learn about and reflect on the world around you but little more. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will try to fix that. You still can’t romance companions in the sequel but at least they’ll try to kill you this time if you really piss them off.</p> <p>You’ll have six optional companions in Obsidian’s upcoming sci-fi RPG, many associated with particular in-game factions. Niles is an engineer from the Earth Directorate. Valerie is a robot from the same faction. Aza is a cultist from the Glorious Dawn. Inez is a field medic from Auntie’s Choice. Marisol is an assassin from the Order of the Ascendant. Finally there’s Tristan from the Protectorate who has a giant hammer. Hurt their friends or break their rules and they’ll turn on you.</p>

 <p>“One of the things that was really important is we wanted these characters to feel like they’re their own people,” design director Matt Singh said on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VLPpTh_v8&amp;t=827s">latest episode</a> of the Xbox Expansion Pass show (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/screw-up-too-hard-in-the-outer-worlds-2-and-your-companions-may-fight-you-to-the-death-because-obsidian-wanted-the-rpgs-cast-to-feel-like-theyre-their-own-people/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). “They have their own goals, their own motivations, and if the player’s aligning with them, that’s great. They’re going to be there for you. They’ll fight alongside you. But if you go against their interests, they’re going to have something to say about it. That might break out into a conflict, that might mean they leave you or you have to fight them to the death. But if you do build that relationship with them, they’ll be there for you in the end.”</p>

 <p>This sounds neat and builds off one of the most memorable moments from the original <em>Mass Effect</em> in which two of your squadmates clash, resulting in an unreconcilable showdown. Over a decade later I still remember what choice I made during that part of the game and why (fuck you, Ashley). I don’t expect <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> to rise to the same level since these confrontations don’t sound like pivotal scripted moments so much as procedural consequences.</p>

 <p>Singh also suggests you can sort of skate by the friction if you have a good enough relationship with the NPC. Something like, “Uh, sorry I wiped out your clan, remember that time I finished your second loyalty mission though?” I hope that’s not the case. I hope we have some real friends-to-enemies journeys out there in Halcyon this time around. One of my biggest complaints with party-based RPGs is that the people you’re with never seem to quite have a mind of their own outside of sassy retorts and disappointed scowls. It sounds like <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is trying to evolve the formula beyond that.</p> <p><b>“</b>We still wanted to make sure that the player has choice<span>—</span>meaningful choice—here,” Singh <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/18764-the-outer-worlds-2-interview-talking-role-playing-second-chances-with-obsidians-brandon-adler-matthew-singh">told <em>RPGSite</em> in another interview</a>. “Companions are completely optional. If you don’t want to engage with them, you don’t have to. But you can take them along and see how that changes your story. Same thing with factions, right? The factions are there. They have their goals. They have their motivations. You can try to side with them. You can try to bring them together. Or you can say, ‘F it. I’m going my way. I don’t care about you. We’re going to do it the way that I would like.’ We’re all trying to figure out how to give the player as much player agency as possible and respond to it in interesting ways.”</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has no business being as funny as it is. Whether I’m enjoying the absurdity of its main cast’s antics or passing by an NPC who says something so out of pocket I have to do a double take at their speech bubble, I’m getting plenty of chuckles out of my time in Lumiose City. The citizens of the Paris-inspired setting seem to be </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-secret-npc-dialogue-sinister/"><span>going through it</span></a><span>, and it means that you’ll find a lot of odd one-liners popping up as you run through the city.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There’s much to be said about whether or not Lumiose City feels “alive” in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>small map’s</span></a><span> lack of distinct districts and visual identity has come under fire since the RPG launched last week. Still, you can’t deny that its people have character. The main cast of Z-A Royale participants and members of Team MZ are some of the most memorable characters Game Freak has put in one of these games. While the nameless denizens of Lumiose City you encounter aren’t decked out in glitz and glamour like the members of the main cast, they make the most of their screentime, like that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/30/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-got-upstaged-by-a-swivel-eyed-extra"><span>one lady in the background of </span><i><span>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the brief quips you’ll see while running around actually drop surprisingly insightful tidbits, like revealing what’s happened to characters from </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. Others are just the ramblings of mad people at their wits’ end, who can’t be bothered to mask their discontent in front of a group of young adults tirelessly trying to save the city. Without further ado, here are some of the best, funniest, and most unsettling quotes I’ve seen both online and in my own playthrough.</span></p>

Even without proper voice acting, loads of personality comes through, as Game Freak makes the most of the tools at its disposal to bring that extra bit of humor and character to the world.
