Could it really have been that far off from releasing? Was it really going to cost that much to take it the rest of the way over the finish line? Answers to those questions may come in time, but some of those who worked on the game said it was shaping up to be something special.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“The game was gorgeous and expansive,” comic book writer Gail Simone <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GailSimone/status/1894548068336636025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GailSimone/status/1894548068336636025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently wrote</a></span> of the unreleased action-adventure game first announced back in 2021. “It was beautiful to look at. I am not going to give details for a number of reasons, but every effort was made to make this not just a great game, but a great WONDER WOMAN game. A showpiece epic.”</p><p>Simone is best known for her past runs on DC Comics<em> Secret Six</em>,<em> Birds of Prey</em>, <em>Batgirl</em>, and of course, <em>Wonder Woman</em>. She’s currently writing the latest <em>Uncanny X-Men</em> reboot and says she was doing long-term consulting on Monolith’s game, a dream come true in part because of how much she loved the studio’s <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-middle-earth-nemesis-system-patent-1851766437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-middle-earth-nemesis-system-patent-1851766437">known for their groundbreaking nemesis system</a></span>. </p><p>“Everyone who worked on it  brought their a-game,” Simone continued. She said the team was also dedicated to making sure <em>Wonder Woman</em> was lore accurate in every way. “I know there’s a lot of finger-pointing going on, but everyone I worked with from Monolith and WB both was enthusiastic and supportive. Everyone wanted to make the best game ever. Sometimes, you give your all and it doesn’t work out.”</p><p>One of the game’s developers was similarly optimistic in the Monolith Discord. “Don’t listen to anything anyone’s said about the project stalling or failing,” they wrote. “It was going to be absolutely killer.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-wonder-woman-hogwarts-legacy-game-thrones-1851757907?_gl=1*1nevm7h*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDU4MjA4My40NC4xLjE3NDA1ODM3MDAuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-wonder-woman-hogwarts-legacy-game-thrones-1851757907?_gl=1*1nevm7h*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDU4MjA4My40NC4xLjE3NDA1ODM3MDAuNjAuMC4w"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a></span> that the project underwent a reboot early last year, switched directors, and may have still be years away from shipping despite already costing $100 million. </p><p>“I know every dev will say this about something they worked on, but it was going to be amazing,” the developer told Monolith fans. “I am not allowed to say much but I can at least say that every single person was pouring their heart into it and it showed. Our narrative team had a fantastic and deeply meaningful story. Especially in these really difficult times, I felt the world really needed the story we were telling.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here, you’ll face off against a fearsome bear, meet a new NPC, and ultimately have a fresh conversation with the Voice you’ve been hearing in your head.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>During the end of your conversation, the Voice will attempt to make a deal with you. Whether you accept the Voice’s power in return for helping them or decline the offer is entirely up to you. However, if you want to know what you’re gaining or missing with your choice, here’s what you need to know:</p><figure id="" data-id="edebd3bdbc3cc3eb7e7723102485dd10" data-recommend-id="image://edebd3bdbc3cc3eb7e7723102485dd10" data-format="jpg" data-width="2832" data-height="1593" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The swirling blue lights that represent the Voice early in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The swirling blue lights that represent the Voice early in the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="edebd3bdbc3cc3eb7e7723102485dd10" data-recommend-id="image://edebd3bdbc3cc3eb7e7723102485dd10" data-format="jpg" data-width="2832" data-height="1593" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The swirling blue lights that represent the Voice early in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h338280"><a id=""></a><strong>Should you help the Voice in Message From Afar?</strong></h2><p>As you proceed through the conversation with the Voice during the end of the Message From Afar quest, you’ll eventually come to a crossroads. You’re presented with either saying “Yes” or “No” to the Voice’s offer, leaving you with an important choice to make.</p><p>Since there are many more interactions with this Voice as the game progresses, your choices at this point can have a big impact both on how the Voice thinks of you, and—perhaps more importantly—what you think of the Voice. There’s no wrong choice here, so the most important thing to do is go with your heart. You aren’t going to break the story whichever route you take.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>If you choose to help the Voice</strong>, you’ll receive the Dream Touch godlike ability. This active ability heals and revives all your allies while dealing damage over time to Delemgan, Dreamthralls, and Vessels in the area.</li><li><strong>If you choose not to help the Voice</strong>, your reward will be an ability point.</li></ul><p>Pragmatically, it seems reasonable to choose to help the Voice in this situation, as the Dream Touch godlike ability is immensely useful—perhaps much more so than a single ability point. It’s one of those skills you’ll grow to love as you play the game. But the choice is yours and yours alone, and you’ll be able to invest more in your own personal abilities if you reject the Voice’s offer. Either way, it’s an interesting path.</p><p>Whichever decision you make is permanent, but you’ll have plenty of other choices to make as you progress through <em>Avowed</em>—you haven’t lost opportunities to gain (or reject) more useful rewards later on.</p><hr><p><em>Avowed</em> is available now on Xbox Series X and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
