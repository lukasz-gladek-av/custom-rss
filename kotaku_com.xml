              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> launched back in May to positive reviews from fans and critics. But like with most Ubisoft games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-free-updates-assassins-creed-shadows-road-map-1851778558"><em>Shadows</em> has continued to be updated over time</a>. And tomorrow’s big 1.1.1 update is its biggest yet, making it the best time to return to the game’s gorgeous digital recreation of Japan.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv">On September 10, Ubisoft released the full patch notes for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> update 1.1.1</a>, which is arriving on all platforms on Thursday. This is a massive update. The big star of this new patch is that it adds support for the game’s first major DLC expansion: <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. This DLC is launching on September 16 and will be available to anyone who pre-ordered <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em> ahead of its launch earlier this year. It will also be sold separately. The upcoming expansion adds a whole new region to the already massive in-game world of <em>Shadows</em>, as well as around 10 hours of story content, missions, and activities.</p> <p><em>Claws of Awaji</em> adds a new weapon type for Naoe, one of the game’s two playable characters, to use: The fast and hard-hitting bo staff. But you don’t need to buy the DLC to get this new weapon. Ubisoft has changed plans and announced on Wednesday that all players will get access to a bo staff after completing a new free quest being added in update 1.1.1.</p>

 <p>“Originally developed exclusively for the <em>Claws of Awaji</em> expansion, we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone… for FREE,” explained Ubisoft in the patch notes post for 1.1.1. “You get a Bo! And you! And you at the back! Everyone gets a Bo, coming September 16<sup>th</sup>.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, update 1.1.1 also adds a ton of free stuff that will be available on September 11. For starters, Ubisoft is increasing the level cap (again) and now you’ll be able to level up to 100, letting players get even more powerful. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-no-animal-killing-zoo-1851781328">Your in-game hideout is also getting some new features and upgrades</a>. Here’s what Ubisoft had to say about the new hideout changes:</p> <blockquote><p>With the new update, each unique building now includes 2 additional upgrade levels, bringing a total of 20 new enhancements, alongside 3 new Hideout levels. These upgrades introduce valuable bonuses that accelerate Hideout growth, improve crafting capability by making Gold more accessible, and directly enhance Naoe, Yasuke, and their allies, making them more effective in both combat and exploration.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will also get two new gear levels: Mythic and Artifact. Ubisoft makes it sound like upgrading weapons and armor to these new levels will take some time, and that it’s mainly an option for players who are playing on new game+ and need extra help against the tougher enemies. Here are the full patch notes from Ubisoft, which are very long but include details on a lot of other neat changes, fixes, upgrades, and tweaks.</p>  <h2 id="QURESVRJT05BTCBISUdI">ADDITIONAL HIGHLIGHTS</h2> <h3 id="VW5jYXBwZWQgQ3V0c2Nl">Uncapped Cutscenes</h3> <p>Cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS (PC Only).</p> <h2 id="TElTVCBPRiBCVUcgRklY">LIST OF BUG FIXES</h2> <h3 id="R2VuZXJhbMKg">General</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue where the game crashed during the cutscene of the “Chained” rift.</li> <li>Fixed various localization issues.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the vertical sliding sound effect continued if you switched characters during a slide.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where some tutorials repeated themselves after unlocking Yasuke.</li> </ul> <h3 id="R2FtZXBsYXnCoMKg">Gameplay</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue where the Naginata Ronin were not vulnerable after using the Vault ability.</li> <li>Addressed an issue where the Scale of the Koi and Soaring Tatsu trinkets were not functioning as expected.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the aiming reticle option “Only While Aiming” was missing from the settings.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where a persistent “New Item” notification appeared after looting weapons from scout supply chests.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to start horse archery in Iga because the quest giver had moved locations.</li> <li>Fixed an issue Ikko Ikki Kamon banner was missing after completing the “Collection of Crests” quest.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the Mount Nukai contract targeted a chest that was already opened.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where multiple waypoints were not synchronizing.</li> </ul> <h3 id="RGlmZmljdWx0eSBPcHRp">Difficulty Options</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue on Nightmare difficulty where Teppo enemies appeared broken.</li> <li>Fixed an issue on Nightmare difficulty where the Samurai Spear Guard had a combat glitch.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where Canon Mode disabled itself on the second launch of the game.</li> </ul> <h3 id="SGlkZW91dMKg">Hideout</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue in the Hideout when selecting the option to duel with Naoe or Yasuke did nothing.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in the Hideout where certain buildings or set pieces could not be rotated.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in the Hideout that prevented players from moving the horse stables after changing their original location.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where Rufino remained stuck in the Hideout after being recruited.</li> </ul> <h3 id="U2tpbGxzLCBBYmlsaXRp">Skills, Abilities &amp; Upgrades</h3> <ul> <li>Addressed an issue where the Shadow Piercer ability was not functioning correctly.</li> <li>Addressed an issue where the 33% health recovery on posture attack perk was not functioning as expected.</li> </ul> <h3 id="VmlzdWFscyAmIEdyYXBo">Visuals &amp; Graphics</h3> <ul> <li>Fixed various visual issues.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue with the architect’s lip sync in the “Seta-Killers” quest.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue affecting Yasuke’s aim with the Teppo when wearing variations of the Samurai Hat.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue with the Ronin Kasa Hat.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue with the Blush of the Earth bow quiver.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue with Oni’s Flesh Armour.</li> <li>Fixed a visual issue where Gashadokuro’s mask did not have red eyes on the Memories screen.</li> </ul> <h2 id="U1BPSUxFUlMgV0FSTklO"><em>—SPOILERS WARNING!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fall is nearly here. People around my place are putting up Halloween decorations already. I’m leaving my windows open and going outside more. But I’ll try to stay in and enjoy some of the new games being added to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog this month, like <em>The Invincible </em>and <em>Persona 5 Tactica.</em></p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-wwe-2k25-persona-5-tactica-green-hell-fate-samurai-remnant-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On September 10, PlayStation officially announced</a> the next round of PS Plus Extra and Premium games that will be added to the subscription service’s game catalog. All of these newly revealed games will be available to start downloading and playing on September 16.</p> <p>I’m really happy to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em> on here. This indie lo-fi retro survival horror game</a> caught my attention last year when it launched, but I never got around to playing it because there were (and still are) too many damn games. That made me sad, but now that it’s waiting for me on my PS5 as we enter Spooky Season, I’m going to try and play it. Another horror game included here, <em>Conscript</em>, also seems like a perfect Halloween game. Heck, even<em> Legacy of Kain: Defiance, </em>this month’s classic game<em>,</em> has some creepy, gothic horror vibes, too.&nbsp; If PlayStation is giving out two horror games in September, I’m hopeful that next month’s offerings will include even more spooky titles!</p>

 <p>Remember, to access, download, and play these games, you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber. Essential tier subscribers don’t get access to the game catalog. And if your subscription runs out in the future, you’ll no longer be able to play these games.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s the full list of games being added to PS Plus and its various tiers next week:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>WWE 2K25</em> – PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Persona 5 Tactica </em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Green Hell&nbsp;</em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Fate/Samurai Remnant&nbsp;</em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Crow Country – </em>PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Invincible – </em>PS5</li> <li><em>Conscript –&nbsp;</em>PS5</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Plus Premium Only</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance –&nbsp;</em>PS5, PS4</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m always saying that Raichu, the evolution of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s mascot, is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>constant target of disrespect</span></a><span> from both The Pokémon Company and the community at large. Well, now some collectors with far more expendable cash than I’ll ever fathom are in a high-stakes bidding war to buy one of the electric mouse’s rarest cards. The fabled “Prerelease Raichu” card is up for auction, and the bids have already surpassed six figures.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000624736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624736"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624736">© Heritage Auctions</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For those that don’t know, the “Prerelease Raichu” card is the stuff of legend. According to reports dating back to the late ’90s, around 11 copies of the original Raichu card with “PRERELEASE” text stamped in the corner of the artwork were accidentally produced by Wizards of the Coast employees. These cards were mixed in with pre-release Clefable cards that were given out at events in the ’90s, and they were supposed to have been destroyed, though a few were supposedly saved by WOTC workers. Back in 2023, CGC Cards </span><a href="https://www.cgccards.com/news/article/12277/"><span>certified two of the Raichu cards</span></a><span>, confirming that they were indeed legitimate. Now, one of these legendary cards is up for auction on </span><a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-raichu-14-unlimited-base-set-prerelease-psa-trading-card-game-ex-mt-6-wizards-of-the-coast-1999-holo-rare/a/7424-36062.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515"><span>Heritage Auctions</span></a><span>, and as of this writing, its current bid is a whopping $135,000.</span></p> <p><span>It’s certainly not the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633"><span>most money anyone’s ever paid for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card</span></a><span>, but it is a pretty cool piece of history that probably should go somewhere other than a WOTC employee’s attic. As of right now, only a couple of these rare misprints are accounted for. It’s entirely possible some of these Raichu cards have been lost or destroyed in the past 25 years, but at least someone might be able to save and preserve one of them. Someone with more money than I’ll probably see in this lifetime. What do you think it’s like to be so rich you can just drop six figures on a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card? At least it’s being spent on my underappreciated favorite. $135,000 isn’t nearly enough for you, Raichu. Someone raise the bid. Put your money where your mouth is.</span></p>

              <p>After seven long years, <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> has finally left the realm of games we’re always hoping to see at some event or showcase. Silkpost no more. We can all finally play <i>Silksong–</i>and for just 20 bucks at that!</p> <p>With a few days of playtime under their belts, folks have flocked to the internet to opine, elating over finally getting to play such a long-awaited game, and despairing over a surprisingly steeper learning curve than some were expecting.</p> <p>So let’s turn our attention to the Steam reviews section of <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> to see how it’s faring with the chorus.</p> <p>At the time of writing, <i>Silksong</i> is enjoying a “Very Positive” status for its English-language reviews. Fans have rushed in to share their enthusiasm for the long-awaited game. Those who aren’t as excited, as you might expect, are frustrated with not merely the difficulty, but how various challenges seem to feel like unfair “gotcha” moments. Many positive reviews, however, echo back that the game is much more manageable once you get deeper into the story and have amassed some more powerful skills.</p> <p>So let’s jump into some standout reviews, both of the silly and (somewhat) useful kind.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000624693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624693"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624693">©
