<p><i>Overwatch 2</i> remains one of the most popular games in the multiplayer gaming arena due to its lovable roster of characters, strategic gameplay, and consistent updates that keep things feeling fresh for both new and returning players. And if you are brand new to the game or haven’t played in some time, you might be wondering what’s going on in this long-running hero shooter. So let’s get to everything you need to know about <i>Overwatch 2</i> in late summer, 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-going-on-with-the-current-season"></span>What’s going on with the current season?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Overwatch 2</i> is currently winding down on <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24216161/season-17-hits-with-a-midseason-surge">season 17</a> which saw some reworks to New Junk City and Suravasa, as well as a taste of what’s to come in season 18 with a preview of a new support hero, Wuyang. In fact, you can play as him right now, as his Hero Trial is expected to go until August 18.</p> <p>But Season 18 will arrive in full on August 26, and with it Wuyang will fully join the roster. Also, for the new season, Sojourn will get a new mythic hero skin. You can learn all about that from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBK1JI1Vjeg&amp;t=1814s">the dev livestream here</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dev Livestream: Season 18 Mythic Hero Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBK1JI1Vjeg?start=1814&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>We also know that Sojourn will be getting some new perks. The Deceleration Field, which will replace the Extended Mag, will see hit enemies slowed down by a quarter of their top speed. Sojourn’s Adhesive Siphon in favor of her new Friction Generators, which will give her as much as 50 energy while sliding. You can read more about these changes, as well as some updates to Juno in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24226732/weekly-recall-2-perks-2-furious">this official preview of season 18</a>.</p> <h2><span id="who-are-the-best-heroes-right-now"></span>Who are the best heroes right now?<span></span></h2> <p>While season 18 is likely to change things up, right now we’re seeing Orisa and Ramattra leading the pack when it comes to tanks, Tracer and Cassidy laying claim to the best DPS, and Baptiste and Kiriko dominating the support heroes.</p> <p>Of course, given the importance of great teamwork, it’s always hard to sus out which heroes are best at any given moment. So if you’ve been out of the loop for some time, it might be worth jumping back in with a main that feels familiar to you. And if you find they’re not up to snuff anymore, try out one of the ones we just mentioned.</p>

 <h2><span id="does-overwatch-2-have-crossplay-support"></span>Does <i>Overwatch 2</i> have crossplay support?<span></span></h2> <p>If you’re wanting to join up with friends on other platforms, I’ve got some good news for you: <b><i>Overwatch 2</i></b><b> features full crossplay support</b>. This means that you can team up with your friends across any platform by adding one another’s Battle.net accounts, which is a quick and easy process.</p> <p>The exception to this crossplay rule is Competitive matches, where console and PC players are separated due to the perceived edge of mouse and keyboard players. While this may disappoint more hardcore players looking to truly test their mettle, most folks should be happy having some casual fun in Quick Play, Arcade, and Custom Matches. That’s not so bad!</p>

 <h2><span id="does-overwatch-2-have-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Overwatch 2</i> have cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>The good news continues, as <b><i>Overwatch 2</i></b><b> also fully supports cross-progression</b>. With this feature, you can easily jump between different platforms while maintaining your account’s progress. So, if you’d like to play a few matches on PC before relaxing in bed with your Nintendo Switch 2, no one’s stopping you. All you need to do is ensure you’re signed into the same Battle.net account on each device, and you’re all set!</p> <hr> <p><i>Overwatch 2</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

<p>There are few games as well-known in the general population as <i>Fortnite</i>. Even your grandmother knows what it is because she’s bought your cousin $700 in V-Bucks over the past month so he can play as a hot dog or whatever. This beloved battle royale is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon, either. But maybe it’s been a little while since you’ve played or you’ve yet to jump out of your first party bus. Let’s get into what you need to know to get into <i>Fortnite</i> in 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-the-deal-with-the-current-season"></span>What’s the deal with the current season?<span></span></h2> <p>At the time of this writing, <i>Fortnite</i> is up to Chapter 6, Season 4, which went live on August 7, 2025 and it features new characters from <i>Halo</i> and <i>Power Rangers</i>. We can expect this season to take us into the Fall of this year before the new one arrives.</p> <p>The current season sees a bit of a pest-control problem on the island. Throughout the map you’ll find various gross nests, eggs, and the like. There are also three queen insects you’ll need to take down to earn yourself a mythic weapon. For full details on these pests and where on the map you can expect to find them, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/bad-bugs-bite-the-bullet-in-fortnite-battle-royale-shock-n-awesome?lang=en-US">check out the official blog post.</a></p>

 <h2><span id="what-are-the-best-guns-in-the-game-right-now"></span>What are the best guns in the game right now?<span></span></h2> <p>Right now, it’s looking like it’s SMG season, folks. The Veiled Precision SMG is arguably at the top of the pack when it comes to mowing down your opponents. That said, the Deadeye DMR is also a great pick for those who like to place their shots with more precision. And if you’re into looking weird while taking out multiple foes at once, give the Bug Blaster a shot.</p> <h2><span id="what-got-vaulted/unvaulted"></span>What got vaulted/unvaulted?<span></span></h2> <p>This season sees the following changes to the game’s arsenal, as<a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg/status/1953357145140809934"> per Osirion on X</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BR LOOT POOL UPDATES</p> <p>unvaulted/added:<br>– Hammer Assault Rifle<br>– O.X.R.

 <h2><span id="does-fortnite-have-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Fortnite</i> have cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>I’ve got some more good news for you: <b><i>Fortnite</i></b><b> features full cross-progression functionality</b>, too. This means that you can play on your account across any supported device that you own. Get a few dubs on PS5, Xbox, or PC, then take the game on the go using your Nintendo Switch 2. And if you don’t want to drag a dedicated portable gaming device with you, just break out your phone for a few mobile matches. Yes, it really is that seamless.</p> <p>In other words, anywhere you go, <i>Fortnite</i> is there. Watching. Waiting. Expecting you. Needing you. Feed it money. It’s hungry. You want that new skin.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> is the first 3D game in Nintendo’s ape-starring franchise since <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> way back in 1999, so expectations were high for the titular character’s newest outing. There’s a lot to love about this adventure, which sees Donkey Kong join up with a young Pauline as he punches, rolls, and slaps his way through open-ended levels filled with secrets and challenges. But how many hours will it take you to see everything? Let’s take a look at the length of the <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> campaign and what else there is to do beyond it.</p> <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>?</h2> <p>If you just want to punch your way through to the end of this DK expedition, <b>you can expect to spend around 10-15 hours beating the </b><b><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i></b><b> campaign</b>. This makes it a pretty beefy experience in an age where many 3D platformers come in at half that length or less. And that’s just for the base adventure! There’s still a ton of monkeying around to do beyond that.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-amiibo-letters-ball-outfit-1851786640">Here’s What Amiibos Can Do For You In <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i></a></p> <p><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>‘s world is immensely dense with extra things you can find to do beyond just reaching the end of its campaign. It is a 3D platformer, after all, so it wouldn’t be complete without a treasure trove of stuff to collect—though I hope that’s not bringing back any bad memories of <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> and its thousands of collectibles.</p>

 <p>You can opt to tackle finding everything in <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> during your initial playthrough, or you can dive back in after beating the main story. However you go about it, there’s a great time to be had tracking down all the Golden Bananas, Banandium Gems, music discs, and fossils in the game.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-co-op-support-gameshare-pauline-1851787349">Don’t Sleep On <i>Donkey Kong Banana</i>’s Co-Op Mode</a></p> <p>And while they’re all fun to find, definitely don’t pass up any opportunities to get fossils, even if you’re just trying to mainline the campaign. They’re cool because you can use them to unlock new outfits for DK and Pauline, which you can then mix and match to your fashion tastes. But more importantly, they often sport helpful passive bonuses like improved swimming speed or reduced damage from poison. Any bit of help you can get for survivability is a good thing, yeah?</p> <p>Whether you’re rushing through the campaign or trying to go for 100%, you can start bashing your way through <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> right away. The game is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>After the success of <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2</i> in 2020, it was only a matter of time before more of the famous skater’s beloved games got the remake treatment. After nearly five years, <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> has finally ollied onto the scene sporting a fresh coat of paint and a wide variety of enhancements to make it the best way to experience two skating classics.</p> <p>But if you have some friends who play their games on a different platform than you, you may be left wondering whether you can get into multiplayer matches with them in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i>. You might also be curious just how long these two games will last you. Let’s dive into everything you need to know about this classic skating experience.</p> <h2><span id="does-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3-+-4-support-crossplay"></span>Does <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> support crossplay?<span></span></h2> <p>If you’re hoping you can hop online and skate with friends who game on other platforms, well, you’re in luck! <b><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i></b><b> has full crossplay support across all platforms</b>. This means you can easily hop into multiplayer games with up to seven other players across all consoles and PC, opening up plenty of opportunities for grinding rails and popping tricks together.</p>

 <h2><span id="does-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3-+-4-support-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> support cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>While playing with anyone you want online is a huge win for virtual skaters everywhere, things don’t fare quite as well for cross-progression fans. <b><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i></b><b> does not support cross-progression at all</b>. As a result, any progress you make on one platform will not carry over to another, meaning you’ll need to start over entirely if you pick up the game on more than one device.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-skaters-are-in-the-games"></span>How many skaters are in the games?<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618079"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618079">© Screenshot: Iron Galaxy Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><i>THPS 3 + 4</i> will give you a total of 29 skaters to choose from, with a few hidden ones you can unlock as well.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Andrew Reynolds</li> <li aria-level="1">Aori Nishimura</li> <li aria-level="1">Aurélien Giraud</li> <li aria-level="1">Bob Burnquist</li> <li aria-level="1">Bucky Lasek</li> <li aria-level="1">Chad Muska</li> <li aria-level="1">Chloe Covell</li> <li aria-level="1">Elissa Steamer</li> <li aria-level="1">Eric Koston</li> <li aria-level="1">Geoff Rowley</li> <li aria-level="1">Jamie Foy</li> <li aria-level="1">Jamie Thomas</li> <li aria-level="1">Kareem Campbell</li> <li aria-level="1">Leo Baker</li> <li aria-level="1">Leticia Bufoni</li> <li aria-level="1">Lizzie Armanto</li> <li aria-level="1">Margielyn Didal</li> <li aria-level="1">Nora Vasconcellos</li> <li aria-level="1">Nyjah Huson</li> <li aria-level="1">Rayssa Leal</li> <li aria-level="1">Riley Hawk</li> <li aria-level="1">Rodney Mullen</li> <li aria-level="1">Rune Glifberg</li> <li aria-level="1">Shane O’Neill</li> <li aria-level="1">Steve Cabellero</li> <li aria-level="1">Tony Hawk</li> <li aria-level="1">Tyshawn Jones</li> <li aria-level="1">Yuto Horigome</li> <li aria-level="1">Zion Wright</li> </ul> <p>You can also unlock:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Andy Anderson</li> <li aria-level="1">Bam Margera</li> <li aria-level="1">Birdman</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-thps-3-4-officer-dick-unlock-panda-plush-locations-2000614519">Constable Richard (Officer Dick)</a></li> <li aria-level="1">Michelangelo</li> </ul> <p>The Doom Slayer and Revenant from the recent <i>Doom </i>games is also available via the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>

 <h2><span id="how-long-is-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3+4"></span>How long is <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836"><i>THPS 4 </i>doesn’t have a Career mode</a>, but you’ll still be able to complete certain goals on different parks like Foundry and Shipyard. In <i>THPS 3</i>, there are 9 parks to play on and 10 in <i>THPS 4.</i></p> <p>Each park has ten Standard goals and five Pro goals. It only takes about <b>4-5 hours</b> to complete all of the Standard goals.</p> <p>Once all the Standard goals have been completed, you’ll unlock Pro goals. Even after completing Pro goals, you’ll unlock Platinum goals. Each park has a single one and they usually involve pulling off a certain move somewhere in the park. These steps should take about another <b>5 hours.</b></p>

 <h2><span id="getting-100percent-in-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3+4"></span>Getting 100-percent in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618080" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618080"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618080">© Screenshot: Iron Galaxy Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>After completing all the Pro goals, you’ll unlock Solo Tour, and this is where the real time sink begins. There’s one trophy/achievement called Flying Solo. This requires you to beat the Solo Tour with <b>all 35 characters</b>. Yes, you’ll have to go through this mode at least 35 times. This is easily the most time-consuming part of the journey to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <p>But it’s important to note that you do not need to achieve 100% with every skater, which includes completing things like optional challenges. You only need to complete each skater’s unique career path to count towards Flying Solo.You do NOT need 100% with each skater. Just complete their unique career path once.</p>

 <p>Fortunately, there are no missable trophies/achievements so you can tackle them in any order you wish. There are also no difficulty-related ones, so you can customize the settings to your liking without having to worry. Overall, getting all of the trophies/achievements should take you between <b>25-35 hours.</b></p> <p>However, there are certain assist mods like Perfect Rail Balance and Instant Quick Recovery that can void trophies/achievements. There are two of them, which are “Extra Ball” and “Unprecedented.” Their descriptions specifically state that you cannot have assist mods activated..</p>

 <p><b>Extra Ball: </b>“Without Assist Mods, score 1,000,000 or over in Pinball.”<br> <b>Unprecedented:</b> “Without Assist Mods, earn a score of 10,000,000 in any park in a 2-minute session or single combo.”</p> <p>It seems like these two are the only ones impacted by assist mods, so you can turn them on when going for any other trophies/achievements. Good luck, and have fun!</p> <hr> <p>If you’re ready to team up with some pals and hit some skateparks and beyond in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i>, you can get started right away. The game is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>
