            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sometimes I discover a new game by looking at what’s trending on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3191050/">SteamDB</a>. That’s how I first learned about<em> BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT,</em> a game which I will now only refer to as <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> or <em>BDD3</em> to save us all a lot of time. Of course, the long and wild name caught my eye, but it also has a very high Steam review rating. So I paid $2 and checked it out, and folks, it’s a wild but oddly charming experience.</p> <p><em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> is best described as <a href="https://kotaku.com/more-tips-than-you-probably-need-for-the-quake-remaster-1847616427">a heavily modded and twisted version of <em>Quake</em>.</a> It uses that classic shooter’s engine as its foundation, as well as reskinned enemies and weapons from Id’s fantastic FPS. But while it plays a lot like that classic shooter, this definitely ain’t <em>Quake</em> anymore. At least, I don’t remember <em>Quake</em> containing so many hellish favela levels and evil soccer players.</p>  <p><em>BDD3 </em>plays, looks, and sounds like a retro fever dream, complete with loud, ear-piercing music, random sound effects, bizarre textures everywhere you look, and oddly shaped levels based on real-life locations, like a grocery store and a soccer stadium. Filling these levels are reskinned <em>Quake</em> enemies, now replaced with demonic soccer fans armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers. Oh, there are also demons and other monsters, too. I’m not sure if they like soccer. To rip through these enemies, you’ll use gold-plated handguns, assault rifles, dual shotguns, a simple sandal, a staff that shoots electrical beams, and other strange stuff I won’t spoil here. Every gun is very loud and feels like it would kill an elephant. And because this is the OG <em>Quake</em> engine, you move fast and hit hard, and it all runs perfectly on a modern, powerful PC. In other words, I had a blast playing <em>BDD3.</em></p>

 <p>As the game’s very long name suggests, <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> (loosely) tells the story of a person who, in trying to revive their favorite musician, accidentally opened a portal to hell and is now desperately fighting back against the demonic invaders while trying to close it and save the world. You know, that ol’ chestnut. Trying to follow the story is tricky, and&nbsp; I’m not even sure the game’s main developer is aiming to provide a coherent narrative. But whatever, the real appeal of <em>BDD3</em> is its fast-paced action and fever dream vibes. It’s the kind of game in which I was excited to play the next level just to see what nightmarish music or mess of textures awaited me.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628184">©Joeveno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, to <em>BDD3</em>‘s credit, while it might look like a giant mess of nonsense, there’s actually a well-made shooter under all that chaos. Levels are perfectly paced, providing you with a mixture of big fights and smaller encounters that tend to flow really well together. Though it may look slapdash, I think that aspect was carefully cultivated, and that a lot more thought than you might expect went into crafting every level.&nbsp; For example, each one is filled with strategically placed (and very odd-looking) quick save machines,&nbsp; so even less-experienced FPS players will have no trouble at all progressing.</p>

 <p>The other reason I’ve really enjoyed playing<em> Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> is that it’s quite a charming experience. It’s clear that the game’s lead developer, <a href="https://x.com/JoevenoYT">Joeveno</a>, is channeling his experience as a Brazilian gamer and developer to create something that, from the outside, might seem weird for weird’s sake. And to be sure, <a href="https://x.com/get_glizzy/status/1965638844910633266">if you listen to the dev talk about the game</a>, some of what’s in <em>BDD3</em> is just meant to be odd and make you laugh. But it’s also recreating the kind of bizarre <em>Quake</em> and <em>Doom</em> mods that used to be all over the internet back in the early 2000s, as well as the various foreign bootlegs of popular shooters that were passed around via forums or floppy disks long ago.</p> <p>On<em> Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em>‘s Steam page, Joeveno calls the trippy game a “Tribute to the Brazilian mods” and “bootleg games” from that era, and while I might not be as familiar with the source material as the dev is, I can still feel the passion and care that was put into nailing a very specific and chaotic vibe. <em>BDD3</em> won’t be for everyone, but for players looking for something different that is also well-made and fun, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3191050/BRAZILIAN_DRUG_DEALER_3_I_OPENED_A_PORTAL_TO_HELL_IN_THE_FAVELA_TRYING_TO_REVIVE_MIT_AIA_I_NEED_TO_CLOSE_IT/">I’d recommend spending $3 to check it out.</a> (The game’s price will jump to $5 on October 1.) And hey, at the very least, in the future, if someone says they own a game on Steam with a long name, you can make a bet with them that you know you’ll likely win.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Problem With Switch 2 Game Key Cards Isn’t Going Away]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Did Sega just completely change the spirit of <em>Yakuza 3</em> by recasting its lead in the remake? Does <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> really look prettier without fog? And when will Nintendo finally support smaller SD express card sizes and ditch those dreaded game key cards? It’s another edition of <em>Morning Checkpoint</em>, <em>Kotaku’</em>s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Fed chair Jerome Powell <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1970606369578590451">says tariffs aren’t driving up inflation just yet</a> as companies eat the cost of the new taxes. I guess he’s not trying to buy a new game console!</p> <h2>Game devs aren’t happy about Switch 2 game key cards either, apparently</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2025-09-24/T2T62TGP493K00?srnd=cojp-v2"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> some backroom grumblings ahead of Tokyo Game Show 2025 this week regarding the health of game development in Japan and also, interestingly enough, anecdotal frustration with Nintendo’s game key cards for the Switch 2. It also confirms that Nintendo currently only offers 64GB sizes for all games, which increases the cost and appears to be the primary reason so many third-party publishers are opting for the plastic DRM keys instead.</p> <p>It’s clear, however, that paying the higher cost of going physical on Switch 2 can pay dividends for some games. <em>Bloomberg</em> points to the recent example of <em>Daemon Ex Machina: Titanic Scion</em>. “In the UK, it was released as a standard physical cartridge, ready to play straight out of the box. According to Nielsen IQ, 72% of physical sales in the UK were for the Switch 2,” it reports. “In Japan, however, it was sold as a key card, and the results were reversed. According to<em> Famitsu,</em> only 40% of sales were for the Switch 2.”</p>

 <p>Nintendo recently surveyed fans about their feelings on game key cards, and at least some publishers say requiring downloads helps with performance for more taxing games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>.</p> <h2>A <em>Yakuza 3</em> remake and more are on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm watching the Kiwami 3 Summit but seeing the new Rikiya is pissin me off <a href="https://t.co/qDZE7covQn">pic.twitter.com/qDZE7covQn</a></p> <p>— Jtastic (@JtasticVA) <a href="https://twitter.com/JtasticVA/status/1970696209749746121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Announced during the Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit livestream, <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> will bring the last PS3-era entry in the series to modern platforms on February 12. It recasts a key character, Rikiya Shimabukuro, with the guy from <em>Tokyo Vice</em> (Sho Kasamatsu), however, and fans are not happy.</p>

 <p>It’ll come bundled with a new spin-off called <em>Yakuza 3 Gaiden: Dark Ties</em> that follows main villain Yoshitaka Mine. <em>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</em> and remakes of the first two games are also getting upgraded ports for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

 <h2>PlayStation will now make you work to unlock special merch</h2> <p>Sony unveiled <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-photo-mode-features-detailed-tips-guide/">Franchise Rewards</a> this week, a new program through which popping certain trophies in games will qualify you to pay the company money for select swag. It’s kicking off with a pin and T-shirt for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> that cost a combined $55.</p>

 <p>This will be familiar to <em>Destiny 2</em> fans since Bungie has been running this exact type of program, offering special swag to day-one raid players, for some time. The reason it works <em>there</em> is that it’s a limited-time group achievement. I’m confused as to why Sony seems to be having so much trouble figuring out cool rewards initiatives.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill f</em> players are already nuking the fog</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone already removed fog in Silent Hill F lol <a href="https://t.co/K6daHORlZ7">pic.twitter.com/K6daHORlZ7</a></p> <p>— Besk (@BeskInfinity) <a href="https://twitter.com/BeskInfinity/status/1970526109851648178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Konami’s latest survival horror game isn’t technically even out yet and it’s already getting the mod treatment. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-modders-add-ray-tracing-cheats-and-remove-the-hud-and-the-series-signature-fog-a-day-after-advanced-access-went-live-on-steam"><em>IGN</em> notes</a>, fans are already adding cheats and ray-tracing while erasing the HUD and any other immersion-breaking elements. Now if only they could mod in a proper PS5 Pro mode for the console version.</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>Team Ninja’s upcoming Soulslike is coming soon, according to a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026">leaked store page</a> on Amazon Japan. The PS5 console exclusive arrives February 6 (on PC too). In addition to its samurai combat, the sequel is adding a new ninja playstyle. Who’s ready for some “Soulsgaiden?”</p> <h2>Here are some <em>Mega Man</em> RPGs you probably never knew existed</h2>  <p>Was I alone in never having heard of the <em>Mega Man Star Force</em> trilogy before? They were spiritual successors to <em>Mega Man Battle Network</em> that came to the Nintendo DS in the second half of the aughts and were mostly panned by reviewers at the time for failing to change up the formula much. Capcom is clearly still riding the high of the <em>Battle Network</em> collection selling over 1 million copies, and I applaud the effort to bring lost niche games to modern platforms. I’m morbidly intrigued.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">The Switch 2 port of <em>Borderlands 4</em> was delayed at the last minute with no real explanation</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">DHS goons are using Ash Ketchum’s <em>Pokémon</em> anthem to promote fascism</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889">Hideo Kojima announced a bunch of things yesterday include a new credit card</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s almost as if Amazon knows you’re thinking about upgrading your older laptop for something newer, faster, and packed with more features than you thought possible. Why else would they offer this deal on the Dell 15 Inspiron touchscreen laptop in its most souped-up state — <strong>the max 64GB of RAM and 2 TB SSD, preloaded Windows 11 Pro, and a free accessory bundle worth $199?</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/">It lists for $2,400, but right now it’s just $900 dyring this killer 63% off limited-time deal.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Credit where credit is due, Amazon has been hard-selling this high-end Dell model lately, maybe because they know that a touchscreen laptop packed with as much RAM and SSD space as possible and driven by an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor (speeds up to 4.5GHz) and AMD Radeon graphics chip is a literal game-changer to anyone who’s been slogging through their work and play with an older, slower machine. Why else would they take a do-it-all machine like this and slash $1,500 from the price?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Machine, Premium Deal</h2>
<p>The top-of-the-line specs, preloaded Windows 11 Pro — including the AI wizardry of Microsoft Copilot — and compact profile and light weight of this Dell laptop virtually guarantees it would be a significant upgrade for pretty much anyone. (Other than the happy shoppers who have already cashed in on this deal.) It’s slim and lightweight enough to pop into a backpack or briefcase to take anywhere, and built sturdily so it won’t break down or fall apart during your road trips.</p>
<p>The touchscreen has all the responsiveness of a high-end tablet, but it’s also a full-HD screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and IPS technology for wide viewing angles. The energy efficient LED-backlit screen helps keep your power bills manageable, and the entire screen plus processor plus graphics card is the equation for awesome streaming on the Dell Inspiron 15. But if you insist on using the high-end visuals for work, there’s also an HD webcam and MaxxAudio Pro speaker for those unavoidable Zoom calls.</p>



<h2>No Upgrades Needed</h2>
<p>You won’t need to immediately drop more money on upgrading the OS of this Dell Inspiron 15, because Windows 11 Pro is already loaded and ready to go. Which also means Copilot AI is at your service. This AI assistant has gotten rave reviews for power, speed, and intuitiveness, and the Dell Inspiron 15 gives it more than enough processing power to do that research or write that email for you almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>We’ve been playing Whak-a-Mole with these massive PC laptop deals at Amazon — every time we think we’ve covered the last of them, two more pop up. But there’s on guarantee these will continue to drop like this, and this one that saves you $1,500 off the price of a brand-new Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop and free accessories bundle valued at $200 isn’t going to get beat anytime soon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/">Head to Amazon now and make the upgrade that puts a powerful touchscreen PC laptop in your hands and a pile of money back in your pocket.</a></p>
