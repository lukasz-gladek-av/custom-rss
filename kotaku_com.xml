            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest PlayStation Showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-date-time-where-to-watch-2000627924">is later today</a>. Will it deliver or are Sony fans destined to wander the PS5 generation with big first-party announcements remaining few and far between? The Tokyo Game Show 2025-adjacent State of Play could deliver major updates on any number of highly anticipated games, including what’s next on Sony’s first-party docket for 2026. Is it finally time to see what Insomniac Games has been cooking with <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em>?</p> <p>The September State of Play livestream begins at 5:00 p.m. ET and will stream, per usual, on YouTube and Twitch. It has a “mercifully” concise runtime of just 35 minutes, with at least some of that devoted to Housemarque’s upcoming sci-fi shooter roguelike <em>Saros</em>. That suggests it could be on deck for the first half of next year, exactly five years after the launch of<em> Returnal</em>, a development cadence that a lot of PlayStation studios are hitting this generation.</p>  <p>But what about the rest of the 2026 release slate for the PS5? Leaks <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-showcase-state-play-tgs-2025-ff7-remake-part-3-2000626000">earlier this month</a> suggested that a new trailer for <em>Wolverine</em>, first seen back at a September 2021 Sony showcase, was ready for primetime and likely to air during the company’s next event. A build was leaked in the malicious hack back in 2023 and the game’s creative director left the studio last year. Outside of that, we still know hardly anything about how it will play or what <em>X-Men</em> stories it will weave into its campaign.</p>

 <p>On the third-party front, there’s a rumor that our next look at<em> Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> could be at the showcase to confirm a potential 2026 release window. We also know that Square Enix doesn’t have its own livestream booked for TGS, suggesting updates on <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, <em>Dragon Quest 12</em>, or <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part III</em> could come during Sony’s showcase. It would be great to finally be able to put the rumors about the<em> Final Fantasy 9</em> remake to bed one way or the other as well.</p>

 <p>One game that seemingly won’t be at the showcase is Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/09/23/bungies-marathon-not-at-sonys-new-state-of-play-next-look-months-away/"><em>Forbes</em>‘ Paul Tassi reports</a> that an expected update on when the extraction shooter will launch won’t be part of the event. “The earliest we will see something more from <em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is November. And that’s a ‘maybe,’ right now,” he writes. The game has been going through some last-minute reworks after feedback from an alpha earlier this year and a scandal over plagiarized art soon after.</p> <p>Sony previously said it was still expecting the extraction loot shooter to hit before the end of March 2026. Given the wretched state of <em>Destiny 2</em> this summer, there couldn’t be more riding on it for the company’s live-service legacy and, more importantly, Bungie’s future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security posted a <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">gross video of ICE making multiple arrests</a> set to the original <em>Poké</em><em>mon&nbsp;</em>anime’s theme song, as well as using interstitial cuts of the show and displaying mock-ups of trading cards for several of the individuals arrested. After millions of people saw the video and called on Nintendo or The Pokémon Company to pursue legal action, the company has issued a statement to <em>Kotaku.</em></p> <p>“We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand,” the statement reads. “Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gotta Catch ‘Em All. <a href="https://t.co/qCvflkJGmB">pic.twitter.com/qCvflkJGmB</a></p> <p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The statement stops short of mentioning whether the company plans to take any further action. Doug McGowan, <em>Pokemon</em>‘s ex-legal chief, told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">IGN</a>&nbsp;</em>that if he were still working with the company, he “wouldn’t touch this” case for a few reasons.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t see them doing anything about this for a few reasons,” McGowan told <em>IGN</em>. “First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]’s name in the press,” McGowan told <em>IGN</em>. “They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn’t touch this, and I’m the most trigger-happy [Chief Legal Officer] I’ve ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s probably the safer course of action, but it’s certainly not the more principled one considering The Pokémon Company has pursued legal action for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-mobile-lawsuit-pocket-monster-remake-1851765825">far less egregious offenses</a>. But hey, at least it’s putting all its legal team to good use by <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">patenting mechanics</a> and suing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit-patent-1851652489">knock-off monster-catching franchises</a>, right?</p>

              <p>How many cables do you have running across your desk right now? The more smart devices we have the more clutter we accumulate as each needs its own cable and adapter to keep it’s battery charged up. My nightstand is a nightmare. Having to plug in my phone, earbuds, and smartwatch at the end of the day leaves barely any room for eave a glass of water. And when I reach to check a notification on my phone, the cables get tangled, pulling stuff off the stand. At least that was the case before I got myself a dedicated charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/">Take a look at this 3-in-1 wireless charger from Acer. It’s normally selling for $70, but Amazon has it in a limited time deal, bringing the price down by 32%.</a> That equates to a savings of $22 having you only need to pay $48.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Acer MagSafe charging station is designed with Apple in mind, making use of Qi2 wireless charging. Modern Apple devices all are equipped with wireless charging capability. If you have an iPhone 12 or later, your phone will be compatible. The 3-in-1 charger’s three dedicated charging platforms are each made for you iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, magnetically adhering to your devices. This keeps clutter down and you’re devices still easily accessible while charging. No more knocking things off the nightstand when you get a late night text.</p>
<p>The cylindrical base is made for stability, keeping it always upright even when you phone is providing some extra weight on top while charging. The anti-slip pads along the bottom keep it firmly planted in place. The charger also doubles as a stand. If you choose to keep the Acer charger on your desktop, you phone when mounted is set at an ideal viewing angle so you can scroll with it in place or just keep it there next to you in view in case a notification pops up.</p>



<h2>Portability in Mind</h2>
<p>The charging stand is made to be portable. The iPhone charging platform can rotate around to for a cylinder while the AirPod and Apple Watch platforms can retract into the base. This leaves you with a little capsule about the size and shape of a soda can which you can easily fit into your bag while traveling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/">Get the Acer 3-in-1 charger and eliminated clutter on your desk for a hefty discount for a limited time</a>. Right now, you’ll save 32% while the sale is still active.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-stray-alan-wake-tv-control-2-1851647950">Annapurna Interactive</a> kicked of Tokyo Game Show 2025 with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXf5t1MC1k">brief showcase</a> last night that highlighted three new indies joining its <a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-steam-cat-game-god-of-war-powerwash-simulator-1849339513">impressive list of published games</a> which includes <em>Donut County</em>, <em>Stray</em>, and <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. The upcoming releases hail from a variety of teams and feature unusual genre mashups. Could one or more of them be a 2026 GOTY contender? Here’s a brief breakdown of each.</p> <h2><em>People of Note</em> is an RPG for theater kids</h2>  <p>I’ll admit, I usually try to stay as far away from theater kids as possible, doubly so if they start singing (which I’m allowed to say as a reformed theater kid myself). But <em>People of Note</em>, a musical RPG, is boasting turn-based battles and some really pretty-looking environments.</p> <p>You travel around to different musically themed cities recruiting new band mates, but the real draw is the rhythm-based combat that evolves over the course of each fight as the music being played shifts. “Did you like <em>Expedition 33</em>? Did you like <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em>? Well…” is the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sunshineduk.bsky.social/post/3lzkfq2fylc2j">best pitch</a> for it I’ve heard yet. It’s made by Iridium Studios and is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.</p>

 <h2><em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em> is a <em>Zelda</em>-like for Dungeon nerds</h2>  <p>Okay, we’re getting a little warmer to my personal tastes with <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em>, a pretty familiar-looking riff on the classic <em>Zelda</em> puzzle action formula. You play as an antlered “voidsent” trying to lift a mysterious curse who travels to a bunch of different biomes to do that, including one that looks very <em>Journey.</em></p>

 <p>The draw here is the<em> Devil May Cry</em> sword combos and 3D dungeon exploration. There’s even a backwards flip just like in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. <em>Zelda</em> homages are a dime a dozen at this point, but I’m as hungry as anyone else for clever 3D puzzles. It’s being made by Yarn Owl and it’s coming to Switch 1/2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.</p>

 <h2><em>D-topia</em> is a cozy puzzle adventure for people terrified of the future</h2>  <p>This is by far the game I came away from the showcase most excited to check out. <em>D-topia</em> takes place in a future where, instead of drowning us in meme-slop and cooking the planet’s atmosphere, highly advanced AI has actually helped to take care of humanity’s every seeming need. If there’s a grim <em>Black Mirror</em>-style lining to this sci-fi story, it’s not apparent from the first trailer.</p> <p>Your job is to help the AI help make people’s lives better, exploring their personal relationships and unique life situations along the way. There’s logic puzzles, branching convos, and a very cute, very thick cat in the mix. It’s being made by Marumittu Games and coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wicked-for-good%E2%80%99s-final-trailer-kinda-gives-the-whole-thing-away.1307253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Maybe it’s just because nothing could possibly live up to the cultural takeover of last year’s </span><i><span>Wicked</span></i><span> that the promotional campaign for </span><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>, the second and final part of the </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> stage musical’s movie adaptation, has felt a bit understated. We’re still two months away from the movie’s premiere in November, but this far out from the release of the first film, I was already being inundated with videos and memes of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo on a press tour, and nothing like that has happened yet with this one.. So it was surprising to me to see that, this morning, Universal released the final trailer for </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>. Maybe I’ve just been in an unintentional media blackout, but what was more surprising to me than the arrival of the trailer itself was that it pretty much spoils some of the biggest twists in the musical’s second act.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>fans have spent much of the last year trying to obscure some of the major reveals yet to come after Erivo’s showstopping “Defying Gravity” closed out the first movie, but the final trailer for the sequel pretty much gives away some of those details just months before the movie hits theaters. Specifically, the first film</span> <span>sows the seeds for iconic characters from the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>to appear in </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, but you might not catch on if you weren’t already privy to the musical’s second act. The most obvious is the lion cub Elphaba and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) rescue, who grows up to be the Cowardly Lion who accompanies Dorothy. But what about the Tin Man and Scarecrow who make up the rest of their crew? Well, viewers are quite familiar with both of these characters, actually. Boq, played by Ethan Slater, is turned into the Tin Man by Elphaba in an attempt to save his life. Fiyero suffers a similar fate, with Elphaba’s magic turning him into a scarecrow after he is tortured by the Wizard’s guards.</span></p>  <p><span>All of that had been mostly kept under wraps, until this new trailer. Boq’s fate is much more spelled out, as we see him turned into the Tin Man and shouting at Elphaba for what she’s done. Fiyero’s fate is more implied, as we see Elphaba stroking his face, but Bailey is facing away from the camera, so people who aren’t paying a ton of attention might miss that one. If you somehow didn’t catch it and are still reading this article anyway, sorry?</span></p> <p><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span> heads to theaters on November 21, when we will finally get to hear Erivo’s rendition of “No Good Deed,” resulting in world peace and happiness across the land.</span></p>
