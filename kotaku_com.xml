This makes it so that a character can’t attack for a few rounds due to the deficit, but <strong>it can also be an immensely useful tactic for grinding. </strong></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-bravely-default-1851779935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-bravely-default-1851779935">One Surprising Switch 2 Launch Game Sold Me On The Mouse Controls</a></span></p><p>By maxing out your Brave on each character during a standard enemy encounter, you can set up your attacks so that you slay every foe in a single turn with a bevy of attacks. <strong>This high-risk, high-reward tactic is ideal for helping you grind through fodder enemies</strong>, especially when using the battle speed multiplier to keep things moving at a rapid pace.</p><h2 id="h109755"><a id="2"></a>Focus on support enemies first</h2><p>Some fights will be straightforward, allowing you to focus on whichever foes you want to kill first. However, you’ll come across some battles with support enemies that can buff or heal other foes in the fight. In these cases, always <strong>focus your attention on the support enemy to make the battle go more smoothly</strong>. Nothing sucks worse than dishing out huge damage on a baddie just to see it get healed back up right after. </p><h2 id="h109756"><a id="3"></a>Always be building something in Norende Village</h2><p>Rebuilding Norende Village is one of the most important parts of your playthrough of <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em>. By increasing your villagers and assigning them spots to build/work, you’ll be able to unlock new items, weapons, armor, spells, and more. </p><figure id="" data-id="4073ab058cc0952a89c3e389a0983d1b" data-recommend-id="image://4073ab058cc0952a89c3e389a0983d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a project option to fix a collapsed bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a project option to fix a collapsed bridge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4073ab058cc0952a89c3e389a0983d1b" data-recommend-id="image://4073ab058cc0952a89c3e389a0983d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a project option to fix a collapsed bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keep an eye on the village, regularly, to make sure all of your villagers are assigned to something. It takes a long time to upgrade everything, so you want to be making the most of every second.</p><p>One thing that can be helpful to remember—especially early on when you have limited villagers and the time to rebuild something can be in excess of 10 hours—is that <strong>you can leave the game open overnight to help you work through the longer building processes</strong>. Even if your Nintendo Switch 2 goes to sleep, you’ll still be making progress due to the game continuing in real time as long as the game is active on the console.</p><h2 id="h109757"><a id="4"></a>Keep an eye on Tutorial Quests and Achievements</h2><p>If you like getting free stuff, <strong>complete all of the Tutorial Quests and Achievements</strong>. Visit this menu frequently by clicking Right on the D-Pad and selecting the icon that looks like a bulletin board. When you complete a quest here, you’ll earn items or gear that can be extremely useful on your journey. A random recovery item here and there may not seem like much, but it adds up in a game that can be rather demanding at times.</p><h2 id="h109758"><a id="5"></a>Play the game your way</h2><p><em>Bravely Default</em> offers a variety of difficulty options. These settings can change up the experience pretty wildly.. Whether you want a breezier playthrough, a normal challenge, or a brutal experience, there’s no wrong answer. </p><figure id="" data-id="d57c1e1fd90ecd90d0a25730093195a8" data-recommend-id="image://d57c1e1fd90ecd90d0a25730093195a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A difficulty option lets the player adjust how frequently random fights occur.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also, make sure you’re taking advantage of the game’s battle speed and encounter rate toggles. <strong>You can speed up fights dramatically if you want to grind quickly, or you can increase/decrease how frequently you are taken into battle by foes</strong>. Adjust these on the fly for an experience that feels just right at that moment in your playthrough.</p><p>With some fresh information at your fingertips, get out there and tackle <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD.</em> It’s available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-remaster-flying-fairy-hd-brave-norende-1851785709]]></content:encoded>

In the three years since then, however, both the developer and the animation team at Studio Trigger said multiple times that they’d be open to a new <em>Cyberpunk </em>anime. Now, we’re finally getting one and it will, surprisingly, carry the <em>Edgerunners</em> name.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195259" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Phantom Liberty Is Undoing One Key Thing That Cyberpunk Got Right" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="229" data-playlist="195259,195386,195734" data-current="195259"><div><p>Phantom Liberty Is Undoing One Key Thing That Cyberpunk Got Right</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20720.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On July 4, CD Projekt Red announced that <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 </em>is now in development over at Studio Trigger, and will feature a new, standalone story told across 10 episodes. We don’t know much about it beyond that it will be some kind of revenge story, as the official description calls it a “raw chronicle of redemption and revenge.”</p><p>“In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter?”</p><p>The next day, the company released a minute-long teaser that is mostly made up of footage from the first season, showing (spoilers) the original <em>Edgerunners </em>crew’s deaths. We then see silhouettes of what seems to be the new cast, with a lingering shot on what looks like a young child holding an old camcorder. I’ve seen some chatter suggesting that this girl could be the daughter of season one stars David and Lucy, but that’s just theorycrafting at this point.</p><p>While we still don’t know much, it does sound like <em>Edgerunners 2 </em>is going to be a bit of a bummer.

I’m from Poland and people in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad.”</p><p>I’m always down for a trip back to Night City, and if the season is truly a stand-alone story that won’t trample all over the first season’s perfect ending, then I’m all for another round of <em>Edgerunners</em>.

Some players recently went sleuthing through the potato quality pixels and think they see new games that aren’t currently available.</p><p>“I started hunting with my Discord for what games Nintendo ‘accidentally’ spoiled with the May NSO update video and this is what we have so far,” retro gaming Vtuber ImakuniVT <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ImakuniVT/status/1941912231303585925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ImakuniVT/status/1941912231303585925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a></span> on July 6. “Still trying to compare box arts, but this is what we have so far!!” An accompanying image includes the box arts for <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>, <em>Forsaken 64</em>, <em>Glover</em>, and <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.
