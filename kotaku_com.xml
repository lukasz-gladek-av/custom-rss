              <p>Some of my favorite games ever are on sale for the Switch right now. You might already own most of these, but I promise most of you will find something worth picking up in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/">eShop</a>‘s latest fire sale.</p> <p>Here’s just a sample:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Paradise Killer</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>What The Golf?</em></strong> – $8 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em></strong> – $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Moonlighter: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $4.34 (85 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>OlliOlli World</em> </strong>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Spiritfarer</em></strong> – $4.50 (85 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Disco Elysium</strong> – The Final Cut</em> – $12 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim </em></strong>– $15 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inscryption</em> </strong>– $7 (65 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death’s Door</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $5 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Unicorn Overlord</em></strong> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hotline Miami Collection</em></strong> – $5 (80 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inside</em></strong> – $2 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></strong> – $6.24 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Slay the Spire</em> </strong>– $8.50 (66 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster</em></strong> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></strong> – $18 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Civilization VI</em></strong> – $6 (80 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>A few special shout-outs. If you don’t have <em>Slay the Spire</em>, it’s a top-notch deck-building roguelike that you won’t be able to put down. <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, a loot shooter roguelike, is a similarly irresistible timesink. <em>Inside</em>, meanwhile, is an excellent cinematic platformer adventure game and, in my opinion at least, one of the best games ever made. It doesn’t get enough credit. Only $2? A steal!</p> <p>Finally, <em>Digimon Cybersleuth</em> is an incredibly meaty JRPG for just $5 (the series latest entry <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341">came out this fall</a>), and $15 is a great price for <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>, a wonderfully inventive and surprising visual novel/strategy game mash-up from Vanillaware.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> gets its biggest discount yet</h2> <p>There are actually some decent Switch 2 deals right now, too. They’re nowhere near as good as the ones for games on the OG hardware, but <em>Cyberpunk 2077: The Ultimate Edition</em> in particular is just $40 until November 1. That’s 43 percent off the list price, which isn’t bad at all for a port that only arrived in June. It runs surprisingly well on Switch 2 and is a decent way to catch up on the best sci-fi open-world RPG of the decade (it also supports cross-saves if you already started on another platform).</p> <p>What else is on sale on the Switch 2 at the moment?<em> Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> is just $30 right now (40 percent off) and GOTY contender <em>Split Fiction</em> is just $40 (20 percent off). The Switch 2 port of <em>EA Sports Madden NFL 26</em> isn’t the best but it’s currently $20 off the standard price. So is <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, a very solid lifestyle sim RPG that arrived back with the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this year.</p>

              <p>Canada’s Fan Expo is the nation’s largest geek-themed convention, attracting the crowds for its comics, sci-fi, horror, anime and gaming events, alongside big-name guests and their autograph-hunting acolytes. It also draws in a massive number of cosplayers, and where cosplay appears so does <em>Kotaku</em>‘s crack team of photographers from Mineralblu. We’ve put together a gallery of some of the best and most intriguing fits from the recent convention.</p> <p>2025’s Fan Expo was not short on big-name celebrities. Appearing at the event were the likes of <em>Star Wars’ </em>John Boyega, Tyler Hoechlin (aka the best Superman), the legendary Juliet Lewis, and <em>the</em> Michael J. Fox. (It’s worth noting that <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/celebrities/">next year’s event</a> has already managed to line up all four hobbits from the original&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies.) But we push such famous people aside, uninterested in their shiny faces, because we want to see the people dressing up as other famous people: the cosplayers.</p> <p>Mineralblu have sent us over a great mix, with some (now) traditional appearances from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, some classics like a great Princess Leia, and some old-school <em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>, along with the outright unusual such as a Dry Bowser. Click on to see the fully gallery of amazing outfits.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was hanging on for dear life this weekend. I spent about 13 hours in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ “Server Slam,” a test of the game’s servers and overall game stability ahead of its release on October 30, and it’s clear that the game clicked with me so well, I might hardly leave my apartment anymore. Farewell social life and other hobbies; <i>Arc Raiders</i> is nearly here and I don’t know if I can resist its call.</p> <p>A PvPvE extraction shooter, <i>Arc Raiders</i> makes for a rough experience, but also a thrilling one. It is also, clearly, the multiplayer game I’ve been searching for ever since it was announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-dmz-beta-warzone-dead-activision-1851066541"><i>Call of Duty</i>’s DMZ was headed for a slow, un-updated death</a>. So allow me to tell you of the unbelievable thrill that was <i>Arc Raiders</i> this weekend.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders</i> is a hostile game. That’s the point</h2>  <p>There’s no way around this: Extraction shooters are just mean. And <i>Arc Raiders</i> is <i>nasty</i>.</p> <p>The lone map provided during the Server Slam was replete with hiding spots from which you could plan an ambush. Though you can’t lay prone, it’s pretty easy to hide in bushes, and the interiors of buildings have their fair share of corners you can exploit. Survival is about keeping your head on a swivel and your ears perpetually open for random sounds that can signal the presence of a threat before you can see it.</p>

 <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, like many other extraction shooters, sticks you right in the midst of a fight-or-flight response and exploits that tension for a one-of-a-kind dopamine rush if you make it out alive, and one hell of a come-down should you fail. No, it’s not fun when you lose all your shit from a kill you could never see coming; yet somehow you need to push past that to find “fun.” It’s not for everyone.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9wwpk/when_your_best_isnt_good_enough/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><i>Arc Raiders</i> is mean</a> in a way that a simple battle royale or team deathmatch just isn’t. You can die so quickly and, true to the genre’s conventions, death puts you at risk of losing your best gear. It often doesn’t feel fair; that’s a tough pill to swallow. Don’t worry, though; plenty of mean people will eventually get what they deserve in a later round when they inevitably push their luck too far. That’s just what this game is about: The deep, crushing feeling of loss is why the feeling of winning is so exhilarating. The highs are so high <i>because </i>of the depths of the lows.</p>

 <p>This is what I love about the PvPvE extraction genre: Everything matters and punishment is swift. The distant clap of gunfire isn’t set design, it’s an actual firefight that could quickly become your problem if you’re too close. You can hear nearby enemy players break into various loot caches, digging around for supplies, and that becomes a signal that you need to either GTFO or draw your weapon and be prepared. Enemy Arc drones and other machines are an essential part of this experience: They’re an opportunity for good loot, an engaging gun battle, or the best distraction in the world from enemy players who have you outgunned. The PvPvE is a triangle you rotate around.</p>

    <p>Fleeing battles during the Server Slam was sometimes as exhilarating as participating in them. The experience of trading shots with enemy players down long corridors of an abandoned water treatment facility, only to need to race down the labyrinthine maze of hallways, tossing smoke grenades behind me and barely making it to a door I can shut, giving me a precious few seconds to heal up and continue my escape or make a stand taps into something so exhilaratingly primal in my brain that even thinking about it makes my skin tingle a bit.</p>

    <p>Perhaps because it’s October and I’ve been on a huge survival horror kick in general, it dawned on me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/">extraction shooters and horror games</a> seem to poke at the same network of neurons in the human brain. Seeing another player can be a jumpscare; hell, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/">the game’s tumbleweeds</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa9ruw/every_signle_damn_time/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">random bits of garbage</a> that float around as set design often trigger a kind of PTSD response as, in order to survive, you do have to sort of assume anything that moves is a potential threat. I’ve shot a few tumbleweeds impulsively because surviving in this game means you have to close that distance between seeing a moving thing and shooting it.</p>    <p>And when things break out into full-on firefights with either human players or the game’s machines, it’s a spontaneous game of survival unlike anything else, given the real risk of dying and <i>not</i> respawning, losing your weapons and essential crafting loot. It’s a challenge to not let the lethality of the game consume you and turn your next run into a rage-filled revenge quest. The game is aware of this, as one of the post-death loading screens literally says “This could be an excellent start to your villain arc.”</p> <p>As one Redditor commented after suffering <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9zr2w/i_tried_i_really_tried/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a humiliating betrayal by another player</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>I will never trust a raider again. It’s dog eat dog out there, and now this dog is hungry.</p></blockquote> <p>“Sure,” one Redditor replied, “it wasn’t a happy ending, but it’s a far more unique experience.” The risk of betrayal, the tender nature of any temporary alliance, the risk and reward, it’s what makes this whole thing so damn entertaining. Success is in rare supply, so you are regularly chasing it.</p>   <p>Fighting other humans is a ton of brutal, mean fun. But I was very surprised to find the game’s computer-controlled enemies, the E of the PvPvE triangle, were also great sparring partners and, interestingly, helpful informants.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637365"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637365">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Against all odds, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has flying enemies that don’t suck</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> didn’t set out to be a PvPvE game at first, we’ve learned. Other human players were added after developer Embark realized that simply fighting the game’s robots, collectively referred to as “Arc,” over and over again <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540">got old too fast</a>. And while I probably wouldn’t want to just play a game that pits me against these machines without human antagonistic forces, damn are they enjoyable pests to have roaming the skies.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ 2-Year Delay Explained: Game Was Boring</a></p> <p>Upon stepping out into the game’s post-apocalyptic maps, you’ll regularly see drones flying out in the distance, always keeping an eye on what’s going on underneath them. They come in a few varieties: drones with guns, drones that can summon other drones with guns, and of course the big ones that shoot rockets at you and are a literal terror. They’re deadly, sure, but their presence can also indicate where other players are, which is essential knowledge for survival. Arc drone behavior, whether they’re actively engaged in a firefight with other players or are searching for players they’ve caught sight of, sends a clear message: Either there’s a situation up ahead that you want to <i>avoid </i>or there’s a possible opportunity that you want to <i>exploit</i>. After all, looting a downed player is likely to net you a healthy injection of supplies and a decent chance to find a good weapon.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637363"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637363">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Drones let you know what you’re potentially getting yourself into while you’re traversing the map. They also make for unlikely temporary allies. On more than one occasion, I fired off shots at drones to lure them to my position to try and shake off some enemy players who were on my tail. Arc can rapidly change the dynamics of a firefight between players as they swiftly dart through the air and ignore the ground-level cover that players are hiding behind.</p>

 <p>And it seems much of the community shares my fondness for these airborne pests. <i>Thank the goddess</i>.</p> <p>One of the most up-voted threads, sitting just shy of 5k up arrows, on r/ArcRaiders is a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oarm5m/please_dont_nerf_the_arc/"> plea to <i>not</i> nerf Arc</a> following the Server Slam. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oawvny/arc_are_not_overpowered_its_a_massive_skill_issue/">Arc’s lethality is the point</a>, others have argued, and they’re right.</p>   <p>Drones also offer a surprisingly fun test of marksmanship. They’re not just flying things for you to mindlessly pump bullets into for the sake of loot and experience points. You really have to place your shots well to come out alive. Shooting out the propellers on these machines can ground them faster than aiming at the core fuselage, but it also makes their flying behavior wildly erratic when a propeller or two is destroyed. Landing shots on them is as satisfying as nailing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_pigeon_shooting">clay pigeon</a> in real life–something I haven’t done since I was a kid, yet <i>Arc Raiders</i> tapped right into that old muscle memory. To top it off, drones carry pretty decent crafting supplies, so there’s good reason to fuck with them if you’re confident you can earn their loot unscathed.</p>  <p>Thanks to all the ways they make the action more dynamic, these airborne pests never frustrated me the way flying enemies in games usually do. They’re useful for dealing with other players and somehow exist in this Goldilocks zone of being a lethal challenge that’s surprisingly fun to take down.</p>

 <h2>Will <i>Arc Raiders</i> shatter the extraction shooter’s glass ceiling?</h2> <p>Extraction shooters have struggled to hit critical mass in the way that, say, battle royales have. At their most intense–when they incorporate rigid survival mechanics like hunger and thirst, deadly fall damage, and the need to keep track of specific calibers of ammo like you do in, say, <i>Escape From Tarkov</i>–they’re just too grueling to ever appeal to a mass audience.</p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> streamlines many of the genre’s survival trappings: There’s no hunger or thirst. You can move pretty fast for a “realistic” game and can survive some pretty steep falls if you jump off a ledge. And ammo is abstracted down to light, medium, heavy, and shotgun (at least as far as what was on offer in the Server Slam). It’s an easier game than many of its more hardcore peers, but it’s still punishing.</p>

 <p>The Server Slam also capped out at a certain level. The game has skill trees that you invest points into to up your survival skills, improving everything from how long you can sprint, to how quickly you can vault over objects, to how much noise you make while rummaging through the detritus of a fallen civilization.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637362"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637362">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Given the level cap of 15 in the Server Slam, this weekend saw the intensity only ratchet up to a certain point. Once players have the full game, I wonder how chaotic, or potentially unfair, some builds will be, and at what point <i>Arc Raiders</i> may struggle to sustain that Goldilocks zone of tension. The game could also use some more QOL features such as double or triple key bindings and maybe some better inventory management tools.</p>

 <p>Still, I haven’t been this optimistic about a multiplayer game all year and I’m hungering for this game to return in a way that worries me. When the servers went dark last night, I was quite sad.</p> <p>So if you don’t see me in real space after October 30 when this game launches, don’t be surprised. This game is going to be a problem for me, and I’m so here for it.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has some of the best character customization in Game Freak’s monster-taming series. Lumiose City’s wide array of fashion choices are a welcome change after </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>locked everyone into school uniforms, but the best addition is that none of these clothing items are gender-locked. So whether it’s skirts or long hair, whatever you see on the rack is yours to buy and wear as you please. The game is pretty fluid in how it lets players present themselves in the world, but even so, it’s got some gendered stuff in its story that some players aren’t thrilled about. However, the fashion freedom is helping people get around some of those limitations.</span></p> <p><span>When you pick your character’s initial appearance, you’re also picking whether the game will recognize them as male or female, regardless of what you’re wearing. However, you’re also picking who your rival is going to be. If you play as a male character, you’ll be greeted by a young girl named Taunie when you arrive in Lumiose City. Conversely, a female trainer will meet Urbain, a boy who has a similar role and aesthetic, but is otherwise a different person. At first, I kinda figured this split would be in service of some shoehorned, heterosexual romantic subplot, but thankfully it never came to that. I rolled credits last night and I’m still not a hundred percent sure what the point of having these two characters is, beyond giving the main cast an even gender divide. Maybe I’ll find out more as I make my way through the post-game. That said, some fans want to play as a girl and have Taunie on their team, or want to be a boy and hang out with Urbain. So while it’s not a perfect solution, some players are taking up crossdressing to present as one gender and still get their preferred rival.</span></p>

Or they’re just doing it because it feels right to them.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">holy shit thank you toriyaro-sensei i am going to restart my game right now <a href="https://t.co/COqgIo5CCs">https://t.co/COqgIo5CCs</a></p> <p>— Selipse （セリっち） (@selipse4) <a href="https://twitter.com/selipse4/status/1978986174804038131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">あとは俺に任せてくれや <a href="https://t.co/ELZn8oVkED">https://t.co/ELZn8oVkED</a> <a href="https://t.co/mCgRegGyMU">pic.twitter.com/mCgRegGyMU</a></p> <p>— トリヤボウ (@Toriyaro_NICHI) <a href="https://twitter.com/Toriyaro_NICHI/status/1978723354405171226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you want Taunie as the rival in ZA and be a girl you need to turn your character into a trans girl and then let everyone use incorrect pronouns on you <a href="https://t.co/6WMomDp9wJ">pic.twitter.com/6WMomDp9wJ</a></p> <p>— Soru (@LocalGhostSoru) <a href="https://twitter.com/LocalGhostSoru/status/1978868320100106440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">He/Him Butch Lesbian edition Z-A is kinda amazing ngl. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/IcpPpBoLj1">pic.twitter.com/IcpPpBoLj1</a></p> <p>— ✨ Abarero {MikotoHanna 4ever}✨ (@AbareroKitty) <a href="https://twitter.com/AbareroKitty/status/1978996450219462999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm so glad clothing is no longer gender locked in Legends Z-A, I can finally have a trainer that looks like me 🥹 <a href="https://t.co/mLefnLrxuZ">pic.twitter.com/mLefnLrxuZ</a></p> <p>— Shayy (@Shayy_TV) <a href="https://twitter.com/Shayy_TV/status/1979300531161174460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>As far as I can tell, the rival is the only thing determined by the player’s gender in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but maybe this will impact other parts of the game as well that I haven’t seen yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rumors have swirled for weeks now that the next <em>Fortnite</em> season would be a mini-season themed around Fox’s long-running animated series <em>The Simpsons.</em> Now we have new info from reliable leakers that claims the popular battle royale’s next big update will replace the game’s map with a virtual Springfield from the show.</p> <p>In September, reliable <em>Fortnite</em> insiders like HypeX and Shiina began reporting that the next season of<em> Fortnite</em> would be a <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season. Then, earlier this month, dataminers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706">discovered Kang and Kodos inside <em>Fortnite’s</em> files</a>. Descriptions of the two characters mention them not being included in the battle pass, seemingly confirming that the rumors of a <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season, complete with a battle pass, were true. Now those same insiders are reporting that the mini-season will replace <em>Fortnite</em>‘s current battle royale map with a Springfield-inspired battlefield.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">SIMPSONS x FORTNITE MAP IS FULLY SPRINGFIELD</p> <p>Also a Nuclear Plant POI — VIA <a href="https://twitter.com/NotPaloleaks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NotPaloleaks</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpushFNBR</a> <a href="https://t.co/s6H40GbEyK">pic.twitter.com/s6H40GbEyK</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1979986181413622240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On October 19, multiple <em>Fortnite</em> leakers, including Hypex, <span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks">NotPaloleaks</a>, and </span><span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR">SpushFNBR,</a> began reporting that the mini-season’s map would arrive in November and will be “fully Springfield.” Previously, some had theorized that part of Springfield would be added to the current battle royale map, but it sounds like that’s not the case. Instead, it’s claimed that the entire <em>Fortnite</em> map will be replaced with Springfield for the reportedly month-long event. <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Battle">That’s similar to how past mini-seasons have worked</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks/status/1980303035936165911">Paloleaks further reported that the map will be cel-shaded</a>, matching the look of the animated series. It’s also claimed that the new <em>Simpsons</em> season will include mash-up skins, likely mixing and matching <em>Simpsons</em> characters with <em>Fortnite</em> characters. I can’t wait to see what Epic does with Peely. Perhaps a Moleman x Peely skin that will make everyone question their sanity?&nbsp;</span></p> <p>As a giant <em>Simpsons</em> fan, I’m both excited about this <em>Fortnite</em> news and scared that I’m going to end up spending far too much money on a bunch of silly digital skins. <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">Yes, I know, I’m part of the problem and I’m sorry</a>. Epic hasn’t confirmed the new <em>Simpsons</em> season yet, and likely won’t until we get closer to November. Until then, I’ll just rewatch Treehouse of Horror episodes and mourn the loss of <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Simpsons Tapped Out,</em> the last new <em>Simpsons</em> game released in over a decade</a>.</p>
