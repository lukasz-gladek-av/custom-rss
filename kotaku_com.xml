              <p>Amazon started <em>Black Friday Week</em> off with a bang on Thursday by knocking the AirPods 4 with ANC down from its usual $179 to $109. Shoppers jumped on it immediately, but Amazon decided to go even harder on Friday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">Now the price is at an unbelievable $99 (44% off)</a>, a record low for earbuds that are barely into their first year. The standard <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">AirPods 4 without ANC also hit a new low at $79, down from $129</a>. Neither of these deals exists on Apple’s website because it will not run Black Friday promotions. Amazon clearly has different plans.</p>

<h2>Premium ANC Earbuds Finally at an Accessible Price</h2>
<p>Until Apple figured it out, active noise cancellation seemed impossible on open-ear earbuds with the H2 chip. The <strong>ANC model of AirPods 4 blocks out the ambient noise without the sealed feeling of traditional in-ear designs</strong>. Airplane engines, office chatter, and street noise fade into the background so you can focus on your music or calls. The technology adapts continuously to your environment, adjusting cancellation levels in real time.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode flips the script</strong> when you need to hear your surroundings. A quick press lets in ambient sound so you can have a conversation or listen for announcements without removing the earbuds. The transition between ANC and Transparency is genuinely instant and seamless. It’s this flexibility that makes the AirPods 4 truly useful for everyday life, rather than just an isolated listening session.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Audio goes even further:</strong> it automatically blends noise cancellation and transparency, depending on your environment. Walk down a busy street, and it ramps up awareness of your surroundings. Sit at your desk, and stronger noise cancellation kicks in to help you focus. In essence, the earbuds read the room and adapt-without any input from you. It feels almost magical once you experience how seamlessly it works.</p>
<p>With <strong>Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, an immersive three-dimensional soundstage is built around your uniquely shaped ears. Technology utilizes the TrueDepth camera on your iPhone to scan your ears and optimize audio delivery. Movies and music acquire depth and dimension that standard stereo simply cannot match. It feels like the sounds are around you, not inside of your head. Immersive audio will enormously improve the gaming and video content.</p>



<p>All these advanced features are powered by the <strong>H2 chip</strong>, and it does so with great battery efficiency. You get up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case, ample for a week of commutes and workouts. The earbuds themselves will last around 6 hours on a single charge with ANC turned on. When you’re in a real hurry, a quick 5-minute charge gives you about an hour of playback.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort remains a strong suit for the open-ear design</strong> that Apple has refined generation after generation. The earbuds sit securely without creating pressure or fatigue during extended listening sessions. No silicone tips means no irritation in the ear canal, no plugged-up feeling. And most people can wear them hours on end without discomfort. The fit works for workouts, commutes, and everything in between.</p>
<p>For $99, the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC deliver flagship audio features at a mid-range price point. You are getting active noise cancelation, adaptive audio, spatial audio, and the H2 chip in comfortable open-ear earbuds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since <i>No Man’s Sky</i>’s Voyagers update, players have been obsessed with making some incredible ships. And with the help of some mod tools, the most daring of ship builders out there are pushing the boundaries of Hello Games’ procedurally created universe. One of the most impressive demonstrations I’ve seen of this yet is this <i>NMS</i> player’s tribute to <i>Independence Day</i>.</p>    <p>Built by Vilxir, this build is reminiscent of his epic, and perhaps equally terrifying, <i>No Man’s Sky</i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-death-star-star-wars-2000635367">Death Star I highlighted last month</a>. Like the Death Star before it, Vilxir’s <i>Independence Day </i>“Destroyer” leveraged the power of open-source 3D modeling software Blender and the handy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/984">Base Builder mod</a> that allows users to import 3D models from Blender into <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p>

 <p>While <i>NMS</i>’ in-game ship-building tools can produce incredible results, Vilxir tells me that the ability to use Blender is a game-changer, “Blender has opened up an entirely new level of creativity for me. It lets me make things I genuinely didn’t think were possible in <i>NMS</i>, so huge shoutouts to the creators of the Blender Plugin and the Base Editor.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646307"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646307">© Screenshot: Hello Games / Vilxir</figcaption></figure> <p>The Destroyer took about four hours to build, according to Vilxir. One of the most interesting challenges? Nailing the dome-like flying saucer structure of the <i>Independence Day </i>ship. “Anyone who’s made a dome in <i>No Man’s Sky</i> or worked with Blender spheres knows the pain,” he told me. “You get merged pieces, overlaps, and a bumpy surface. To get something closer to a smooth dome, I had to build it in individual layered rings instead of using a single sphere.”</p>

 <p>Impressive though it may be, the ship isn’t finished. Vilxir now has his sights set on building out the interior of the ship, but he’s not looking to crash anyone’s console or PC with aggressively complicated ship architecture. “I’m aiming for something optimized for performance and fun, especially if I share it publicly,” he said. “Right now my plan is to build dedicated spaces for the core, the hangar, and a command deck. I also want to experiment with making a separate Corvette that acts as a small fleet of the fighter ships that Will Smith and the others flew in the movie.”</p> <p>Vilxir’s reign of building impressive ships to stalk the procedurally generated vacuum of Hello Games’ galaxy won’t conclude with the Destroyer. “For the next big project,” he told me, “I’m considering tackling Thanos’ Sanctuary II, or the Crimson Dawn ‘First Light’ yacht from <i>Solo</i>. I’ve also thought about the Lucrehulk battleship from <i>The Clone Wars</i>. My goal is to build ships that nobody has tried yet, or that hasn’t been done at this level of detail.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-hd2d-remake-review-is-it-good-2000646277</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-has-forever-changed-how-i-look-at-the-legendary-rpg-series.1361278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>I spent several hours over the past weeks trying to think of a single remake that’s comparable to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, and I couldn’t. I thought about 2023’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>remake, which changes the controls, the tone, and even the content of 2005’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4</span></i><span>. However, I could still use my knowledge of the original game to progress through the remake, which for the most part I can’t with </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i><span>. I thought about </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span>, which dramatically overhauls the core systems of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> and changes the narrative in ways that deliberately play with fan expectations. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i><span>, however,</span> <span>clearly </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>want to be recognized as the first two </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games, not as a riff or commentary on them, as it primarily adds to each game’s overarching story rather than changing it outright.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even 2024’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</span></i><span> is a tangibly different beast than this, as it still generally adhered to the NES-era storytelling of its source material in ways that </span><i><span>I+II</span></i><span> do not. I realized my best point of comparison for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>was actually movies like </span><i><span>Clueless </span></i><span>(1995) and </span><i><span>10 Things I Hate About You </span></i><span>(1999). Those adaptations are directly based on the works of Austen and Shakespeare respectively, but they are not bound to those works. Instead, they are movies made unapologetically for the audiences of their time, treating their source material as an outline to follow rather than something to “remake.” </span><i><span>Clueless </span></i><span>is a more interesting flick if you’ve read </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>and can compare the two works. However, if you told someone “I’ve experienced </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>because I watched </span><i><span>Clueless</span></i><span>,” they’d tell you to at least pretend to read </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>like everyone else who sleepwalked their way to a Bachelor of Arts in English.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>is similarly disinterested in recapturing the essence of the first two </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games. As a package it instead strikes me as more akin to a modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>game, with enough retro sensibilities to appeal to fans of Square Enix’s greater “HD-2D” catalogue (like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459"><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i></a> <span>or the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/philabieldia-switch-nintendo-direct-elliot-jrpg-1851787431"><i><span>The Adventures of Elliot</span></i></a><span>). Given that these two games have seen countless remakes that mainly iterate on 1993’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I &amp; II</span></i><span> for the Super Famicom, a more transformative take on these classics feels overdue. But </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>rides such a fine line between honoring its source material and reinventing it for the modern era that I’ve found myself completely changing the way I even look at the two games it’s based on. To explain what I mean by that, we’ll have to look at these games next to their former counterparts and answer a simple, yet overwhelming question: What even is </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>?</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646279"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646279">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest I</em>: The bones are the RPG</b></h2> <p><span>The first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, released in Japan in 1986, is sometimes called “the first RPG.” However, that isn’t really true. Series like </span><i><span>Wizardry</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ultima</span></i><span> were already several games deep by the mid 80s, and gamers in Japan could enjoy region-exclusive hits like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-arpg-review-guide-1851684251"><span>Falcom</span></a><span>’s </span><i><span>Dragon Slayer</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>The Black Onyx</span></i><span> on PC about two years before </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> debuted. The real claim to fame of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> isn’t </span><i><span>inventing</span></i><span> the video game RPG, but distilling this mouse-and-keyboard genre into a form that could fit on the more mainstream Famicom. It’s objectively not the first Japanese RPG, but it is arguably the first “jRPG.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As a result, the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>boils down to an exceedingly simple loop: fight monsters, buy equipment, level up. If you cross a bridge and die to strong monsters, do something else to get stronger. Talk to townsfolk, gather hints to find key items, and eventually you will reach the final boss. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>hones in on a gradual power fantasy, one in which time invested translates directly into strength gained. These mechanics aren’t a result of the RPG genre freshly emerging out of its primordial goo. Rather, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is a statement about RPGs as a whole—strip the genre to its most essential parts, and this is what you get.</span></p>

 <p><span>To this day, that loop of “do an activity, level up, repeat” that drives RPGs remains the basis of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-d4-loot-reborn-season-4-helltide-1851482897"><span>major video game franchises</span></a><span>. You can even find </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3127000/Splintered/"><span>brand new games</span></a><span> that specifically iterate on the look and feel of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, simply because the core formula is still compelling. The remakes and remasters of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> have only homed in on that fundamental loop harder, with rebalanced EXP and Gold gains that get players to that sweet dopamine rush of leveling up even faster. The most recent mobile versions of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> even highlight the location of key items, nullifying that aforementioned element of hint gathering to get players back to grinding slimes and skeletons until they’re strong enough to overcome their next obstacle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ll be honest, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-games-where-to-start-guide-1851700491/5"><span>I’m a sucker for these iterations of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i></a><span>. It’s now a concise RPG that you can start after breakfast and finish before dinner, which is a refreshing change of pace for a genre associated with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-part-3-remake-length-how-long-2000637274"><span>wildly long runtimes</span></a><span>. The game can feel tough, especially for kids who were expecting a </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span>-like experience after getting it from </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15410710/dragon-quest-heroes-ii-square-enix-japan-us-release"><span>a Nintendo Power giveaway</span></a><span>. But once you learn the basic rules, I’d say </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is just as soothing as it is epic (by 1986 standards, anyway). Meanwhile, “soothing” is the last word I’d use to describe </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646280">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</em>: So are the worms</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> separates itself from its source material right after you select “new game.” Following a series of cutscenes that introduce a few major characters, the hero embarks on a quest that is not driven by accruing strength, but by traveling to set locations to advance the plot. This is now a story-driven game, and the story it tells is practically the antithesis of the original game’s loop. You are not a mighty warrior embarking on a power fantasy. You are alone in a world devoid of hope, where death and defeat are always a breath away.</span></p> <p><span>These feelings permeate the combat of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>. In the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, battles are quick 1vs1 skirmishes in which your actions typically consist of attacking, casting a spell, or healing.” In </span><i><span>HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, the hero now faces full groups of enemies at once. This pushes you into the role of the wary tactician, perpetually one bad turn away from defeat. Battles are now drawn out affairs in which individual enemies can attack multiple times per turn as if to reinforce how heavily the deck is stacked against you. If an enemy scores a single critical hit on you, a game over is likely to soon follow.</span></p>  <p><span>To compensate, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>now lets you utilize a plethora of modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>spells and abilities. In the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, the hero learns ten spells in total. By the time I finished </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>, the hero had forty-seven. Weapons and armor now boast unique properties, a far cry from the static stat increases of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. Even in regular encounters, I found myself swapping my equipment nearly every turn to exploit weaknesses and optimize my elemental resistances. And </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-how-to-beat-lu-bu-chapter-2-1851765372"><span>lest you think I’m just doing hard mode things</span></a><span>, this is all on the default normal difficulty!</span></p>

 <p><span>The irony of these new battle mechanics is that they do feel retro-inspired, just not in a way that’s specifically faithful to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. There’s a heavy emphasis on dice rolls, where a single status effect landing on either side can single-handedly determine the outcome of combat. Missing an attack with a whip on a group of enemies feels crushing. Enemies spam instant death moves as frequently as they would in a proper full-party </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. Were it not for this remake’s generous autosave system, dungeon exploration would probably feel tense in a way hardcore dungeon crawlers often do, but the cheery, inviting </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>series typically does not.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646281">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest</em> 0.2 – A Fragmentary Passage</b></h2> <p><span>You may be wondering how one could make a story-driven version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, a game that has virtually no story. The answer, of course, is to write an almost entirely new story that integrates the major beats of the NES classic. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake</span></i><span> is completely treated as a sequel to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span>. Plot elements that only appeared in that third game now take the forefront here and completely recontextualize the story. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>originally spent a lot of time talking about the heroic deeds of the first Erdrick. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> proclaims that you </span><i><span>know </span></i><span>the first Erdrick, and it spends the entirety of its 15-hour run time acting as a bridge between </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>In fulfilling this role, the tale of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> becomes somewhat darker than it has seemed in past incarnations. Princess Gwaelin, once the prototypical damsel-in-distress, is now blessed with powers, though they’re still insufficient against the villainous Dragonlord, costing the lives of her protectors before she is flung into a dungeon where she is psychologically tortured. At least one named character dies in a demon attack that feels as cruel as it is pointless. The soldiers who escape with their lives are broken by their helplessness, wondering what they can possibly do to defend against the powers that could target their loved ones next.</span></p> <p><span>Through these threads, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> focuses on one of the oldest themes in jRPG history: don’t give up hope. The solution for many of these struggles isn’t to go out and take on the world without aid; instead, people move forward by focusing on what they </span><i><span>can </span></i><span>do, which in turn creates the conditions for the hero to succeed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“… You’re only one person. You can’t keep the whole world safe single-handedly,” a character tells the hero after her village wards off a deadly invasion. “We can’t give in to fear. If we run, then what happened to us will happen to others. The world won’t be safe. So we have to be strong. And we have to keep going.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This is where I feel </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> strains a bit in its identity as, well, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. In </span><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145759/masaaki-hayasaka-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-interview-gamescom"><span>an interview with </span><i><span>Shacknews</span></i></a><span>, remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka discusses how the team originally pitched series creator Yuji Horii on the idea of giving the hero more party members. However, according to Hayasaka, Horii was adamant that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>remain a solo adventure, stating “… </span><i><span>Dragon Quest 1</span></i><span> is a story about one man’s adventure, one journey, and it’s the history of the series.” This is a true statement about the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but it is not true of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest HD-2D</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> is very much </span><i><span>not </span></i><span>one man’s journey. It’s the story of people coming together to ward off a fearsome, overwhelming evil. It’s a celebration of small victories, like a father realizing that he can be a hero just by defending his family. It’s a game about a princess doing what she can to protect her kingdom, and it legitimately feels awkward that she doesn’t become a party member when she outright asks to join the hero. Frankly, more companions could have smoothed out some of the rough edges in this remake’s modernized combat system too, as it’s clearly designed for a full party.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’m not here to argue with Yuji Horii about a video game that he made in the 1980s. It’s just that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> is not that game. I can’t state enough that I love the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, and I sincerely recommend that you find the time to play any past iterations of the game if </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D </span></i><span>was your first exposure to it. Yet as I watched the credits roll, I found myself curious about the vision Hayasaka’s team had in mind when they pitched the idea of adding more party members. Could we have seen a deeper relationship blossom between the hero and Gwaelin outside the “love at first sight” premise of the original? Is there a world in which Robbin ‘ood could have worked as a playable character? I find these possibilities much more interesting than the idea that the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest must </span></i><span>be a solo journey, especially when virtually everything else about it has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That said, I’ll admit that limiting the game to one party member gives greater thematic significance to the second game in this package.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646282">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>After all my passion for the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, forgive me if I don’t sound as enthusiastic about </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>. I didn’t play it as a kid, and most of the western hemisphere seems to hold it in relatively low regard. </span><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/142844/dragon-quest-games-ranked-list"><span>It routinely ranks at the bottom of mainline </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>rankings</span></a><span>, though these same rankings often clarify that the writers don’t outright hate the game. In my opinion, it’s missing the strong hook that would have made it distinct from the other mainline games. The first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is a less technically impressive game, but its simplicity gives it a lasting charm that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>lacks.</span></p> <p><span>One look at Japan in 1987, however, paints a very different picture. In </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512112519/http://www.1up.com/features/koichi-nakamura-interview-console-rpg"><span>an archived interview with </span><i><span>1Up</span></i></a><span>, Chunsoft founder Koichi Nakamura describes how he “was very confident that [the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>] was going to become a hit.” However, he was disappointed with how the first game initially sold, as he was “expecting it to be a bigger hit.” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>was actually the breakout success that would eventually lead to the series spawning </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-spawned-an-urban-myth"><span>wild rumors about Japan declaring a holiday whenever a </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game is released</span></a><span>. According to Nakamura, “once [</span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>] was out in stores, it created a huge panic — the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>panic — everybody wanted </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, and the stores all sold out.”</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s fitting, as </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>introduces much of the flavor that would define </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>beyond “it’s kind of like </span><i><span>Ultima </span></i><span>I guess.” The player now commands a party that must contend with swarms of foes in strategic combat. The world is vast in scope, going so far as to include the island of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>as a small slice of its map. The journey spans multiple granular arcs that balance drama with whimsy. If the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is the core of the turn-based RPG, then </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>is the core of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>as a series.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>also released in a notably unfinished state. In </span><a href="https://shmuplations.com/dragonquestii/"><span>a 1987 interview</span></a><span>, Yuji Horii describes how the development team had to scramble to balance the game, which ultimately delayed the game’s release. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>was also designed with more elaborately drawn cutscenes in mind, but those had to be cut due to memory limitations. Items were wholesale removed from the game, leaving some treasure chests empty. Even the ending was cut down to size; Horii originally entertained the idea of having the Prince of Cannock sacrifice himself during the final battle, which would lead to the Princess of Cannock murdering the protagonist out of revenge for her lost brother. I don’t think that would have been a </span><i><span>good </span></i><span>idea, but it definitely is an idea!</span></p>

 <p><span>The point is, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>comes across as a game whose narrative ambitions outstripped what was feasible at the time. It’s been remade about as many times as the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, which has afforded its makers many opportunities to fix any lingering balance issues (ask your local NES gamer about </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/183zlyr/the_final_section_of_dragon_quest_2_is_making_me/"><span>what the final act of the game was like</span></a><span>). However, </span><a href="https://www.realmofdarkness.net/dq/snes-dq2-differences/"><span>aside from altering some dungeon layouts and introducing some extra stuff to interact with</span></a><span>, none of these remakes have punched up the content of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>to better match that original vision. Keep in mind that its sequel, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span>, received a massive overhaul</span> <span>when it was remade on the Super Famicom way back in 1996, with new items, core mechanics, and content that </span><a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_III/Versions"><span>would mostly carry forward to its subsequent remakes</span></a><span>. The precedent was there for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>to get a glow up, but it never got one, until now.</span></p> <p><span>For this reason, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span> feels much more impressive than its predecessor in this package, even though the two games were treated virtually identically by Masaaki Hayasaka’s team. It too is very different from what it previously</span> <span>was, but it also feels closer in spirit to what </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>has always aspired to be.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646283">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake</em>: Party like it’s 1999ish</b></h2> <p><span>As you might expect, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> is also now a story-driven game. While the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>mostly treated the player’s party as observers traversing through the world, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D </span></i><span>makes the protagonists active participants in the unfolding events. The characters now discuss events at length that passed in mere seconds in the original game, and we get our fair share of “you couldn’t sleep either?” conversations in which the cast can intimately discuss their feelings. It’s not quite a “modernized” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but it does more closely match the jRPGs of the SNES and PSX eras, rather than the NES one.</span></p> <p><span>By focusing more on the main characters, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> builds off of that feeling of hopelessness that pervades so much of its predecessor. Back on the NES, the Princess of Moonbrooke occasionally felt like the little sister who you had to let follow you so your mom wouldn’t get mad. She contributes to combat, but her lack of defenses and low level cap could make her a liability. In </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span>, not only is she an invaluable party member, she’s practically the beating heart of the entire cast. Hers is the only kingdom to be destroyed by the villain Hargon’s forces, so her sorrow and desire for revenge give a weight to the conflict that never existed before.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As the Prince of Cannock tells the protagonist, “The princess fights to exorcise the grief and anger that cloud her heart…We may never be able to soothe the Princess’s pain, nor replace her family, but perhaps we can offer her another.”</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> lingers on that sorrow for much of its early game, but something interesting happens as it progresses. In the original game, the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/PswoKohVx4Y?si=u8OBkuXwGhmUM656"><span>world map theme that plays at the start carries a melancholic tone</span></a><span>, riffing on the equivalent theme in the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. However, once the party of heroes is assembled, the theme changes to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPKbuxLwELs"><span>a happier, jaunty tune</span></a><span>, marking the moment as a sea change for the rest of the game. This remake’s narrative similarly shifts in tone as it progresses. That overwhelming darkness starts to feel surmountable in a way that wasn’t felt in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>, and that theme of clinging to hope finally feels like it pays off.</span></p> <p><span>“But lately, I dream [of Moonbrooke’s destruction] no longer,” the Princess of Moonbrooke tells the protagonist later in their journey. “I dream instead of our time together. The meals we enjoy in one another’s company. The arguments. Even the battles. I once believed that the purpose of this journey was to see Hargon and his minions suffer as I have suffered. But I know now that this is not true. And I know this thanks to all of you.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646284">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The epic conclusion</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> isn’t just a <em>D</em></span><i><span>ragon Quest II </span></i><span>remake: it is the culmination of all the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest HD-2D</span></i><span> games. The villain Hargon has been built up and teased for two games now. It feels as if evil forces are a generational inevitability that can only be subdued rather than outright defeated. For someone who is freshly experiencing the first three </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games via these remakes, it might feel like this is just what </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is: Monsters endlessly returning time and again, like the villains of the week in an old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sentai"><span>Super Sentei</span></a><span> series.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> counterbalances this by showing how good works can become generational too. The heroes are regularly saved by relics of the past, like Princess Gwaelin’s pendant which both opens otherwise blocked paths and dispels enemy magics that confound the party. The legendary armaments crafted for the past Erdricks can also be found and used throughout this journey. The heroes of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> are younger than their heroic predecessors were when they faced generational evil, but the legacies of their ancestors give them the strength to do what couldn’t be done in the past: End this cycle once and for all.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>“It’s interesting to think that every generation between Erdrick and yourselves had its own heroes,” the party is told. “All those who came before you: your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents…All of them were heroes in their own right, if only because they kept Erdrick’s legend alive until you lot came along to repeat it.”</span></p> <p><span>This reframing of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> gives it a unique warmth in relation to the other HD-2D games. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span> technically has a party system, but it’s filled with generic mercenaries created by the player, so it still feels a bit lonely. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I</span></i><span>, as I described above, is a solo adventure despite this remake’s best efforts. So coming into </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span>, with its full party of developed characters, brings an end to those hours upon hours of isolation you feel by playing these games in this order.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646285"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646285">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Strength through unity</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> leans into this theme by adding the Princess of Cannock to the cast of playable characters for the first time in this game’s history. It’s a big departure from the original for sure, but given Yuji Horii’s original aspirations for the Princess to take a more prominent role, her inclusion feels appropriate. She doesn’t kill the protagonist (sorry, spoilers), but I think Horii would have agreed this direction is best even back in 1987. From a pure gameplay perspective, the Princess of Cannock is a major boon to the combat system. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>combat works best with a party of four, as this gives the player enough actions per turn to cast buffs and debuffs, and even to take a gamble on some status effects here and there.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Princess of Cannock also breathes new life into the party’s relationships with each other, offering fresh perspectives as the protagonists interact with the world. I can only describe </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> as overwhelmingly empathetic, with its heroes unifying the many peoples and species of the world with their kindness. Meanwhile, disorder notably divides the villains of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, with Hargon’s generals routinely sabotaging each other for personal gain. The Princess of Cannock mentions this outright, as it becomes a massive advantage the heroes can press over their enemies.</span></p> <p><span>“I am overjoyed! For I have seen that we can win!” the Princess of Cannock proclaims. “That victory over Hargon and his armies shall surely be ours! …There is no unity among the monsters. No harmony… Each is a law unto themselves. We, on the other hand, have made—and continue to make—allies of the people we meet.”</span></p> <p><span>These themes of hope may be new to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, but they’re not new to RPGs. Notably, however, they have gone out of vogue in recent years. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-are-giving-up-on-the-idea-that-we-can-save-1849727976"><span>As Michael Lee writes in his reflection on this very topic</span></a><span>, “The question video game narratives are asking has shifted from ‘How can we save the world?’ to ‘How do we live in the world we couldn’t save?’” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake</span></i><span> is modernized, but not so modernized to age itself out of this classic theme. The way it homes in on this concept makes it feel like an homage to the entire RPG genre as it evolved following the original release of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>back in 1987, and that story is exactly what we need in the present day.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646293"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646293">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The real <em>Dragon Quest</em> was inside you all along</b></h2> <p><span>Neither game in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>is profound in ways I’ve never seen before. I can point to games with better stories, better battle systems, games that are better at whatever criteria we use to discuss a game’s quality. Yet I found myself regularly tearing up playing these games, even during banal moments that shouldn’t elicit an emotional reaction. These games aren’t facsimiles of what they were before. But as I interrogated that deep response I was routinely getting, I realized that’s the essence of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest—</span></i><span>simple, poetic adventures that give us the space to slow down and reflect on our lives, taking whichever shape will reach us in the moment.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>invites us not to look at this series as a set collection of rules and systems, but as classics that </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>speak to whichever time period they’re revisited in. After all, while the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is a great tutorial for how RPGs work, the modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>fan doesn’t necessarily need one of those. Homer’s </span><i><span>The Odyssey </span></i><span>probably wasn’t created to be forever discussed in academic settings. But whether it takes the form of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F"><span>the tale of escaped convicts in 1937 Mississippi</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic:_The_Musical"><span>a series of musical numbers that are covered and animated by internet denizens</span></a><span>, the story continues to resonate throughout society. Were </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>a fully modernized, 3D reimagining, we’d probably look at it as a new game totally detached from what it was before. But it maintains just enough of a retro sensibility to bring RPG fans back to the halcyon days of their youth, even if the core essence of these games has drastically shifted.</span></p> <p><span>As Tim Rogers says in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-xi-the-kotaku-review-1828646512"><span>his very in-depth and very good review of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest XI</span></i></a><span>, “</span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games are bedtime stories.” I don’t think I’m the only one for whom calming my ever-present anxiety enough to get eight actual hours of sleep has been a struggle for these past couple of years. There have been so many layoffs in the video game industry that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/layoffs"><span>it got its own tag on this very website</span></a><span>. The cost of living is unconscionably high. My own career as a writer has been completely and utterly slashed to unrecognizable shreds thanks to </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs/"><span>shortsighted media networks</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/04/14/the-60-problem---how-ai-search-is-draining-your-traffic/"><span>AI-driven algorithm changes</span></a><span>. How can someone dream of a joyful future when just surviving for the next six months is an overwhelming prospect? Where does one find the energy to take another step forward in a world that seems to detest their existence?</span></p> <p><span>In this mindset, it’s all too tempting to retreat into nostalgia, living in a fantasy of “the good old days” as our bodies age and our minds wither away. And for the RPG enjoyer, there is no more reliable comfort food in such times than </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. I find it moving to think that those most in need of the hope these games offer may come to them seeking to blot out the world by retreating into the nostalgic comfort they offer and perhaps instead find the courage to face the darkness enveloping their lives. A world in anguish is a world that can be united. Evil is not an inevitability that has to endlessly repeat. Maybe we aren’t Erdricks, but rather, we’re the people simply enduring, searching for our own small destinies as we bolster our heroes. The sun will rise again no matter how endless the night may feel, and it will be because the suffering that connects us is greater than the philosophies that divide us. Those who oppress us are too disordered and too selfish to overcome a force as powerful as that.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>is the bedtime story for the broken. It’s comfort for those who desperately need to find their strength again, a reminder that it’s okay to dream of a world where we’re surrounded by friends and we fight for a brighter future. What we get here is not </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I</span></i><span>, nor is it </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, but its connection to the original form of those games is not arbitrary. Rather, through this reinvention, I once again remember the promise expressed by the gameplay loop of the very first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>: Take your time and get stronger. Know when to fight another day if you encounter a challenge you cannot overcome. Talk to those around you. Gather hints and follow the clues. The road ahead may be fraught, and you may face defeat. But always remember the time you’ve invested is not wasted. Fight bravely and do not back down. Persevere, and you will finally win.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-hd2d-remake-review-is-it-good-2000646277]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Honkai: Star Rail</span></i><span> publisher HoYoverse’s next game seems to be less fantasy or sci-fi than psychological thriller—something more akin to Remedy Entertainment’s </span><i><span>Control</span></i><span> than Nintendo’s </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, which </span><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> was compared to when it was first released. Clearly a horror game, </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span> begins with a job application that may cause “slight discomfort.”</span></p> <p><span>HoYoverse announced the game on Thursday with a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NccLyRQQZY"><span>31-minute gameplay demo</span></a><span> showing the world of </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>, in which the player-character approaches a desk to join a mysterious organization called SEAL (Shadow Emergency Alliance) whose headquarters looks to be a government building that shifts and changes due to “disruption events” caused by mindrot. The gameplay demo has about 20 minutes in the SEAL building, followed by a lengthy driving segment before heading out into the field where the player battles shadowy monsters while dressed like Harley Quinn.</span></p>

  <p><span>“Upon entering Varsapura, the protagonist’s appearance shifts to match each viewer’s preferences,” HoYoverse wrote in the YouTube video’s description, perhaps explaining the outfit shift from sexy cop to DC villian-lookalike. “The origin of this parapsychological effect remains unknown.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span> is also HoYoverse’s first game using Unreal Engine 5; </span><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> was made in Unity. The game shares a similar vibe for its characters but the broader art direction is definitely more moody and distinct. HoYoverse’s usual cel-shaded look has been swapped for more realistic, three-dimensional textures—the characters and design look more similar to the company’s </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833000/N0va_Desktop/"><span>Lumi character model from its desktop companion program Nova Desktop</span></a><span> than any of its previous games.</span></p> <p><span>There’s no information yet on its timeline for release. As of now, HoYoverse has three unreleased games in development: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/honkai-nexus-anima"><i><span>Honkai Nexus Anima,</span></i><span> a creature-collecting game</span></a><span>; </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/petit-planet"><i><span>Petit Planet</span></i><span>, a life simulator</span></a><span>; and the newly announced </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>. Beyond announcing the game, </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>‘s lengthy gameplay demo seems to be an ad to recruit developers: The video ends with all the different jobs HoYoverse is hiring for.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“</span><span>Hoyo literally said, ‘go get a job’ by a game,” one person joked on Instagram. </span></p>

              <p>Video game piracy, the common and controversial practice of copying and sharing games without paying for them, has its advocates. One of them was Anadius, a popular fixture in the <i>Sims</i> community for his “<i>Sim 4</i> Updater” tool which allowed users to pirate the game’s many expansions. I say “was,” because the fellow has gone dark, and in his wake, all that’s left is disappointment and disagreement over the state of the work he’s left behind.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All done!

But he didn’t take all of his toys with him; he left behind the source code for his work, enabling others to pick up the pieces and continue to sail the seven seas. Someone has already stepped in to do just that. Problem is, she’s locked these pirate tools up behind a paywall via Patreon.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Simmerella has shared the news on Patreon (free) that they'll be working on a *NEW* updater, and have been given all requireed files to make that happen.</p> <p>See their announcement below:<a href="https://t.co/Zks92KogfZ">https://t.co/Zks92KogfZ</a></p> <p>— GewoonIraj (@xLOLxLOLxIRAJx) <a href="https://twitter.com/xLOLxLOLxIRAJx/status/1991842574290583784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Popular <i>Sims 4</i> modder Simmerella took over Anadius’ work. But while some pirate communities are okay with paying a certain amount of money for access to troves of pirated material, this segment of the <i>Sims </i>community isn’t too thrilled, especially considering the fact that <a href="https://x.com/impekko/status/1991922291018698781?s=20">Anadius didn’t charge for his work</a>.</p> <p>There’s another potential wrinkle in all of this: the fact that Simmerella is using a popular funding platform to more or less sell piracy services. As <i>Sims</i> creator <a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1991888537718018510?s=20">SimMattically put it</a> in an X thread documenting the community reaction to the news, “you have to put your legal name and pay taxes on your Patreon earnings lmfao bless [Simmerella] and good luck.”</p>

              <p>The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB is the <strong>best-seller among internal SSDs on Amazon this Black Friday</strong>, and that makes total sense given what you’re getting. Storage speed is the single greatest determinant of whether your computer feels snappy or sluggish, as fast SSDs eliminate boot delays, application loading, and file transfer bottlenecks. This drive delivers flagship performance at pricing that makes it the best value proposition in the SSD market right now. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/">has it down to $169 for Black Friday, down from $229</a>, which marks a record low that places professional-grade storage well within reach of anyone building or upgrading a PC.</p>

<h2>7,450 MB/s Read Speed Eliminates Storage Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>The s<strong>equential read speed of 7,450 MB/s</strong> represents the ceiling of what PCIe Gen 4 technology can do. You boot Windows in under 10 seconds, fire up applications in an instant, and transfer large files between drives in a matter of seconds-not minutes. In-game loading, when the game is loaded on this drive, is faster than on SATA SSDs or hard drives, with some titles eliminating loading screens altogether through DirectStorage support. It makes a big difference in day-to-day use, where everything from opening folders to extracting compressed files happens faster than you expect.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential write speeds reach 6,900 MB/s</strong> to handle large file creation and modification with ease. For video editors working with 4K or 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains smooth, while render times significantly decrease. Content creators exporting large projects onto this drive find transfers complete in a fraction of the time that SATA drives normally would take.</p>



<p>The 2TB capacity allows for installing your OS, applications, and a substantial game library without relying on secondary storage. Modern games take up 50-150GB each, and with this capacity, you can store 15-40 titles depending on how large the files are. You keep the most played games installed and ready, instead of always having to reinstall and uninstall based on which one you want to play.</p>
<p>To achieve these speeds, the PCIe Gen 4 interface uses four lanes of bandwidth on compatible motherboards. The M.2 2280 form factor fits into the standard slots on modern motherboards without the need for adapters or special mounting hardware. This drive will work in older systems that have PCIe Gen 3 slots but will run at reduced speeds limited by that interface. Most motherboards from the past five years support PCIe Gen 4, making this drive compatible with the majority of current builds.</p>



<p>The <strong>thermal solution involves a heat spreader</strong> that radiates the heat during continuous operation. High-speed SSDs generate thermal energy during continuous intensive read and write operations, and proper cooling keeps performance within limits. The included spreader does its work quite effectively in most scenarios, but it’s even better with systems that have dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions. The drive implements thermal throttling, which drops the speeds temporarily when temperatures exceed safe limits, ensuring hardware protection while continuing operation.</p>
<p>Drive management tools such as performance optimization, firmware updates, and health monitoring are available through<em> Samsung Magician</em> software. You manage remaining drive life, securely erase data, and optimize settings for different workloads. The software normally runs in the background, usually alerting you to firmware updates or potential issues before they can become a problem.</p>
<p>At $169, you get Samsung’s flagship SSD with PCIe Gen 4 speeds for 26% off, dropping pro performance down to the mid-range drive price class.</p>
