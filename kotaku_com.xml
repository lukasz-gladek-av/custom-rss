              <p>New York state’s attorney general is suing Valve over its use of loot boxes in games like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>. Attorney General Letitia James said Valve “enables gambling through” its popular multiplayer games.</p> <p>On February 25, the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through">New York attorney general’s office filed a lawsuit against Valve in Manhattan</a>. The state is accusing Valve, the company behind Steam, the largest digital gaming store on the planet, of violating its laws against gambling while also claiming its loot boxes will lead to children becoming addicted to gambling.</p> <p>“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” said Attorney General James. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.” In the lawsuit and a press release, the state even directly compared Valve’s loot boxes to slot machines.</p>

 <p>Attorney General James criticized Valve’s system of charging people to buy digital keys to open virtual loot boxes and said that “Valve intentionally makes some items far harder to win than others, making the rare items more valuable.”<a href="https://kotaku.com/counter-strike-blue-gem-skin-sells-one-million-dollars-1851521593"> In 2024, a single <em>Counter-Strike</em> skin sold for over $1 million.</a></p> <p>In its lawsuit against Valve, New York is seeking to permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its video games and wants to force the company behind <em>Half-Life</em> to pay various fines for violating New York’s law.</p>

 <p>In 2023 alone, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-counter-strike-cs2-csgo-cases-keys-2023-1-billion-1851190615">Valve reportedly made nearly $1 billion off of <em>Counter-Strike</em> keys</a>. The skins and cosmetic items found in these digital boxes, which have been a part of many Valve games for years now, can be extremely valuable and are often sold on Steam’s marketplace. Valve gets a cut of every sale on this marketplace and has full control over it. In 2025, Valve made changes to how the skin economy worked and in the process, reportedly wiped out over a billion dollars, <a href="https://kotaku.com/counter-strike-2-cs2-valve-skin-marketplace-covert-red-2000638560">leading to a <em>CS2</em> crash among skin collectors, sellers, and traders</a>. Buying keys, opening boxes, trading skins, and selling cosmetics continues to be a controversial part of Valve’s gaming empire, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-gta-6-gambling-skins-violence-csgo-2000639821">YouTube cracking down on videos in 2025 that promote so-called “skin casinos” and third-party marketplaces.</a></p>

              <p>President Trump gave his State of the Union speech to Congress last night. I skipped it and played video games instead as part of my ongoing 2026 resolution to practice more self-care. But pinhead sycophants like CNN contributor Scott Jennings and Trump advisor Stephen Miller thought it killed, especially one moment in which the president tried to trick Democrats into appearing unpatriotic by not standing in support of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/us-judge-orders-release-of-five-year-old-and-father-from-ice-detention">ICE kidnapping kids off the street</a>.</p> <p>“If you agree with this statement, then stand up and show your support: The first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens,” Trump told Congress. Got ’em! Sick burn, Mr. President! That’s how the charmless toadies riding his coattails responded on social media. “Will be signature moment of this speech,” Jennings, who gets paid <a href="https://www.status.news/p/scott-jennings-cnn-deal">the big bucks</a> to launder fascist talking points on cable TV, wrote somewhat normally. “Trump nailed them.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why does this guy always talk like a World of Warcraft npc <a href="https://t.co/HWIIhBWpSz">https://t.co/HWIIhBWpSz</a></p> <p>— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/2026696988272546182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Then Miller responded like that friend at the party who promised you they they’d be chill and then moments later won’t shut up about the<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> banned card lists from 20 years ago. “Democrats declared to the world their searing disdain for, and profound disloyalty to, the actual citizens of the United States,” he wrote. “They were repeatedly entreated to stand. Over and over. They refused. It was a moment that chills to the bone and which will live for a thousand years.”</p> <p>Sounds about right for the guy <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/stephen-miller-danced-ice-ice-020716169.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABw1aucCtL0V3ooK882fxCGI3X9QkIovPuwGEiGYga_saAdGOLkXEfWwJdp4GXy_J7NKxRUKksUF1JrPccktILsrFTZ165XDBCDN7u8m0wwvMdWQaInFvi2yW8B2X6uw6y7LBUiRR3Mt7EH6_D3r_GLcmA3t8XWgmnGDKdlBQuuh">dancing like this</a> to “Ice Ice Baby” at Mar-a-Lago hours before his wife announces their fourth child. “Why does this guy always talk like a World of Warcraft npc,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote back. “Holy shit…Wasn’t expecting to catch that stray today…” responded veteran Blizzard designer Chadd Nervig in the comments. Previously a developer on <em>World of Warcraft</em>, Nervig now works on <em>Hearthstone</em>, which has immortalized some of the MMO’s best NPCs in card form. It would all be that much funnier if Miller wasn’t foaming at the mouth 24/7 to ruin other people’s lives.</p>

              <p>Full Circle, the studio behind the online-only <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-season-2-update-skin-tone-changes-tired-stoners-character-changes-2000649710"><em>Skate</em></a> reboot that launched last year, has announced that an unspeciifed amount of developers have been laid off.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">On February 25,</a> EA-owned developer Full Circle posted on its official website that it is “reshaping” the studio to “better support” <em>Skate’s</em> “long-term future.” What does that actually mean? Well, it translates to some members of the studio being laid off.</p> <p>“These shifts mean making changes to our team structure, and some roles will be impacted,” posted Full Circle. “The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of skate. Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.”</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA for more information on the layoffs.</p> <p>Full Circle says its work on <em>Skate</em> will continue, adding: “Our commitment to <em>Skate</em> and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.” The post wraps up with a message to the devs who are losing their jobs. “To our departing teammates: thank you. <em>Skate</em> exists because of your hard work and dedication to the craft.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">This is just the latest in a string of recent layoffs</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">and game cancellations at EA</a>. Full Circle’s post doesn’t connect these layoffs to the massive <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">$55 billion Saudi Arabia-backed buyout</a> that is currently in the works. <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-steam-reviews-microtransactions-always-online-2000626503"><em>Skate</em> launched in September</a> of last year with a high playercount on SteamDB, but the online-only MMO-lite skating game has struggled to keep players around and news of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-grom-paywall-location-new-map-island-2000671466">new paid map expansion hasn’t helped win back frustrated fans.</a> The game’s third season launches March 10.</p>
