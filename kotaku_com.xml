              <p>Amazon kept some Cyber Monday deals running on select items including this JBL Go 4 that punches way above its weight class in the sound department. The speaker <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/">is currently down to $39 from its regular $49 price, which is an all-time low</a> that makes it an easy pick for personal use or as a <strong>holiday gift at a reasonable budget</strong>.</p>

<h2>How JBL Made a Small Package Sound Big</h2>
<p>The sound engineering that went into this small speaker is all about<strong> getting bass response that usually needs much bigger drivers and enclosures</strong>. JBL tuned the parts inside to make what they call <em>“punchy bass”</em> which means that you can feel the low-end frequencies instead of just hearing the tinny mids and highs. A single driver and passive radiators in the speaker boost the bass without needing extra power or space. This means you get fuller sound from something that weighs less than half a pound. The JBL Go 4 is great for times when you want to hear real music instead of the thin, high-pitched sound that most ultra-portable speakers make.</p>



<p>With moderate volumes,<strong> the battery lasts up to seven hours of continuous playback</strong>&nbsp;which is enough for most day trips or outdoor activities without having to find an outlet. The <em>Playtime Boost</em> feature adds two more hours by changing the audio processing to use less power. However, you will lose some volume and bass depth in exchange for longer battery life. This is helpful when you’re at the beach or camping and remember you forgot to charge it the night before and it gives you enough power to keep the music going until sunset.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP67 certification</strong> means that the speaker can stay submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and is also completely dustproof. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the tap, use it in the shower, or leave it by the pool without worrying about splashes ruining the electronics. The tough outside is made of recycled plastic and has a fabric grille that protects the driver while letting sound through clearly. This environmentally friendly construction doesn’t make the speakers less durable; the materials can handle drops and bumps that would break less sturdy speakers.</p>



<p>With the $10 off, this speaker is now cheap enough that you might buy it on a whim instead of thinking about it first. For less than the price of good wired headphones, you get IP67 protection, surprisingly strong bass, and a battery that lasts all day. JBL built their name on providing high-quality sound at reasonable prices. This is the lowest price ever for a portable speaker that doesn’t sound like a toy and it’s easy to grab one and try it out for yourself.</p>
