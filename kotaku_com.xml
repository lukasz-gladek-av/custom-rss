              <p>You don’t exactly need a bulky tower taking up half your desk just to get strong, fast performance. A mini PC can do the job just as well, and Amazon is right now making it easier than ever to upgrade your setup.</p>
<p>The <em>Bosgame</em> P3 mini gaming PC (Ryzen 7, 32GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD) is<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5198/"> currently sitting at $399, thanks to a massive $150 discount on the retail price of $549</a>. It quite literally fits in the palm of your hand but still delivers enough power to push through busy workdays and fun-packed game nights. The retailer has marked the discount as a limited-time one, so it’s best to get your orders in before the price shoots back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5198/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Specs for Heavy-Duty Tasks</h2>
<p>This compact desktop runs on an 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7 7840HS CPU (up to 5.1GHz) based on AMD’s Zen 4 architecture. The processor is paired with 32GB DDR5 RAM and a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, so you can expect a faster overall performance, whether you’re working through a bunch of resource-intensive apps or a creative project that demands a bit more muscle. Using multiple programs at once, jumping between video calls and presentations, or navigating through a ton of tabs, won’t be an issue. There’s also going to be sufficient space to store all your important files, media content, and favorite games without feeling limited. Plus, if you ever need more, the system has an extra M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 slot to expand your storage.</p>



<p>Vibrant, lifelike visuals are made possible with the AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics running at 2600 MHz. It supports AV1 decode/encode and DirectX 12, and rivals the performance of a GTX 1060. You can connect up to three 4K displays with Bosgame P3’s HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C outputs, so it’s also great for bigger setups. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2, plus dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, two USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (10Gbps), two USB 2.0 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a DC input.</p>
<p>Your purchase will also come with a 1-year limited warranty, a 30-day hassle-free return policy, and access to 24/7 technical support. So if you need help with getting started or run into an issue, you’ll be able to connect with experts instantly.</p>
<p>The current deal brings the price of this powerful PC down to $400 from $550, but the offer won’t be around for long. Jump on it while it’s available.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-samsungs-ssds-before-black-friday-990-evo-plus-now-going-for-peanuts-2000640283</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-offloading-samsung%E2%80%99s-ssds-before-black-friday-990-evo-plus-now-going-for-peanuts.1340293/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything worse than low storage and slow load times when you’re working on something important? Probably not. If your system is starting to drag and you often find yourself deleting old files to make room for new ones, it’s time for a storage upgrade. And thanks to a solid discount on one of Samsung’s best SSDs, doing that just got a lot more affordable.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">Amazon has the Samsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB SSD listed for just $75, which is 29% off its regular price</a>. You’re saving a solid $30, which actually makes it cheaper than the base model right now. It offers plenty of space along with fast boot and transfer times so nothing is going to slow you down during your most productive, demanding days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plenty of Space for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>Starting off with the storage capacity – 1TB is more than enough to house a ton of work files, plenty of assignments, all your favorite media content (high-resolution photos, videos, movies), and even a few games. This capacity should be sufficient for most work professionals, students, and creatives out there.</p>
<p>As for speed, you’re looking at some of the best in the category. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus uses PCIe Gen 4×4 and is also compatible with PCIe Gen 5×2. You’ll get read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds up to 6,300MB/s, which translates into faster boot times and much quicker file transfers. No more staring at painfully slow progress bars that kill your momentum.</p>



<p>The M.2 2280 form factor means it works well with both desktops and laptops. Samsung’s Magician Software lets you monitor the drive’s health, install new updates, and enable extra encryption so that it stays optimized and secure over time. Best of all, despite all this power, this SSD keeps things calm and cool as it works. There’s a nickel-coated controller that helps with thermal control and keeps overheating in check during heavy tasks. It’s also more power-efficient, so you won’t have to worry about it draining the battery of your device.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, the Samsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB gives you massive storage, plus incredible performance, now at a lower-than-usual price. If you’ve been thinking about an upgrade, now’s a good time to make the move. And if 1TB isn’t quite enough for you, the 2TB and 4TB versions are also on sale, currently priced at $140 and $250, respectively.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>has gotten a lot of comparisons to classic turn-based </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>games since before it launched back in April. Sandfall Interactive’s RPG has been such a runaway success that people are asking Square Enix if it might signal to the storied developer that </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-turn-based-combat-clair-obscur-ff16-1851786128"><span>should go back to its turn-based roots</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVII</span></i><span>. From the looks of it, both studios have a great deal of respect for each other, with Sandfall employees visiting Square’s offices for an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927"><span>“exchange of ideas” in July</span></a><span>. Now, in the lead-up to </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</span></i><span>’s launch on Switch 2, the teams are collaborating on official art of each other’s characters.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just revealed at the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Final Fantasy VII Remake collaboration event in Paris, brand-new artwork celebrating both worlds.</p> <p>Made by E33 Art Director Nicholas Maxson-Francombe &amp; FF7R Creative Director Tetsuya Nomura! <a href="https://t.co/5w1gn3MEEQ">pic.twitter.com/5w1gn3MEEQ</a></p> <p>— Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (@expedition33) <a href="https://twitter.com/expedition33/status/1983995413956108528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The artwork was made by both Square Enix creative director Tetsuya Nomura and Sandfall Interactive art director Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, and features </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>leads Gustave and Maelle in Nomura’s style, while Maxson-Francombe draws Cloud and Aerith from </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>. Both pairs have swapped outfits, so we see Gustave in Cloud’s iconic SOLDIER uniform and Maelle in Aerith’s dress and jacket, and Cloud and Aerith are seen wearing Expedition 33 uniforms. Shoutout to </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-x-final-fantasy-vii-colaboration-event-in-paris.1339843/"><span>Delaney on ResetEra</span></a><span> for aptly describing the piece as “like when Gaga and Beyonce made Telephone together.”</span></p> <p><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-free-update-expansion-bosses-2000633193"><span>getting a major update</span></a><span> soon, and it would be a fun surprise if this art were a precursor to an in-game crossover with new outfits based on </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>characters. As for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>potentially nodding to </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>in-game, it wouldn’t be the first time </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>has done that sort of thing. I’ve never forgotten </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIII-2</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed </span></i><span>costumes, so it doesn’t seem entirely out of left field that we’d see something official in the video games themselves. For now, we have new Nomura art of some of the breakout characters of the year. Nomura has collaborated with several franchises over the years by reimagining characters in his style, whether that be in more straightforward crossovers like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-sora-super-smash-bros-ultimate-tetsuya-n-1849065582"><i><span>Super Smash Bros.</span></i></a> <span>or some more uh, maximalist designs like when he </span><a href="https://x.com/thegamersjoint/status/1778054077940973569"><span>remade Batman and the Joker</span></a><span> in his style.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nowhere-on-hps-site-this-17-laptop-with-1tb-ssd-gets-dumped-at-73-off-on-amazon-2000640293</link>

              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops on the market, but finding one that can handle everyday work and entertainment without unnecessary extras or a high price tag can be tough. HP makes some of our favorite options out there, and Amazon is making it easy to treat yourself to one right now.</p>
<p>We just spotted the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4946/">17.3-inch HP flagship laptop going for $699, thanks to a massive 73% off its original retail price of $2,599</a>. That’s over $1,800 in savings, and one of the steepest drops we’ve seen on a full-size laptop packed with massive RAM (32GB) and storage (1TB). This is a limited-time offer, and while it hasn’t been marked as a lightning deal, there’s no guarantee it’ll last through the week-end.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4946/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Massive Screen for Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>If you’re a student or a professional looking for a reliable machine for work, streaming, or light gaming, you’ll want something with a bigger display and more power. This machine delivers exactly that.</p>
<p>Display-wise, you’re getting a 17.3-inch HD+ anti-glare screen that not just offers a larger real estate to work on, but also pushes stunning, sharp visuals to make the content pop. The 250-nit brightness keeps everything visible in both bright and dim settings, so you can comfortably use it indoors or outdoors without straining your eyes.</p>



<p>For power, there’s an Intel Core i3-N305 processor with 8 cores and 8 threads. It can hit speeds up to 3.8GHz, which is pretty decent for most everyday tasks. There’s 32GB of RAM that prevents lag during multitasking, as well as a 1TB PCIe SSD for faster boot times. The SSD also gives you plenty of space to store your important data, whether that’s work files or school assignments.</p>
<p>Those who are often on the go will appreciate the impressive all-day battery life. Recharging is fast too, and you can expect to go from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes. It also includes Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 for faster connections, and a physical webcam shutter for privacy.</p>
<p>Best of all, you’re getting an accessory bundle thrown in with your purchase for free, which includes pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. You can get started right away without dealing with setup hassles or extra subscriptions. Just be sure to place your order before the retailer decides to shoot the price back up for good.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-iconic-spider-man-2-train-scene-comes-to-lego-now-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000640308</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-iconic-spider-man-2-train-scene-comes-to-lego-now-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon.1340221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s great, ain’t it? It’s a toy that appeals not just to children but folks of all ages. You don’t need to be a kid to enjoy a good LEGO set, just a kid at heart. It helps that there is a LEGO set for practically every fandom in the world. One of the most popular of which has got to be the many, many Marvel collaborations the brand has made. This set here that happens to be on sale depicts perhaps the most iconic set pieces from Sam Raimi’s original <em>Spider-Man&nbsp;</em>trilogy. I’m of course talking about the train scene from&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>.</p>
<p>Normally, the LEGO Marvel <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/">Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock subway train scene set goes for $55, but right now it’s on sale for 20% off</a>: That shaves off a nice $11 from the price, bringing it to just $44.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you were in middle school or high school in the mid 2000s, chances are you loved these films. Critical consensus (highest Rotten Tomatoes score) indicates the best of Tobey Maguire’s best of the bunch is&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em> and I’d personally credit that to it having more heart than the other.</p>
<p>The most memorable scene from the Marvel sequel (spoilers, I guess) has got to be when a maskless Spider-Man saves the subway train, slowing it down on the tracks by webbing the nearby buildings, then for the passengers to warmly agree to keep his identify secret. That’s New York, baby.</p>



<h2>Runaway LEGO Action</h2>
<p>The 393-piece LEGO set includes builds into the front train care and includes four minifigures. It comes with Doc Ock, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May, and Spider-Man, who comes with swappable masked and unmasked heads.</p>
<p>Use Spider-Man’s attachable web to recreate the iconic scene. Doc Ock comes with his four adjustable mechanical arms. Two of them are equipped with laser beams while the other two can attach themselves to the train, holding on. And J. Jonah and May are just there too I guess.</p>
<p>The set measures in at over 3 inches high, 9 inches long, and 2 inches wide. The roof of the train can lift off to give access to the interior.</p>
<p>Use the LEGO Builder app to help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
