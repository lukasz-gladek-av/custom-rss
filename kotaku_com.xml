              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early discounts are already dropping in right, left, and center. Those looking to purchase a new laptop for work or entertainment – we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>The 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which normally retails for over $3,000, is now going for just $990 on Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5446/">That’s an unbelievable 73% discount, but there’s still more. You will also receive a free accessory kit worth almost $200 with your purchase.</a> Of course, like most big deals, this one is also around for a short time, so it’s best to act fast to grab it. We’re expecting the discount to wrap soon, and there’s no telling if it will be back for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5446/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Everything You Need to Get Started Right Away</h2>
<p>Starting off with the accessory kit; it includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, an external optical drive, a wireless mouse, and a cleaning cloth. These are all useful add-ons, but Windows 11 Pro steals the spotlight. This operating system is one of the best ones out there in terms of overall experience. Microsoft has packed it with a bunch of security features, productivity tools, and system management options, making it ideal for work professionals and creatives. It’s also more expensive than the Home version, but you don’t have to worry about that here.</p>
<p>As for the laptop itself, you’re getting a massive 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) anti-glare touchscreen that delivers clear, vibrant visuals. Colors will pop while staying easy on the eyes. Touch support makes it easy to scroll, pinch, swipe, and type directly on the screen using your fingertips. You can use it to sketch and even take notes when you’re not feeling like using the keyboard.</p>



<p>There’s also an HP True Vision 720p camera with a physical privacy shutter paired with AI Noise Reduction for better video calls. The battery offers up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging the laptop in. And when you do need to recharge, it goes from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes!</p>
<p>Powering the device is an <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor with 32GB RAM</strong> for faster and more efficient multitasking. The <strong>2TB SSD</strong> lets you store all your important documents, media content, and programs with ease. Together, these are enough to help you be productive on your busy days where you need to work with multiple applications at the same time, take back-to-back video calls, create presentations, etc.</p>
<p>We highly recommend grabbing the deal as soon as you can, before the retailer pushes the price up for good.</p>
