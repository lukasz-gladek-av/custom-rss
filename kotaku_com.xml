It’s on this latest assignment that Reacher faces his toughest challenge yet: a 7-foot-tall bodyguard named Paulie. “He’s twice my size,” Reacher tells his handler. Yes...ha ha ha...<u>YES</u>.</p><p>Fans are already ecstatic. “Somebody is bigger than Reacher.  This alone is a solid reason to watch Season 3,” reads the top comment on the season 3 trailer’s YouTube page. “Finally, a worthy opponent for Reacher! This deserves unlimited seasons, keep em coming!” reads another. “This show should go on for 30 seasons,” added a third. </p><p><em>Reacher</em>’s success is part of a recent wave of “lean back” TV, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/05/08/1097514186/2-new-shows-fall-into-the-smart-dumb-tv-category&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/08/1097514186/2-new-shows-fall-into-the-smart-dumb-tv-category" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also known as “smart-dumb” TV</a></span>, that indulges in the fun and satisfying delights of storytelling that knows what it’s about, does it very well, and doesn’t try to take itself too seriously. Where <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em> revels in absurd but totally awesome courtroom antics, <em>Reacher</em> in unabashedly a show about a decent, stand-up guy who never found a bad situation that couldn’t be made right again through the careful deployment of his rippling biceps and manhole-cover quads.</p><p>In season 2 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://defector.com/it-is-now-time-to-discuss-jack-reacher-throwing-a-grill-at-a-guy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://defector.com/it-is-now-time-to-discuss-jack-reacher-throwing-a-grill-at-a-guy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he threw a grill at a guy</a></span>.
