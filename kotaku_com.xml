            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shooters rely on a pretty fundamental thing: You aim your gun at something, you shoot, virtual bullets hit a target. Unfortunately for those diving into <i>Battlefield 6</i>, that’s not always working out according to plan. Bullets, it would seem, are sometimes just passing through targets. A hotfix was issued to deal with the problem for now, but what was going on?</p>      <p>In a pair of posts to X (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-dev-confirms-the-ghost-bullet-problem-is-very-real-amid-bloom-debates-it-is-commonly-observed-with-the-target-being-visibly-hit-but-no-damage-is-confirmed/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>), <i>Battlefield 6</i>’s principal game designer Florian (<a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3">Drunkkz3</a>) stated that the issue seemed to involve the target being “visibly hit (blood splatters) but no damage is confirmed in the HUD.” The Battlefield Comms X account confirmed that it wasn’t a persistent issue, and it’s not a problem across all of the guns in the game’s arsenal. Only certain combos of attachments and weapons seem to trigger it. The devs issued a hotfix to deal with it.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're aware of reports of rare cases where bullets may not register damage correctly when hitting enemies.</p> <p>Following our investigation, we found this was related to certain weapon attachment combinations. A hotfix has been deployed to address known instances.</p> <p>We'll continue to…</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Ghost bullets don’t have to do with bloom or network issues</h2> <p>It’s a hotly debated and discussed topic: How virtual guns behave, how they recoil, how bullets get distributed in a given area. The recent <i>Battlefield</i> ghost bullet issue has kicked up some discourse around this, but <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978415319002603851">according to Florian</a>, this present issue has nothing to do with bloom (where a recoil pattern grows in size the longer you’re shooting to simulate the struggle to keep a gun steady the longer you fire).</p> <p>Furthermore, networking bugs (or just a slow internet connection) can also result in some unwanted aiming mishaps. <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978415667914096645">Florian also responded</a> to a comment wondering if the ghost bullets were the result of something as simple as someone having a crappy internet connection. “Some hit reg issues <i>can</i> happen as a result of bad internet or the game server performance being problematic,” he said, “but you will get performance icons at the top left when that happens.” The videos showing off the ghost bullets, notably, don’t show any such icons. So while we may not know exactly what <i>was </i>causing the ghost bullets, at least we know a few things that weren’t.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-the-apple-pencil-feels-pricey-this-stylus-pen-for-ipad-is-nearly-7x-cheaper-and-amazon%E2%80%99s-current-best-seller.1325440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sometimes, tapping around with your fingers just doesn’t cut it, and other times you just want the feel and control of a pen, especially when working on creative tasks or taking notes. That’s where a stylus pen can help, especially if you’re an iPad user. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4787/">Third-party options usually start at $30, but right now, you can grab one from Jamjake at Amazon for just $18, after a straightforward 40% discount.</a></p>
<p>This deal is for the white color. Other options are discounted too, but they’re priced almost $10 higher than this classic white version.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Super Responsive, Plus a Solid Battery Life</h2>
<p>This highly responsive pen comes with a 1.5mm pen tip that can replace your fingertip for precise input. It’s comfortable to hold, whether you’re using it to take notes, working on a detailed sketch, or just having some fun painting. Speaking of writing, it features palm rejection technology that lets you rest your hand on the screen without messing up your input; pretty much the same as writing with a regular pen and paper. You can also easily tilt it around for better angles without worrying about losing accuracy.</p>
<p>Getting started is quite simple – a simple tap on the top turns the pen on. As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a wide range of iPads released between 2018 and 2025. That includes the iPad 6th through 11th Gen, iPad Pro (11 and 12.9-inch models, including the M4), iPad Air 3/4/5/M2/M3, and the iPad Mini 5 and 6. It won’t work with older models or Android tablets, so we recommend making sure your device falls within this range before proceeding.</p>



<p>A quick 5-20 minute charge gets you around 8 to 10 hours of usage, and it reaches full charge in about 90 minutes. With these in mind, you’re easily looking at a full day of creativity without worrying about recharging. Note that it charges via USB-C, but the cable isn’t included with the purchase. The brand also recommends using a 5V2A power adapter to charge the pen. You are, however, getting extra pen tips in the box, so you will always have the option to quickly replace a worn-out tip without spending anything extra.</p>
<p>Altogether, this stylus pen is a great option for anyone looking to use their iPad more conveniently. It’s great for taking notes, working through large documents, sketching, painting, and much more. Get your orders in before the sale ends!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Govee is no stranger to our deals page. The company makes a wide range of smart LED lamps, bulbs, light strips, and holiday-specific decorations. This is a bit different from the brand’s flagship offerings. This Govee pixel light panel can be customized to your liking with different images, gifs, or information you’d like to have available at a glance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4786/">Right now, Amazon has the Govee gaming pixel light on sale for between 33% and 36% off.</a> There are two different size options, with the smaller one coming down from $120 to just $80 ($40 discount) and the larger one coming down from $140 to $90 ($50 discount).</p>
<p>The Govee RGBIC LED light panel makes for an excellent addition to your nightstand or desk, or makes for a wonderful gift so a loved one can place it on their nightstand or desk. The panel’s LED screen can display pixel art beautifully. It features over 150 preset scenes to choose from so you can match any mood or room aesthetic.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4786/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Customized Life Assistant</h2>
<p>The screen shows more than just art, though. It’s meant to be your life assistant. You can have it set to display the time and the calendar date. Have it display the weather, not just a number. Have a lovely pixel art scene of sunny skies or rainy clouds complement the temperature. You can have it set to show specific NASDAQ stock prices you’ve been keeping an eye on. Or even have it set to display a scoreboard of the Jets and whoever they’re losing to.</p>
<p>The Govee LED light panel works with the Govee Home App as well las Alexa and Google Home. So you can have it set to shift between your various scenes just with your voice. Ask Alexa to show you the weather, the Knicks score, or pull up that funny gif you love of Homer Simpson slowly backing up into the bush. Any gif can be uploaded and converted into a scene, whether it’s been downloaded from the internet or self-made. It only takes seconds.</p>



<p>This display makes for a wonderful holiday decoration as you can have it filled with jack-o-lanterns in October, turkeys in November, then snowflakes in December. Customize the scenes to show whatever it is you’d like.</p>
<p>The small model Govee LED panel measures in at 7.28 inches by 5.91 inches while the large version is 10.47 inches by 5.91 inches — so they’re both the same height, but the large one is wider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4786/">Get the small panel for $80 or the large panel for $90 for a limited time at Amazon.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-250w-charger-at-all-time-low-on-amazon-6-ports-for-less-than-a-single-fast-charger-2000635667</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-250w-charger-at-all-time-low-on-amazon-6-ports-for-less-than-a-single-fast-charger.1325395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your desk is likely swimming in charging cables at the moment: A laptop charger here, a phone cable there, perhaps a tablet brick in the middle of the mess and all of them claiming outlets and forming a knotted mess. Multiple chargers equal multiple power adapters, multiple cables and the perennial irritation when you have to plug something in but all the outlets are already in use.</p>
<p>A <strong>desktop charging station eliminates that mayhem</strong> by keeping it all in a single powerful hub: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">Anker Prime 250W charging station has just gone to a mere $99 from its original $169 price tag on Amazon</a>. That’s the cheapest this six-port powerhouse has ever been, and it’s packed with features that most charging stations don’t even attempt.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Six Ports and Power Enough for Anything</h2>
<p>This Anker Prime charger <strong>has a total of 250 watts spread across six ports – four USB-C and two USB-A</strong>. That’s enough juice to charge a laptop, a tablet, two phones and a few accessories all at once without any of the devices holding back.</p>
<p>The first USB-C port is the heavyweight and it is capable of <strong>delivering up to 140 watts on its own</strong>. That’s enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just 25 minutes which is faster than most standalone laptop chargers. The other three USB-C ports each max out at 100 watts, which is still more than enough to fast-charge any phone, tablet or smaller laptop at full speed. The two USB-A ports cap at 22.5 watts each which works fine for older devices, wireless headphones, or anything else that still uses USB-A.</p>



<p>Most multi-port chargers simply divide power automatically and you have no input into how that power is doled out: This Anker Prime has a 2.26-inch LCD screen on the front that<strong> indicates real-time power output for each port</strong>. You know precisely how much wattage each device is pulling which is handy for sorting out sluggish charging or determining which devices are wasting the most power. The screen also goes into a clock mode when you’re not charging so it serves double duty as a desk clock with the time and date displayable at a glance.</p>



<p>The charger offers four different charging modes: <strong>AI Power Mode, Port Priority, Dual Laptop Mode, and Low Current Mode</strong>. AI Power Mode is the default setting, and it uses algorithms to distribute power intelligently based on what’s plugged in and how much each device needs. Port Priority lets you manually prioritize one specific port, which is useful if you need your phone to charge quickly while everything else can wait. Dual Laptop Mode splits power evenly between the first two USB-C ports, giving each one 70 watts. Low Current Mode is designed for smaller devices like wireless earbuds or smartwatches that don’t need much power and can be damaged by higher wattages.</p>
<p>The charger uses GaN technology: This is a newer material for semiconductors that allows chargers to be more efficient and generate less heat compared to traditional silicon-based chargers. GaN chargers can also be built smaller and lighter without sacrificing power output, which is why the Anker Prime is compact enough to fit on a desk or shelf without taking up too much space.</p>
<p>The Anker Prime 250W has never been this cheap before at $99. If you’re tired of having a chain of chargers and want a charger stand that will accept all the charging demands on your desk top, this is the deal to grab before it goes back to its initial retailing price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-halloween-barn-building-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-before-the-big-day-2000635661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-halloween-barn-building-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-before-the-big-day.1325338/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October brings the spooky season and kids who love building and Halloween want something that combines both. Decorations sit on shelves gathering dust after a few days and cheap plastic toys break before the month ends. A LEGO set solves both problems by giving kids a hands-on building project and a decoration they can display long after Halloween passes. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4792/">LEGO Halloween Barn just dropped to a record low of $11 on Amazon, down from $14</a>: That’s the <strong>cheapest this 205-piece seasonal set has ever been</strong>, and it’s perfect for kids who want to build something creepy, tell spooky stories and add a haunted touch to their room.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cheapest Price Ever for This Spooky Building Set</h2>
<p>The <strong>Halloween Barn is 5.5 inches high, 6.5 inches wide, and 2.5 inches deep</strong> so it is small enough to sit easily on a shelf or desk without consuming a lot of real estate. The construction gives that old haunted barn appearance through weathered wooden planks in various shades of brown and gray, crosses by the windows and door and a crooked old tree that appears to have stood for decades.</p>
<p>The hidden surprises are what make this set fun: Open the barn door and you’ll see a mouth with fangs on the back side. The teeth are visible from the front when the door swings open and gives the barn a menacing face. The window shutters hide another surprise: an eyeball that peers out when you open them. <strong>These hidden features add an element of discovery to the building process</strong> so kids aren’t just stacking bricks. Inside and around the structure, you’ll find small accessories that add to the spooky atmosphere: There’s a bat, a lamp, a green bottle, a black jar, and the twisted tree that sits next to the barn.</p>



<p>The accessory set also <strong>comes with a skeleton mini-figure</strong> that’s a typical LEGO skeleton you’re bound to have found in other kits. It’s nothing unique or a proprietary piece but is good for its purpose of being a character for kids’ pretend stories for Halloween. The skeleton’s mouth is open and has moveable arms and legs so that kids will be able to position it in various spots around the barn. A vampire or a scarecrow would have been a better addition but the skeleton will do for a decent pretend play. Kids will be able to pretend that the skeleton is the caretaker of the farm or a drifting spirit or whatever scary character that comes to mind.</p>
<p><strong>In 205 pieces, this is a relatively quick building</strong>. Eight-year-olds and up will want to complete it in an hour or so, depending upon experience with LEGOs. Instructions are simple to see and are straightforward, and each step tells exactly where a piece goes. Younger builders will want help for a bit of the detail when it comes to the smallest pieces, but the building itself isn’t very complicated.</p>
<p>At $11 this is the all-time lowest that the LEGO Halloween Barn has been. This is a very reasonably priced way to get kids a fall building set that will be fun to use during the month of October and display seasonally. For a family that wants a gift for Halloween or a fun activity to do together, this set provides good value for the money without costing a lot.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-want-the-best-action-cam-the-gopro-hero13-ultra-wide-just-hit-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000635651</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-want-the-best-action-cam-the-gopro-hero13-ultra-wide-just-hit-a-new-record-low-on-amazon.1325335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>GoPro has been the standard in action cams for years and it provides a tremendous slate of models that span the spectrum from basic vlogging to extreme sporting. The <em>Hero13 Black Ultra Wide Edition</em> is the flagship of that lineup and pairs <strong>pro-level video capabilities with a larger angle of view</strong> that captures a greater portion of the scene than any typical action cam. It <strong>films 5.3K video at 60 frames per second, has 27-megapixel photo capabilities</strong>, and has the Ultra Wide Lens Mod included for a gargantuan 177-degree angle of view. Currently, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4791/">has the price slashed to a new all-time-low of $329 from $479</a>. That’s the lowest this model has ever gone, and it’s a hefty saving for a top-tier action cam.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4791/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GoPro’s Most Immersive Camera</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ultra Wide Lens Mod</strong> is the unique feature that sets this edition apart: Most action cameras offer a pretty good look around you, but the 177-degree viewing angle on this model is <strong>36% wider and 48% higher than a typical Hero13 Black’s standard-issue viewing angle</strong>. That’s a lot more sky, a lot more horizon and a lot more of the scene in each and every frame.</p>
<p>If you’re mountain biking, skiing, or surfing (any sport where you want the audience to experience this visually as if they’re standing right next to you), this additional coverage is a game-changer. The wider angle also provides a <strong>better awareness of the speed and motion of the action</strong> directly around the camera so that it’s less likely to convey descents or high-adrenaline moments that are slower and less exciting than they are in real life.</p>



<p>The<strong> flagship spec is 5.3K at 60 frames per second</strong>&nbsp;and delivers beautifully clear footage that plays smoothly. You’ll also be able to shoot 4K at 120 frames per second for your slo-mo shots, or 2.7K at 240 frames per second for very slow-mo effects. The Hero13 Black also comes equipped with Burst Slo-Mo for when you want to push things to the absolute extreme by cranking things to a very impressive 400 frames per second at 720p for 15 real-time seconds. That’s slo-mo enough to achieve clarity on details such as water droplets suspended in the air, or sparks flying around or debris hurtling through the air in extreme detail. For static photography <strong>the camera captures 27-megapixel images</strong> and you’ll also be able to pluck 24.7-megapixel static images directly from your movie sequences if you happen to miss a moment that you hadn’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One of the Ultra Wide Edition’s biggest advantages is the 1:1 aspect ratio recording function. Most cameras will compel you to choose horizontal or vertical framing before you even get started but the 1:1 format records a square frame that’s high enough and wide enough to crop for both directions in post-production. This gives you the ability to shoot once and thereafter have the option of deciding whether or not you want to <strong>export it as a 16:9 landscape format YouTube video or a 9:16 vertical video for the Instagram Reels or TikTok app</strong>.</p>



<p><em>HyperSmooth</em> video stabilizing has been a hallmark of Gopro cameras for years, and the Hero13 Black ramps it up a notch with <em>HyperSmooth</em> 6.0. Advanced algorithms in the camera smooth out shakes, bumps and vibration in real time so your footage appears steady even when you’re flying down a bumpy trail or navigating rocky water. The <strong>stabilizing is called unbreakable because it operates in all resolutions</strong> from 4K at 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>The camera is also <strong>rugged and waterproof to 5 meters</strong> when you have the Ultra Wide Lens Mod attached, and it <strong>drops to 10 meters when you replace it with the included standard lens</strong>. The Ultra Wide Lens is not designed for submersion because it’s not suitable for underwater work so if you’re going to snorkel or submerse yourself, you’ll want to change to the standard lens.</p>
<p>At $329, this is the all-time lowest for the Hero13 Black Ultra Wide Edition and a very sizable reduction from the typical $479.</p>
