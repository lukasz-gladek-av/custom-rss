              <p>If I try to think of brands that appeal to everyone across all ages and gender, the one that pops into my mind front and center has got to be LEGO. Whether you’re a kid or just a kid at heart, there is joy to be found in building a LEGO set. Assembling LEGO bricks piece by piece, can be a mindful, rewarding, and enjoyable activity. Then by the send of it, you have some cool <em>Star Wars</em> or <em>Marvel</em> toy to play with or display on your shelf.</p>
<p>The only catch is that LEGO sets can get pretty pricey, and when they do actually go on sale, it’s usually not by a lot or it sells out almost immediately. That’s what when a big sale does kick in, it’s hard to pass it up. Right now, this LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano set depicting the duel on Peridea has dropped in price:&nbsp;With the 40% off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/">you end up saving $22 as the price comes down to just $33 (down from $55) for a limited time</a>.</p>

<h2>From the <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em> Season 1 Finale</h2>
<p>There are too many Star Wars LEGO sets to count, and even a small handful depicting scenes from the recent Disney Plus show <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em>. This set portrays <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s duel on Peridea against Grand Admiral Thrawn’s army</strong> from the final episode of the show’s first season.</p>



<p>The <strong>382-piece set designed for ages eight and up</strong> includes five minifigures of characters from the show: We have <strong>Ahsoka Tano, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Morgan Elsbeth, Ezra Bridger and a Night Trooper</strong>. The buildable brick platform they fight on features three built-in turntables which can spin each minifigure allowing you to recreate their dynamic battle. You can even reenact Ezra’s leap off the platform with the launchpad.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p>Right now, the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s Duel on Peridea is discounted down to its lowest price yet of just $33.</p>

              <p>Cooking can feel overwhelming if you’ve never mastered timing, temperatures or knowing when meat is actually done. The Ninja <em>DZ550</em> <em>Foodi</em> solves these everyday kitchen frustrations by removing all the guesswork from meal preparation through its integrated thermometer that tells you exactly when your food reaches the perfect doneness level.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5066/">dropped this dual-basket air fryer from $249 down to just $129</a>, and the timing creates a great opportunity if you’re looking for restaurant-quality results without culinary school training. The <strong>two independent 5-quart baskets</strong> eliminate the stress of coordinating multiple dishes because the <em>Smart Finish</em> feature syncs everything to complete simultaneously.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5066/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Independent Baskets That Transform Meal Preparation</h2>
<p>The <em>DualZone</em> Technology offers <strong>two completely separate cooking zones with independent fans and heaters in each 5-quart basket</strong>. You can air fry chicken wings in one basket at 400°F while roasting sprouts in the other at 375°F. Both finish cooking at the same time, thanks to the <em>Smart Finish</em> feature that automatically calculates timing differences. The <em>Match Cook</em> function copies your settings from one basket to the other instantly; this is very useful when you need to cook larger amounts of the same food in both baskets, and gives you a total 10-quart capacity. IQ Boost spreads the 1690 watts of power efficiently across both zones. This improves cooking speed when you are preparing different items at the same time.</p>



<p>The integrated Foodi thermometer takes the guesswork out of cooking proteins by continuously monitoring internal temperature throughout the cooking process. Just insert the probe into your chicken breast or pork chop, select your desired doneness level from rare to well-done, and the system alerts you as soon as your food reaches perfection. This feature is invaluable for novice cooks unsure when meat is safe to eat. It also prevents overcooking expensive cuts by constantly checking and maintaining heat. The temperature range goes from 105°F for gentle dehydrating up to 450°F for high-heat searing and air frying, allowing you control over every cooking method.</p>



<p><strong>Six cooking programs</strong> cover almost every meal preparation scenario you’ll encounter: <em>Air Fry</em> gives crispy results using little to no oil by circulating superheated air around food at high speeds and creates that satisfying crunch on fries, wings, and breaded items.<em> Air Broil</em> applies intense heat from above to caramelize the surfaces of meats and vegetables. <em>Roast</em> envelops food in moderate heat for even cooking, perfect for whole chickens or root vegetables. <em>Bake</em> offers consistent heat distribution for cookies, muffins, and casseroles. <em>Reheat</em> warms leftovers without making them soggy like microwaves do. <em>Dehydrate</em> removes moisture at low temperatures over long periods, making it ideal for jerky, dried fruits, or vegetable chips.</p>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch footprint fits two large baskets</strong> while keeping counter space in check. The unit cooks food up to 30% faster than conventional ovens by eliminating preheating time and focusing heat directly around the food. Both nonstick cooking baskets and crisper plates are dishwasher safe for easy cleanup, and the nonstick coating prevents food from sticking. The gray finish resists fingerprints and blends seamlessly into most kitchen color schemes. This air fryer turns frozen foods into crispy meals in about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This is the lowest price ever on this Ninja XL air fryer, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>
