Its innovation was trading a set party of heroes for a cast of 108 total characters who could be recruited on your adventure. Combined with a world of rune-based magic and political intrigue, <em>Suikoden I </em>and <em>II</em> managed to carve out a unique lane in a crowded field, and now both games have finally been updated with modern bells and whistles for current platforms. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196766,196452" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ve played around a bit with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced-1851632968/slides/24&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced-1851632968/slides/24"><em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> collection</a></span>, which technically includes the much longer subtitle “Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars,” and am pleased to report two main takeaways. First, these JRPGs still have the juice, especially <em>Suikoden II</em>. The snappy turn-based combat and open-ended collect-em-all-fest holds up 30 years later, with decent storytelling and even better character writing. </p><p>Second, both games have survived the journey from low-resolution 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 HD mostly intact and looking better than ever. The character sprites remain perfectly pixelated-looking without any smoothed-over upscaling effects or muddy silhouettes. The backgrounds, never a series highlight, look crisp and get the job done. The tiling of its top-down world can feel a bit bland and repetitive, but certain scenes with more detailed shadows and lighting really pop. Most importantly, the battles still look and feel great, at least to the eyes of someone who grew up with these games back in the ‘90s.</p><figure id="" data-id="d7e22e5989ceecc9e18004a394b766ee" data-recommend-id="image://d7e22e5989ceecc9e18004a394b766ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters fight a bug in battle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For those unfamiliar, <em>Suikoden I</em> (1995) follows military nepo-baby Tir who comes into possession of a magical relic that jumpstarts a rebellion against the empire he had previously pledged to serve. <em>Suikoden II</em> (1998) follows childhood friends Riou, Jowy, and Nanami after a false-flag attack by their military unit leads them to be branded as traitors amid an invasion by a neighboring kingdom. The first game is about 20 hours long and focuses mainly on recruiting characters to aid you in your fight against the evil Scarlet Moon Empire, while the second is longer, much more narratively dense, and a bit more morally grey and complex. </p><p>Both are propelled along by random encounters and boss fights, toil made much better than in some other games thanks to <em>Suikoden</em>’s old-school but flashy turn-based formula and the fact that you’re always finding new characters with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses to fight alongside. Instead of just three or four characters, you get to fight with six, with front and back rows as well as synergistic combo attacks adding to the strategy. None of it felt  revolutionary at the time like the multi-cam cinematic quality of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> battles, but it’s crunchy and well-balanced as far as conventional turn-based combat goes.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec7665b9604a75378ac2a78cc4160011" data-recommend-id="image://ec7665b9604a75378ac2a78cc4160011" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character runs across a town.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So what improvements and new quality-of-life features does the <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> collection bring to the party? Aside from the graphical overhaul and updated script (the original localized versions were far from perfect), there are standard additions like auto-saves and a menu log that keeps a record of what people have told you. There’s no mini-map but you can sprint from the start now. You can speed up fights to auto-battle through them quickly, though weirdly the music speeds up during this as well. Plus there are optional difficulty modes now. The ability to turn off timed events is coming in a day-one update (certain characters can’t be recruited if the in-game clock ticks past a certain point). </p><p>It’s unfortunate that you can’t speed up the game outside of battle, and it feels like a missed opportunity not to have the option to turn on the game’s old graphics and aspect ratio for enthusiasts who want to revisit the original experience on PS1. The inventory systems in both games are also still a pain (though not nearly as clunky as how they were left in the recent <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>). An in-game gallery, museum, or other historical feature would have been a nice bonus as well, especially for the $50 price tag. The bar keeps rising for modern remasters of all-time classics, and it certainly feels like there was room for <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster </em>to be a more comprehensive package. </p><p>It doesn’t make any major missteps, though, which can’t be said for every PS1 JRPG that gets an HD makeover. <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> presents one good game and one excellent one (it’s sacrilege to say but if you’re short on time I think you should just play<em> II</em>) with everything a modern player needs to enjoy two genre classics (well, except for maybe an option to turn off random encounters). Konami has already announced an anime adaptation of <em>Suikoden II </em>and a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suikoden-star-leap-trailer-gacha-mobile-konami-date-1851767567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suikoden-star-leap-trailer-gacha-mobile-konami-date-1851767567">mobile spin-off called<em> Star Leap </em>that looks beautiful but has gacha microtransactions</a></span>. If this burgeoning <em>Suikoden</em> renaissance is successful, though, maybe we’ll finally get<em> Suikoden VI</em>, or at least <em>Suikoden III</em> as a PS2 classic on PlayStation 5.  </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The remarkable Hulu series is set in a world where rich and powerful people designed a utopian city called Paradise inside of a Colorado mountain in order to survive an extinction-level event that has ravaged Earth. The illusion of safety is shattered when President of the United States Cal Bradford (James Marsden) is mysteriously murdered in a place where crime isn’t supposed to exist, and it’s up to his Secret Service bodyguard Xavier Collins (Sterling K. Brown) to find out who did it. Samantha “Sinatra” Redmon (Julianne Nicholson), the brains behind the entire Paradise project, turns out to be a worthy adversary who’s trying to do the right thing in the absolute worst possible ways.</p><p><em>Paradise</em> does a lot of things well, but its shining achievement is showing how much of a badass Sterling K. Brown can be.</p><p>Known for his portrayals of stern but loving parents on his breakout show <em>This Is Us</em> and in the severely underrated film <em>Waves</em>, the Emmy-winning actor finds himself in some of the most intense situations of his illustrious career thanks to the Hulu series. Without shooting that many bullets or killing that many people, Brown channels the same emotional control that made his earlier characters feel three-dimensional to perform a role at the intersection of grief and anger. He isn’t a badass just for the sake of being one. He’s a badass because it’s the right thing to do. And these are his most badass moments from the first season of <em>Paradise</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-recommend-id="image://3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1687" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Ser Baffo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-recommend-id="image://3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1687" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a testament to how wildly the show’s character dynamics shifted by the end of the season, Agent Collins risking his life to protect the president from an assassin’s bullet in the first episode isn’t even a Top 5 most badass moment by the end of the season. While speaking to the press, Collins shields the president from a crazed boom operator who slides a gun out of his boom mic in an inventive but unsuccessful assassination attempt. In the moment, it was incredible watching Collins’ super-secret agent senses slow down time, allowing him to effectively react to the shot before it happens, and seeing him so focused on doing his job that he doesn’t realize he’s been shot until the President tells him. Unfortunately, revelations from later in the season  knock this badass moment down a few pegs, and it also suffers from not being presented from the boom operator’s perspective, which would have placed it squarely in the top 3.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-recommend-id="image://1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-recommend-id="image://1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There was no sequence in <em>Paradise</em>, or arguably any other show so far this year, as nerve wracking and suffocatingly intense as the one in which everyone in the White House realizes the severity of the natural disaster they’ve been watching take out entire countries. The seventh episode is centered on the chaotic day when the president let’s everyone in America, including the shell-shocked politicians outside the Oval Office, know that he and a few others knew about the cataclysm they’ve been watching, essentially telling them that death is inevitable for most of them. A true badass can oscillate between emotions at the drop of a dime, and Brown exhibited some of his most emotionally visceral acting yet as he was frantically worrying about the safety of his wife in Atlanta while also being tasked with getting the president through the mob of his hostile colleagues ready to tear him apart for keeping them in the dark. </p><p> He runs back to grab the briefcase the president needs to launch a nuclear attack seconds after the last person holding it was shot in the back of the head, then scurries to the helicopter without a single blink, tear, or even dust from the propeller entering his eyes. That’s a stone cold badass who unfortunately did it in service of a plot he’d quickly learn may have cost him the love of his life. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-recommend-id="image://9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-recommend-id="image://9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Verbally reprimanding your boss in front of his subordinates could get you fired from McDonald’s. Doing that to the President of the United States, and as a result delaying his evacuation from an extinction-level disaster, could (and probably should) get you shot before your lips formed an exclamation point. None of that matters to tearfully enraged Agent Collins after he finally realizes the President knew Collins’ wife was doomed from the beginning of the day. As he and the leader of the free world exchange barbs over the reality of the situation, Collins looks him dead in his dreamy blue eyes and mocks the president’s performative bravery for telling the American people the world was already ending before they had a chance to prepare like he did. He then makes the impossible choice to accept his wife’s death in order to be there for his children, etching this in the Sterling K. Brown badass hall of fame.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-recommend-id="image://03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-recommend-id="image://03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, Samantha “Sinatra” Redmon was a grieving mother who turned the grief of her son’s death into her life’s purpose to protect the ones she loved from a dying world, but she’s deserved a bullet in the head since the second episode. That quick shift from distraught to dangerous that I mentioned earlier was at its peak in the 10 seconds Collins went from a puddle of tears to a gun-toting killer after Sinatra implied that she’d accidentally had his daughter killed. This would’ve been a little higher on the list if he put the megalomaniac out of her misery. Unfortunately all he did was distract her long enough with a gun to her head for Sinatra’s own assassin, Jane Driscoll (Nicole Brydon Bloom), to put a bullet in her chest to disable her without killing her. I guess you shouldn’t come between a psycho and their Nintendo Wii.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-recommend-id="image://8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="825" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hulu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-recommend-id="image://8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="825" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are certain things in life that are inherently badass simply because describing them sounds unbelievable. Once Collins was ready to finally come at Sinatra, he called in the craziest favor you can ever ask a neighbor: Leave digital messages in the sky for all to see. In episode six, Collins had the messages “THEY’RE LYING TO YOU,” “DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?” and “WHO IS SINATRA?” displayed across the sky in crimson red. That alone was a badass move to destabilize Sinatra’s influence over the community. It became genius when the only way she could have it removed was by rebooting the sky. REBOOTING. THE. SKY. That alone accomplished everything he wanted, and she did it for him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd1ddb951399f549e32d8555f180c622" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ddb951399f549e32d8555f180c622" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins having an intense conversation over lunch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins having an intense conversation over lunch" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd1ddb951399f549e32d8555f180c622" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ddb951399f549e32d8555f180c622" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins having an intense conversation over lunch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>This Is Us </em>fans are well aware that if you give Brown time to speak uninterrupted about death, he’s going to rip your heart out and wash it with your tears. In the middle of his silent uprising in the sixth episode, Collins cuts through Dr. Gabriela Torabi (Sarah Shahi) trying to talk him out of his dissention with her psychobabble bullshit by vividly comparing Sinatra bringing all of these people to this idyllic city inside a mountain to the way people corral cows  into increasingly smaller spaces until the fight in them is diminished so much that they  “line up single-file and march down a chute to their death.” His delivery is bone-chilling, the analogy is sobering, and the interspersed visuals of Agent Robinson (Krys Marshall) finding Sinatra’s hidden armory during his speech are devastating. Speaking the truth is usually the most badass thing you can do, especially when it’s a matter of life or death.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-recommend-id="image://20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedell</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-recommend-id="image://20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The #4 pick and #2 pick have some overlap, but they’re not quite the same. With the help of Agent Robinson and a bunch of disillusioned Secret Service colleagues, Collins organizes a multifaceted coup of the powers that be. He and his cohorts surreptitiously steal all of the guns the government said didn’t exist, and hack the sky to tell the people being governed that they’ve been lied to, leading Sinatra to initiate the shelter protocol that had all senior officials and their families corralled in a secure location like the cattle he mentioned earlier. While his ultimate plan of imprisoning Sinatra with the rest of the corrupt officials doesn’t succeed, bringing a government to its knees is A-1 badassery. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Guns, blood, and government destabilization require bravery, but nothing is more badass than flying a plane out of a mountain into potentially poisonous air to find your wife who may or may not be alive. After 8 episodes of Collins doing everything from organizing a coup to berating the President of the United States after taking a bullet for him,  Collins commandeered a plane and took off to find his wife based on the secret coordinates the late president left. Season 2 will undoubtedly have him venturing into the unknown while his kids and everyone else he cares for back at Paradise deal with the aftermath of his uprising. No matter where he is, you can count on Collins to be the biggest badass in the vicinity. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
