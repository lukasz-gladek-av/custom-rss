              <p>If you had been hoping to snag yourself some cool new tech gadget on sale during Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days, you’re not out of luck just yet. While the event only extended from October 7 to October 8, some products are still on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> This Logitech webcam for example is normally listed at $40, but right now has been marked down by 36% off. That ends up saving you $14 as the price comes down to only $26 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The Logitech Brio 101 is a Full HD 1080p webcam that comes in your choice of either black or white and can be mounted easily on top of your monitor, TV, or laptop screen. The camera utilizes auto-light balance which can on the fly boost brightness and reduce shadows to allow folks you’re on the video call with to see you crystal clear, regardless of the lighting conditions of the room you’re in. Then when no longer in user, the cover slide can be closed over to ensure your privacy when you’re not on a video call.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The webcam has a built-in microphone so you can cut down on the number of peripherals needed to join and Zoom or Discord call with colleagues, friends, or family. It is also compatible with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and a number of other video conferencing applications.</p>
<h2>Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s follow-up to the immensely successful Switch saw some of the lightest changes from its predecessor. That’s not a bad thing. Many Nintendo fans just wanted more of the same, just on better performing hardware, though Nintendo can’t help themselves but to squeeze in one or two new gimmicks.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 features all new chat functionality including the ability to have video calls with friends. Some games even support integrating your video feed to the gameplay, super imposing your video onto in-game elements. Nintendo has its own proprietary USB camera and a handful of — but not all — third party cameras support the Nintendo Switch 2. Luckily, the Logitech Brio 101 is one of those that is supported on the Nintendo Switch 2, so you can enjoy gaming and chatting with your friends with a webcam at a fraction of the price Nintendo sells its for.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is listed at $55.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> The Logitech Brio 101 webcam is usually $40, but with the 36% discount, it comes down to just $24.</a> That’s less than half the price the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera sells for.</p>

              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>revealed at Gamescom earlier this year</span></a><span>, the trailer looked like a blocky version of the </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games, which we haven’t gotten a proper sequel to in a decade. Yeah, the name </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span> has been slapped on VR spin-offs and mobile apps, but there hasn’t been an honest-to-god open-world </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>action game since </span><i><span>Arkham Knight </span></i><span>in 2015. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-batman-batgirl-nightwing-dlc-wb-games-1850378621"><i><span>Gotham Knights</span></i></a> <span>came close, but was weighed down by loot nonsense and a miserable grind. Rocksteady, the developer of the original trilogy, pivoted to the loot shooter </span><i><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047"><span>which didn’t go over well</span></a><span>. So there’s been a dearth of interesting </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>games in recent years, and while I figured it would come to an end at some point, I just expect the next to come from </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>developer TT Games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>’s trailer showed the mini-figure version of the Caped Crusader grappling around Gotham, descending upon unsuspecting baddies, and investigating crime scenes just like he did in games like </span><i><span>Arkham City</span></i><span>. I played about 30 minutes of the game, and even though I hadn’t played any of the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games in a decade, my muscle memory kicked in when I was surrounded by a group of minifigure goons and the parry prompt appeared over one of their heads. People joke that </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>’s beat-em-up combat is a rhythm game because every action, whether it be a punch, the swing of a bat, or the firing of a gun, has an equivalent QTE prompt response coded into Batman’s arsenal of moves. When you really get into the groove, Batman is practically dancing across a battlefield as he dodges, parries, and punches, and even with the more snappy </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>movement, it still feels fluid and rhythmic. It is quite literally an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game, albeit with the slapstick </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>flair you’ve come to expect from its parodies. Batman’s finishing moves are less of the “you expect me to believe that man isn’t dead?” brutality we see Bruce Wayne dish out in </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>, and more silly stuff like covering an enemy’s head with a trash can. Foes still break apart like any Lego character would, but I guess if you can just rebuild anything in these games, that’s not </span><i><span>technically </span></i><span>Batman breaking his no-kill rule.</span></p>

  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>comparisons don’t stop at fights, as </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>also has an open world to grapple and glide around. Though the pieced-together Gotham City might not be as atmospheric and dour as Rocksteady’s, getting around the crime-ridden Lego metropolis is just as satisfying. It’s easy to get distracted grappling to every high platform or gliding around with Batman’s wings spread over the city, but </span><i><span>Legacy </span></i><span>has enough of the random crime missions and collectibles that even a detour from your original objective is usually rewarded with something to do. You’re also able to ride around the city in the Batmobile, but I was so caught up in flying around the rooftops that I actually forgot to head to the ground level and drive around. My bad.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>clearly has a lot of </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>influence, it still has </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>foundations. The game can be played with couch co-op or by swapping between characters on the fly if you’re riding solo. The section I played, which had Batman and Commissioner Gordon infiltrating an Ace Chemicals plant, had puzzles that required both characters to solve. Batman’s gadgets can clear certain obstacles–his grappling hook, for instance, letting you pull locks off walls and crates–while Gordon has a gun that can stop up air vents or leaking pipes to clear the way for you to move forward. It’s easy enough to go back and forth between characters, but I imagine those segments will feel more rewarding when you have a second player next to you and it actually feels like a team effort. Gordon is one of several buddy characters Batman will team up with in </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>People might have an image of </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games in their minds as games with simple co-op action and a lot of referential humor, and </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>has all of that. But it’s also the closest thing to an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game we’ve gotten in years, and what I played so far makes it feel like a competent one. We’ll see how well it holds together or breaks apart when it comes to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2 in 2026.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell’s decided to show the competition just how a serious laptop deal gets done. They’ve taken one of their premier models — a 2025 Inspiron 15.6-Inch Full-HD Touchscreen with 32GB of RAM, a massive 2TB SSD, and Windows 11 Professional preloaded — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/">and taken a 72% hack out of its price, listing it for just $869 at Amazon</a>. For added incentive they’re throwing in a $199 accessories bundle, with a wireless mouse, USB hub, and more, on the house.</p>
<p>All that built-in processing heft, not to mention the Intel 13th Gen 10-core i5-1334U processor with 12M cache and speeds reaching 4.6GHz, are almost unheard of in a laptop being offered at such a dramatically reduced price. Then there’s the touchscreen, which presents all sorts of possibilities, especially when you add an inexpensive stylus to mark up, draw, edit, and perform all kinds of productive and creative tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Absolute Upgrade</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve bought a brand-new laptop within the past 12 months or so, this 2025 model Dell Inspiron touchscreen laptop would almost certainly be an upgrade for you, even above and beyond the preloaded Windows 11 Pro with Microsoft Copilot that would normally cost you a subscription fee. When you read about all the perks and bells and whistles packed into this Dell Inspiron, you might just start looking differently at your current laptop and all of its little flaws, slowdowns, and outdated bits.</p>
<p>And while that 2TB SSD is more than likely going to be enough for as long as you have this Dell laptop, you can add to the ample 32GB of RAM for faster and more efficient multitasking by adding to the two available memory slots, all the way up to 64GB. The Wi-Fi 6 connection will be among the fastest for some time to come, and the vast range of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and an SD card reader, add to the future-proof qualities of this Dell laptop.</p>



<h2>Don’t Ask Questions</h2>
<p>What else can we say about this seriously upper-echelon Dell touchscreen laptop? It’s ultra-slim in construction and weighs a very commuter-friendly 3.66 pounds, so there’s no size issue. You might be able to take issue with the modest 6-hour battery life, but as complaints go, that’s small potatoes.</p>
<p>Is this a post-Prime Day deal? Or is it a very-very-early Black Friday deal? There’s really no sense overthinking it when you see a outstanding laptop like this 2025 Dell Inspiron with a 15.6-inch full-HD touchscreen, tons of memory and storage, Windows 11 Pro and Copilot locked and loaded, and a bundle of free accessories take a huge price dip like this. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/">Head to Amazon now before someone changes their mind about offering this superstar laptop for just $869.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over 250 developers at <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108"><em>MindsEye</em> maker</a> Build A Rocket Boy were laid off earlier this year following the AAA open-world shooter’s disastrous launch. Now, over 90 current and former staff have signed an open letter blasting the studio’s management, including founder and long-time <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ioi-hitman-everywhere-mmo-1851673924"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em>&nbsp;producer Leslie Benzies</a>, over what they claim were poor working conditions and a chaotic layoff process that allegedly broke the law. “The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand,” ex-employee Ben Newbon wrote in a statement.</p> <p>Published by<em> Hitman</em> maker IO Interactive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-steam-reviews-bugs-glitches-update-refunds-1851784312"><em>MindsEye</em> launched in early June</a> and was immediately met by harsh criticism from players, streamers, and reviewers. It was pitched as the first building block in the well-funded studio’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117">ambitious user-generated metaverse MMO</a> called <em>Everything</em>. In reality, it was hard to see it being the start of anything but painful cuts for the new startup studio with offices dotted around Europe. Mass layoffs, first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, immediately followed. According to the open letter, organized by Britain’s IWGB Union trade group, over 250 developers at the company were eventually swept up into its hasty and chaotic layoff process despite having been allegedly forced to work mandatory overtime in the four months leading up to launch.</p>

 <p>“This week, members of the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union are filing multiple legal actions against BARB, claiming failure to carry out fair consultation ahead of redundancies as well as multiple cases of unfair dismissal,” the trade group announced on October 10. “In an open letter&nbsp;to BARB leadership, employees describe a record of&nbsp;systemic mistreatment, mismanagement, and mishandling of the redundancy process.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We stand in solidarity with employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy as they file legal claims through our union and publish an open letter, condemning the way in which they’ve been mistreated and discarded by the studio’s millionaire executives. <a href="https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd">https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd</a> <a href="https://t.co/bOOHaQEakQ">pic.twitter.com/bOOHaQEakQ</a></p> <p>— IWGB Game Workers (@IWGB_GW) <a href="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Concerns outlined in the letter include poor transparency and communication, extended crunch, and a “disastrous” handling of the layoff process. The current and former developers who signed it are calling for a public apology, the option for staff who haven’t hit their layoff date to take payment for it without working, a promise to use professional partners outside the studio for any future layoffs, and a “documented effort” to improve working conditions, including acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union for the studio.</p>

 <p>“Many fantastic, hard-working developers have felt used and discarded, while public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions,” <em>MindsEye</em> audio engineer Isaac Hudd said in a statement. “A pattern of poor decisions from senior management has led to a disappointing launch and ongoing challenges for both players and employees.”</p>

 <p>Despite a concerning swirl of exiting executives and broken promises at launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> over the summer that <em>MindsEye</em> director Benzies, who worked on <em>GTA</em> at Rockstar Games for over a decade, blamed the studio’s troubles on internal and external saboteurs hoping for Build a Rocket Boy’s failure. “The callousness shown by management towards staff at Build A Rocket Boy is truly awful,” Ben Newborn, former lead games analyst at the studio, said in a statement. “Even before the disastrous launch of<em> MindsEye</em>, staff had suffered months of crunch, resulting in some horrific mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the typical widespread burnout.”</p> <p>He continued, “Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game’s failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this.”</p>
