              <p>Last year, Sony released a new PS5 Dualsense controller themed around the then-upcoming platformer <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Astro Bot</a>.</em> The game was a huge hit with critics and fans, as was the controller, which sold out quickly and became hard to find. But now, a slightly tweaked version of the popular gamepad is returning in October with pre-orders later this month.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092">On September 2</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-five-new-free-levels-july-10-cameo-bots-ps5-1851786014">after some teasing in July,</a> PlayStation revealed that the new “Joyful” version of the<em> Astro Bot</em> PS5 controller was officially launching just before Halloween, on October 30. And gamers who missed out on buying an <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> controller last year will have a chance to pre-order the new version on September 12 at 10 a.m. local time via PlayStation’s own online store and “participating retailers.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Astro Bot returns with a new delightful twist! </p> <p>The limited edition Astro Bot Joyful DualSense launches October 30. Pre-orders start September 12 at 10am local time at <a href="https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG">https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG</a> and participating retailers. <a href="https://t.co/TLqJEyEZSt">pic.twitter.com/TLqJEyEZSt</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This isn’t the same controller that was sold back in 2024 and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controllers-are-being-scalped-for-over-150-second-hand-market-exclusive-items/">quickly gobbled up and scalped on eBay</a> for more than twice the price. Well, it’s mostly the same controller. The only real difference is the touchpad. On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">OG <em>Astro Bot</em> gamepad</a>, the eyes were open and always watching you play. This time around, the eyes are slightly closed, simulating joy and happiness. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-edition-dualsense-astro-bot-pre-order-1851607894">It’s a bit less creepy, which is nice</a>.</p>

 <p>No price was shared for this new version of the controller, but last time PlayStation sold the <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller, it was priced at $80. Still, the new<em> Astro Bot</em> pad might cost a bit more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ps5-controller-last-of-us-dualsense-ugly-price-sony-1851768135">The boring and ugly <em>Last-of-Us</em>-themed Dualsense controller from Sony cost $85 earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>Whatever it costs, you can expect it to go for much more when resellers inevitably grab up a ton of them and sell them on eBay. Heck, the original <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller still goes for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Astro+Bot+controller&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313">$110 to $160 sealed on the internet’s ancient auction house</a>. So if you really want a joyful <em>Astro Bo</em>t-themed Dualsense controller and you don’t want to pay $200 or whatever, I’d be hanging out at your computer on September 12, ready to pre-order the moment they go live. Good luck with that!</p>

              <p>How can it possibly have taken 22 years for a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> movie to go into production? That’s how long it’s been since the very first WW2-themed FPS game in the franchise was released, and yet at no point over its many incarnations and decades has it come to movie theaters. That is about to change, as Paramount has agreed to a deal with Activision to convert the enormously popular shooty-bang games to the big screen.</p> <p>Whether the <em>Call of Duty</em> film will be directly adapted from any particular game or series is as of yet unclear, and given the series has at various points been a somber Second World War simulation, a ludicrous blockbuster futuristic war-wank fantasy, a zombie FPS, and now, more than anything else, a massive multiplayer shooter, that leaves a lot of room. You might imagine if the movie were due out soon, it’d make sense to focus on the <em>Black Ops</em> vein, given that’s the theme of both this and last year’s entries. But since it’s only just being announced as a deal, a million miles away from having a script or appointing a director, it’s possible everyone will be long over that angle by the time anything is released. Going back to the series’ roots also seems an unlikely choice, given WW2 cinema is a very well-trodden path with some legendary films against which it would be compared.</p> <p>Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a press release that the deal is a “dream come true.” He added, “From the first Allied campaigns in the original <em>Call of Duty</em>, through&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em> and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops</em>, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.”</p>

 <p>Citing&nbsp;<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, presumably in an effort to show the studio has the right sort of form, Ellison said, “We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence…ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand–thrilling longtime fans of <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;while captivating a whole new generation.”</p> <p>There were no clues about the specific approach the creative team would be taking to adapting the franchise in Activision’s grimly banal press blurb either. Activision president Rob Kostich waffled about “the incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world,” and called Paramount “a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment.” Bleurgh.</p>

 <p>I’m fascinated to learn how a deal is only happening now, given&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>‘s dominance over gaming for so many years, and the games that&nbsp;<em>have</em> had cinematic conversions. It would seem like a no-brainer to slap the words “<em>Call of Duty</em>” and a colon onto pretty much any war movie and rake it in, given the games long ago abandoned anything about their storytelling that is distinctive or worthwhile. A bunch of men gruffly shouting how cross they are and then running through a crumbling building doesn’t seem like a big stretch for Hollywood.</p> <p>A movie is likely at least three or four years away in the best circumstances, so don’t go trying to book tickets just yet. It seems vastly more likely that it’ll take a lot longer, as the budget will inevitably be enormous, so too many executive eyes will be on the script, then interfering with development, then driving a director off the lot in frustration…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s Tuesday, but it feels like Monday thanks to Labor Day giving many of us the day off. But that weird feeling and a short week won’t stop the Morning Checkpoint. Today, we learn more about Ubisoft’s potential plans for <em>Rayman</em>, catch up on <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/pax-west-2025">PAX West 2025 news</a>, and see how a group of modders is reviving <em>The Crew</em> after Ubisoft killed its servers last year. Also, another game gets delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>. And good news: The next Benoit Blanc murder mystery movie hits theaters this Thanksgiving.</p> <h2><em>The Crew Unlimited</em> brings the racing game back online</h2> <p>In April 2024, Ubisoft shut down the servers powering its 10-year-old open-world racing game<em> The Crew</em>. This made it unplayable, and that didn’t go over well with fans. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-killing-games-the-crew-lawsuit-shutdown-offline-1851695302">the shutdown led to legal battles and a whole “Stop Killing Games” movement</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">as reported by <em>RPS</em></a>, the game that started all of it has been revived, but not by Ubisoft.</p> <p>Instead, <em>The Crew Unlimited,</em> a free mod for the PC version of the racing game, is being built and supported by a group of modders. The mod, which has been in development for about a year now, is set to arrive on September 15. The core of the mod is a server emulator that will let players essentially trick the game into thinking the official Ubisoft servers are still operating like it’s 2014. You can even, with some work, run the server emulator on your own PC, effectively giving players the offline mode they’ve begged Ubisoft for over the last decade. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034">And something which Ubisoft is adding to<em> The Crew 2</em> and its sequel.)</a></p>

 <p>While the mod looks like it won’t be the easiest thing to set up, videos of it in action look great, with the devs even making some minor fixes and tweaks to <em>The Crew</em> based on fan feedback. If publishers won’t help preserve video games, fans will do it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244">It’s been like this for decades, and I doubt anything will change soon</a>.</p> <h2>Another game has been delayed because of <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p><em>Silksong’s</em> surprise September 4 launch and $20 price tag have caused many other indie games to panic and flee the days around the game’s release date. And we can add another game to the list:<em> Star Birds</em>. This is the next game from the <em>Dofromantik</em> developers and it’s a colorful strategy management game based on a popular educational YouTube channel. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2719750/view/538863491448046148?l=english"><em>Star Birds</em> was set to arrive on September 4, but will now launch six days later on September 10</a>.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft reportedly wants to make a <em>Rayman 4</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">👊 🎉Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy 🎂🥳</p> <p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p> <p>— Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/">A new report from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> claims that the previously reported <em>Rayman</em> remake is progressing nicely, and the plan is to launch the game in 2026. <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694">In a new video</a> from Ubisoft celebrating the 30th anniversary of the platforming series, Ubisoft confirmed that it was working on a new <em>Rayman</em> game but warned that more news wouldn’t come anytime soon.<em> Insider Gaming</em> reports that the remake is the new game and that if it sells well enough, Ubisoft will develop a <em>Rayman</em> <em>4</em>. Reportedly, there are already “preliminary plans” in place for that sequel.</p> <h2>Capcom president blames PS5’s high price for soft numbers</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/capcoms-president-says-high-price-of-ps5-has-contributed-to-low-sales-of-monster-hunter-wilds">As spotted by <em>GamesIndustry.biz,</em></a> in a recent interview, Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto partially blamed the “soft” sales of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on the high cost of the PlayStation 5. While <em>MonHun Wilds</em> sold incredibly well out of the gate, becoming the fastest-selling Capcom game in the company’s history, the publisher’s most recent financial results called the game’s sales in Q1 2025 “soft.” According to Tsujimoto, you can blame that on the high price of a PS5 in most parts of the world.</p> <p>“The console costs about ¥80,000 ($538). When you factor in the cost of software and monthly subscriptions, it comes to about ¥100,000 ($672) at the time of purchase. This is not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations. This situation is not limited to Japan, but is similar overseas as well,” said Tsujimoto.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">Our report on the <em>Borderlands 4</em> rage room at PAX West 2025</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695">Hands-on impressions of <em>Silksong</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094"><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s</em> intro is still amazing on Switch 2</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
