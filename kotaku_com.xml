              <p><i>No Man’s Sky</i> continues to grow and expand with the seemingly endless updates developer Hello Games continues to toss out for free. Lately, user-made ships have been all the rage. The range of options now available for a custom spacecraft has led to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">stunning original creations</a> as well as tributes to classic ships from other science fiction franchises. But Tosk, an <i>NMS</i> fan who’s been playing the game since launch, recently took to recreating not a ship, but a key location found in Studio Ghibli’s classic animated film, <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i>. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/KJJ8VJE3SmU">Tosk’s video walkthrough</a> of his creation here:</p>  <p>I recently DM’d back and forth with Tosk to get a sense of the challenge of finishing a project like this in <i>No Man’s Sky</i>. Like any worthy endeavor, all it takes is time, perseverance, and, perhaps most importantly, inspiration. In this case, that was Tosk’s love of Studio Ghibli films. “<i>Totoro </i>is my favorite,” he told me. “It’s like a warm nostalgia blanket! Such a sweet innocent story of childhood wonders. It [also] has environmental themes but doesn’t hit you over the head with it.”</p>

The first challenge? Finding the right planet. Tosk scouted <i>NMS</i>’ procedurally generated universe far and wide for not just a suitable habitat, but one adorned with the right “Ghibli green,” he told me. That search alone took a month. “I did find about three or four sites that were possibilities,” he said, “but to find the right combination of color flora and a spot where I could build on flat land with a cave nearby a hill above it took a long time.” Just a random paradise planet wouldn’t do.</p>

 <p>Once he found that picture-perfect world, Tosk said it took around 100 hours to put the base together, much of it made “using free placement, so it was put together by hand, which takes a long time. It came in at just under 3000 parts, which is the build limit for uploading in <i>NMS</i>.” As it was done on PS5, no mods were used but, as he describes in the walkthrough video, there’s some “scale and color glitching” at work. He also “used the film a lot as reference for the floor plan, but the layout changed a bit from shot to shot, so I had to take a few creative liberties.”</p>

So I had to go back and rebuild a lot of it. I nearly gave up on it then, to be honest.”</p>

 <p>Thankfully, Tosk persisted. Unfortunately, due to an issue with the game right now, users can’t visit Tosk’s creation without him also being online and present in the area. But even when that issue is fixed, you’ll have to do some work to find Totoro’s location. The planet is in the Istentam galaxy, but Tosk has deliberately hidden the glyphs necessary to find it in his tour video.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">15 Amazing&nbsp;<em>No Man’s Sky</em> Ship Builds You Have To See</a></p> <p>I was curious what project is next for Tosk. “I’ve been thinking about making the floating island from <i>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</i>,” another Studio Ghibli joint. “But to be honest,” he said, the <i>Totoro</i> build “has taken so long that I might just play for a while.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Developer Behind Hit 2025 Game Thinks The Response Has Been ‘Too Positive’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developer-behind-hit-2025-game-thinks-the-response-has-been-%E2%80%98too-positive%E2%80%99.1347313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I am convinced that I can get better at <a href="https://kotaku.com/ballxpit-devolver-kenny-sun-brickbreaker-indie-2000635720">playing <em>Ball X Pit</em></a>, but whether I win or lose often seems to have little connection to my actual moment-to-moment skill. Sure, I can be smarter about my upgrade picks. I can aim and maneuver to maximize my DPS and avoid some attacks. But in the aggregate, my success feels more or less predetermined by an invisible curve that’s slowly progressing me through the metagame.</p> <p>“I think there is a bit of a skill curve, but I do think it plateaus pretty quickly,” lead developer Kenny Sun <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ball-x-pit-x-interview">told<em> Game File</em></a> this week. “Once you get it, there’s not much you can do to improve your play. So, it is very much a game about pretending that you’re getting better by getting better stats, actually.”</p>

 <p>Rarely has a developer so perfectly articulated my ambiguous and conflicted feelings about their game!</p> <p>Look, <em>Ball X Pit</em> is great. The smart mashup of <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-balatro-kill-the-brickman-poncle-roguelike-2000619132"><em>Breakout</em> and <em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> is way more than just a cash-in on one of Steam’s hottest genres. It’s part shoot ’em up, part buildcrafting roguelike, and part management sim. And it’s not just nice to look at and listen to while you’re watching the numbers go up. There are new levels to reach with unique hazards and tons of characters to unlock that subvert the core ball-throwing mechanic in interesting ways.</p>

 <p>But still, I have a hard time not feeling slightly tricked and manipulated as I play, even if after each break I eventually come back for more. It’s the same way I felt about <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and later <em>Balatro</em>, and most recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-silent-hill-jurassic-world-dispatch-2000638933"><em>Slots &amp; Daggers</em></a>. Sun said this is partly by design.</p>

 <p>“I kind of like the idea of having it start off as one thing and then slowly evolve into an idle game,” he told<em> Game File</em>. “Like, the more you play, the less you play.” He continued, “That’s something that one of my artists was talking about: He had this idea about how games were kind of turning into a thing where players just want to play less of the game. Like, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is all about not playing the game.”</p>

 <p>In other words, the more I play, the more I’m actually not playing, which makes me want to play even more. This is nothing completely new. You can sense the <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-video-game-loot-is-so-addictive-according-to-the-c-1846695147">dark DNA of <em>Diablo</em></a> in each of these recent RNG-driven skinner boxes. But they are getting so much more streamlined and optimized.</p>

 <p>Maybe that’s some small part of why Sun seems somewhat reluctant about <em>Ball X Pit</em>‘s wild success.</p> <p>It sold 400,000 copies in its first week. That number has almost doubled in the weeks since. “It just feels weird for so many people to like this game,” he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-07/how-ball-x-pit-became-a-hit-video-game?srnd=undefined">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a separate interview. “I think the response has been a bit too positive. I think, like, there are plenty of flaws…I think the good things are good enough that it makes people ignore the flaws.”</p> <p>Whatever those flaws are, they haven’t dented the roguelike’s 96-percent positive user rating on Steam. No wonder my inbox is flooded with new indie games pitching themselves as “<em>Vampire Survivors</em> meets X” or <em>“Balatro</em> crossed with Y.” Unfortunately, I don’t think most of them will be cleverly designed as <em>Ball X Pit</em>, let alone as successful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick seems pretty happy with this year’s <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</em> In a new interview, he said the relatively short and linear semi-open-world action game proves that a lot of players will buy games that are focused, not super bloated, and offer a good story. And boy howdy, as someone who loves a nice weekend single-player game, I’m very happy to hear that.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true#:~:text=The%20other%20big,the%20perfect%20result.%E2%80%9D">In a recent interview with T<em>he Game Business</em> newsletter</a>, Zelnick talked about some of the successes Take-Two has had over the past few months. It turns out <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em> isn’t selling as well as expected, which the CEO blames on PC issues and says he expects it to do well in the long term. On the flipside, <em>Mafia: The Old Country,</em> a different game published earlier this year by 2K (a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two), actually <em>beat</em> internal sales expectations. According to Zelnick, it proves that people want well-made, narrative-driven single-player games.</p>

 <p>“What we suspected was confirmed,” Zelnick told the outlet. “Which is just…if you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.”</p>  <h2>Remember when everything wasn’t a live-service thing?</h2> <p>Released in August and developed by Hangar 13,<em> The Old Country</em> is smaller than past <em>Mafia</em> titles, only takes about 11 hours to complete, has no online components, and launched at a reduced price of $50. It’s also the kind of game we don’t really get anymore from AAA publishers like 2K: <a href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions">a big-budget, solo-only, linear action game</a> that lacks a lot of replay value or in-game purchases. Back in the PS2 and even Xbox 360 eras of gaming, this was pretty standard stuff. Not so much anymore.</p>

 <p>However, as Zelnick points out, there is definitely a demand for these types of games. I think a lot of people don’t have the time to dedicate to the latest big online hit, nor can they invest 200 hours into some giant open-world RPG. But a 10- to 12-hour action-adventure game with some great cutscenes, good writing, and no bullshit? Yeah, that’s appealing to a lot of people, myself included.</p> <p>Hopefully<em>, Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s success can be used as a blueprint for Take-Two, and the publisher can greenlight similarly sized projects at its various studios. And we can play those games while we wait for Take-Two’s juggernaut, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6,</em> to finally release one day. Eventually</a>.</p>
