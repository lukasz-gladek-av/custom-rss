            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Welcome to the coolest show in town, <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint. This is our daily roundup of video game news and other interesting stuff you might care about. Squeeze in, find a seat, and get ready to be blown away by this morning’s showcase, which includes bad news for fans of <em>The Finals</em> on PS4, more layoffs, Sakurai wanting to live a chill life, and more.</p> <h2>Some games that sold a single physical copy in October</h2> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">According to data from Circana’s Matt Piscatella</a>, some odd, old games sold exactly one new physical copy in the United States during October. If you were the person out there who bought a physical copy of <em>Spore</em> in October, email me a photo of the receipt. I want to talk to you about your life. I hope things turn around for you. And if you are the person who bought <em>Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em> on GBA last month, you are a wild individual, and I respect it. Here’s the full list:</p>

 <ul> <li>360- <em>Burnout Paradise</em></li> <li>3DS-<em> Carnival Games: Wild West 3D</em></li> <li>GBA-<em> Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em></li> <li>NDS- <em>Imagine Fashion Stylist</em></li> <li>PC- <em>Spore</em></li> <li>PS2-<em> Backyard Baseball</em></li> <li>PS3- <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em></li> <li>PS4- <em>Cooking Mama Cookstar</em></li> <li>XBX- <em>Ultra Bust A Move</em></li> </ul> <h2>Avalanche Liverpool closes, 31 devs laid off</h2> <p>In September, Avalanche Liverpool, the studio behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">canceled Xbox game <em>Contraband</em></a>, announced it would be shutting down. And now that has happened. On November 19, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">the studio announced via its official website</a> that it had completely closed its doors and 31 developers had been laid off as a result.</p>

 <p>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project. We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios&nbsp;Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avalanchers through the transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.”</p>

 <h2>Leave <em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai alone</h2> <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html"><u>Game*Spark,</u></a> <em>Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai talked about how he doesn’t consider his life all that interesting and wishes people would just focus on the games and not who made them. So he was surprised that people wanted to turn his story into a manga.</p>

 <p>“I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life,” Sakurai told the outlet, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros-and-kirby-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-its-best-to-just-play-games-instead-of-looking-at-who-made-them-so-please-dont-perceive-him/">as translated by <em>Gamesradar.</em></a> “Even with [being contacted about creating the manga], I’m sure my response was something like ‘really?'”</p>

 <p>“I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life. I think it’s best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Finals</em> on PS4 will be shut down next year</h2> <p>Before Embark Studios released the massively popular <em>Arc Raiders</em> last month, the company published the destructive shooter <em>The Finals</em> across consoles and PC. It wasn’t as big of a hit, but it’s still kicking and getting updates. But not for much longer on PlayStation 4, <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592?t=swsOGicwN1vsbqWO-_CZjg&amp;s=19">as confirmed by the studio earlier this week</a>.</p> <p>“When Season 10 begins (18th of March, 2026), we’ll be retiring <em>The Finals</em> on PlayStation 4 and focusing our support on current generation hardware,” posted Embark Studios. “From that point on, you’ll need to play there to keep enjoying the game. Your progress and purchases will be stored in your Embark ID and will transfer to anywhere you choose to play. We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who’s been part of the PS4 community.”</p> <h2>Huh, Panic Button handled some Switch 2 port upgrades for Nintendo</h2> <p>Remember how, when the Switch 2 launched, some popular OG Switch games published by Nintendo, like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, got upgrades to look and play a bit better on the new machine? Well, turns out that Switch port experts Panic Button were contracted by Nintendo to handle those upgrades.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Panic Button was honored to be selected by Nintendo to help update marquee games from the Nintendo Switch™ library.  Nintendo asked us to help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system, while remaining faithful to the original games. <a href="https://t.co/5P96V9DFUq">pic.twitter.com/5P96V9DFUq</a></p> <p>— Panic Button (Official) (@PanicButtonGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanicButtonGame/status/1991264499676930507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I find this very interesting, as it seems like something Nintendo could have done internally. But instead, they trusted the folks at Panic to handle the upgrades. I bet Panic is feeling very good about that right now, and it will likely help the studio get even more work porting games to the new Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><em>Deadpool VR</em> is perfect…for fans of Deadpool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495">MrBeast’s new “theme park” looks…uh…not great</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412">Critics seem to mostly like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="158" data-end="922">For PlayStation 5 owners who regularly find themselves bumping up against the console’s limited storage, keep reading. In the lead-up to Black Friday, Crucial has cut the price of one of its PS5-compatible SSDs, making it easier and more affordable to expand your game library.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/"> The 2TB Crucial P510 Gen5 NVMe SSD normally priced around $210 has been discounted by 29%, bringing the cost down to $150.</a> That’s a meaningful $60 reduction on a high-performance SSD equipped with its own heatsink for seamless compatibility right out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="158" data-end="922">PS5 &amp; PC Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="924" data-end="1686">One of the most common frustrations among early PS5 adopters is the reality of the console’s internal storage limitations. Even though Sony technically lists the system as having an 825GB SSD, the usable space is significantly smaller. After accounting for system files and required software, players are left with roughly 667GB for game installs—a number that feels increasingly cramped as modern titles frequently climb past 100GB each. For anyone with a growing collection, or for those who enjoy bouncing between several big releases at once, that space disappears almost immediately. Installing Crucial’s 2TB expansion effectively triples the amount of room you have to work with, reducing the need to delete old favorites just to make space for new ones.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="2423">Beyond the raw storage boost, the drive is built to meet the PS5’s demanding performance standards. With read and write speeds up of to 11,000 MB/s, the Crucial P510 far exceeds what’s needed to keep pace with Sony’s ultra-fast architecture. The included heatsink, which is required for PS5 internal installation, helps maintain stable temperatures and prevent thermal throttling during extended gaming sessions.</p>


<p data-start="2425" data-end="3119">If you’re planning to install the Crucial P510 SSD into a PC gaming desktop, you’ll be able to make the most of its insanely fast read and write speeds. Just make sure your motherboard supports Gen5 NVMe SSDs. A Gen4 slot will still work with it, just won’t be able to reach the maximum speeds supported by the P510. With optimal conditions, you’ll be able to experience lightning fast load times in your games as well as when working with high-intensive applications such as when video or photo editing. Plus with a full 2TB, you’ll have plenty of room for not just your games, but any important pictures or vids you want to hang onto.</p>
<p data-start="3121" data-end="3308" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With its generous performance, significant storage increase, and a timely discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/">Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive stands out as one of the most practical PS5 upgrades you can grab this season.</a></p>

              <p><i><span>Kirby Air Riders </span></i><span>is out today, and it sounds like the chaotic kart racer is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412"><span>exactly what fans of the GameCube original wanted</span></a><span> (and like it’s probably not for anyone else). One of the ways the Switch 2 game embraces disorder is in its vehicle customization, which lets you paint your hoverboard to look like pretty much whatever you want. Some players are using this feature to make cool karts to race around in, and others are seeing what monstrosities they can put on the market for other players to use.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo has held </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><span>multiple feature-length Direct showcases</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>, so we’ve already known about its vehicle customization for a while. I wouldn’t be surprised if fans were planning some of their vehicular shitposts for some time and just needed the game in their Switch 2s to finally bring them to life. But the reason that people can make vehicles that look like Chef Kawasaki in a bikini from a </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasakis-cursed-micro-bikini-look-from-banned-kirby-fangame-gets-revival-in-air-riders-custom-machine-market/"><span>banned fan game</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/kirby/masahiro-sakurai-maybe-gave-kirby-air-riders-players-too-much-power-as-there-already-multiple-scantily-clad-versions-of-chef-kawasaki-flooding-the-vehicle-market/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span>) is that the toolset is so good. So for every joke, you’ll find a custom kart that actually looks pretty incredible. Y’all haven’t even had the game for a day, and you’re already killing it.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">なんでもうコックカワサキマイクロビキニ部が二種類もあるんだよ <a href="https://t.co/KOxhFDLGMY">https://t.co/KOxhFDLGMY</a> <a href="https://t.co/GTSit5kUuT">pic.twitter.com/GTSit5kUuT</a></p> <p>— じごくのランチタイム (@lunchtime39439) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchtime39439/status/1991282714637660553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">カイオーガつくれるじゃねぇか<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#オレマシン</a> <a href="https://t.co/3IO1yNOOXn">pic.twitter.com/3IO1yNOOXn</a></p> <p>— まʓくʓ (@marukurururu) <a href="https://twitter.com/marukurururu/status/1991228290716098822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">オレマシン市場、もう既に闇市場になっててカオス<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%82%A3%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#カービィのエアライダー</a> <a href="https://t.co/I3Sz115tPN">pic.twitter.com/I3Sz115tPN</a></p> <p>— ロジー&amp;マリオファンの集い (@7Roggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/7Roggie/status/1991313062759117150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>        <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">流石エアライダー<br>色んな企業さんが参戦してるんだねー <a href="https://t.co/27vdhK9cqT">pic.twitter.com/27vdhK9cqT</a></p> <p>— あぽろ (@_aporoG) <a href="https://twitter.com/_aporoG/status/1991213110888403216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">とりあえず作ってみたフォーミュララティアス<br>オレマシンだけでもめっちゃ楽しい！！<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#エアライダー</a> <a href="https://t.co/M219v7ChP1">pic.twitter.com/M219v7ChP1</a></p> <p>— おれお (@Atge799wE3PeveQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atge799wE3PeveQ/status/1991256890115002714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">カビカフェのオムライス🍽️<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#エアライダー</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#オレマシン</a> <a href="https://t.co/lBRhUp1DTk">pic.twitter.com/lBRhUp1DTk</a></p> <p>— ミロルク (@zelro_ruda) <a href="https://twitter.com/zelro_ruda/status/1991471280407867605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">プププランド住人の魂を生贄に、<br>降臨せよ！《地縛神 Ccapac Apu》！！ <a href="https://t.co/CjWJK9woMh">pic.twitter.com/CjWJK9woMh</a></p> <p>— えろす♈️ (@EROS_Last_JK) <a href="https://twitter.com/EROS_Last_JK/status/1991200757920723264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#エアライダー</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#オレマシン</a> <a href="https://t.co/nsInIQKxMA">pic.twitter.com/nsInIQKxMA</a></p> <p>— くらげ (@oba08kekeke) <a href="https://twitter.com/oba08kekeke/status/1991242399117357249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>My favorites so far are the GameCube kart and the ship shaped like Latias from </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, but I’m sure we’ll see some even crazier designs by day’s end.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-hard-on-apple-2025-ipads-now-going-for-less-than-no-name-budget-alternatives-2000645748</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple launched the 11-inch iPad with an A16 chip back in March of this year, and now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon’s dropping the 128GB/Wi-Fi mode to a record low of $279 for Black Friday, down from its $349 retail price</a>. You won’t find this discount on Apple’s official website or in their retail stores because the company keeps tight pricing controls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>iPhone Performance to Tablet Form</h2>
<p>The A16 Bionic chip delivers processing power that rivals many laptops and maintains the instant responsiveness that iPads are known for. The 6-core CPU splits tasks between performance and efficiency cores that balance speed and battery life based on workload demands. The 5-core GPU accelerates graphics rendering, gaming performance, and augmented reality applications. It allows the <strong>16-core Neural Engine to process 17 trillion operations per second</strong>&nbsp;and powers machine learning functions like Live Text, subject isolation in Photos, and real-time translation.</p>
<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display pushes 2360 by 1640 resolution with True Tone technology</strong> that adjusts color temperature based on ambient lighting. The display covers the P3 wide color gamut, reproducing vibrant colors that look accurate for photo editing and creative work. The IPS panel maintains excellent viewing angles, so colors and contrast stay consistent when viewing the screen from the side.</p>



<p>A 128GB storage configuration provides enough space for essential apps and working files without forcing you into constant cloud storage management. Modern apps and high-resolution photos consume storage fast, and 128GB is the minimum viable capacity required to enjoy comfortable use. You can store dozens of apps, thousands of photos, hours of offline video content, and still have room for documents and downloads.</p>
<p>With WiFi 6 connectivity, this <strong>iPad offers faster and wireless speeds and better performance</strong> in crowded network conditions than earlier WiFi standards. The increased efficiency reduces battery drain when using the internet for several hours continuously, while the low latency further enhances video calls and online gaming. WiFi 6 routers are slowly becoming commonplace in many homes and businesses, and this iPad fully leverages the new and improved technology.</p>
<p>The<strong> Touch ID built into the power button</strong> allows for secure authentication without the TrueDepth camera setup of Face ID. The fingerprint sensor instantly unlocks the iPad, authorizes purchases, and allows you to switch between user profiles with the touch of a finger. This method of authentication works in any environment with no light limitation and does not require you to position your face in front of the device. Finally, <strong>with all-day battery life, up to 10 hours of web surfing</strong> or video playback on a single charge covers full work days, long flights, or weekend road trips without needing a charger.</p>
<p>The<strong> iPad runs iPadOS</strong> with access to millions of tablet-optimized apps that take advantage of the larger screen compared to the apps on the iPhone. The operating system supports multitasking with <em>Split View</em> and <em>Slide Over</em> which let you run multiple apps at the same time. Support for the Apple Pencil allows for note-taking, digital art, and document annotation, though the stylus sells separately.</p>
<p>For $279, this iPad is cheaper than a lot of budget Android tablets that deliver far worse performance, worse displays and app ecosystems that pale in comparison.</p>
