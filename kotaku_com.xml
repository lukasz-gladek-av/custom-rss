While playing with some friends, the group encountered some “rando” players. </p><p>About 3 minutes [later] a video appeared on my screen,” claimed Tado422. “I have never seen this before but it took up the whole screen. It was a Russian pop video or something that played for 20 seconds or so. Most of us were talking in chat about what the heck was happening.”</p><p>Tado422 further explained that, shortly after the first video, a second video appeared. This one showed a man entering a store and shooting people in the head. </p><p>“At this moment I freaked out and hard closed out of <em>StarCraft 2</em>. My 5 year old daughter was in the room with me, half paying attention to me playing a video game. This is beyond unacceptable. I should never have to worry about seeing people murdered or porn while playing a <em>SC2 </em>game.”</p><p>Tad0422's post blew up on Reddit and led to many other <em>SC2 </em>players sharing their stories about similar hackers injecting annoying or graphic videos while people are playing the game. I reached out to Tado422 and they shared with me a replay of the match that was hacked by someone. They also made it clear that this isn’t an issue with the Arcade map they were playing or the creator of that mode. It appears to be a larger exploit within <em>StarCraft 2</em>'s Arcade Mode. You can find others reporting similar incidents with screenshots, too. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/hackers-are-injecting-mass-shooting-videos-into-random-starcraft-2-matches/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/hackers-are-injecting-mass-shooting-videos-into-random-starcraft-2-matches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>404Media</em></a></span>, some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k3rd1y/sc2_homepage_replaced_with_nazi_imagery/?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k3rd1y/sc2_homepage_replaced_with_nazi_imagery/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players shared stories</a></span> of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/sc2/t/lobby-injection-hack/30494?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/sc2/t/lobby-injection-hack/30494?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing swastikas</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k3scsm/comment/mo4ww8g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k3scsm/comment/mo4ww8g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">while playing</a></span>.

Either the classic “2/2/2” or the new Triple Vanguard, one Duelist, and two Strategist line-up.</p><p>Other notable balance changes include new team-ups for Emma/Magneto/Psylocke, Bucky and Cap, Namor and Hulk, Dr. Strange and Scarlet Witch, and the removal of team-ups for Bucky and Rocket, Namor and Luna, Storm and Thor, Magneto and Scarlet Witch, and Magik and Psylocke.</p><p>Rocket has always been great, but with vastly improved single-target healing and a two-for-one Ultimate that both boosts damage and negates several ‘one-shot’ combos that kill through other support ults, he is a <em>borderline</em> must-play character now and, for my money, in the running for “best Strategist” in the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="4d1ac92df2fb5f8577523549cc773ad2" data-recommend-id="image://4d1ac92df2fb5f8577523549cc773ad2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a hero profile screen shows Loki wielding a scythe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a hero profile screen shows Loki wielding a scythe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d1ac92df2fb5f8577523549cc773ad2" data-recommend-id="image://4d1ac92df2fb5f8577523549cc773ad2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a hero profile screen shows Loki wielding a scythe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Scarlet Witch is also stronger with her team-up with Dr. Strange, although he has fallen from grace a bit with his lowered damage and increased survivability (his high damage set him further apart from Magneto previously). Moon Knight is also in a better spot, as his projectiles and grappling hook are faster, and he gains bonus health from his secondary fire. Peni Parker and Mr. Fantastic are also better in this patch, shoring up the weaknesses in Peni’s health pool and Reed’s ultimate, respectively. </p><p>Although I always knew he was good, the recent Human Torch buffs have also turned him into a meta pick, countering powerful new characters like Emma even if he still has the same ‘cheaper townhome’ problems the rest of us do with the new and improved Iron Fist. Hulk got some love, too, which is nice, but it doesn’t bring him back into ‘hard meta’ just yet, partially because he has well-known and easy counterplay, and there are simpler or more robust, ‘just-as-powerful’ options in Thing and Emma.</p><p>Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Human Torch have also been buffed, and Hela got some tweaks to reduce her survivability slightly, which amounts to a slap on the wrist for the always-meta character. Winter Soldier also got some slight nerfs to his ultimate, and with the Rocket team-up removed he is weaker, but don’t let that fool you. Expert players will still run circles around opponents with his kit. </p><hr><p>Overall, the meta is in a good spot, with opportunities for all kinds of characters, and counterplay for almost everyone. Get out there, pick your favorite character, and make some plays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
