              <p>Late on August 7, <em>GTA</em> publisher Take Two put out its quarterly earnings report, accompanied by a shareholder Q&amp;A and interviews with CEO Strauss Zelnick appearing on various outlets. Obviously, the big question everyone had is: How much are you going to charge for <em>GTA 6</em>? Zelnick chose to deliver some extra-special corporate gloop instead of actually answering.</p> <p>Rumors have been flying back and forth over the price of next year’s&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>, with a recent round of “industry analyst” nonsense <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/analyst-says-i-expect-a-usd100-price-point-for-gta-6-estimates-rockstars-development-cost-is-over-usd1-5-billion-and-predicts-it-will-earn-usd10-billion-lifetime-and-another-usd500-million-annually-from-gta-online/">declaring that the game will cost $100</a>. However, while something around $70 to $80 seems far more likely, Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick avoided giving a price when speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p> <p>Game prices are in something of a hinterland, with many publishers wanting to follow Nintendo’s lead up to a standard price of $80 but seemingly being afraid to push the button. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">Microsoft recently backtracked on the plan</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">EA has made clear it intends to stick with $70 for the foreseeable future</a>, and perhaps most relevantly here, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">Take Two recently said&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> would be $70</a>, after <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-games-1851781445">Randy Pitchford made a twerp of himself on the subject</a>. Many, however, are predicting that if any game could push prices up, it’s&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>.</p>

 <p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, Zelnick put modesty aside and said of <em>GTA 6</em>, “I do think it’s fair to say that this is perhaps the most highly anticipated property pre-release in the history of entertainment.” Given this confidence, you might think the CEO would be willing to just state the intended price for the game. However, when&nbsp;<em>Variety&nbsp;</em>spoke to him, he instead prevaricated.</p> <p>“Our goal is always to deliver more value than we charge,” Zelnick told the outlet, which are words that <em>look</em> like they should mean something. He continued, “so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever.” Mentioning special editions and so on, the response finished, “I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it.” Yes, but how much will it cost?</p> <p>Zelnick was equally bemusing about <em>Borderlands 4</em> during August 8’s earnings call, responding to a shareholder question about why <em>that</em> game will be $70, “We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing. So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth.” Yes, but why is it $70?</p>

 <p>When 2020 prices were stepping up from $60 to $70 as a console standard, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-interactive-next-gen-software-price-increases-reflect-the-quality-of-the-experience">Zelnick wasn’t nearly so shy</a> about justifying the increased costs. “We think with the value we offer consumers…and the kind of experience you can really only have on these next-generation consoles, that the price is justified,” the CEO told <em>GI.biz</em> at the time. “But it’s easy to say that when you’re delivering extraordinary quality, and that’s what our company prides itself on doing.”</p> <p>So, we still have no idea what Take Two will be charging for May 26’s&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. Presumably there’s a desire to hold off and see which way the wind blows over the next nine months. Given Nintendo is sticking to its guns at $80 for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but then confusing everything by charging $70 for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, there’s no clear indication yet. Certainly Microsoft and Sony appear to be sticking to $70 for the upcoming holiday season, but it seems entirely possible that $80 will creep in during 2026.</p> <p>And yes, sure, Take Two&nbsp;<em>could</em> charge $100 for&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>, but it’d be a bad move that would do reputational damage to both the publisher and the game. Presumably there will be a “premium” version priced at around $100, and possibly another at $130 or more, but it seems vanishingly unlikely the vanilla game will cost more than eighty bucks.</p>

              <p>It’s time for your monthly reminder that your Amazon Prime subscription also comes with a bunch of free games. And in many cases, while that “free” perhaps deserves scarequotes for falling under a subscription fee for a monstrously evil corporation, they’re actually yours to keep forever, with no DRM, and no requirement to keep up your sub. That’s true for eight of this month’s offerings, including&nbsp;<em>Civilization III </em>and&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition.</em></p> <p>The reason for this proper, actual ownership is Prime partners with GOG for a lot of the games it includes in the subscription, meaning that you’re getting a code that allows you to download a DRM-free version of the game that boots from an .exe, rather than requiring any launchers or proprietary software. So while you may observe that&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> is a 24-year-old game, and as such perhaps not quite matching the sorts of games added to services like PS Plus or Game Pass, in this case you’re getting&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> to&nbsp;<em>keep</em>. You could also point out that the game is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">currently available on GOG for $0.75</a>, which is approximately 185 times cheaper than an annual Prime subscription, and there I couldn’t argue back.&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em>, however, is $25, so that’s definitely a sweeter deal. And, you know, as much as that game definitely shouldn’t have been called “<em>Thief</em>,” and as embarrassing as its <em>The Crow</em> cosplay may have been, it’s actually a pretty decent game in its own right.</p> <p>Amazon Prime likes to make it as confusing as possible to acquire your freebies, releasing the games in four separate batches across the month, guaranteeing you to forget at least some of them. It also removes other games from the selection at the same times, really keeping you on your toes. But the two headline games for August are <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">both there to grab right now</a>, along with big names added in July like&nbsp;<em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> and&nbsp;<em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em>. Also coming later this month are&nbsp;<em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em>–an expandalone entry in Travis Baldtree’s legendary&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like series–and last year’s deckbuilding roguelite&nbsp;<em>Necroking</em>. Here’s the full list of games for August:</p> <p><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>The Academy: The First Riddle</em> (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 14</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Filthy Animals – Heist Simulator</em> (Epic Games Store)</li> <li><em>Tin Hearts</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Necroking&nbsp;</em>(GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 21</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective&nbsp;</em>(Amazing Games App)</li> <li><em>Silver Box Classics</em> (GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 28</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Heroes of Loot 2</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Fantasy Empires</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>City Legends: The Ghost of Misty Hill Collector’s Edition</em> (Legacy Games)</li> </ul> <p>You also get a bunch of games via the Amazon cloud gaming doodad, Luna, which rotate in and out. It currently contains&nbsp;<em>Saints Row: The Third</em>,&nbsp;<em>SkateBIRD</em>,&nbsp;<em>Overcooked! 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, among others.</p>

              <p>Nintendo, apparently dissatisfied with being a stalwart of nearly every school child’s life, is aiming even younger. A new range of products under the banner of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/index.html"><em>My Mario</em></a> has been announced, including wooden block toys, board books, and a Switch and mobile app that’ll let kids mess with Mario’s face, all focused on a preschool market. Gotta get ’em young and impressionable.</p> <p>Initially launching in Japan, the physical toys will be available in select Nintendo stores, but will almost inevitably find their way to international markets soon enough. The range includes plastic crockery, a mini-backpack, rattle plushies, and super-adorable teeny clothing, so you can deck your toddler out as a nearly-walking Nintendo billboard.</p> <p>The app, which is confirmed as coming to Switch and iOS, lets little kiddos goof around with Mario’s face, pulling and stretching the poor plumbers various features, causing him to react in different ways. It sounds super-basic, which is precisely what kids that age will want, reacting to their experimental input. Also, it’ll be free, so they can keep their complaints to themselves.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616597" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616597"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616597">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This new range launches in Japan on August 26, and will include the most beautiful-looking building block sets, but each block is also an amiibo! There’s a Mario, Toad, Yoshi, Luigi and Peach, along with items like&nbsp;? blocks and green pipes, letting your kid build up a gaming scene, or just smash them into each other before chewing on the side of Yoshi’s face until the paint wears away. A Mario picture book looks equally well made, each board page interactive in some form. And oh my goodness, I want to go back in time and get the Mario romper suit with a hoodie for when my boy would fit in such things.</p> <p>There’s also a collection of stop-motion animation videos that’ll appear on the My Mario website when it goes live, each about a minute long telling stories about the mustachioed hero, again aimed at the youngest kids.</p> <p>All the physical objects will initially go on sale in Nintendo stores in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, but hopefully Nintendo will see the demand for international customers once everyone realizes those wooden blocks are secret amiibos and adults go insane trying to buy them. It’s unclear if the app will be available in English, but again, it’d be pretty daft not to.</p> <p>I shall never stop finding it incredibly weird that an ambiguously aged, mustache-wearing portly Italian plumber is such a staple of everyone’s lives, and it only gets more strange when aimed at preschoolers. And yet he’s the best! Nintendo’s clearly aiming to ensure kids are fully enculturated before they can even say his name.</p>
