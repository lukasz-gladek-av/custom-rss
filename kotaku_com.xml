              <p>Modern life requires charging multiple devices at once and most homes and offices don’t have anywhere near enough outlets or good-quality chargers to keep phones, laptops, tablets, and accessories all charged up simultaneously. A compact multi-port charger consolidates the charging infrastructure into a single hub that eradicates adapter juggling and outlet competition and offers fast charging across all connected devices.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">$24, down from $39, Ugreen’s four-port Nexode 65W charger has reached a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday that suggests a zero-margin pricing that’s purely aimed at driving volume sales during the critical shopping period. This aggressive discount makes <strong>premium GaN charging technology accessible to everyone</strong> rather than remaining a luxury for tech enthusiasts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Power for Laptops</h2>
<p>The maximum <strong>65W output provides enough power to charge MacBook Air</strong>, MacBook Pro, Dell and other USB-C laptops at full speed rather than the trickle charging that lower-wattage adapters deliver. A MacBook Air reaches 51% battery in just 30 minutes when using the full 65W through a compatible cable: this makes quick charging practical during brief work breaks or morning routines.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-port configuration, including three USB-C outputs and one USB-A input</strong>, covers every device type you’re likely to carry daily without requiring multiple chargers or adapters. You can charge your laptop off one USB-C port while simultaneously powering your phone off another USB-C port, your tablet off the third USB-C port, and older accessories such as wireless earbuds or fitness trackers off the USB-A port<strong>. Intelligent power distribution</strong> automatically adjusts wattage allocation based on the requirements of the devices connected to ensure optimal charging speeds, rather than equally splitting power without regard for actual needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact dimensions of just 2.64 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches</strong> make for a charger small enough to slip into jacket pockets or laptop bag compartments without the bulk that makes larger chargers a pain to transport. This size reduction compared to traditional laptop chargers comes courtesy of GaN technology that allows higher power density in smaller packages thanks to running cooler and more efficiently than silicon-based designs. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body to avoid snagging on bag contents or causing damage to other items during transport.</p>
<p>Besides size reduction,<strong> GaN technology provides safety due to better thermal management</strong> and prevents dangerous overheating that has plagued cheap chargers with outdated component designs. Improved efficiency means less energy is converted to waste heat during operation, keeping the charger cooler during extended use while reducing fire risk. Built-in protections against overcurrent that could damage sensitive device circuits, overvoltage spikes resulting from unstable power grids, and short circuits from cable damage or debris in the ports are included.</p>



<p>This covers universal compatibility with MacBook Pro and Air, iPhone 15/16/17 series, Samsung Galaxy S24/S25, Google Pixel 9/10, iPad Pro, Steam Deck, and virtually any USB-C device compatible with Power Delivery fast charging standards. That cross-compatibility breaks the iOS versus Android divide in which you’d have to use different chargers for different ecosystems.</p>
<p>For $24, the Ugreen 65W charger delivers a total of four ports, including three USB-C, GaN technology, and 65W laptop charging capability. Now 39% off retail this Black Friday, Amazon’s aggressive pricing suggests margin sacrifice for volume during peak shopping season.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-director-says-%E2%80%98jrpg-3-0%E2%80%99-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-%E2%80%98at-a-fundamental-level%E2%80%99.1364248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People talk about turn-based role-playing games and JRPGs the way academics fret about the novel. Much ink is spilt over what defines the form and whether it’s dead, only for a great piece of work to come along and briefly revitalize hope that it’s as alive and relevant as ever. <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> was this year’s jolt of lightning, proving turn-based RPGs still have some gas left in the tank, but <em>Persona</em> director Katsura Hashino seems to think the genre’s best days are still ahead.</p> <p>The lead developer behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-kotaku-review-1793752909"><em>Persona 5</em></a> recently gave a talk at the G-Star 2025 gaming conference in South Korea with the heady title ‘When experience becomes memory – designing lasting impressions through art and structure’ in which he argued there are three main eras of the JRPG, according to a report by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/714/G071477/20251114074/"><em>4Gamer</em></a> that was translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/persona-and-metaphor-refantazio-creator-says-he-wants-to-create-jrpg-3-0-fundamentally-changing-the-genres-structure-and-presentation/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>.</p>

 <p>According to Hashino, JRPG 1.0 encompasses the “true classics,” which seems to include everything from the NES through at least PS2. Then there’s JRPG 2.0, which refers to the modern era of the genre. The director doesn’t seem to specify the boundaries, but lets peg it at <em>Persona 4</em> through <em>ReFantazio</em>, a period which Hashino describes as being “higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player.”</p>

 <p>Most importantly, there is “JRPG 3.0,” which refers to the next generation of games that haven’t yet been defined. How will the genre stay fresh in this new era? “There will be a greater dimension to these games and they’ll change the genre’s structure and presentation at a fundamental level,” he says, according to <em>Gamesradar</em>.</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Clair Obscur</em> the future or the past?</h2> <p>I have no idea what any of this means, but I’m excited that Hashino seems excited. He doesn’t sound dogmatically wedded to the past or necessarily burnt out on what has become a very successful but somewhat predictable formula for Atlus RPGs. Will that push the team to try and reinvent the wheel a bit with <em>Persona 6</em>, or whatever P-Studio has coming in the future? I certainly hope so.</p>

 <p>There’s been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1ogr1r2/history_of_turn_based_rpgs_according_to_e33/">a meme going around</a> aimed at lampooning self-identified JRPG fans who sometimes seem to pretend like nothing good came out of the genre between <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> and <em>Clair Obscur</em>. But there’s a kernel of truth in both stances. There have been plenty of great JRPGs during this period, and they weren’t just called <em>Persona</em>. The<em> Xenoblade Chronicles</em> are a particular bright spot, while <em>Trails</em>, <em>Tales</em>, and other series have grown bigger as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is unironically how some of y'all treat this genre <a href="https://t.co/pL8tIDXfcU">https://t.co/pL8tIDXfcU</a> <a href="https://t.co/wwswKZrRS0">pic.twitter.com/wwswKZrRS0</a></p> <p>— Red (@kitsuneredFES) <a href="https://twitter.com/kitsuneredFES/status/1981807121168838678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But it’s also true that <em>Clair Obscur</em> has pulled in lapsed fans in a way few other games have. A timeline with only<em> FFVII</em> and <em>Clair Obscur</em> on it is JRPG erasure, but it’s probably a not entirely inaccurate picture of your average casual gamer’s relationship to the genre.</p> <p>The French GOTY front-runner is in many ways a very traditional turn-based role-playing game, but it has just enough unique twists on old tropes and mechanics to feel bold and novel. It recontextualizes the past more than it points to some revolutionary future, but maybe, as with <em>Metaphor</em> and other turn-based games experimenting around the fringes, it can be a bridge to something new. Or maybe I, like a lot of fans, just want to be tricked into feeling like what we’re nostalgic for is actually doing something fresh.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gift-yourself-peace-of-mind-and-save-30-off-this-wd-backup-drive-for-black-friday-2000646963</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You have enough on your mind during the holidays, why not free yourself from the fear of your laptop or desktop meeting with a catastrophic demise and taking all of your precious data and files with it? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5920/">There’s a Black Friday deal for that right now at Amazon — save $30 off the price of the 5TB model of WB’s Elements portable external hard drive for Windows or Mac.</a> Take a quick break from shopping for family and friends and give yourself the best gift of all — peace of mind.</p>
<p>That might sound extreme, but saving yourself from losing your data and files due to a massive hardware failure, an accident, or even an act of nature is well worth the new $110 price tag on the 5TB WB Elements. Many of the items on your PC or Mac are probably irreplaceable, like digital family movies or digitized photos, official documents that you’ve scanned into digital form, work files, archived emails, and more. A fast backup to a reliable portable hard drive is an essential step toward keeping your files safe, and the WD Elements is among the very best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5920/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Size and Speed You Need</h2>
<p>The 5TB capacity of this WB Elements portable external hard drive is likely more than enough to back up your entire desktop or laptop, and possibly consolidate any files you’ve had floating around on thumb drives or smaller external hard drives. The longest file transfer is always the first one, but the WB Elements drive moves at USB 3.0 speed up to 5Gbps while also being retro-compatible with USB 2.0 devices. You should note it’s a USB-A device, not USB-C.</p>
<p>All those files may be hogging hard drive space on your computer, but the WB Elements backup drive will most definitely not hog space on your actual desktop. It’s a tiny, sleek device measuring only 3.2 by 4.35 inches and a scant 8.32 ounces, so it’s literally pocket-sized and more than able to hitch a ride in your backpack or briefcase.</p>
<p>The drive comes formatted for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.1 for plug-and-play usage. It’s also Mac-compatible after a quick and easy reformatting process that your Mac or MacBook will walk you through.</p>



<h2>Steal of a Deal</h2>
<p>The full range of WD Elements portable external hard drives, ranging from 1TB to 6TB, are beginning to hit Black Friday pricing. But this 5TB model is by far the best deal so far at 21% off its regular $140 price. If you’re really concerned about keeping your files safe, a great way to take advantage of this awesome deal is to buy two WD Elements drives, with one intended to be stored somewhere away from your home in case of fire or other natural disaster.</p>
<p>WD’s rep as one of the best storage drive manufacturers has been decades in the making, starting with the My Book line that debuted in 2006. The 2007 model My Book was one of the first terabyte-sized drives to hit the consumer market. The physical size of these drives has shrunk dramatically while the storage levels have soared, and the prices have never been friendlier than they are now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5920/">Hit this Amazon Black Friday deal on the 5TB WD Elements drive for just $110 and sleep easier knowing your files are safe and secure.</a></p>

Over this past weekend, police in Northern California received reports of possible gunshots and arrived on the scene to discover, thankfully, that it was just someone playing games too loudly with their window open.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/chico-police-respond-to-loud-video-game-mistaken-for-gunshots/article_456898e1-4925-41f0-a71e-fee8a012852a.html">As reported by <em>Action News Now</em></a>, police in Chico, California, received a call from a local resident who claimed to have heard “threatening words” as well as “pop sounds” that sounded an awful lot like gunshots. <em>ANN</em> says a heavy police presence arrived at the scene around 5:30 p.m. on Saturday to investigate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Police discovered that the situation wasn’t dangerous at all, just annoying. Apparently, a gamer in Chico was playing a video game at a very loud volume with their window open. No other details were shared about the incident.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Neither the report nor the police confirmed which game it was, but I’d assume a recently released FPS like <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Black Ops 7 </em></a>or <em>Battlefield 6.</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ActionNewsNow/posts/police-confirmed-that-reported-gunshot-sounds-in-chico-on-saturday-night-were-ac/1258647912960506/">Over on the news network’s Facebook page</a>, commenters are also curious if it was <em>BF6 or CoD.&nbsp;</em></span></p> <p><span>It’s a silly story with a not-horrible ending, which isn’t always the case <a href="https://kotaku.com/swatting-the-hip-new-griefing-trend-sends-the-cops-5838927">when gamers and police get involved.</a> We’ve seen far too many cases of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fatal-call-of-duty-swatter-pleads-guilty-to-51-charges-1830434368">SWAT teams being called on random gamers and Twitch streamers</a> by assholes. </span><span>Thankfully, it seems that if a SWAT-like team was called, it didn’t escalate into something more serious. </span></p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/guy-played-video-games-so-loud-the-cops-showed-up-2000647237]]></content:encoded>
