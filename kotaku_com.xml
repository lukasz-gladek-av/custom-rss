              <p>If you’ve ever dreamed of owning a piece of the Star Wars universe without needing a hangar bay or hyperdrive fuel, this might be your moment: The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary edition) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has just dropped to an all-time low of $67 on Amazon, down from its usual $84 price tag</a>. For fans who’ve spent decades watching Han Solo’s legendary <em>“hunk of junk”</em> outrun Imperial Star Destroyers, this mid-scale collectible brings that iconic vessel right into your living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another Lego set that’s going to end up collecting dust in a closet: The <strong>921-piece build provides adult fans with something more</strong>: a moment to quit staring at a screen and immerse themselves in a trance-like building experience that requires several intense hours to complete. The set depicts the Millennium Falcon as it was seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with all of the details that made it so iconic in its debut.</p>
<h2>Unique LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is part of LEGO’s starship collection which is a special line of <strong>mid-scale models designed exclusively for display purposes rather than play</strong>. The completed model stands 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide so it’s massive enough to draw attention on a bookshelf or desk without dominating your available space. The stand that comes with it does more than simply support the ship upright. It’s designed to angle the Falcon dynamically so that it looks as if it’s banked hard on a turn while it makes a daring escape.</p>



<p>The build process itself rewards patience and attention to detail. With 921 pieces, <strong>you’re looking at roughly 4-6 hours of construction time</strong> depending on your experience level. Each section reveals new layers of complexity as you work from the interior framework outward to the iconic hull plating. The cockpit section alone requires careful placement of transparent pieces to recreate those viewport windows, while the external paneling uses clever techniques to achieve the ship’s famously asymmetrical profile. The rotating satellite dish connects through a simple but satisfying mechanism that lets you adjust its position after completion.</p>
<p>This price drop represents genuine value for collectors: The set typically hovers around $84, and previous sales rarely dipped below $75. At $67, you’re getting a premium adult-focused building experience for roughly the cost of a standard mid-range LEGO set. The <strong>4.9-star rating across more than 1,800 reviews</strong> speaks to consistent quality.</p>

              <p>If you’re going to play games on your desktop PC, any old monitor won’t do. Sure, it would be nice to have a massive OLED ultra-wide curved display, but that’s not really necessary either. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4896/">Samsung has an excellent low budget gaming monitor that’s usually in the couple hundred dollar range, but happens to be on sale right now for as much as 45% off.</a> We’re in a bit of a deals drought between the Amazon Prime Big Deals Days and next month’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, so this is a pretty darn good savings for this time of year.</p>

Up a level, we have the 27-inch on sale for 35% off. That one usually goes for $230, but has come down by $80 to just $150. Then last we have the larger 32-inch display for 36%. That discount knocks off an even $100, taking the price down from $280 to just $180.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ceo-weighs-in-on-streamer-assault-at-twitchcon-%E2%80%98i-care-deeply-about-emiru%E2%80%99.1330261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A video showing a fan assaulting <a href="https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2000637226&amp;action=edit">cosplay livestreamer Emily “Emiru” Schunk at TwitchCon 2025</a> made every online content creator’s worst nightmare go viral. It’s created a new crisis of confidence in Twitch as streamers worry about how seriously the Amazon-owned platform is taking their safety and security. Comments from Twitch’s CEO did little to dispel those concerns.</p> <p>“The safety of our creators is our top priority,” Dan Clancy told Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602">in an interview</a> the day after the incident took place. “The challenge we face is a challenge in today’s society. It’s not limited to Twitch, it extends throughout our society.”</p>

 <p>The executive waxed philosophical about community moderation before talking specifically about what happened with Emiru.&nbsp;“I do think that when you’re livestreaming, in many ways, since you control your community and you can ban people, you can make it so that those people that you don’t want engaging with you and participating with you, aren’t there.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I asked Twitch CEO Dan Clancy about <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emiru</a> getting assaulted at Twitchcon and whether creators can trust the platform to keep them safe. Full interview will be out on my YouTube channel/podcast feed on Wednesday <a href="https://t.co/wTH13vhjBH">pic.twitter.com/wTH13vhjBH</a></p> <p>— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Now, what happened yesterday, obviously, was something that we care deeply about securing this environment. We’re looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi. She’s a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there’s always more work to be done, because that’s the world we live in now.</p></blockquote> <p>But the actions of “leaders in the industry” is not how Emiru has been describing Twitch’s response to the assault at its most recent event. In a video published the same day as the Clancy interview took place, she accused Twitch of lying about its response, claiming the platform’s initial desire was to just ban the alleged suspect for 30 days instead of for life. Emiru also claimed that no one from Twitch security immediately came to her aid or apprehended the suspect to escort him from the show.</p>

 <p>“Like if you watch the clip, the security guard who pushes the guy away is my security,” Emiru said. “The woman who pulls me to the back, my manager. If you’re a small streamer and you don’t have those resources or someone in your line’s not filming, what the fuck do you do? No one would have known.”</p> <p>The incident has led to renewed warnings about Twitch personalities attending in-person events and even, in some cases, calls for new ownership of Twitch.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-potions-class-drops-to-pennies-as-amazon-clears-stock-for-spooky-season-2000637338</link>

              <p>Lego has released plenty of Harry Potter sets over the years, and with Halloween just around the corner, Amazon’s kicking off the celebrations early by putting quite a few of them on sale. We’ve spotted Hagrid’s hut, Hogwarts Castle, and Aragog in the Forbidden Forest dropping in prices previously. But today, things are taking an even more magical turn – straight into the dungeons.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/">Amazon is being generous with a 35% discount on the Hogwarts Castle: Potions Class Building set, offering it for just $26</a>. That’s a nice $14 discount on a set that’ll fit beautifully into your current Harry Potter Lego setup, and even make a memorable gift for a fan in your family or friends. There’s no word on how long the discount will last, so it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Four Key Characters From the Movies</h2>
<p>This set lets you recreate Professor Severus Snape’s lessons in his dungeon classroom. It comes with 397 pieces, and includes a blackboard, potion bottles, ingredient jars, shelves, and all the other elements you’ll need to bring the setup to life. You’ll also get four minifigures; a very angry Severus Snape (not even surprised), Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, and Seamus Finnigan. We would’ve loved to see a confused Ron or Malfoy up to some mischief, but this lineup works just fine too.</p>



<p>The set also includes two randomly selected collectible Hogwarts portraits. These are part of a larger collection of 14, and can be a valuable addition to your collection if you’ve got one. As with all Lego sets, you’ll get a step-by-step instruction book that walks you through the entire build. It’s pretty easy to follow, even for kids who are building for the first time, but if you need more help, we recommend installing the Lego Builder app. You’ll get 3D instructions, so you can view every step from all angles to get a better idea. There’s also a “Build Together” mode, which is great for when multiple people are working on the same set. Plus, you can keep track of your progress, and see all your Lego projects in one place.</p>
<p>All in all, this set offers a great chance to relive a classic Harry Potter moment, and bring your favorite characters home. It’s made for ages 8 and up, but you can also treat yourself to it (no judgements), or gift it to a Wizarding World fan in your life.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-1tb-storage-card-is-now-practically-free-storage-for-xbox-at-0-10-per-gb.1330192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers, is there anything worse than having to delete a game just to make space for a new one? There isn’t and thankfully, you don’t have to deal with such problems. Game file sizes are growing, which calls for a storage solution that’s not just spacious, but also fast. The Seagate storage expansion card (1TB) offers all that and more, and you can now grab it without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s currently sitting at $130 on Amazon, which is 19% off its regular price</a>. We know it’s not a massive drop, but considering how it doesn’t go on sale that often, it’s definitely worth grabbing. The only catch is that the discount might not be around for long, so it’s best to grab it quick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Load Times, No Annoying Lags</h2>
<p>This card is designed in partnership with Xbox, so you won’t run into any frustrating compatibility issues. It also uses the same Xbox Velocity Architecture, meaning every title runs exactly as it would from internal storage. Expect faster load times, smooth gameplay, and an overall immersive environment without any slowdowns. Whether you’re playing an Original Xbox game or experimenting with the latest Series X|S release, this card handles it all. Quick Resume support means you can switch between games from both the internal SSD or the expansion card in literal seconds, and pick right where you left off.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">This version gets you 1TB of storage, which is more than enough to house all your favorite titles and then some.</a> This capacity should be enough for most gamers out there, but if you need more, Seagate also offers 2TB and 4TB options. Of course, these are priced a bit higher but the good news is that both are discounted right now too, with the 2TB version at $220 and the 4TB at $430.</p>
<p>Setting things up and getting started is fairly simple. There are no complicated procedures to follow, and you should be ready to play in just a few minutes. Seagate also includes <strong>a 3-year limited warranty</strong> with your purchase, so you will have that extra peace of mind if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you are looking to bid annoying storage problems goodbye and play without feeling limited, this Seagate storage card can be a great investment. It’s built in partnership with Xbox, and offers plenty of space to store all your favorites. The deal might not be around for long, so grab it soon.</p>
