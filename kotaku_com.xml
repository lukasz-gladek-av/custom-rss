              <p>Microsoft and Asus’ collaborative handheld Xbox device is arriving on October 16, 2025, with pre-orders available at various outlets right now. And as things go on the internet, eBay listings promising confirmed pre-orders are now <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=rog+ally+xbox+x&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_odkw=rog+ally+xbox&amp;_osacat=0">going for two to three times the retail price</a> –which is pretty ridiculous when the top-tier model of this handheld is already a thousand bucks.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-price-preorder-2000629161">Xbox’s Handheld Finally Has A Price, And It Costs More Than An Xbox</a></p> <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is an Xbox-skinned portable PC much like the Steam Deck or Asus’ own non-Xbox-branded “Ally.” These devices have become quite popular in recent years because, well, they’re usually pretty awesome. With the ability to carry around massive storefronts like Steam on the go, and enough horsepower to run graphical powerhouses like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, it’s no wonder Microsoft wanted to get in on the action with a more Xbox-themed offering. The only problem is that the hardware manufacturer and game publisher is asking folks to spend $600 on the basic model, and a full four-digit $1,000 for the top-tier model featuring a more powerful processor. And yet, some eBayers think folks will spend even more than that even though it hasn’t sold out elsewhere. Wild.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629896">© Screenshot: eBay / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Who’s buying this thing anyway?</h2> <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X (which is the more powerful of the two models) is <i>technically</i> more powerful than some of its competitors. It features a new AMD Z2E AI Chip. Is it a generational leap? Certainly not enough to prompt Valve to base a Steam Deck successor on it.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">Microsoft Reveals The First $800 Xbox With Another Round Of Price Hikes</a></p> <p>Still, the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/handheld-gaming-pcs/the-rog-xbox-ally-x-priced-at-usd1-000-and-available-to-pre-order-in-october-making-it-officially-the-most-expensive-xbox-ever/">improved performance of the Z2E</a> <i>is</i> worth noting, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Handhelds/comments/1m8ujhf/at_low_tdps_the_z2_extreme_is_a_generational_leap/">around a 10 to 20-percent performance improvement</a> over TKTK, and sometimes a bit more, under certain circumstances. That improvement, however, comes at a cost, namely about $500 more than what you’d pay for a Steam Deck, and $100 more than Asus’ excellent ROG Ally X, which is not the Xbox-branded one. (No, you’re not dumb, this naming convention is.)</p>

 <p>So, that really just leaves the controller-based Xbox user interface, which reduces the overall processing power Windows takes up and is more gamepad-friendly, and the unique controller grips. And even then, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934">folks have found a way to get the new Xbox game launcher working</a> on regular, non-Xbox-branded Ally portable PCs, and, to be honest, while I haven’t held a ROG Xbox Ally, it’s gonna be hard to compete with the Steam Deck’s excellent ergonomics.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934">The Biggest Reason To Buy The Xbox Ally Handheld Just Leaked</a></p> <p>At $1,000 for the top-tier Xbox handheld, it’s hard to see a compelling reason to upgrade if you already have a Steam Deck, and certainly not if you have a more powerful handheld than that. Who, then, is gonna get suckered into spending twice that for an eBay pre-order? Hopefully not you!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Welcome to a new week. Will it be better than last week? I really hope so! Anyway, today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and stuff you might care about, features a new and less shiny PS5, <em>Silent Hill f</em> sales data,<em> Borderlands 4</em> DLC news, a content creator retiring, and a cool Daft Punk video.</p> <h2><strong>New PS5 Model Ditches All That Shiny Black Plastic</strong></h2> <p>A new model of the PlayStation 5 has leaked online ahead of an official announcement from Sony, and while it’s not a massive update to the current iteration of the console, it does include one tweak that seems to be making a lot of people happy: The new PS5 doesn’t include shiny black plastic.<a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1972613838953476238"> As reported by Zuby_Tech</a>, new photos and information about the refreshed PS5 show that it features matte black plastic, saving you from having to cover your PS5 in nasty fingerprints every time you dare to move or touch it.</p> <p>Other changes found in this new, updated PS5 console include different-colored USB ports, a smaller SSD, and a new heatsink. The console is also overall a bit lighter now, likely thanks to more stamped metal parts inside. No word on when to expect this new console to hit shelves, but I’d bet it won’t be long, as we are getting close to the holiday season.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em> Outselling <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake</strong></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">『SILENT HILL f』</p> <p>全世界累計出荷本数※が100万本を突破しました。<br>プレイいただいた皆さまありがとうございます。</p> <p>■ゲームはこちら: <a href="https://t.co/msZNoMHzVg">https://t.co/msZNoMHzVg</a></p> <p>※2025年9月26日時点 当社調べ<br>※パッケージ版出荷数とダウンロード版販売数の合計<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SILENTHILL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SILENTHILL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%92%E3%83%AB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#サイレントヒル</a> <a href="https://t.co/P6jl93zhGW">pic.twitter.com/P6jl93zhGW</a></p> <p>— SILENT HILL (@silenthill_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/silenthill_jp/status/1972577585558433936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>People really like <em>Silent Hill f</em>, Konami’s first original mainline entry in the long-running horror series in over a decade. So I’m not shocked to see it selling so well. According to Konami, <em>Silent Hill f</em> sold a million copies in around 24 hours. <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">In a press release announcing the news</a>, the publisher also confirmed that <em>Silent Hill f</em> was selling faster than last year’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This is good news for <em>Silent Hill</em> fans who have spent the past decade putting up with a lot of bad news, garbage, and disappointment. Hopefully, this new era of <em>Silent Hill</em> isn’t short-lived.</p>

 <h2><strong>GOG Adds More Classic Games To Its Preservation Program&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Classic PC gaming store Good Old Games, aka <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WX">GOG, announced recently</a> that over half a dozen more titles were being added to its ongoing preservation program. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Launched in 2024</a>, the GOG Preservation Program is the store’s long-term plan to keep certain classic PC games playable, updated, and accessible. It’s a great idea and one which, if GOG sticks to it, could be extremely helpful for games that no longer have official publisher or developer support.</p>

 <p>Here’s the latest list of games added to the program, many of which are currently on sale to celebrate the news:</p> <p><em>– Gothic 1</em><br> <em>– Gothic 2</em><br> <em>– Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness</em><br> <em>– Mortal Kombat Trilogy</em><br> <em>– Freespace 2</em><br> <em>– XIII Century Gold Edition</em><br> <em>– Stranglehold</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Gearbox Reveals <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em>‘s First DLC Character&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p>Over the weekend during Tokyo Game Show, Gearbox and 2K Games revealed the first playable DLC character coming to<em> Borderlands 4:</em> C4SH, a gambling robot cowboy built around luck and chance. <a href="https://x.com/borderlandshub/status/1972264469280559301">Fan account Borderlands 4 Bulletin shared more information</a> about the new Vault Hunter on social media directly from the Gearbox TGS panel. The studio says that C4SH will have 3 action skills just like the other playable characters and that the character’s skills are “distinctly unpredictable, as they all involve an element of chance.”</p>

 <p>C4SH will be available in Q1 2026 for all players on all platforms who own the Super Deluxe Edition of <em>Borderlands 4,</em> buy the Vault Hunter Pack DLC, or who purchase the game’s first Story Pack when it’s available.</p> <p><strong><em>Skyrim</em> Grandma Shirley Curry Retiring (Again)&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/almost-90-years-old-skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-says-shes-retiring-from-the-adventuring-life-im-tired-im-not-having-fun-anymore/">As reported by<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> Shirley Curry, better known online as the famous <em>Skyrim</em> Grandma, is retiring from content creation. The nearly 90-year-old gamer, who will appear in <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> when that finally launches, <a href="https://youtu.be/89L4oV-ZKqM">confirmed the news in a new VLOG uploaded to her YouTube channel.</a> She explained that she’s just “bored” with playing <em>Skyrim</em> again and isn’t having a great experience on YouTube anymore, as many of the comments she got were just, according to her, younger kids shouting about how much they loved their video game grandma. She says she wanted more feedback and interesting conversations.</p> <p>“That’s why I’m just going to stop uploading anything to do with <em>Skyrim</em>,” said Curry. “I’m tired, I’m not having fun anymore, probably because of all the little kids on there. I think that’s about all I have to say.”</p> <p>Curry will keep making VLOGS and blogging, but her days with <em>Skyrim</em> are over. Probably. It was just a year ago that Curry actually announced similar plans to retire from <em>Elder Scrolls</em> content, but then came back and even made a video of herself playing the <em>Oblivion Remaster</em>. But based on how she sounds in this new VLOG, I get the feeling she really is done with <em>Skyrim</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is turning into a giant <em>Fortnite</em>-like mess</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-free-to-play-game-tech-debt-ceo-discord-ps5-pc-fps-performance-2000629256"><em>Helldivers 2</em> was, at one point, planned to be a free-to-play game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-america-3ds-satoru-shibata-2000629269">Nintendo of America’s New CEO Seems Fun</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When we look back on 2025, we might remember it as the Year of the Mini PC. These mighty mites broke out in a huge way this year, with powerful and fast new models flooding the market and putting to rest the idea that the mini PC is no more than an amusing toy. Virtually all of these new-breed mini PCs have pushed the productivity and work angle as their selling point, but now the BOSGAME P3 Mini Gaming PC has arrived, combining serious processing and graphics power essential for PC gaming with the ultra-compact body that has made the mini PC such a hot item.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/">There’s a limited-time 27% off deal on the BOSGAME P3 at Amazon right now which gives you the chance to shrink your gaming rig smaller than you ever thought possible, and do it for just $400.</a> With the P3 running the show, your gaming station can now fit three massive 4K gaming monitors and your specialized keyboard, mouse, and controller while the PC at the heart of the system is tucked behind one of those monitors, delivering top-level performance while remaining unseen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gaming PC, Not a Toy</h2>
<p>The old-school thought that these fun-sized desktop PCs are mere curiosities and toys that could never possibly compete with a full-sized rig is just that — old school. Beneath its teeny hood the P3 packs an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 processor with a top speed of 5.1GHz, more than enough to keep you in the game even during a fast-action first-person shooter or battle royal game.</p>
<p>There’s also 32GB of RAM built in, along with a fat 1TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD. And while you certainly would not guess it from looking at this palm-sized PC, you can expand that RAM to 64GB, and there’s even a vacant NVMe PCIe slot available for you to max out the storage.</p>



<h2>Fast, Smooth Graphics</h2>
<p>And, yes, we did say three huge 4K gaming monitors, because the P3 can support them all with HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C ports at the ready. The AMD Radeon 780M graphics chip is able to keep up with the fastest and most visually detailed games without lag or glitching. And whether you go with the Wi-Fi6E connection, the Bluetooth 5.2 one, or either of the two Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 ports for hardwired online gaming, you will never be lacking in speed.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before a mini PC for gamers hit the market, and when you look at the prices of those enormous rigs with the fancy neon lighting and clear panels showing the guts of the machine, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/">you’ll really be blown away by the $400 price tag on the BOSGAME P3 Mini Gaming PC that you’ll find right now at Amazon.</a> But, it’s only there for a limited time, so be as fast as the P3’s impressive processing and internet speed and get to Amazon now before it’s over.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-scarecrow-puzzle-field-hinako-2000629866</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Early on in <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent Hill f</i></a>, as Hinako and friends try to regroup after the fog and its monsters roll into town, our girl finds herself stranded in the middle of a field, surrounded by scarecrows dressed like schoolchildren wielding sickles. Like many moments in <i>f</i>, the way through this challenge involves some puzzle solving and a couple of scuffles. What really makes this moment sing, however, is how it combines the separate elements of <i>Silent Hill f</i> into one: Puzzle solving, paranoid dread, and combat that will punish you for sloppy mistakes.</p> <p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em>: The&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></p> <p>The scarecrows are, of course, no ordinary scarecrows, and can definitely turn those sickles on you. They don’t attack immediately, however; instead, they remain frozen, waiting for you to pick the right one based on a cryptic riddle, after which the correct scarecrow will point you in the direction of the next challenge and eventually out of the fog. Choose the wrong scarecrow and you’ll get attacked, with few replacement weapons in sight. Oh, and you’ll regularly hear footsteps behind you as you try to figure out which scarecrow is the correct one. Yes, they are following you, but only when you’re not looking. The number of scarecrows and the speed with which they freeze when you turn to look at them is enough to make you question whether or not you’re hearing things, and even those footsteps don’t guarantee an attack every time you hear them. Early on, I wondered if the game was just playing the sound effect to screw with me. Nope! I was eventually attacked by one of these freaks.</p> <p>The horror of this whole scene isn’t one of blood dripping red in your face, but instead comes from the pressure to figure out the puzzle, which is virtually immune to brute force solutions, in a timely manner. The sheer tension of this situation, sustained in the perpetual gray fog of this endless field, makes it one of <i>f</i>’s best moments.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629872" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629872"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629872">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Most of <i>Silent Hill f</i>’s puzzles resist brute-force solutions due to their sheer number of variables. Many of them are technically solvable by just trying out every possible combination, but it’s all too easy to end up spinning your wheels in frustration for far longer than is necessary instead (ask me how I know). What makes the field puzzle so uniquely resistant to brute force is that it punishes you rather harshly for just trying to spam your way through it.</p>

 <p>Each scarecrow segment starts with a riddle like:</p> <blockquote><p>Can you even imagine how I feel?<br> I’ll put on my polite smile for now.</p></blockquote> <p>You’ll then need to choose the one that best fits the description from among around half-a-dozen scarecrows. It’s not easy; you’ll have to determine which scarecrow seems to give a “polite smile,” or in another instance, which scarecrow looks like it’s betraying another.</p>

 <p>Against your better judgment, you’ll have to get up close and personal with many of the scarecrows, with footsteps playing behind you sporadically, and the chance that one of these freaks is actually ready to jump you at any moment.</p> <p>During my first playthrough, I screwed up the final puzzle of this whole sequence and had about five or six scarecrows stalking me around the feels as I frantically tore at the remaining ones to find the correct solution.</p> <p>The puzzle also deals with <i>f</i>’s consistent themes about love, longing, betrayal, and harm; so, not only is the game asking you to survive the dread of the endless gray fog and murderous scarecrows, but you’ll also be trying to figure out how this sequence fits in with <i>f</i>’s cryptic narrative. It’s a nice mixture of traditional survival horror puzzle solving,&nbsp; the threat of the game’s punishing combat, and its looming sense of dread, all without feeling like it’s a bunch of abstract symbol-matching or number crunching.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-peacemaker-dance-pulled-over-nazi-concerns-following-latest-episode%E2%80%99s-big-reveal.1311544/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“Peaceful Hips” is an&nbsp;emote that was added to <em>Fortnite</em> earlier this month. Part of the “DC Series,” it cost 400 V-Bucks and referenced HBO’s show <em>Peacemaker</em>, specifically a dance move the character does in the season 2 intro that has him flapping his arms and swerving his hips around. That was all fine and good until the comic book series’ big season 2 reveal last week cast it in a different light. Epic Games has now pulled the cosmetic over concerns about its “creative intentions.” In plain English, Epic is worried it might be intended to look like a Nazi Swastika.</p> <p>“We’re disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in <em>Fortnite</em> as we inquire into our partner’s creative intentions in this collab emote,” the battle roayle’s <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447">official account</a> announced over the weekend. “Assuming it’s not coming back, we’ll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks.” All of this weirdness stems from the following dance which players were previously able to buy separately or as part of the Peacemaker bundle:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629848"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629848">Epic Games / DiscussingFilm / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It wasn’t until <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2 episode 6 that some people started seeing it in a different light. Full <strong>spoiler warning</strong> ahead if you haven’t watched yet and don’t want to know what happens.</p> <p>Chris Smith, AKA Peacemaker, doesn’t want to leave the alternate dimension where things seem “perfect” despite that menacing suspicion that something is very, very off.&nbsp; It turns out that this Earth-2 the mercenary’s been hanging out in is actually Earth-X, our planet in an alternate timeline where the United States lost to Hitler’s Germany in WWII. In case the lack of any non-white people didn’t give it away already, the big reveal comes when Chris realizes there’s a Swastika on the American flag. It now seems like that Nazi theme may have made it into the <em>Fortnite</em> emote. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/09/28/fortnite-disables-alleged-nazi-peacemaker-emote-after-show-reveal/"><em>Forbes</em> notes</a> its similarity to a&nbsp; dance Donald Duck performs in the&nbsp; Disney short “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7vb89c6pQY">Der Fuehrer’s Face</a>” when he’s trained to become a Nazi.</p> <p>The headscratching part is how Epic Games didn’t know about this twist coming ahead of time, or who at Warner Bros. or HBO would have tried to keep its “creative intentions” hidden. The show is written and directed by James Gunn, the creative force fueling <em>Superman</em> and the rest of the rebooted DC universe right now. Epic would have seemingly developed the emote in-house, suggesting that it didn’t initially raise any suspicions internally. Live by the branded cosmetic, fail by the branded cosmetic, I suppose.</p>
