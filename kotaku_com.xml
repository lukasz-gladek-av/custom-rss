              <p>Getting kids started with Pokemon card collecting can get expensive fast when you’re buying individual booster packs at the store for $5 to $7 each with only 10 cards inside. Building up enough cards to actually trade with friends or organize by type requires buying multiple packs and suddenly you’ve dropped $50 without even getting any rare cards.</p>
<p>Amazon just slashed <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">the price on their 50-card Pokemon bundle from $10 down to just $5, which works out to 10 cents per card</a>. This is the perfect starter pack for kids beginning their collection and (smart) parents are ordering four or five bundles at once to give their kids a substantial trading base right from the start.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Random Pokemon Cards</h2>
<p>The <strong>set includes 50 cards randomly selected from all Pokemon series</strong> from the old beginning of the card game in the original 1999 base set to the new releases. The set will comprise a variety of Pokemon character cards with some old favorites like <em>Pikachu</em> and <em>Charizard</em> to new generations kids are accustomed to from existing games and television programs. The <strong>set includes Energy cards too</strong> which are required to play the game as opposed to collecting the cards.</p>



<p>The random nature of the selection makes each package different and builds anticipation as you open the package because you never quite know what you’ll be receiving. This element of mystery replicates the booster pack buying experience at the market but you’ll be receiving five times the number of cards for the same cost. The randomness keeps kids getting Pokemon from various evolutionary levels, types, and power levels to introduce them to the depth of the Pokemon universe as opposed to receiving multiple copies of the same handful of characters.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates happen within one set </strong>or across sets if you buy a bunch of sets at one time. This is actually a benefit rather than a flaw for children assembling collections, since replicas become desirable trade material. When your kid has two or three of the same card, they can trade the spares with others who need that particular Pokemon to fill out their set or construct a superior deck. Learn the value of negotiation, social interaction, and value exchange within the context of something enjoyable, not educational.</p>



<p>Each of the Pokemon cards features the character’s hit points (HP), attacks with costs in energies along with values of damage, weaknesses, resistances, and retreat costs. The cards with energies show the single type with the Pokemon energies that the children recognize. The cards are the same size, girth and quality as cards found in booster packs that can be purchased at retailers.</p>
<p>Buying four or five bundles makes economic sense because 50 cards is actually the beginning of a serious collection. Buying four or five bundles puts kids right out of the gate with 200 to 250 cards that instantly put together a substantial-looking collection. They can then construct dozens of finished decks with different Pokemon types, a slew of duplicates with which to trade, yet still retain a display collection of their very favorites. At $5 per pack, buying five packs still costs a grand total of $25, the same as buying five single booster packs at the store that would net you the same 50 cards anyway.</p>
<p>For $5 rather than $10, this is the cheapest Amazon has ever sold this set at.</p>

              <p>This past week, Amazon ran its seasonal Prime Day-adjacent sales event. The October one has been given the clumsy name Prime Big Deals Days, but don’t let that fool you. The deals were quite good, but unfortunately the event has come to a close. If you missed out on grabbing yourself something cool at a discount, no need to worry. There are still a number of excellent deals happening right now despite the sales event being over.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4728/"> Like at this moment, this GMKtec mini gaming PC has been cut down in price by 25%. The mini PC normally goes for $800, but the deal has knocked off a clean $200.</a> That brings the price you pay down to just $600 for a limited time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-acer-aspire-15-slim-laptop-is-now-practically-free-it%E2%80%99s-not-refurbished-and-even-cheaper-than-entry-level-ipad.1323589/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon noticed there wasn’t much happening in October. September has Labor Day, November has Black Friday, but October was always quiet. That’s why it created its own shopping holiday: Prime Big Deal Days. The event officially ran from October 7 to 8, but even though it’s over, many of the best deals are still live. From lawnmowers and vacuums to laptops, Amazon seems in no rush to pull those discounts just yet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/">This Acer Aspire 15 slim laptop has a pretty affordable starting price to begin with at $350. For the sale, Amazon has chopped off 20% which saves you a whopping $70. That brings the price you pay down to just $280.</a></p>
<p>So what’s this laptop working with? The Acer Aspire Go is powered by an 8-core, Intel Core 3 processor N355 with an integrated Intel graphics. It’s got 8GB of memory an 128GB of UFS storage. It’s a great little workhorse designed for browsing the internet, sending emails, and writing up Word docs. Sorry, you’ll have to go with something a little more powerful if you’re looking to play CyberPunk 2077 in ultra-high settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable and User-Friendly</h2>
<p>The laptop measures in at 15.6 inches with a super narrow bezel to maximize the screen real estate while keeping the computer compact. It displays in a resolution of up to 1080p Full HD which is plenty at that size. For bouts where you’re find yourself on the laptop for multiple hours at a time, you can turn on Acer BluelightShield. This reduces the levels of blue light to help less the effects of blue light exposure. Keep your eyes from feeling strained so you can get your work finished up.</p>



<p>As far as connectivity is concerned, you have a number of different ports along the sides of the Acer Aspire 15. Along the left, you’ll find two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and an HDMI 2.1 slot so you can display on a second monitor. On the right side, you have one more USB-A port so you can connect to wired accessories like a mouse or external SSD. The laptop has Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 support so you can utilize fast internet speeds when on a Wi-Fi 6 network.</p>
<p>Video call with colleagues, family or friends thanks to the on-board 720p HD web camera. It can capture high-quality footage even in low light conditions, plus can reduce noise and amplify your voice using AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/">Right now, Amazon has the Acer Aspire 15 slim laptop on sale for just $280 even after Prime Big Deal Days.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>LEGO Star Wars sets have become hot collectibles that fly off shelves even among people who’ve never seen a single movie. The appeal goes way beyond fandom: these are legitimate display pieces that look expensive sitting on a desk or shelf, and they provide hours of meditative building that actually helps you unwind after work.</p>
<p>This particular <em>Millennium Falcon</em> model celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Lego Star Wars line has a perfect 4.9 out of 5 stars from nearly 1,800 reviews and ranks as one of Amazon’s best-selling sets even at full price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Amazon has dropped it from $84 to just $67, which is the lowest price this set has ever been</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This isn’t one of the gigantic 7,500-piece LEGO sets that occupies half your dining room table for a month: The <strong>build with 921 pieces is big enough to be a true project but small enough that you can tackle it over a long weekend</strong> or a couple of easy evenings. The completed model is <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide</strong> which is a nice size to sit nicely on a bookshelf.</p>
<p>The model builds the Millennium Falcon as seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with true-to/detail features such as the characteristic cockpit offset to the right side of the vessel, the disc-shaped satellite dish resting on top, and the four-laser cannons placed at the upper and lower panels. The plates of the exterior embody the worn, lived-in appearance of the galaxy’s fastest hunk of junk with the greebling and textured panels that give depth and realism to the classic saucer form.</p>



<p>The included display stand is what elevates this from a toy to a legitimate decorative piece: The stand angles the ship at a dynamic tilt that makes it look like it’s banking through space during a chase sequence. This angled presentation adds visual interest and creates the impression of motion, which is way more engaging than a flat horizontal display. The stand includes a printed nameplate that reads <em>“Millennium Falcon”</em> along with a special 25th Anniversary Lego Star Wars commemorative brick, marking this as part of the anniversary collection.</p>
<p>In the $67 rather than $84 range, this offers a 20% savings as the lowest price this anniversary set has seen since release.</p>

              <p>It’s easy to feel cramped up when you’re working or gaming on a single screen. An easier (and cheaper) solution than upgrading your entire setup is to add a second display, and bonus points if it’s portable. The 15.6-inch MNN portable monitor is an excellent option to consider for this, and right now, you don’t have to pay the full price for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">It was already quite affordable at $90, but currently it sits at just $60 on Amazon after a 33% discount.</a> This discount is a limited-time one, so act fast to grab it while the offer is still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Slim, Portable Build With Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS panel, which is the same as many full-sized laptop screens. Resolution pushes to 1920×1080 for a sharp, vibrant display, regardless of what you’re using it for. Visuals are pretty much consistent from any angle, and the matte finish helps cut down on reflections, so using it in brighter settings won’t be a problem. And since these specs match what you’ll find on many built-in laptop screens, you really won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between your main display and this one.</p>
<p>There are also multiple display modes for different tasks. We’re talking Extended Mode for a larger screen space, Second Screen Mode for a dual-monitor setup, Portrait Mode to use it as a vertical display, and more. Maybe go with the extended option while playing a game, and the portrait mode when you’re reading something!</p>



<p>Connectivity options include two full-feature USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port, meaning you can connect it to your laptop, PC, smartphone, tablet, MacBook, gaming console, or even a Switch. Just note that your device needs to support USB-C DP Alt Mode or HDMI output. If it does, a single USB-C cable that comes included in the box should be enough to handle both power and video.</p>
<p>The monitor itself is quite lightweight and easy to carry around. You’re also getting a scratch-proof smart cover made of durable PU leather exterior. It not only protects the screen from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand that you can use to easily prop the monitor up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">Altogether, this is quite an affordable option to consider if you’ve been wanting to invest in a second screen that works with a range of devices</a>. It goes with you wherever you go, and there are no compromises on the visual quality.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-its-now-going-for-pennies-2000634598</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-going-for-pennies.1323541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages during hurricane season, winter storms knocking out electricity for days or those rolling blackouts during summer heatwaves – these aren’t rare anymore, they’re becoming the new normal. Having a reliable backup power source is now essential for keeping your family safe and comfortable when the grid goes down.</p>
<p>Amazon just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">price on the 1,800W EcoFlow Delta 2 from $699 to $429</a>, which makes it the lowest price we’ve ever tracked for this powerhouse portable power station that <strong>can run 90% of your household appliances</strong>. This is the unit that sells out every time severe weather hits and right now you can grab it at 39% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Power Station</h2>
<p>The EcoFlow Delta 2 is equipped with a <strong>1024-watt-hour LiFePO4 battery that has 1800W of continuous AC power</strong> through four standard wall outlets. That 1800-watt power rating puts it in a whole different class compared to smaller power stations because it can power high-draw appliances such as space heaters, power tools, electric grills, and even clothes washers.</p>
<p>The unit achieves a <strong>surge capacity of up to 2700 watts to power the initial surge</strong> of power with motor-driven appliances turning on so that your refrigerator or air conditioner kicks on without a hiccup. LiFePO4 chemistry is capable of over <strong>3000 full charge cycles until the battery degrades to 80% capacity</strong>, which equates to about 10 years of day use. This is six times longer compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries used within lower-cost power stations.</p>



<p>The charging speed on this device is completely nuts: The <strong>Delta 2 reaches 80% from zero in 50 minutes</strong> and 100% in 80 minutes with a standard wall outlet. That’s seven times as fast as previous EcoFlow products and enables you to get disaster backup power virtually instantly when storms are looming. The product feeds 1200 watts of AC input to the battery and that’s why it charges that quickly. The fans do run noisier during this fast charging mode and reaches approximately 58 decibels, but the charging speed can be lowered with the EcoFlow app to minimize noise if you are charging overnight.</p>
<p>The front panel is flush<strong> with 15 assorted outlets</strong>: You’ve got four AC outlets that together carry a rating of 1800 watts, two USB-C ports each carrying 100 watts of power (capable of fast-charging two MacBook Pros simultaneously), four USB-A with assorted speeds including two capable of 18-watt fast charging, one 12-volt auto outlet ideal for items such as portable coolers, and one DC5521 output port.</p>



<p>The LCD display shows real-time power input and output in watts, remaining battery percentage and estimated runtime based on your current load. This makes it easy to see exactly how much juice you have left and plan accordingly. The <em>EcoFlow</em> app adds remote control functionality and allows you to monitor power usage from anywhere, adjust charging speeds, and control connected outlets even when you’re not near the unit. The app also provides detailed energy consumption statistics so you can see which devices are draining the battery fastest.</p>
<p>The <strong>unit weighs 27 pounds</strong> which is heavier than the smaller capacity power stations yet light enough to be lifted with one hand with the heavy-duty built-in handle. The compact unit doesn’t occupy much floor space, and the top is level to easily stack items on top of it or store it away under a desk. The power station functions in extreme temperatures as well as features advanced battery management with 62 different protective features that <strong>watch temperature, voltage, current, and other vitals to ensure that everything stays within the safety range</strong>.</p>
<p>At $429 instead of $699, this is a 39% off deal and the lowest price that this power station has ever reached on Amazon. As with these units, they always seem to run out of stock during natural disasters when everyone wakes up as one to the sudden realization that they could use some backup power, so don’t delay waiting until the next hurricane watch to come to a decision.</p>

              <p>Gamers and deal hunters usually don’t fish in the same ponds. Deal hunters are often willing to cut a few corners and give up a few features in the name of the almighty wallet. But to a gamer, sacrificing features like a fast processor and quick, reactive screen mean certain elimination in a battle royal game or enough lag-induced annoyance that those extra few hundred bucks are almost always worth shelling out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">But when a gaming laptop like this 15-inch beauty from Lenovo takes a sharp and completely unexpected $1,000 price dive at Amazon and is transformed from a $1,700 investment into an incredible $650 deal</a>, the gamers and deal hunters will be racing to be the first to click buy. And while Amazon’s supply of these hot gaming laptops is almost certainly ample, the amount of time left on the deal might not be — it’s always hard to tell just how “limited” a limited-time Amazon deal is.</p>

<h2>The Specs Check Out</h2>
<p>We know the deal hunters were already satisfied when they saw that 62% discount label on this Lenovo, but the gamers are all about the specs. Good news — they check out, starting with the six-core, 12-thread AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor with a base speed of 3.3GHz and boost speed up to 4.55GHz. Add in the 40GB of DDR5 RAM and large-scale 1TB PCIe SSD, and while it may not be able to go toe to toe with those $3,000-plus pro rigs, the Lenovo massively overperforms on that new $650 Amazon price.</p>
<p>The screen also passes muster — it’s a 15.3-inch WUXGA (1920×1200) IPS panel with a slightly taller aspect ratio than the standard 16:9 for a little extra visual real estate. The 300 nits of brightness combined with anti-glare coating mean you don’t have to dim all the lights and draw the blackout shades to get a good picture. The Radeon 660M integrated GPU is perfect for eSports, mid-level FPS and battle royal games, and most definitely for streaming and creative work.</p>



<h2>Lagless Internet</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 is an absolute must for any gaming laptop, and the Lenovo delivers, along with Bluetooth 5.3 for controllers. There’s DisplayPort support too, along with other ports including two USB-A, one HDMI 1.4, and an SD card reader. It’s preloaded with Windows 11 Pro and Microsoft Copilot, so even when it’s not in gaming mode it’s a more than ample everyday laptop.</p>
<p>While the gaming shoppers almost never look at anything below four figures, and deal hunters won’t normally seek anything with that comma in the price, everyone’s wants, needs, and interests are satisfied by the 62% off limited-time Amazon deal on this 15.3-inch Lenovo gaming laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">It’s just $650 if you’re quick enough to catch it before it’s gone.</a></p>
