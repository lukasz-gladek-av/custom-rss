              <p>The 2000s had the EyeToy. The 2010s had the Kinect. And now the 2020s have the Nex Playground. This play system will get you and the whole family up from the couch, moving and grooving while you play a variety of awesome games. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5753/">Thanks to Amazon’s Black Friday, you can grab the Nex Playground on sale. It’s currently 20% off.</a> That brings the price down from $249 to just $199, saving you an even $50. That ends up being less than half the price of the new Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5753/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Get Up and Moving to Play</h2>
<p>The Nex Playground is a plug-and-play gaming console built around motion controls. No controller necessary because your body is the controller. Just connect it to your TV over HDMI with the front camera pointed toward a space you’ve cleared enough in front of it for you to move around in. Depending on the game, up to four players can be up and out of their seats to play along together.</p>
<p>Out of the box, you’ll have access to five fun games. This includes <em>Fruit Ninja</em>, <em>Go Keeper</em>, <em>Party Fowl</em>, <em>Whac-a-Mole</em>, and <em>Starri</em>. This may be enough to keep you entertained, but you can dive into a huge library of even more games with the Nex Playground Play Pass. Yu’ll gain access to new games each month, some of which feature famous and beloved characters from Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda and more. The full catalog includes over 30 games.</p>



<p>The Play Pass can be purchased separately from you Nex Playground. The three-month pass can be acquired for $49 while a full-year pass is set at $89. That works out to just a little over $7 per month. That cheaper than most streaming services go for nowadays. One Play Pass can be used on up to two Nex Playgrounds in the same household. Great for if you have one in the living room and then one in either a finished basement or kid’s bedroom.</p>
<p>The Nex Playground is safe for kids and families as all content is made to be appropriate for all ages. No mature content, no in-app purchases, but best of all the system has no ads. It’s nice to be able to boot up a smart device in the year 2025 without being bombarded with advertising.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q10-s5-drops-53-off-amazon-wants-every-unit-gone-from-black-friday-day-one-2000645764</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-q10-s5-drops-53-off-amazon-wants-every-unit-gone-from-black-friday-day-one.1359613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Roborock Q10 S5+ became <strong>Roborock’s best-selling model within hours of Black Friday starting</strong>&nbsp;and that makes perfect sense when you see the pricing. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">robot vacuum and mop combo just dropped to a record low of $259 on Amazon, down from its usual $549 (53% off)</a>&nbsp;while most other Roborock models sit between $600 and $1,000 even with Black Friday discounts.</p>
<p>Roborock built its reputation as a premium brand that competes directly with high-end options from iRobot and Ecovacs and their performance typically commands premium pricing. Robot vacuums solve the eternal problem of maintaining clean floors without dedicating hours to manual vacuuming and mopping each week. The <strong>Q10 S5+ combines 10,000Pa suction, 70-day self-emptying capacity, sonic mopping</strong>, and intelligent obstacle avoidance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>70 Days of Truly Hands-Free Floor Cleaning</h2>
<p>The<strong> self-emptying station holds a 2.7-liter dust bag that stores debris for as long as 70 days</strong> before needing replacement. This capacity eliminates the weekly ritual of emptying dustbins that plagues basic robot vacuums and standard self-emptying models with smaller bags. Pet owners, in particular, benefit from the extended capacity since pet hair builds up fast and fills smaller dust containers in days. The station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin after each cleaning session, so you never touch dust or allergens during normal operation.</p>



<p>The <strong>10,000Pa HyperForce suction is serious cleaning power</strong> that pulls embedded pet hair from carpets, lifts crumbs from hardwood grooves, and extracts debris from tile grout lines. This is much stronger than many upright vacuums provide and means this robot can deeply clean rather than just lightly maintain surfaces. Power is automatically adjusted based on floor type and debris detection and rampus up on carpets and dialing it back on hard floors to balance cleaning performance against battery life. A dual anti-tangle system utilizes a JawScrapers comb on the main brush, combined with specialized side brush design to prevent hair wrapping that stops cheaper robots dead in their tracks mid-clean.</p>



<p>The <em>VibraRise</em> 2.0 mopping system scrubs floors with<strong> sonic vibration at 3,000 oscillations per minute</strong>&nbsp;which generates actual cleaning action rather than just dragging a damp cloth across surfaces. This type of sonic scrubbing picks up dried spills, sticky residue, and ground-in dirt that static mopping systems leave behind. When transitioning onto carpets,<strong> it lifts the mop pad up to 8 mm</strong> and saves wet mopping pads from soaking rugs or carpet edges.</p>
<p><em>ReactiveTech</em> obstacle avoidance uses structured light technology that detects objects in its path and navigates with precision around them. The system <strong>identifies shoes, cables, pet toys, and furniture legs without bumping into them</strong> or getting stuck. This obstacle detection works in low-light conditions where camera-based systems struggle, maintaining reliable navigation during nighttime cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation <strong>scans rooms 360 degrees to create detailed maps</strong> that enable efficient cleaning patterns. It also supports multi-level mapping, remembering layouts for different floors in multi-story homes. The robot will plan an optimal cleaning route that can minimize the area of repeated coverage and reduce cleaning time. <strong>You can set no-go zones, invisible walls, and schedules for specific rooms</strong> with the Roborock app, giving you granular control over where and when the robot cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, the Roborock Q10 S5+ is less than half price while delivering features and performance that usually require spending upwards of $600. The fact that this became Roborock’s Black Friday bestseller in a matter of hours proves that buyers recognize exceptional value when premium performance falls to mid-tier pricing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Welcome to the coolest show in town, <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint. This is our daily roundup of video game news and other interesting stuff you might care about. Squeeze in, find a seat, and get ready to be blown away by this morning’s showcase, which includes bad news for fans of <em>The Finals</em> on PS4, more layoffs, Sakurai wanting to live a chill life, and more.</p> <h2>Some games that sold a single physical copy in October</h2> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">According to data from Circana’s Matt Piscatella</a>, some odd, old games sold exactly one new physical copy in the United States during October. If you were the person out there who bought a physical copy of <em>Spore</em> in October, email me a photo of the receipt. I want to talk to you about your life. I hope things turn around for you. And if you are the person who bought <em>Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em> on GBA last month, you are a wild individual, and I respect it. Here’s the full list:</p>

 <ul> <li>360- <em>Burnout Paradise</em></li> <li>3DS-<em> Carnival Games: Wild West 3D</em></li> <li>GBA-<em> Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em></li> <li>NDS- <em>Imagine Fashion Stylist</em></li> <li>PC- <em>Spore</em></li> <li>PS2-<em> Backyard Baseball</em></li> <li>PS3- <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em></li> <li>PS4- <em>Cooking Mama Cookstar</em></li> <li>XBX- <em>Ultra Bust A Move</em></li> </ul> <h2>Avalanche Liverpool closes, 31 devs laid off</h2> <p>In September, Avalanche Liverpool, the studio behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">canceled Xbox game <em>Contraband</em></a>, announced it would be shutting down. And now that has happened. On November 19, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">the studio announced via its official website</a> that it had completely closed its doors and 31 developers had been laid off as a result.</p>

 <p>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project. We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios&nbsp;Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avalanchers through the transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.”</p>

 <h2>Leave <em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai alone</h2> <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html"><u>Game*Spark,</u></a> <em>Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai talked about how he doesn’t consider his life all that interesting and wishes people would just focus on the games and not who made them. So he was surprised that people wanted to turn his story into a manga.</p>

 <p>“I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life,” Sakurai told the outlet, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros-and-kirby-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-its-best-to-just-play-games-instead-of-looking-at-who-made-them-so-please-dont-perceive-him/">as translated by <em>Gamesradar.</em></a> “Even with [being contacted about creating the manga], I’m sure my response was something like ‘really?'”</p>

 <p>“I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life. I think it’s best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Finals</em> on PS4 will be shut down next year</h2> <p>Before Embark Studios released the massively popular <em>Arc Raiders</em> last month, the company published the destructive shooter <em>The Finals</em> across consoles and PC. It wasn’t as big of a hit, but it’s still kicking and getting updates. But not for much longer on PlayStation 4, <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592?t=swsOGicwN1vsbqWO-_CZjg&amp;s=19">as confirmed by the studio earlier this week</a>.</p> <p>“When Season 10 begins (18th of March, 2026), we’ll be retiring <em>The Finals</em> on PlayStation 4 and focusing our support on current generation hardware,” posted Embark Studios. “From that point on, you’ll need to play there to keep enjoying the game. Your progress and purchases will be stored in your Embark ID and will transfer to anywhere you choose to play. We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who’s been part of the PS4 community.”</p> <h2>Huh, Panic Button handled some Switch 2 port upgrades for Nintendo</h2> <p>Remember how, when the Switch 2 launched, some popular OG Switch games published by Nintendo, like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, got upgrades to look and play a bit better on the new machine? Well, turns out that Switch port experts Panic Button were contracted by Nintendo to handle those upgrades.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Panic Button was honored to be selected by Nintendo to help update marquee games from the Nintendo Switch™ library.  Nintendo asked us to help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system, while remaining faithful to the original games. <a href="https://t.co/5P96V9DFUq">pic.twitter.com/5P96V9DFUq</a></p> <p>— Panic Button (Official) (@PanicButtonGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanicButtonGame/status/1991264499676930507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I find this very interesting, as it seems like something Nintendo could have done internally. But instead, they trusted the folks at Panic to handle the upgrades. I bet Panic is feeling very good about that right now, and it will likely help the studio get even more work porting games to the new Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><em>Deadpool VR</em> is perfect…for fans of Deadpool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495">MrBeast’s new “theme park” looks…uh…not great</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412">Critics seem to mostly like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="158" data-end="922">For PlayStation 5 owners who regularly find themselves bumping up against the console’s limited storage, keep reading. In the lead-up to Black Friday, Crucial has cut the price of one of its PS5-compatible SSDs, making it easier and more affordable to expand your game library.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/"> The 2TB Crucial P510 Gen5 NVMe SSD normally priced around $210 has been discounted by 29%, bringing the cost down to $150.</a> That’s a meaningful $60 reduction on a high-performance SSD equipped with its own heatsink for seamless compatibility right out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="158" data-end="922">PS5 &amp; PC Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="924" data-end="1686">One of the most common frustrations among early PS5 adopters is the reality of the console’s internal storage limitations. Even though Sony technically lists the system as having an 825GB SSD, the usable space is significantly smaller. After accounting for system files and required software, players are left with roughly 667GB for game installs—a number that feels increasingly cramped as modern titles frequently climb past 100GB each. For anyone with a growing collection, or for those who enjoy bouncing between several big releases at once, that space disappears almost immediately. Installing Crucial’s 2TB expansion effectively triples the amount of room you have to work with, reducing the need to delete old favorites just to make space for new ones.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="2423">Beyond the raw storage boost, the drive is built to meet the PS5’s demanding performance standards. With read and write speeds up of to 11,000 MB/s, the Crucial P510 far exceeds what’s needed to keep pace with Sony’s ultra-fast architecture. The included heatsink, which is required for PS5 internal installation, helps maintain stable temperatures and prevent thermal throttling during extended gaming sessions.</p>


<p data-start="2425" data-end="3119">If you’re planning to install the Crucial P510 SSD into a PC gaming desktop, you’ll be able to make the most of its insanely fast read and write speeds. Just make sure your motherboard supports Gen5 NVMe SSDs. A Gen4 slot will still work with it, just won’t be able to reach the maximum speeds supported by the P510. With optimal conditions, you’ll be able to experience lightning fast load times in your games as well as when working with high-intensive applications such as when video or photo editing. Plus with a full 2TB, you’ll have plenty of room for not just your games, but any important pictures or vids you want to hang onto.</p>
<p data-start="3121" data-end="3308" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With its generous performance, significant storage increase, and a timely discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/">Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive stands out as one of the most practical PS5 upgrades you can grab this season.</a></p>

              <p><i><span>Kirby Air Riders </span></i><span>is out today, and it sounds like the chaotic kart racer is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412"><span>exactly what fans of the GameCube original wanted</span></a><span> (and like it’s probably not for anyone else). One of the ways the Switch 2 game embraces disorder is in its vehicle customization, which lets you paint your hoverboard to look like pretty much whatever you want. Some players are using this feature to make cool karts to race around in, and others are seeing what monstrosities they can put on the market for other players to use.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo has held </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><span>multiple feature-length Direct showcases</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>, so we’ve already known about its vehicle customization for a while. I wouldn’t be surprised if fans were planning some of their vehicular shitposts for some time and just needed the game in their Switch 2s to finally bring them to life.

So for every joke, you’ll find a custom kart that actually looks pretty incredible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dedicating individual wall outlets to each device creates outlet scarcity and cable chaos, especially when you need to charge your laptop, phone and wireless earbuds simultaneously. The Baseus <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/">2-pack 65W USB-C charger blocks just hit a record low of $29 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from the usual $49 price (42% off)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Each charger includes three ports</strong> that let you power multiple devices from a single outlet and getting two chargers for under $30 total makes this deal borderline ridiculous. These Baseus chargers use <strong>GaN technology to pack 65W of power into a compact form</strong> factor that’s 41% smaller than traditional chargers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Split Three Ways or Full Power to One Device</h2>
<p>This intelligent power distribution system <strong>delivers the full 65W to a single connected device or splits the total wattage across multiple ports</strong>, depending on the needs of each. You can fast-charge a MacBook Air at maximum speed when it’s the only device plugged in, reaching 50% battery in roughly an hour. Connect your laptop, phone, and AirPods simultaneously and the charger will apportion the right wattage to each device automatically. Using Power Delivery protocols, the system automatically negotiates with each device for optimal charging speeds without user intervention.</p>



<p>Each charger has<strong> two USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong>, which covers modern devices and old gadgets that haven’t migrated to USB-C. The dual USB-C configuration will handle laptops, tablets, recent phones, and any other device that charges using USB-C Power Delivery. The USB-A accommodates older phones, wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and accessories still using the old USB connector.</p>
<p>Gallium nitride technology enables such compact sizes because it runs much cooler and more efficiently than traditional silicon-based chargers. As a result, the GaN chip realizes an impressive 92% energy conversion rate which means less power goes to waste as heat, and more directly into charging your devices. Improved thermal management allows Baseus to fit more power into a smaller package without overheating concerns. Even during three-port full-speed running, <strong>the charger remains cool to the touch</strong> and reduced heat generation prolongs the service life of the charger.</p>



<p>The <strong>compact design is 41% smaller than Apple’s original 61W MacBook charger</strong>, while it offers more total power across more ports. That size reduction makes a real difference when packing for trips or trying to cram chargers into crowded power strips. Foldable prongs collapse flat against the charger body, preventing them from snagging on bag contents or scratching other devices.</p>
<p>Built-in safety mechanisms <strong>protect against overcharge, overheating, short circuits, and power surges</strong>. Chargers constantly monitor temperature, voltage, and current, automatically shutting down when any of these becomes unsafe. These protect the batteries in your devices from being damaged and eliminate fire hazards caused by malfunctioning charging equipment.</p>
<p>At $29 for two complete 65W three-port chargers, this Black Friday deal brings the cost down to $14.50 per charger and undercuts single-port chargers from lesser-known brands. You get GaN efficiency, 65W total output, three-device simultaneous charging, universal protocol support, and compact travel-friendly design for 40% off.</p>
