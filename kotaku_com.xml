<p>With speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s, it outperforms many other portable drives on the market, including its predecessor, the Samsung T7, which has a maximum speed of 1,000 MB/s. This makes the T9 perfect for handling large files.</p>
<p>Despite its high transfer speeds, the Samsung T9 remains impressively cool even during extended use. Thanks to its built-in Dynamic Thermal Guard, the drive efficiently manages heat, ensuring that it stays within an optimal temperature range. This means you can work on intensive tasks like video editing or large file transfers without worrying about overheating.</p>
<p>For videographers, the Samsung T9 SSD is an exceptional choice, allowing you to record directly onto the drive from compatible cameras or smartphones like the iPhone 15 Pro. It supports 4K video recording at 60 frames per second. Great for when your iPhone storage is near capacity and you don’t feel like scrolling through a decades worth of photos and video, looking for stuff to delete to make room.</p>



<h2>Strong. Solid. Stable.</h2>
<p>Built with durability in mind, the Samsung T9 can withstand the wear and tear of daily use. The drive is drop-resistant from heights of up to three meters, making it perfect for creators on the go. If you’re traveling for work or shooting in unpredictable environments, the T9 is a drive you can rely on. Plus, it comes with a generous five-year warranty, providing peace of mind in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>If security is a concern, the T9 allows you to enable password protection. For anyone who frequently travels with their drive, it ensures your sensitive files remain secure, even if you accidentally leave the drive behind at a coffee shop or airport.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6173/">For a limited time, the Samsung T9 SSD is available at a significant discount</a>. The 1TB version is priced at just $95, while the 2TB model is available for $185, and the 4TB version is down to $299.</p>

              <p><span>As we get closer to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> next Wednesday, December 10, Game Freak is adding another missing monster and Mega Evolution to the RPG’s roster. Thankfully, you won’t have to buy the $30 DLC to get this one, as Mewtwo and its two Mega Evolutions are coming to </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>as a free Mystery Gift side mission.</span></p> <p><span>Mewtwo and its Mega Stones are available now in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and they’re totally free. To capture this Legendary Pokémon, you’ll have to download a new side quest through the game’s Mystery Gift feature. Open up the Link Play option in the pause menu, then click on Mystery Gift, and then the “Get via Internet” option. Here, you’ll find a new side quest called “Project M,” which will add the psychic legend to the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>With this addition, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is one step closer to hopefully adding every Mega Evolution-capable Pokémon to the roster with </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. As of right now, the base game has just about all of them, with around a dozen or so still missing in action. Most of these are legendary Pokémon like Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, and Rayquaza, but a few of the old starters like Blaziken, Sceptile, and Swampert are also missing in action.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is also introducing several new Mega Evolutions that weren’t in the base game, including Mega Raichu X and Y. Also today, Game Freak announced Mega Lucario Z, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>a new form for Lucario</span></a><span>, who previously had a Mega Evolution prior to the DLC. So it sounds like even some Pokémon who already had these superpowered transformations might be getting more. Outside of new Megas, the DLC is also introducing a roguelike mode that will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765"><span>break the series’ long-established level 100 level cap</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582</link>
            <guid>1370302</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A holographic Gengar from the Pokémon TCG set Skyridge just fetched over $30,000 at GameStop. The company is touting it as an “own” aimed at all the “<a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1995625203460891061/photo/1">trolls</a>” who make fun of its infamously poor trade-in values. But the record-breaking deal is really a window into the meme stock retailer’s slimy new loot box idea: trading card Power Packs.</p> <p>Pokémon cards are a giant cash cow. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalpers-tcg-gamestop-weigh-scale-lifetime-ban-2000646859">Scalpers raid GameStop</a> stores multiple times a month to buy up all the new products that the Pokémon Company can’t print fast enough. But GameStop barely makes any profit off of those sales. It can’t just print its own Pokémon cards and start selling them either. So it’s done the next best thing: It’s started opening its own packs and reselling the rarest cards as part of Power Packs, which are effectively digital slot machines.</p>

 <p>To participate, customers set up Stripe accounts (a payment processing platform), select the Power Pack they want, and then watch to see what card they get. The program is done in partnership with Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), so all of the cards are graded and slabbed. While the average value of a pack might be $100, most cards people get will be worth less than what they paid for the virtual blind box.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was offered $30 for RDR2 8 days after it came out and my 100k reward points I had saved up for years were not restored when my auto renew membership was turned off from an update despite being a member for 15 years. Never forget <a href="https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0">https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0</a></p> <p>— Nathan 🗡️ (@DistantGalaxy96) <a href="https://twitter.com/DistantGalaxy96/status/1995646241313882496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>GameStop promises to buy back any cards players don’t want at 90 percent of “fair market value” minus a 6 percent commission. That commission is essentially GameStop’s cut since PSA also runs its own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeInvesting/comments/1okzzky/psa_buying_back_their_own_slabs/">90 percent buyback program</a> without the fee. Some folks think <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcgcollections/comments/1nqagls/scammy_move_by_gamestop_powerpack_please_read_if/">it’s a rip-off</a>. Supporters who are still banking on “GameStop to the moon” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1mdyr9e/the_genius_buyback_system_behind_gamestops_new/">think it’s genius</a>.</p>

 <p>This new system is how one Pokémon card collector found a PSA 10 Holo Gengar worth an estimated $33,883 in their Power Pack. They decided to sell it back to GameStop for $30,494.70. It’s still listed as a Power Pack high-value card for someone else to chase now.</p>

 <h2>From GameStop to “Cardstop”</h2> <p>GameStop gets to promote the exchange as “the most valuable single trade-in ever recorded in GameStop history,” even though the amount is contractually obligated through a completely separate program than the one people use to trade-in retro games, old controllers, and last year’s <em>Madden</em> for a fraction of their original sale value.</p>

 <p>“I did get the chase card, I decided to sell it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSAPowerPacks/comments/1pbp6wr/comment/nrtpgwd/?context=3">wrote</a> user Fredflinstone00 on the Power Pack subreddit. “I purchased (2) of the $2,500 packs, I was able to sell my cards from each pack and pulled the Gengar on the 6th pack.” They said they’re getting about $28,000 after fees, which puts them up overall after being down $4,000 before the Gengar.</p>

 <p>“I just sell the cards I don’t want and keep the ones I do want, I’ve had plenty shipped to me,” they told the community on Reddit. “With this card, the sales history is not the greatest, don’t want to risk a $10k move downwards, so I took the payout.”</p> <p>That volatility is another one of the risks with Power Packs. The Gengar in question was only selling for around $5,000 as recently as 2023, and GameStop’s estimated market value matched the <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-skyridge/gengar-h9#completed-auctions-manual-only">highest known sale</a> of the card from back in October.</p> <p>Others cash out the minute they get a chase card as well. A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooPies662/" aria-label="Author: SnooPies662" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false">SnooPies662</a> snagged a PSA 10 Blaine’s Charizard worth $13,700. “Subsidized by my gf after losing 6k total on diamonds,” they wrote. “Safe to say I’m done forever now and achieved everything I could have possibly wanted from this.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Z-A Is Giving An Old Favorite A Second Mega Evolution]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Lucario is one of Game Freak’s favorite Pokémon and has long been one of the faces for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459">Mega Evolutions</a> since the powered-up transformations debuted in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. Now, the steel/fighting-type monster is getting another Mega form called Mega Lucario Z as part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i></a><span>DLC.</span></p>  <p><a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega_lucario_z"><span>According to the official </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> website</span></a><span>, these Mega Evolution Z forms will play a little differently than their standard transformations, as they will have shorter cooldown times for their attacks, but use more of the Mega Gauge that lets them sustain their transformations. They hit faster, but use fewer moves before reverting to their original forms, so Game Freak says they’re less suited for longer battles.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Mega Lucario Z doesn’t change the Pokémon’s steel/fighting typing, so it will be interesting to see how it differentiates itself from the original Mega Lucario in the competitive space. The fact that Z forms have their own special mechanic makes it sound like other Pokémon will be getting these alternate forms. This lines up with some of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">datamined leaks from earlier this year</a> that claim Absol and Garchomp are also getting these new transformations in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Lucario isn’t the only old favorite getting a new Mega Evolution in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s DLC, which is also adding two forms for Raichu, and new transformations for Chimecho, Baxcalibur, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-zeraora-reaction-industry-plant-2000645789">Zeraora</a>. Outside of new Megas, the expansion is also adding a roguelike mode that will <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">break the series’ original level 100 cap</a>, so it could be one of the biggest challenges these games have offered to date. It does seem to take place <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-korrina-lucario-az-galar-how-to-get-2000639831">after the events of the main game</a>, though, so if you haven’t beaten <em>Legends: Z-A </em>yet, you might want to lock in. The expansion will launch next week on December 10.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242</link>
            <guid>1370266</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a moment in </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, a new sci-fi horror game launching on Xbox and PC on December 4, that I won’t forget for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>To explain this moment and why it is burned into my brain would involve spoilers, but suffice it to say, in a game that rarely relies on jump scares, this moment</span> <span>was so perfectly crafted that it caught me completely off guard. So much so that I found my hands shaking a bit. And with no pause button, all I could do in the game was slide into a corner of the room and try to collect myself. So yeah, if you don’t like scary games, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>ain’t for you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is a spooky first-person horror game set in an alternate future where humanity made it to the Moon and partially colonized it sometime in the 1980s. This means a lot of the technology you’ll encounter during </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>six to seven-hour story feels dated, mechanical, and retro. Old CRTs and ’80s-era computers are everywhere, offering up some</span><i><span> Alien Isolation </span></i><span>vibes, which I didn’t mind at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Buttons and doodads and switches</b></h2> <p><span>This retro sci-fi aesthetic includes your trusty Cosmonaut Assistance Tool or CAT, which you acquire right at the start of the game as your character arrives at the now-abandoned moonbase to make repairs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Part computer, part camera, and part gun, the CAT features switches and modes that must be activated by fumbling around with it. It’s designed to be a clunky way to save your game, unlock doors, and scan equipment. And it makes even something as simple as swapping to a different mode a scary moment where you have to stop looking around and focus on your CAT to find the right switch. It’s one of many ways </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>uses clunky mechanics to add tension.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649247">©Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>also hides items and pieces of information in hard-to-reach spots, forcing you to stretch up or bend down using a few extra buttons. Like operating the CAT, this isn’t hard to do, but it does become far trickier to interact with this world using these deliberately clunky methods when a killer robot is quickly approaching.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And yeah, as you might have guessed, you aren’t alone on the moon. Pretty quickly after arriving, killer robots become a problem. They dot the hallways and rooms of the deteriorating moonbase, just waiting to spot you and take chase. And while you can stun them with your CAT, it’s a brief delay and not a viable strategy for survival. Stealth is much more effective, though panic-running to the game’s few safe areas also works, too. Don’t ask me how I know.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Expect the unexpected</b></h2> <p><span>The thing is, there’s… more to </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>beyond what I’ve already mentioned. Obstensibly, as seen in all the pre-release gameplay footage of </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, this is a creepy sci-fi game built around trying to repair a moonbase that features once-docile robots who are now deadly machines determined to find you and snap your neck. That’s not all </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is, but to spoil any more would be a crime. Just know that the second half of this game ratchets up the horror and goes in a direction I wasn’t expecting.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Moon’s haunted.” </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Lunar Software</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Photorealistic first-person sci-fi survival game</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous graphics, creepy vibes, mechanical controls, wonderful second-half swerve  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Some annoying puzzles, ending is a bit meh</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S (played), Xbox One, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished the game’s story in about 6 hours. </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>I appreciated the swerve that occurs in </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>second half. Up until that point, I found </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>to be a solid </span><i><span>Alien Isolatio</span></i><span>n-like experience, but nothing too remarkable. But by the end, after it zigs and zags, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>had fully escaped </span><i><span>Isolation’s </span></i><span>shadow, becoming its own worthwhile horror game and scared the shit out of me in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And while I can’t say much about the second half, I can gush about </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>visuals. This is one of the best-looking video games I’ve played this console generation.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Looks that kill, puzzles that annoy</b></h2> <p><span>At times, the derelict environments of </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>look photorealistic. Lighting and texture detail, in particular, are astonishing. At one point, I was hiding and shaking behind a large piece of machinery and spotted a detailed warning label with scratch marks. It almost distracted me from how scared I was at that moment. Almost. What actually ruined the creepy vibes were some of </span><i><span>Routine’s </span></i><span>annoying puzzles.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, some of these threw me for a loop and led to a lot of random backtracking. The game’s total lack of UI is an immersive choice, but it did lead to some moments where I ran into a brick wall and struggled to move forward. If you play </span><i><span>Routine</span></i><span>, don’t feel bad if you have to look up a few puzzle solutions. Many of these just get in the way of a truly scary experience.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000649245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649245"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649245">©Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At least I got to backtrack through some haunting photorealistic environments. These spaces and mundane objects in them provide a perfect backdrop for<em> Routine’s</em> horrific elements. It is genuinely unnerving to be in a hyper-realistic kitchen and turn around to spot an evil robot just a few feet away. And </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>loves to use its environments, which are filled with wonderful sound design as well, to build up tension and dread.&nbsp;</span><span>There were times when the simple act of moving from one doorway to another felt like the scariest thing I’ve done in a video game. I might not have even been in danger, but I was shook.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>was announced over a decade ago at this point. So was it worth the wait? Hard to say, as I wasn’t waiting for it, but I can confirm that a decade after it was first revealed, </span><i><span>Routine </span></i><span>is a damn fine horror game that stands toe to toe with other heavy hitters of the genre.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p><span>We know Hideo Kojima, the creative lead behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><i><span>Death Stranding</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i><span>Metal Gear Solid</span></i></a><span>, loves movies. The guy even says in his Twitter bio that “70% of [his] body is made of movies.” However, Kojima doesn’t often get to play characters in movies. He’s only had a handful of acting credits over the years. But he’s <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1995746201720029486?s=20">adding one more to his filmography this year</a>: he’ll be playing a character in the Japanese dub of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><i><span>Zootopia 2</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Paul Molebrandt only has a few lines in Disney’s sequel, but the IT guy in the Zootopia Police Department office does pave the way for some pretty good scenes. </span><i><span>Zootopia</span></i><span>, its sequel, and the </span><i><span>Zootopia+ </span></i><span>mini-series play around a lot with the titular city’s shared space between multiple, differently-sized animals.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649594" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649594"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649594">© Disney</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As a mole, Paul is much smaller than most of Zootopia 2’s main cast, and his few scenes really play around with that juxtaposition, so even when he’s not speaking, he’s giving the movie a lot of humorous space to work in. Kojima may not say much in the movie, but his character makes an impact in just a few short scenes. The role began with Josh Gad in the English original, who is best known in the Disney space for playing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/frozen-olaf-character-roams-disney-parks-2026-2000647055"><span>Olaf in the </span><i><span>Frozen </span></i><span>series</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>is out here in the States, but the Japanese dub will enter theaters overseas on Friday, December 5. The sequel has already been a smash hit for Disney, having already passed half a billion at the box office in just one week, and the post-credits scene has big implications for a potential third movie that will probably come out sometime in the 2030s. So, hey, Kojima might reprise the role of Paul in the inevitable </span><i><span>Zootopia 3 </span></i><span>Japanese dub. Surely we’ll have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-od-trailer-horror-2000627883"><i><span>OD</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/physint-kojima-metal-gear-ps6-release-date-od-1851781247"><i><span>Physint</span></i></a><span> by then, right?</span></p>

              <p>December is here and both Black Friday and Cyber Monday are in the rearview mirror. If you missed your shot at purchasing some holiday gifts during the biggest sales event of the year, you’re not out of luck just yet. Some deals are still active and attractive for late shoppers like us. One such deal is on the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the true wireless Bluetooth earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Normally priced at $250, these earbuds are currently available for just $140—a whole $110 in savings, thanks to a 44% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultimate Comfort and Fit</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are designed to be the most comfortable in-ear headphones the brand has created yet, ideal for all-day wear. Each pair comes with a sleek charging case, a USB-C charging cable, and three sets of ear tips in various sizes to ensure the best possible fit. This thoughtful design ensures the earbuds stay in place, delivering crisp, clear sound every time you use them. Whether you’re running errands, working out, or just relaxing, these earbuds should stay securely in your ears.</p>
<h2>Advanced Noise Cancellation and Custom Sound</h2>
<p>With ANC support the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 3 can automatically adjust the level of noise cancellation based on your environment. You can enjoy your music, podcasts, or audiobooks without being disturbed by the surrounding noise like the noisy chatter of a crowded office or the loud hum of an airplane engine.</p>
<p>Sound quality is exceptional, with the dual amplifier and enhanced two-way speaker working in harmony. The adaptive equalizer customizes the audio to your unique ear shape, delivering a personalized sound experience. If you decide to connect them to your TV, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro offer an immersive 360-degree sound experience, providing a surround sound effect without the need for bulky speakers or expensive equipment.</p>
<p>With convenient touch controls, you can easily pause your music, skip tracks, answer calls, and more—all without needing to take your phone out of your pocket.</p>



<h2>Real-Time Translation with Galaxy AI</h2>
<p>One of the more unique new features of these earbuds this specific integration&nbsp; it has with Galaxy AI. The Galaxy Buds Pro 3 allow you to have real-time, face-to-face conversations in multiple languages—no translation app required. It’s a sci-fi wonder straight out of The <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. </em>When someone says “Hola” to you, the earbuds instantly translate it to “Hello” in your ear. This makes communicating while traveling a breeze. It does require being paired with a Samsung device to function. Sorry iPhone users.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro come in two stylish color choices: silver and white. Both have come down in price for Cyber Week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">They’re usually selling on Amazon for $250, but the 44% discount brings the price tag to just $150 for a limited time. You end up saving yourself $110.</a></p>
