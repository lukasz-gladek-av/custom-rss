              <p>As someone who adores the fall, spooky vibes, and Halloween, when I played<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival,</em> I fell instantly in love with it. This free online Halloween-themed mini-MMO features pumpkin carving, spooky places to explore, and much more. And it’s available to play now on PC and Mac. But don’t wait too long, as the servers shut off shortly after Halloween.</p> <p>Developed by Adam “adamgryu” Robinson-Yu, the creator behind cozy indie game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700">A Short Hike</a>, <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver">Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</a></em> has become an annual tradition. Each year, in the middle of October,<a href="https://x.com/adamgryu/status/1978913908543951324?"> adamgryu reopens <em>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> for a few weeks</a> and players flood in, filling the spooky streets and hills of the game with jack-o-lanterns as far as the eye can see. And each year, the indie developer has expanded the online pumpkin-carving MMO with new places to explore. This year, players can watch public domain horror films in the newly opened theater. There’s also a haunted hay ride, a creepy mansion to explore, a corn maze, and many secrets to discover either alone or alongside other players, who appear as cute ghosts.</p>

  <p>I simply adore<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival.</em> So often, when Halloween rolls around, devs and publishers release scary horror games. And while I enjoy those, I often wish we got more games that let you experience the immaculate vibes of a cool night during October. A night with carved pumpkins dotting the landscape and campy Halloween decorations everywhere you look. And <em>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> nails those vibes perfectly.</p>

 <p>Even better, the jack-o-lanterns you see in the game were carved and placed by real people using the MMO’s fantastic, intuitive, and flexible pumpkin carving tool. Pick a pumpkin, spin it around, and start carving into it. You can also scrape spots of the pumpkin away, giving you more options for shading and decoration. Some people do simple faces or funny jokes, and others create elaborate pieces of art. All of these pumpkins can be liked, and once a day, you can award a medal to your favorite.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637793" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637793"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637793">©<span><span>adamgryu / Kotaku</span></span></figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve spent the past few days logging into<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> for half an hour or so to see all the new carved pumpkins, give my favorites a like, and then just chill in the cozy-creepy vibes of the festival and the surrounding city and hills. If you love Halloween or have small kids who enjoy spooky stuff, <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver">I highly recommend downloading<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> ASAP</a>. If you want, you can even pay to download the game and unlock exclusive cosmetic items. Either way, Halloween fans are in for a treat.</p>

              <p>The cool thing about a game like <i>Arc Raiders</i> is that you can engage in a bit of voyeurism if you’re not up for brawling with the game’s bigger threats. Keeping out of sight and making sure other players are far too busy to notice you is actually a really smart tactic if you’re playing solo. Plus, you can get a front-row, responsibility-free seat to some cool firefights that you’re way outgunned for.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>Reddit user SquinkyEXE took such an opportunity to spy on a group of six randos who teamed up to take down one of the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">more menacing threats</a>: a <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Leaper">Leaper</a>. These massive robot spiders hit hard <i>and </i>they can cross vast distances by just straight-up jumping through the air. It’s terrifying, and they’re best avoided unless you’re kitted out really well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1obaocb/i_just_saw_6_solo_players_unite_to_destroy_a/">SquinkyEXE shared their video of the encounter</a> on Reddit where, as it turns out, someone else shared some on-the-ground capture of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1obbgtd/randoms_make_my_last_server_slam_game_amazing/">the group’s encounter with the Leaper</a>. Meeting the moment, Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oc2l84/synced_povs_of_the_6_solo_players_taking_down_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">user guilanosse</a> stitched the two videos together and the result is pretty fun to watch in real-time:</p>    <p>This is the kinda thing I love about the PvPvE format in an extraction shooter. Since folks have their own agendas on the map, unlikely scenarios like these emerge, making for some memorable, unscripted moments that I can’t wait to see more of when the game arrives in full form next week.</p>

              <p>Did you know that Steam has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong">snazzy-looking Deck-focused landing pages</a> for games that are “Verified” on the device? The pages have existed since at least 2023 but, as <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/games-getting-brand-new-steam-deck-verified-pages/"><i>Steam Deck HQ </i>notes</a>, Valve may be ramping up the degree to which they encourage developers to promote them. Before a game even gets one, though, it needs to secure that coveted “Verified” rating. Valve actually has four criteria to determine whether or not a game should earn the badge. A game should: have no issues with middleware (such as anti-cheat software), launch without trouble or compatibility warnings, be fully playable via a gamepad, and, lastly, should “have good default settings, and text should be legible.”</p> <p>What defines “good default settings” is probably open to some level of interpretation, but any way you slice it, for all their sleek visual appeal, these pages are misleading. The problem is that these landing pages feature the trailers for their respective games embedded into an image of a Steam Deck, which in my opinion gives a really false impression of how some games run. Sure, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/datablob.studio/post/3m3ozg4vs4c2t">as developer datablob notes on BlueSky</a>, in theory this gives a decent impression of how a game might look on the Deck, but just observe <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH"><i>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</i>’s Steam Deck Verified landing page</a>.</p>

 <p>The page plays the default trailer from the Steam Page which is clearly running on a much more powerful PC than the Steam Deck. Yes, there’s a tiny disclaimer at the bottom that says the footage was “Captured on PC” and not Steam Deck, but still, the context makes it easy to imagine the game running at such high fidelity and framerate on the Deck.</p>

 <p>To be sure, I double-checked and spun up <i>Rebirth</i> on my Steam Deck and, nope, it still doesn’t look that great. And <i>Rebirth</i> isn’t the only game guilty of this. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2457220/Avowed"><i>Avowed</i>’s Steam Deck landing page</a> also shows the game performing at a level of fidelity that it simply cannot on the Deck.</p> <div id="gallery-1"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000637696"> 				© Screenshot: Square Enix / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000637695"> 				© Screenshot: Square Enix / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>The recently released <i>Ninja Gaiden 4</i> also has this problem, and the subtitle text in the game isn’t what I’d consider legible enough on the Deck’s smaller screen. It does run at a respectable framerate, but it definitely doesn’t look as sharp on the Deck as it does in this simulated experience on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4">the game’s landing page</a>.</p> <div id="gallery-2"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000637746"> 				© Team Ninja / PlatinumGames / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000637745"> 				© Team Ninja / PlatinumGames / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>I’m sure in the future, when the Deck gets its inevitable upgrade, it may run these specific games in a way that matches how they’re portrayed on their landing pages. But at that point, will there be new GPU-melting games that are beyond its capabilities, that are earning these badges and being featured in misleading ways on advertising pages? The Steam Deck deserves far more honesty.</p>

              <p>Everybody loves it when someone inevitably breaks out <i>Catan</i> at a party. And by everybody, I mean those who love getting locked into a board game that’ll take you about four hours to figure out how to best trade some supplies to expand your settlements. Joking aside, <i>Catan</i> can be a good time. But can it make for good TV? Netflix sure thinks so. It just acquired the rights to adapt it for the streaming screen.</p> <p>Announced via <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/catan-board-game-netflix-adaptations">a post on <i>Tudum</i></a>, Netflix is gearing up to bring the 1995 tabletop game centered on the thrills of bartering and colonizing to film and TV via a partnership with tabletop publisher Asmodee. The streaming service isn’t just investing in a single project, but rather “a slate of scripted and unscripted projects inspired by the hit board game.” On the partnership Jinny Howe, the head of scripted series at Netflix US and Canada, said:</p> <blockquote><p>We knew landing this deal would be as game-changing as a well-placed settlement, so we decided to pool our resources across series, features, animation, and games and show Asmodee the full power of Netflix when we work together. Hardcore “Settlers” are going to lose their minds, and new fans will finally learn just how important a sheep trade can be.</p></blockquote> <p>Honestly, if they just make a fancy animated manual for the board game, I’ll be happy. And I do mean that, as someone for whom it takes at least several rounds of a board game before the rules really click in my head. And this game has so many damn pieces and cards and rules. Ugh. Make it simple for me, Netflix. I’ll also take a <i>Catan</i>-based cottage core lesbian romance centered around some sheep farmers and their Australian Shepherd named Pepper. Assuming such a thing isn’t illegal to make anymore, that is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been four years since </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psychonauts-2-the-kotaku-review-1847533536">Psychonauts 2</a>, </span></i><span>the last new Double Fine game. The studio’s off-kilter sensibilities have always appealed to me, and they’ve helped it create some really great and memorable games, so I was excited to finally have a new release from them in </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>. And while this unusual adventure about a lighthouse and a bird is shorter than I expected, what is here is a gorgeous, well-crafted, and incredibly creative game that pulls off an emotional story without a single word.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, out now on Xbox and PC, is the first Double Fine game to be completely developed and released since the studio was bought by Xbox. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-buys-psychonauts-2-developer-double-fine-prod-1835359067">And if you were worried that acquisition</a> would mean that Double Fine might no longer be free to get weird, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>will quickly assuage your fears. This is a game that, at least at the start, revolves around a sentient, walking lighthouse that befriends a cartoon bird, and the two of them embark on a long journey through a post-apocalyptic world devoid of humanity, but full of colorful and bizarre plants and critters.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Weird stuff, right? But while </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>is an odd game, it ain’t an ugly one. This might be Double Fine’s best-looking game, with a wide color palette and a sometimes surreal and abstract art style that lives between hand-drawn and sculpted. Over the course of the game’s three- to four-hour runtime, I was always excited to see what the next area would look like, and…oh yeah, uhh, the game is very short.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s no getting around that fact. This is a $30 video game that most people will complete in just about three hours. There aren’t many puzzles, and few of them really pushed me to think all that much. There’s also no combat or skill trees. </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>isn’t a mechanically deep game or a complicated thing to play. Instead, Double Fine wants you to just vibe out with it for like three hours. Enjoy all the pretty colors, the weird shit, and hopefully, by the end, feel something.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And to </span><i><span>Keeper’s </span></i><span>credit, by the time credits rolled, I did indeed feel something. It’s wild to think that a story about a lighthouse and a bird with no dialogue could make me tear up a bit at the very end, but that’s exactly what happened. I didn’t expect it, but the conclusion was a wonderful way to end this epic journey.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“You’ll never look at lighthouses the same way again.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Double Fine</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Single-player adventure game with some puzzles and lots of vibes.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous art, wonderful music, perfect ending, not too long, very creative.  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>A few performance hiccups, might be too short for some, lacks memorable puzzles.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S (played), PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>October 17, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Just over three hours and finished the game.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>In fact, I really didn’t expect most of what happens in </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>. You’ve seen trailers for the game and likely assume it’s one thing, and it is that for a while. But similar to EA’s </span><i><span>Split Fiction, Keeper</span></i><span> is a game that relishes in throwing curveballs at you. Every 30 minutes or so, Double Fine’s latest adventure zigs or zags in unexpected ways, and by the end, I was shocked that the game I was playing was the same one I’d started playing a few hours before.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>You may have noticed that I haven’t gone into detail about the specifics that make </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>so surprising, and that’s because, well, I don’t want to ruin any of the surprise. If you intend to play </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, I urge you to avoid videos of it and just hop in. You can easily knock this thing out in a single sitting, and despite a few performance hiccups, I did that and had a great experience. These are the kinds of games I want Xbox to fill Game Pass with, not new </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> titles that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">make the service more expensive</a> and fill up my hard drive with 4k textures of assault rifles. Give me more silly, strange, and heartfelt experiences that I can finish in a single sitting.</span></p> <p><span>If you were concerned about how Xbox’s ownership of the Double Fine might change it, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>is here to remind us all that the former indie studio is still doing its own thing. And while I don’t have insight into the daily operations of Double Fine or what’s happening behind the scenes, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>seems to indicate that even under Xbox, the studio behind</span><i><span> Brutal Legend</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Costume Ques</span></i><span>t will continue to make weird games filled with heart and not designed to maximize sales. And that fact, like </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, makes me really, really happy. </span></p>
