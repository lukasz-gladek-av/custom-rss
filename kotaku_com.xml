The second was that the sci-fi extraction shooter from ex-Blizzard developers might be able to succeed where Sony’s hero shooter did not thanks to a gameplay loop that looks way more like <em>Sea of Thieves </em>than <em>Call of Duty</em>. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,197298,197284" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Revealed by Dreamhaven studio Moonshot Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://email.triplepointpr.com/c/eJwczE9u6yAQgPHTwDJiZsADCxZPevINcoDhX-3WsS1KYvX2Vbr9PulXokyVbdI1AlsMyI5AL7EEZEhZqnjvAgBmCzUA-9SgcG56jWjQGUIHnhDg5miSxtCSATcRirJm9PXc6nms-zj7LR8PvcVljPNb0T-Fs8L5uq7bz_Ecz1Tf_11k5EXR_FL039yvz2663PlL91jHIvuH5EVZc_ZjHPtD1u2PHZEDeSLjmchULsEbAhRX0dpSIFs9IqZArU0BRaBUQsnOusLeTMlm26p-RfwNAAD__7ouT-w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://email.triplepointpr.com/c/eJwczE9u6yAQgPHTwDJiZsADCxZPevINcoDhX-3WsS1KYvX2Vbr9PulXokyVbdI1AlsMyI5AL7EEZEhZqnjvAgBmCzUA-9SgcG56jWjQGUIHnhDg5miSxtCSATcRirJm9PXc6nms-zj7LR8PvcVljPNb0T-Fs8L5uq7bz_Ecz1Tf_11k5EXR_FL039yvz2663PlL91jHIvuH5EVZc_ZjHPtD1u2PHZEDeSLjmchULsEbAhRX0dpSIFs9IqZArU0BRaBUQsnOusLeTMlm26p-RfwNAAD__7ouT-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a Game Awards livestream on Tuesday</a></span>, <em>Wildgate</em> is a multiplayer FPS in which crews of players explore a region of space called the Reach in search of a MacGuffin called the Artifact. Once teams find it, they have to battle one another to extract. That can happen aboard spaceships or out in the void. But if a squad’s ship gets blown up, their journey will come to an abrupt end. It’s coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2025. </p><p>You can see where I’m getting the <em>Sea of Thieves </em>vibes from. The deep-dive trailer makes that even more apparent:</p><p>It’s an ambitious mashup of genres. <em>Wildgate</em> boasts “epic spaceship battles,” exploration through “cosmic storms,” plundering alien outposts for loot, and a unique cast of adventurers called Prospectors, each with their own arsenal of tools and abilities. The world and characters, which include a cat in a fish tank controlling a mech and a anthropomorphic goat warrior, are a bit all over the place, but I can see them growing on me if the gameplay loop is as fun as it sounds. </p><p>Whether <em>Wildgate</em> has the magic to put it over the top where so many other live-service multiplayer games have failed remains to be seen. Moonshot Games is helmed by some Blizzard vets who worked on <em>Hearthstone</em>, <em>StarCraft</em>, and other franchises, including producer Jason Chayes, designer Dustin Browder, and artist Ben Thompson. The team is part of Dreamhaven, the publishing label led by ex-Blizzard president Mike Morhaime. </p><p> “<em>Wildgate </em>rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” Morhaime said in a press release. “Since every match of <em>Wildgate </em>plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”</p><p>Today’s livestream also gave updates on Dreamhaven’s other partner projects. Secret Door’s tabletop-inspired RPG, <em>Sunderfolk</em>, will be $50 and is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on April 23. FuzzyBot’s <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em>, a loot-based action-RPG cozy sim (yes, really), is headed out of Early Access for PS5, Xbox, and PC on May 22. Finally, Game River’s <em>Mechabellum</em>, a  tactical mech auto battler with shades of <em>Total Annihilation</em> that launched on PC last year, recently launched season 3 and is currently on sale. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But when the <em>THPS 3+4</em> were announced, Margera was missing from the remake’s roster of new and old skaters. Many attributed this to Margera’s many legal problems and widely reported substance abuse issues, which allegedly led to his firing from the production of the film <em>Jackass Forever</em> in 2020. But apparently, Margera is doing better and his friend Tony Hawk fought to make sure he was a part of the upcoming remake. </p><p>During a March 23 livestream of the skating podcast <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/thenineclub&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/thenineclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Nine Club</em></a></span><em>,</em> co-host Roger Bagley claimed that Margera was added to <em>THPS 3+4 </em>at the last minute after Tony Hawk skated with the troubled former <em>Jackass </em>star earlier this month. <br></p><p>“Well, here’s what happened,” explained Bagley during the stream. “The game was already done. Tony called up Activision or whatever and was like ‘Hey, we’re putting Bam in the thing,’ and they’re like ‘We can’t.’ And he goes ‘No, you’re gonna do it,’ and basically made them fly Bam back out here to get body-scanned and everything else, and put him in [<em>THPS 3+4</em>].”</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Activision about the reported return of Margera. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>O</em>n March 24, <em>TMZ</em> corrobated the claims made in the podcast</a></span> and reported that it had heard from sources that Hawk was impressed by how well Margera had cleaned himself up and how he’s trying to stay sober.
