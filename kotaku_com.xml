            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve already bought an Xbox for the holidays, there are a couple of small issues you thankfully still have time to address. One, it comes with one controller, so if you’re in a multi-player home, that’s going to be an issue. Two, that default controller is good — but it’s not&nbsp;<em>great</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=kotaku01-20">The Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller that’s on sale for 33% off right now at Amazon?</a> Indisputably great, so you can get that second controller&nbsp;<em>and</em> a pro gaming experience at the same time by taking this $135 deal. The Elite 2 works with Xbox One, Series S, and Series X, and also works for PC gaming.</p>

 <h2>Premium Feel</h2> <p>The upgrade from the default Xbox controller to the Elite 2 is obvious from the second you take it out of the box. It’s slightly thicker and has a heavier feel, but just enough heft that it feels sturdy and well-built. The rubberized grips give you a feeling of secure control, and overall it’s ergonomically outstanding, designed for long sessions.</p>

 <p>The construction already sets the Elite 2 apart from the default Xbox controller and third-party versions, but where it really takes off into the stratosphere is when you get to customize it. The tension on the thumbsticks can be finely adjusted, and the triggers are shorter and faster for an edge in shooters and battle royals. The thumbsticks, d-pads and paddles are all swappable, so it’s as close to custom-designing a controller for yourself as you can find.</p>

 <p>Take the customization further by using the Xbox Accessories app on the console or on a PC to remap buttons, set up multiple profiles and custom stick curves, and even assign macros. The profiles can be stored on the Elite 2 itself so you can change them on the fly, which means you can set up different ones for different games.</p>

 <h2>Endurance Level Battery</h2> <p>Where the default Xbox controller is powered by AA batteries and also somewhat notorious for chewing through them at a rapid rate, the Elite 2 is rechargeable. You get up to 40 hours of gameplay on a single charge, and the USB-C charging dock is included. You can game all day and rest the Elite 2 on its dock by night to ensure you’ll have a full charge every time you fire up the console or PC.</p> <p>The upgrades from the default controller to the Elite 2 are staggering, so much so that it’ll entirely reshape how you play. Even if you’re not in need of a second controller, upgrading to the Elite 2 and keeping the default controller on hand as a backup is a smart move. Now’s the time to make the switch — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon’s 33% off deal brings the Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller with its charger and swappable components down to a very reasonable $135.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Did You Think Of The Game Awards 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/what-did-you-think-of-the-game-awards-2025-2000653017</link>
            <guid>1381804</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another Game Awards showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">has come and gone</a>. What did you think? Did you stay up and watch or just skim the highlights on social media? Did the right games win in the right categories? Did any of the “world premier” trailer reveals make you feel like Geoff Keighley’s event earned its nearly four-hour runtime? Consider this an open thread to chat, joke, and share your thoughts.</p> <p>I’ll start. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">won more awards than any game in TGA history</a>. Personally, while I love the game and think it warrants the hype, that seems a bit overblown. Will it stand the test of time like formative winners including <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>? I suspect not, but maybe not reinventing the wheel shouldn’t be held against it. It’s the game of the moment and this is the awards show for 2025.</p>

 <p>At the very least, it <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">shouldn’t have won best indie game</a>. I blame the TGA jury for that one. If one of the goals of the show is to highlight as many of the year’s best games as possible, maybe one game shouldn’t be able to win “best game” across multiple categories. If you picked <em>Clair Obscur</em> for GOTY, it can’t also win “best RPG” or “best debut indie game.” It would prevent sweeps like this, which, even if deserved, end up being kind of boring and leave so many other amazing games underrepresented on the big stage.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Give it up in the chat for Miss Piggy and Rowlf the Dog! 👏👏<a href="https://twitter.com/TheMuppets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheMuppets</a> never let us down! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGameAwards</a> <a href="https://t.co/XY6VxHLiYa">pic.twitter.com/XY6VxHLiYa</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1999322500824445285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>And what about the reveals? Keighley tried to pull another <em>Okami 2</em>-style rabbit out of his hat with <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829"><em>Mega Man Dual Overdrive</em></a> (aka<em> Mega Man 12</em>). As someone who grew up on games in the NES-era, <em>Mega Man 3</em> gave me a daily ass-kicking for years, it sort of worked. That game isn’t coming until 2027 though, and didn’t look nearly as solid or revelatory in the gameplay and art than I’d expect for the Blue Bomber’s prodigal return. Insiders promise Capcom is cooking but they have their work cut out for them.</p>

 <p>The show also seemed light on some of those known quantities that bring a special X factor to a showcase like this. No Nintendo wasn’t surprising. Sony showed showed more<em> Saros</em> but that doesn’t quite pop has much as more <em>Wolverine</em> or a new <em>God of War</em> would have. Microsoft, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and the rest of the big publishers were absent too. The big show stoppers, a new&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> RPG from Larian Studios and a new <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em> spin-off from ex-BioWare director Casey Hudson, are games I can’t wait to play but whose reveals were muted a bit by brief cinematic teasers that shared a vibe but not a story.</p> <p>In many ways, this might have been the smoothest and most slickly produced Game Awards yet. It also, for some reason, felt like one of the least memorable. Will see if that gut assessment holds up a couple years from now. What did you think?</p>

              <p>While the main show of The Game Awards featured some big reveals and cinematic extravaganzas, it was during the pre-show that the real star appeared. An action-platform game called <em>Bradley the Badger</em>, that looks to be four-dimensional folding layers of meta about gaming, with multiple jovial jabs taken at names like&nbsp;<em>The Last Of Us</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>.</p> <p>Beginning with the conceit that we’re already big, nostalgic fans of Bradley, a cheerfully-colored mascot platforming character who’d be right at home in the PS2 era, <em>Bradley the Badger</em>‘s trailer sees the titular character enthusiastically setting out on his latest adventure, to discover his house is now inside some sort of grimdark Soulslike. Walls are made of petrified hands, some holding blue-glowing lanterns, and then a title card drops in reading “Badgerborne.” But as Bradley to platform around in this unpleasant reality, he discovers that it’s very much not finished. Art assets are marked as “WAITING FOR REVIEW,” while sticky notes appear all over demanding fixes.</p>

 <p>This, Bradley discovers, means he can start manipulating these unfinished textures and placeholder blocks, such that he can drag and reshape his own platforms, or reprogram the properties of items. And there, there you’ve got a <em>brilliant</em> idea for a game.</p>

 <p>Except it keeps adding. Once Bradley’s in a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> reality, he’s able to transform himself into untextured items in the world, becoming a trash bin that can roll up walls, or in a&nbsp;<em>The Last Of Us</em> spoof turn into both a pick-up truck and a size-changing apple. This all starts to look really incredible, the game not demanding players learn code (thank god), but rather just having toggles for various settings of each item, explosive or inert, big or small, magnetic or not. And just as you’re getting to grips with what this is all about, Bradley reaches the end of what’s been coded in the game. And wakes up. As a real person, FMV, with filthy human feet and hands, and a dirty, ill-fitting badger hat on his head. He’s in the development studios of Dreamwoods Games, the walls covered in Bradley posters and notes, and at that point I have no idea what this is.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">game’s Steam page</a> makes things a bit clearer. This is, at heart, an action-platformer, but one where you have “game developer powers.” But on top of that, it’s a game about a beloved franchise becoming self-aware, realizing his fictional reality, and fighting against it to try to restore his normality. And then, yes, the story will include live-actions sections too. Which is glorious.</p>

 <p>Evan Peters, the&nbsp;<em>X-Men</em> movies’ Peter Maximoff, plays the real-world version and voice of Bradley, in the first game from Day 4 Night Studios, the first game from team of former AAA devs who have variously worked on games like <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Alliance</em>. One of the co-creators, Christian Cantamessa, calls&nbsp;<em>Bradley the Badger&nbsp;</em>“part love letter to video games and part satire of them.”</p> <p>The game is set for a Steam release in 2026, but will clearly be looking for console releases after its TGA appearance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Offloads Its 15.6″ Laptop at 72% Off, Margin Clearly Not the Goal on This Windows 11 Pro PC]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-offloads-its-15-6-laptop-at-72-off-margin-clearly-not-the-goal-on-this-windows-11-pro-pc-2000652643</link>
            <guid>1381747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops on the market, but not all of them are worth your money. If you’ve been after a solid option for remote work or studies, the 15.6-inch HP Flagship touchscreen laptop is an excellent option to consider, and right now, you can treat yourself to it without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/">It’s typically priced at $1,900, but Amazon just took a whopping 72% off it, dropping the machine down to just $540.</a> You’re saving over $1,300 on an option that has enough muscle to handle all your everyday tasks. The retailer is also offering a bunch of freebies with your purchase for absolutely nothing, which adds even more value to the purchase. Grab it before the deal expires, or the stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Useful Features</h2>
<p>This is a decent mid-range laptop that runs on an Intel i3-1315U processor, capable of clocking up to 4.5GHz with Intel Turbo Boost technology. It’s ideal for browsing, streaming your favorite shows, and regular office work, but might struggle to push through heavy gaming or demanding creative tasks. If you’re planning to use it for basic computing, it’s going to be a solid choice. Those looking to game and push creative limits should consider an i5 or i7.</p>
<p>There’s a modest 16 GB RAM to keep things running smoothly, which even lets you multitask on busy days with ease. Again, it’s not massive, but you’ll be able to use a couple of different programs and hop through a range of tabs without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. The 512GB SSD is spacious enough to house all your important media files and work documents, whether you’re looking to store high-resolution photos, videos, research files, or office projects. Additionally, since SSDs are much faster than traditional hard drives, you’ll also experience quicker boot and transfer times when launching the system or moving files around.</p>



<p>The display is a stunning 15.6-inch BrightView touch screen that is virtually borderless for a wide viewing experience. It pushes detailed, brilliant visuals for all that’s playing on the screen, from work presentations to movies and TV shows. Touch support means you won’t have to rely on just the trackpad or the mouse to get things done. Just use your fingers on the screen directly to scroll through pages, swipe images, zoom in on text, and even sign documents. It also comes in handy when two people are using the laptop; your friend won’t have to awkwardly reach for the trackpad/mouse to do something.</p>
<p>Ports include an AC smart pin, USB Type-A, USB Type-C, HDMI, and more. Best of all, Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, which means you’ll have instant access to a bunch of security and productivity features that Microsoft has designed keeping remote workers and professionals in mind. Copilot support lets you use AI to get help with tasks throughout the day. You can use it to find answers to random questions without opening a browser, get help with crafting replies, summarize documents, and even brainstorm ideas.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/">Other freebies include a DVD/CD drive, a Redragon mouse, a screen wipe, and a 256GB SD card.</a> This 5-in-1 bundle (including the pre-installed OS) is worth almost $200, but you’re getting it here at no extra cost. We highly recommend grabbing the discount while it’s still live – which might not be for long. You can treat yourself to the laptop, or pick it up as a gift for a loved one this holiday season!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-is-practically-giving-away-its-140w-usb-c-charger-in-a-holiday-clearance-push-2000652823</link>
            <guid>1381699</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Raise your hand if you’re one of those people with a too-large box or bin full of wall chargers of all shapes and sizes, 90 percent of which you haven’t used in years. It’s OK, that’s pretty much everybody these days, since any new smart device or laptop comes with one, so they accumulate. For the most part, they’re underpowered, undercompatible, and overall underperforming, which is why they live in that box, collecting dust.</p>
<p>One Anker Laptop Charger — a 140W monster with one USB-A and three USB-C ports and an LED screen that shows power output, port-specific details, and temperature data — should allow you to discard that box once and for all. And if you need two or more of them, now’s the time, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">a limited-time Amazon deal has it marked down by 35% to just $65.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Four at a Time Charging</h2>
<p>Finding a charger that can fast-charge your laptop and three other devices at the same time — Apple, Android, Samsung, Google, you name it — conjures images of something large and unwieldy. The Anker Laptop Charger is smaller in size than the charging block that comes with MacBooks, and way more versatile. It’s 2.7 inches square with the charging prongs folded down into the body and just 1.42 inches thick, weighing just 9.7 ounces. It’s a tad big to be called pocket-sized, but if you put one in your carry-on or suitcase for a trip, you’ll never want to be without it again.</p>
<p>At that compact size, the Anker Laptop Charger can come with you all day long — start as a bedside plug so you know you’ll wake up with a fully charged smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and laptop. Pop the Anker into your backpack or briefcase as you tackle your day. If one of your devices is running low, just find an AC outlet and the fast, efficient charging will get you back into the green in no time. Bring it back home and it’s ready again for four-device fast charging that’s fast, safe, and universally compatible — that includes handheld gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.</p>



<h2>Safe and Stable</h2>
<p>A huge pet peeve for anyone using a wall charging block is how easily they’re dislodged from the AC outlet. That’s especially true with multi-port models, because the ports are almost always positioned at the back of the block, away from the wall, where gravity handles the rest and slowly but surely starts to pull the prongs out of the outlet. The Anker’s ports are located at the bottom of the block, thwarting that downward pull, and the block can support up to 10.6 ounces while plugged in — greater than the 9.7 ounce weight of the block itself.</p>
<p>The Anker Laptop Charger is all about consolidating — all of those weaker one-port wall chargers can officially be walked to the curb now, and your travel or work bag won’t miss that enormous laptop charger. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">While Amazon’s limited-time 35% off deal on the 4-port Anker Laptop Charger is in effect, it’s the $65 charging solution that goes anywhere, anytime.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> just got its first big update and it could be one of the game’s last. Director Masahiro Sakurai previously promised the Switch 2 exclusive wouldn’t be a DLC-fest like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and it sounds like he’s sticking to that. While the new balance patch adjusts a bunch of vehicles and fixed plenty of bugs, the veteran developer said the goal is to not have to keep fiddling with it forever.</p> <p>“As discussed in Air Riders Direct 2, “Kirby’s Air Riders” does not have a production setup for DLC or anything like that,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1999297129186230755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1999297129186230755%7Ctwgr%5Ed405190b081ecd69a1546516d022529f124ffdfe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">wrote on X</a> on December 11, according to the site’s translation. “The team will be disbanding in the near future as well. Therefore, while we still have a short period of time to make adjustments, we’re aiming for a balance that can be enjoyed without issues even years from now. We might be able to tweak it one more time or so, but after that, please enjoy it as the completed balance!”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">エアライダーダイレクト2でお話した通り、『カービィのエアライダー』はDLCなどの制作体制を持ちません。<br>近いうち、チームも解散になります。</p> <p>よって、短い期間で手を打てるうちに､何年後でも問題なく遊べるバランスを目指しています。… <a href="https://t.co/L2JzJHzFb2">https://t.co/L2JzJHzFb2</a></p> <p>— 桜井 政博 / Masahiro Sakurai (@Sora_Sakurai) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1999297129186230755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The response from players has mostly been relief. Players responded to the director by noting that they played the original GameCube entry “tirelessly” for years with no updates. “This is how it should be,” wrote another, arguing that its natural to play games for a while and then move one rather than expect them to constantly evolve to hold your attention.</p>

 <p>Rick was the only character that got directly tweaked <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">in the new update</a>. His Rip-Roaring Rick Special was nerfed in the City Trial and Air Ride modes, as was his HP and defense. The game’s various machines, on the other hand, got lots of tweaks. In addition to changes for quick spin to all vehicles, while Star-types were nerfed across the board and Tank-types were buffed.</p>

 <p>My favorite patch note by far, though, is one that shows just how weird game bugs can get. “An error will occur when opening the Gummies screen in the Collection menu when the number of Gummies is between 8,285 and 8,626,” it reads. “This does not occur if there are 8,284 or fewer Gummies or 8,627 or more Gummies.” That issue will be fixed in the next patch.
