Nintendo now has the chance to do the funniest thing and finally release its own N64 classic fans have long requested. While diehard enthusiasts will still opt for more premium alternatives, it would save everyone else who just wants to recreate that old Christmas morning fun with a few rounds of Mario Kart a lot of money. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895]]></content:encoded>

But the Twitch star is part of a far bigger industry that spans various countries, cultures, and languages. According to a May 2025 report from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streams Charts and VSTATS</a></span>, the international VTubing landscape continues to grow quarter-over-quarter. While Japanese VTubers dominate the industry’s upper echelons, English-language VTubing is a core niche in the contemporary market. Meaning, if you’re interested in VTubing, now is the perfect time to start streaming.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Just don’t end up sticker shocked. Ordering your very own custom-made Live2D VTuber, or a 2D VTuber rigged to match a performer’s movements and facial expressions, can cost thousands of dollars. Many 3D VTuber commissions start around $1,000, with some high-end models reaching similar prices as their 2D counterparts. Make no mistake: The artists, riggers, modelers, and animators who make VTubing shine deserve every penny for their hard work. They are the backbone of this industry. But for newcomers interested in VTubing, it’s ill-advised to drop a couple grand on your first model. Cutting your teeth on something relatively inexpensive is best.</p><p>Luckily, VTubing is more accessible now than ever before. Plenty of pre-made models exist at an affordable price, allowing newcomers to express themselves creatively without breaking the bank. Programs like VRoid Studio even offer free model creation. And when in doubt, you can always throw a few images together and get started as a PNGTuber. Read on to learn the best ways to become a VTuber today.

You’ll want an avatar base</h2><p>While 3D VTubing is popular in its own right, many new VTubers are drawn to the field because they want to stream as a 2D anime character. However, commissioning a bespoke Live2D model can be expensive. Luckily, there’s a relatively affordable way to get started as a 2D VTuber. You can purchase an avatar base and then customize it to your liking.</p><p>Avatar bases are special models created with a wide assortment of modifiable hair, face, eye, and clothing options. Using the popular Live2D VTubing app <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VTube Studio</a></span>, users can import an avatar base and customize its various physical features via the model’s expressions. Additional changes can then be made to the avatar’s textures. After you’ve finished customizing your VTuber, make sure VTube Studio is capturing your webcam and audio output, and you’re done. It’s that simple.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ko-fi.com/s/3c6b9c0edf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ko-fi.com/s/3c6b9c0edf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suiika Customizable VTuber Model</a></span> is the most popular feminine Live2D avatar base, retailing for €115 (or approximately $135 USD).

Yes, this is literally a form of VTubing where you create content with image files. It’s incredibly simple to get started: Just draw a few images, hook them together with a PNGTuber program, and you’re done. I highly recommend this format for illustrators and digital artists unfamiliar with rigging or 3D modeling. Creating your own PNGTuber doubles as an advertisement for your artistic skills.</p><p>Using luna olmewe’s free program <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veadotube mini</a></span>, you can create your very own PNGTuber with ease. Simply fire up the software, go to the right-hand side, and select different image files that depict your VTuber with their mouth opened, closed, or while blinking in either state. You can then customize how your character moves when standing still or speaking. Make sure the correct microphone is selected, and you’re done! When you speak, your new PNGTuber will open their mouth. You’re officially ready to plug your new VTuber into your broadcasting program of choice.</p><p>Anywhere from two to four images will suffice for your PNGTuber. And for those who aren’t artistically inclined, have no fear. Many artists offer PNGTuber commissions starting at approximately $50 – a perfect option if you’re looking for a more boutique experience without breaking the bank.
