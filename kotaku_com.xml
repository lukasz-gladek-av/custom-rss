He’s successfully played the stoic leading man in films like the aforementioned <em>Matrix </em>and <em>John Wick</em>, and more comedic roles that play into his goofier side, like <em>Bill &amp; Ted</em> or when he played a fictionalized version of himself in <em>Always Be My Maybe</em>. Sometimes it doesn’t always translate, and you get rough performances like his role in the romantic drama <em>The Lake House</em> or the much-maligned serial killer movie <em>The Watcher</em>, which got him a Worst Supporting Actor nomination at the Razzies in 2000.

It includes a new level based on the film’s depiction of Tokyo, and has Shadow transported to this other dimension, and changing into a new form: Reeves’ version of the character from the film. His model changes, but more importantly, so does his voice. Reeves voices the hedgehog for the level, including all the grunts when he jumps and attacks, and his inner monologue. I was excited to get a sneak-peek at what Reeves might sound like playing Shadow in the movie, but his delivery in the Tokyo level reaches <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFIA37nFDog&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFIA37nFDog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“That Wizard came from the moon”</a></span> levels of stilted.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons this can happen. Reeves is a talented actor, but I imagine that as a real A-lister, his time is probably not cheap. As such, I don’t imagine there were a lot of recorded takes for Reeves’ lines.

While the live-action <em>Sonic </em>series works with some of the biggest names in Hollywood using Paramount money, it’s never going to be able to spend that sort of cash on the games—one way you could cut down on money spent is by cutting down recording sessions. I would not be surprised if Reeves recorded his lines for the <em>Shadow Generations </em>DLC in a single session, possibly a quick extra while he was in the booth.</p><div id="197402"><div data-video-id="197402" data-monetizable="false" data-position="kinjavideo" data-video-title="Keanu Reeves in Shadow Generations" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="7" data-playlist="197402" data-current="197402"><div><p>Keanu Reeves in Shadow Generations</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" playsinline="" poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/197xrjaz7466rpng.png" data-poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/81dea7e54127d3e9f4062e5794ba98dc.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197402/197402_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197402/197402_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197402/197402_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22940.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><figcaption>Keanu Reeves in Shadow Generations</figcaption></div><p>For example, take this line from Shadow’s inner monologue during the Tokyo level: “A beautiful city. It looks like how Maria described the Earth.” Pushing aside that this is already an awkward sentence, the way this line is delivered somehow sounds both like it could have been spliced together from a couple of different takes or it was Keanu’s first and only crack at it just as he was learning the lines. The awkward pauses, the disjointed inflections—Reeves has delivered better line reads than this.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Reeves has given janky performances in video games. His role as Johnny Silverhand in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> extends throughout the whole open-world RPG, and anyone who has to read thousands of lines for a video game will have a gap in quality from their best and worst days in the studio. But I hear these lines in <em>Shadow Generations </em>and wonder just how much time Reeves spent reading this script. I can’t imagine Sega having a lot to work with if these were the takes they put in the game. In the end, the DLC is free and I will never complain about having more <em>Shadow Generations</em>, but I’m glad to hear people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-early-reviews-premiere-keanu-1851718562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-early-reviews-premiere-keanu-1851718562">came away more impressed by his work in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a></span><em> </em>than I was in this new level. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When discussing a possible second season, Miller admits there are too many video games to choose from, before Wilson mentions arguably the most influential video game of all time. “The one I know I want to do is if we can figure out a way, the sort of granddaddy of all video games, I need to find a way to make a <em>Pong </em>episode.”</p><p>Before any of us could conjure up all of the possible twisted angles you can take with a 2D table tennis-themed game, Miller goes straight for blood, suggesting a <em>Pong </em>episode “could be equally disturbing as <em>Pac-Man</em>.” Just to refresh your memory, the <em>Pac-Man</em>-inspired episode from the first season involved a floating golden orb training a swordsman who emerged from a tank to escape a maze, before violently taking over his body for its own mysterious aim. Does that mean the <em>Pong</em> paddles will be controlled by humans ready to lob bombs instead of an innocuous white dot back-and-forth in a game of survival? Maybe not, but Pac-Man covered in blood after eating its way into someone’s body doesn’t make that suggestion an impossibility. </p><p>Miller also calls <em>Fortnite</em> the “Moby Dick of video games,” perhaps because the vast collection of IPs now present in it would make acquiring the rights a highly attractive but also very elusive and challenging prospect, or because, in his mind, the game’s popularity and cultural ubiquity make working with the property an obvious goal for anyone involved in telling stories rooted in games right now.

But I don’t think he’s going anywhere.”</p><p>The Witcher 4 probably still won’t be out for a while, but in the meantime fans can get more of Cockle’s Geralt in Netflix’s animated movie  <em>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-sirens-deep-doug-cockle-netflix-witcher-4-1851651538&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-sirens-deep-doug-cockle-netflix-witcher-4-1851651538">that arrives in February 2025</a></span>.
