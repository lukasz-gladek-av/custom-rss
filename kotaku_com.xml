              <p><span>After some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-showcase-state-play-tgs-2025-ff7-remake-part-3-2000626000"><span>rumors and speculation</span></a><span> suggesting we‚Äôd be getting one ahead of Tokyo Game Show, Sony has </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/"><span>announced a new State of Play presentation</span></a><span> for tomorrow, September 24. The showcase will include 35 minutes of new games, both from third-party developers and Sony‚Äôs PlayStation Studios.</span></p> <p><span>The only game we know will be in the show right now is </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>, the new game from Returnal developer Housemarque. The action game was first revealed </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893"><span>back in February</span></a><span> and features </span><i><span>iZombie</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fall of the House of Usher</span></i><span> actor Rahul Kohli as the lead actor. It‚Äôs set to come to PlayStation 5 next year. I‚Äôd be shocked if we got a release date tomorrow, but we will see at least five minutes of gameplay.</span></p> <p><span>The show will begin tomorrow at 2 p.m. Pacific / 5 p.m. Eastern, and will be streaming on PlayStation‚Äôs </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation"><span>YouTube</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation"><span>Twitch</span></a><span> accounts. After so many long showcases this summer, it‚Äôs nice to get something that‚Äôs only 35 minutes long. Thank you, Sony, for your mercy, especially because this is taking place after typical working hours for those of us on the East Coast.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond </span><i><span>Faros</span></i><span>, it‚Äôs unclear what games might make an appearance. </span><i><span>Ghost of Y≈çtei </span></i><span>is a little over a week away, so it would make sense for Sony to spend a little time promoting the game and reminding people that the samurai sequel is imminent. I‚Äôm sure someone at Sony thinks it could use some positive buzz after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><span>past couple of weeks of controversy</span></a><span>. I‚Äôd be surprised if they spent too much time on it, though, considering it‚Äôs about to get another wave of chatter when reviews go live later this week.</span></p> <p><span>Thoughts and prayers to the </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>fans who are no doubt hoping we‚Äôll hear more about </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV </span></i><span>tomorrow. I am on your side, but I cannot bring myself to actually feel hope.</span></p>

              <p>Given the endless waterfall of garbage that arrives on Steam, it might seem like you can upload and sell absolutely anything on the storefront. However, there <em>are</em> meant to be some verification checks in place to prevent the most egregious examples of nefarious content from reaching the platform‚Äîit‚Äôs just it doesn‚Äôt always work. Hence <em>BlockBlasters</em>, a Trojan-Horse 2D platformer that released as an innocent game, before being updated such that it could start draining players‚Äô crypto wallets. And tragically, this was discovered during a livestream fundraiser for a streamer with stage-4 cancer.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verified-steam-game-steals-streamers-cancer-treatment-donations/">reported by&nbsp;<em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, <em>BlockBlasters</em> went on sale on July 30 as yet another 2D platformer on Valve‚Äôs industry-dominating PC store. But a month later, on August 30, <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/19799326/">the game was updated with a couple of zip files</a>, which appear to have contained malware that allowed the game to empty players‚Äô crypto wallets.</p> <p>The ‚Äúgame‚Äù was obviously released as free, to tempt as many people into taking a look as possible. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/charts/">according to SteamDB</a> it seems&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em> only managed to attract a very small number of players. Estimates show it as having had under 7,000 downloads, while concurrent player counts never exceeded a desultory eight. That would have sucked if you‚Äôd poured your heart into a platformer, but clearly that wasn‚Äôt the plan here from first-time (and presumably last-time) developers Genesis Interactive.</p>

 <p>It was only when streamer Raivo Plavnieks (RastalandTV) was <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/57p5a-help-me-beat-stage-4-cancer">running a fundraiser</a> to help raise money to treat his stage-4 sarcoma that the cruel nature of the malware became apparent. Someone tuned in and encouraged crypto enthusiast Plavnieks to download <em>BlockBlasters</em>, when the extremely sick man watched $32,000 drain from his funds. ‚ÄúMy life was saved for whole 24 hours,‚Äù the streamer <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258">wrote on X</a>, ‚Äúuntill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on @Steam.‚Äù (Please be warned that the video clip embedded in the post is particularly upsetting.)</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anybody wondering what is going on with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CANCER&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$CANCER</a> live stream‚Ä¶ my life was saved for whole 24 hours untill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Steam</a> <br>After this I was drained for over 32,000$ USD of my creator fees earned on <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpdotfun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pumpdotfun</a> and‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/8YH4njd46E">pic.twitter.com/8YH4njd46E</a></p> <p>‚Äî rastaland.TV (@rastalandTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe, I can‚Äôt think,‚Äù the Latvian gamer added. ‚Äúim completely lost on what is going to happen next, can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it is my fault that I might end up on street again or not have anything to eat in few days.‚Äù</p>

 <p>However, according to&nbsp;<em>Bleeping Computer</em>, what happened next is a rallying from other crypto types, with crypto influencer Alex Becker posting to X to say he‚Äôd sent Plavnieks $32,500 to cover the losses.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have sent $32,500 to cover this to your new safe wallet.   Best of luck to you my friend. &lt;3.<a href="https://twitter.com/rastalandTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rastalandTV</a> </p> <p>Receipt below.</p> <p>‚Äî Alex Becker üçäüèÜü•á (@ZssBecker) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>BlockBlasters</em> was removed from Steam on September 21, the same day as the stream, presumably after a flood of resulting reports. However, it shows serious weaknesses in Valve‚Äôs store that malware can so easily be added to games. Earlier this year a web3 ‚Äúgame‚Äù called&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/security/156674/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware"><em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>was stealing Steam accounts</a>, and it‚Äôs just another of many examples.</p> <p>As a rule, the safest option is to take no part in the entire crypto scam in the first place. Put your money in a bank, or hide it under your mattress, but not in the criminal underworld that is cryptocurrency. And if anything is marked as ‚Äúweb3,‚Äù avoid it like the plague it is.</p>

              <p><span>One of the many consequences of the incredibly dystopian descent into fascism America is experiencing right now is that these motherfuckers have access to the internet and think their heinous acts of terrorism are memeable capital-C Content. Someone particularly evil over at the Department of Homeland Security posted a pretty vile video showing ICE, cops, border patrol officers, and military agents arresting dozens of people‚Ä¶and they set it to the original </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>theme song from the ‚Äò90s.</span></p> <p><span>The video was posted to the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs social media channels on September 22 and shows multiple arrests and searches, including clips of armed squads using explosives to get into closed buildings and groups of people being rounded up, all while either blurring or obscuring the faces of both the people being arrested and the officers themselves. If that wasn‚Äôt weird enough, the footage includes interstitial cuts of </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>protagonist </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash Ketchum</span></a><span> throwing Poke Balls, with the ‚Äújoke‚Äù being that he‚Äôs ‚Äúcatching‚Äù these various criminals. To really lay it on thick, the video concludes with mock-ups of </span><i><span>Pok√©mon</span></i><span> trading cards featuring several of the people arrested, which include mugshots, descriptions of their alleged crimes, a flag from their respective home countries in the background, and a description of where and when ICE arrested them.

              <p>I have too many devices that need charging at night. Between my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, there are enough cables circling around by night stand that it‚Äôs beginning to look like some sort of cyberpunk bird‚Äôs nest. Of course, this is my own fault. I can just get a charging stand such as this MagSafe one from Anker which will eliminate my electronic clutter entirely.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/"> It‚Äôs normally set at $111, but thanks to a 46% limited time discount, it‚Äôs now down to just $60. You save a whole $52 for the duration of the sale.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Apple</h2>
<p>This Anker MagSafe charging stand is built from the ground up for modern Apple products. Newer iPhones, AirPod cases, and Apple Watches all support wireless charging and this stand has three wireless chargers built in. Each are specifically made for either phone charging, watch charging, or earbud case charging.</p>
<p>Be sure to check which model iPhone and AirPods you have as earlier versions don‚Äôt support wireless charging. So long as you have an iPhone 12 or later model, you‚Äôll be good to go on that front.</p>
<p>Charging is fast enough for what the stand is going for. It‚Äôs capable of 15W charging. You can find much faster charging options when going with something wired, even within the Anker family of products. However, this is really an end-of-the-day sort of charging stand. When you turn down for the night, and set up all your devices on it, they‚Äôll be fully charged by morning, no problem. That said, it can still bring an Apple Watch Series 9 to nearly 50% in just 30 minutes.</p>



<p>While you have your iPhone charging on the stand, it can be set to display the charging status of the other devices you have charging as well as a clock display. Perfect for your night stand to catch the time at a glance, head still on your pillow.</p>
<p>Anker‚Äôs has a safety-first design philosophy on its products and we have the same story here on the MagSafe multi-device wireless charger. ActiveShield tech monitors temperatures over three million times per day to help ensure your phone and other devices don‚Äôt overheat.</p>
<p>There are two color options available. Choose either black or white. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. Get it now for $51 off for a limited time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/">That brings the price down from $111 to just $60. You can get the black for $71 at the moment.</a></p>
