            <link>https://kotaku.com/shokz-openrun-pro-2-price-drop-makes-it-a-budget-bone-conduction-headphone-gear-up-for-your-2026-fitness-goals-2000655250</link>
            <guid>1391044</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As we approach the new year, you might find yourself thinking a lot about your goals for 2026. Lots of folks go into January big ambitions to get in shape and keep to a regular fitness routine, but the reality many also drop any health changes they’re trying to make by February. It’s a motivation and discipline issue, but you can help yourself look forward to your time in the gym or time running outdoors with the right tools. I’m talking about a good pair of headphones. I like to use my time running to catch up on podcasts that I otherwise, wouldn’t get a chance during the day to listen to. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5756/">My Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones are my perfect companion for this. Right now, their replacement model are on sale for 22% off on Amazon,</a> bringing the price down from $180 to just $140, saving you $40.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5756/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bone Conduction Technology</h2>
<p>These headphones stand out from regular earbuds because they don’t go in your ears. Instead, they rest around your ears and use bone conduction to deliver sound. This means that sound vibrations are transmitted through your cheekbones, not through your ear canals. It’s a concept many of us might recall from those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ca4tfXefk">quirky lollipop toys in the 90s</a> that played music when you bit into them, though the Shokz headphones offer a much higher-quality listening experience.</p>
<p>The main benefit of this design is that it keeps your ears open to the sounds around you, which can be crucial, especially when running outdoors. Being aware of your environment is a safety issue. Whether it’s listening for approaching cars or simply staying aware of other runners or pedestrians, bone conduction allows you to enjoy your music or podcasts without losing situational awareness.</p>



<h2>Comfort and Fit</h2>
<p>The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 headphones have a design that comfortably sits on your ears, resembling a pair of sunglasses worn backward. They feature a lightweight, flexible titanium frame that wraps around your head, ensuring the headphones stay securely in place even during intense workouts. This design is especially great if you’ve ever been worried about earbuds falling out while running or exercising.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery performance, the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 doesn’t disappoint. You can enjoy up to 12 hours of continuous listening on a single charge. And if you need a quick recharge, just five minutes of charging provides you with around 1.5 hours of playtime, which is incredibly convenient when you’re about to head out for a run and realize you forgot to charge them beforehand.</p>



<p>Shokz also offers a mini version of the OpenRun Pro 2 for those who need a more snug fit. The mini model has a shorter connecting band, making it more suitable for smaller heads. The standard version measures 20.7 cm across, while the mini is 18.6 cm. If you’re unsure which model would be the best fit, Shokz provides guidance on their website to help you decide.</p>
<p>Both the standard and mini versions are currently available at the same discount, and the colors you can choose from include black, silver, orange, and blue. Each of them are on sale for the same discount so you can choose based on your personal preference, and not which will save you more money.</p>

              <p>Lil Wayne makes an unexpected appearance in a very unusual legal fight. <em>Call of Duty</em> is coming to Switch as soon as a few months from now. And one of Ubisoft’s Canadian studios just unionized. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I’m finalizing my personal game of the year list and I think I’ve almost nailed it. What games do you wish more people had paid attention to this year?</p> <h2>“Okay, you’re a goon, but what’s a goon to a Goblin?? Nothin’. Nothin’. You ain’t scaring nothing.”</h2> <p>That’s how attorney Ray Kim described Aspyr, the company behind a Switch port of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</em> that ended up at the center of a very bizarre lawsuit, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-kotor-ii-lawsuit-saga"><em>Game File</em> reports</a>. Those are lyrics from Lil Wayne on the track “We Be Steady Mobbin.” Aspyr were the “goons,” per the legal filing in an actual court of law, while the players suing over missing DLC were “the goblins, and they will not be deterred.” The group reached a settlement earlier this month but the long, messy paper trail revealed plenty of other interesting nuggets, including the <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kotor-old-republic-2-remake-kotor-kotor2-lucasfilm-leak-court-docs-2000651434">existence of an apparent <em>KOTOR 2</em> remake</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em>‘s director suggests you might not want to bother with the old games</h2> <p>“If you play [the two <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> games], you will see things <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">in [the upcoming] <em>Divinity</em></a> that reference those two,” Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/theyre-a-bit-outdated-larian-boss-swen-vincke-doesnt-believe-you-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-before-the-new-one-unless-you-want-the-lore/">told <em>GamesRadar</em></a>. “If you played the first <em>Divinity</em>, you will see it referenced properly inside of this <em>Divinity</em>. Ego Draconis, same story, or The Dragon Knight Saga, all of it is being referenced, but it’s just part of the history of what happened in this world, and it helped shape the world to the point where it is now.”</p>

 <p>But if you just want a taste of the lore and came to Larian through the cinematic feel of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, just play <em>Original Sin 2</em>. “If you played because you really enjoy tactical combat or co-op multiplayer or really having lots of freedom, you should definitely play <em>Original Sin 2</em>, because that’s a game that was a blueprint for<em> BG3</em>,” he said.</p>

 <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> will reportedly come to Switch soon</h2> <p>Years after signing an agreement to bring the franchise back to Nintendo’s platforms, the shooter is still MIA. “The first <em>CoD</em> Switch version is nearly done,” <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027">claims</a> <em>Windows Central</em>‘s Jez Corden. He said it’s currently scheduled for a 2026 release, though it’s not entirely clear which form the game will take: a port of an existing sequel or a completely different experience. “We’re committed to getting the franchise on Switch,” a spokesperson for Activision confirmed earlier this year.</p>

 <h2>We almost got <em>Grand Theft Auto: Tokyo</em></h2> <p>Ex-Rockstar North tech director Obbe Vermei, who worked on the franchise’s PS2-era games, said the studio had once looked at setting the open-world formula in cities all across the world, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>-style. An entry based in Japan was the closest to getting off the ground. “We had ideas about<em> GTA</em> games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul,” he told <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/"><em>Games Hub</em> in a recent interview</a>. “Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan were going to do it, take our code and do<em> GTA: Tokyo</em>. But then that didn’t happen in the end.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “People love having these wild ideas but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it, it’s too easy to go ‘let’s do what we know again,’ and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities.”</p>

 <h2>A Ubisoft studio in North America just unionized for the first time</h2> <p>Ubisoft Halifax is located in Nova Scotia and works on mobile projects, including <em>Rainbow Six Siege Mobile</em>. The group announced its plan to unionize earlier this year and had a majority vote ratified last week after Ubisoft dropped its initial challenges. “It has started a conversation,” programmer Jon Huffman <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/atlantic/nova-scotia/article/halifax-workers-form-first-ubisoft-union-in-north-america/">told CTV News</a>. “Colleagues have reached out to say it’s a huge surprise. Whether or not they choose to follow, that’s up to them. We’ve shown the way forward, hopefully.”</p> <h2>Bloober Team’s next project name-checks some of the best horror games</h2> <p><strong>“</strong>You have no idea how hard it is for me not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it. We’re confident that we’ll be able to share the first details very soon,” CEO Piotr Babieno told <em>Nintendo Insider</em>. <strong>“</strong>What I can say is this: fans of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>,&nbsp;<em>Limbo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Eternal Darkness</em> will immediately feel at home. That said, Project M introduces a bold twist—one that no horror game has ever explored before. This is a vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> was stripped of some Indie Game Awards over its use of AI</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-the-old-country-rare-big-game-you-can-finish-weekend-short-aaa-2k-2000655148">More games like <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, please</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-switch-2s-most-impressive-port-is-75-percent-off-right-now-2000655205"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s super Switch 2 discount was too good to be true</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" src="about:blank" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2647155999&amp;parent=Kotaku.com"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span></iframe></p>

              <p>You’ve never quite experienced a racing game the way it was meant too be played without a racing wheel. The Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals is the perfect way to feel like you’re actually in the car driving. And it’s on sale right now!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/">You can get your own Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals right now at Amazon for $199.99, which represents a savings of $130.01 and 39% off.</a> That means it’s the best time to go ahead and get yours so you can enjoy your racing games to the fullest.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A sturdy racing wheel perfect for all your gaming adventures</h2>
<p>The steering wheel has a nice grip and provides good rotational response, making it easier to turn into corners and making it feel more natural while playing racing games. In addition to having dual motor force feedback that simulates road feel, terrain changes and resistance when the driver pushes the limits of the vehicle, the Logitech G29 is able to provide an added sense of immersion in racing games by providing a tangible sense of feedback when the user is interacting with the virtual vehicle.</p>
<p>The pedals are made of high-quality material and provide the same level of resistance as you would experience with a real vehicle’s acceleration and braking system. With the separate location of each pedal and the placement of the pedals being similar to those found in a real vehicle, the pedals provide a realistic driving experience. Whether you are using the pedals to accelerate quickly down a long straightway or to slow down gently into a sharp corner, the pedals react smoothly to the input of the user.</p>



<p>This is a sturdily-built racing wheel, too. You’re not paying for flimsy garbage. It’s capable of standing up to the rigors of many hours of gameplay, which is good if you end up playing a lot of racing titles at home. When driving aggressively around corners, the wheel doesn’t flex or move in a way that makes driving difficult, and the pedals remain firmly in place underfoot. It doesn’t feel cheap, even though you’ll be saving some serious money on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/">Really, we can’t complain about the Logitech G29. It’s a great pick for anyone who wants to level up their sim racing experience.</a> Since you can get it for a great price right now, you should go ahead and add it to your setup for an even better time out on the digital road. And if you know someone who wants to start getting into racers, now’s the time to get a set with a racing wheel to gift them, even if it arrives after the holidays.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s USB-C Charging Station (250W, 6-Port) Gets a Surprise Christmas Price Drop, Lowest Price Ever This Holiday Season]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-usb-c-charging-station-250w-6-port-gets-a-surprise-christmas-price-drop-lowest-price-ever-this-holiday-season-2000655257</link>
            <guid>1390939</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="76" data-end="622">Running out of outlets is a familiar problem in homes, dorms, and offices alike. With phones, laptops, tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches all needing regular charging, it often feels like your devices are battling for the one free socket on the wall. Deciding whether to charge your phone or your laptop shouldn’t be a daily dilemma. While you could hunt down another outlet across the room, that solution is inconvenient and far from ideal. A better approach is using a powerful, multi-device charging station that can handle all of your stuff at once.</p>
<p data-start="624" data-end="1020">The Anker Prime 250W USB-C Charger is designed to solve this exact issue. Built to charge multiple devices quickly and efficiently, this high-capacity charging station eliminates the need to juggle plugs or carry around several bulky adapters. Even better, it’s currently available at a significant discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/">Normally priced at $170, it can now be purchased for just $100, representing a 41% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="624" data-end="1020">Universal Compatibility</h2>
<p data-start="1022" data-end="1612">It works seamlessly with a wide range of devices, from Samsung smartphones and JBL earbuds to Apple Watches and MacBooks. The charging station includes multiple ports to accommodate different needs, featuring four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. When a single USB-C port is used on its own, it can deliver up to 140 watts of power. That’s enough to fully charge a smartphone at impressive speeds or quickly replenish larger devices. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can reach 50% battery in roughly 25 minutes starting from zero.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2031">One feature of note is its adjustable power delivery system. An integrated LED display shows exactly how much power each port is providing, giving users clear visibility into their charging setup. A smart control dial on the side allows you to manually prioritize specific ports, making it easy to redirect more power to a device that needs to charge quickly—perfect for last-minute phone top-offs before heading out.</p>


<p data-start="2033" data-end="2350">Beyond performance, the charger also helps reduce desk and workspace clutter. With multiple charging ports built directly into one compact unit, there’s no need for extra wall adapters or power bricks. Everything plugs into one centralized station, keeping your setup clean and organized without taking up much space.</p>
<p data-start="2352" data-end="2725">Safety is another area where Anker excels. The charger is equipped with ActiveShield 3.0 technology and meets the latest safety standards. This system monitors temperature 80 times per second—over six million checks per day—to prevent overheating and protect connected devices. It’s twice as responsive as the previous ActiveShield 2.0, offering even greater peace of mind.</p>
<p data-start="2727" data-end="2940" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6570/">For a limited time, the Anker Prime 250W USB-C Charger is available at 41% off, dropping the price from $170 to just $100.</a> For anyone tired of outlet battles and slow charging speeds, this deal is hard to pass up.</p>
