              <p>It’s certainly true that&nbsp;<em>Strange Jigsaws</em> came out as long ago as August, and it’s also very much the case that the game has a blistering <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/">“Overwhelmingly Positive” rating on Steam</a> with a remarkable 99 percent of player reviews giving the game a thumbs-up. But somehow, this stunning follow-up to 2024’s lovely <em>20 Small Mazes</em> has not received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/strange-jigsaws/">a single published review</a>, and has gone forgotten in end-of-year lists. What a peculiar situation. Let’s address that a little bit by talking about why <i>Strange Jigsaws </i>is such a wonderful game, and how it’s a brilliant choice to play during your winter holidays.</p> <p>2024’s&nbsp;<em>20 Small Mazes</em> was a free game created by FLEB that was so much more than its title suggested. I mean, it&nbsp;<em>was</em> literally 20 small mazes, but it was also <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/02/20-small-mazes/">an extremely clever collection of puzzles</a>, each presented as if it were a simple maze but in actuality loaded with completely lovely ideas. It was bonkers that it was free, but perhaps it was something of a runway for <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>, a spiritual sequel that at first looks like it employs a similar conceit, but quickly reveals a whole new realm of intricacy.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655426">© FLEB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This time out, there are 50 “jigsaws” to solve, and I use quotes here because it’s so often more involved than that. As with <em>Mazes</em>, none is straightforward, each possessing a unique twist or original way of being solved. Even the main menu is part of its elaborate mystery of interconnecting elements that defy the laws of physics. Or rely on them, in one case.</p>

 <p>I love that it seems, on reflection, as if <em>20 Small Mazes</em> might have been part of this project, a deliberate effort to create expectations that&nbsp;<em>Strange Jigsaws</em> constantly defies. “Yeah, you thought this was another cute little bunch of novel ideas? Well, now figure out how this factory game spoof fits in to the creation of a lifeform you inadvertently engineered. Oh, here’s a puzzle that’s arrived from the future, locked behind a code and labelled ‘THE PAST.’ (It’s near the puzzle that’s on fire.) Once you’ve solved it, you can enter the infinite zoom!” Oh my goodness, I’m not sure gaming has offered anything else as clever as <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>‘&nbsp;infinite zoom this year.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655429" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655429"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655429">© FLEB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a masterful creation, and it’s rather mystifying why no one (including me!) reviewed it. It’s not too late, of course. And right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/">you can get it for yourself for just $4</a>! That’s madness. Do that, for goodness sakes. Then buy another one for a friend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>More on the<em> Clair Obscur</em> AI drama, a new Arc Raiders bug that’s the perfect excuse for dying, and the French <em>Final Fantasy 9</em> cartoon is still in the works. Welcome to a special Christmas Eve edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Why am I sitting here at my desk click-clacking away on my keyboard instead of watching my kids play <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>? Because of you, dear readers. The words written mean nothing without the people on the other end. From all of us here at <em>Kotaku</em>, we wish you a happy holiday and a restful winter break.</p> <h2>No AI in <em>Clair Obscur 2</em></h2> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="11 minutes, 54 seconds and how do you plan to use it in the future?&quot;&nbsp; Guillaume , yeah, we're aware of what's been going&nbsp;&nbsp;">Director Guillaume Broche was asked about the controversy surrounding the game and the tech in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MSRfVKC-Tc">a recent Q&amp;A with YouTuber Sushi</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-admits-sandfall-tried-ai-during-the-jrpgs-development-but-didnt-like-it-and-everything-in-the-game-is-human-made/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). “Yeah, we’re aware of what’s been going&nbsp; on with that, but I can say everything in the&nbsp; game is human-made,” he said. “When AI first really came out in 2022, we’d already started on the game. It was&nbsp; just a new tool.”</p> <p>He continued, “We tried it and we didn’t like it at all. It just felt wrong. We had originally&nbsp; used it as a placeholder for textures we missed, but we took it out as soon as we saw it. But&nbsp; yeah, the concept art, voice actors, everything is humanmade. It’s pretty hard to predict what&nbsp; the future of the industry will look like, but everything will be made by humans from us.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="11 minutes, 54 seconds and how do you plan to use it in the future?&quot;&nbsp; Guillaume , yeah, we're aware of what's been going&nbsp;&nbsp;"><em>Clair Obscur</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119">was recently stripped</a> of its Indie Game Awards wins over AI-generated textures that were in part of the game at launch but quickly removed. But the devil is in the details. Everything in a finished game being made by humans isn’t quite the same as saying no gen AI tools will be used <em>at some point</em> in the process, though it sounds like so far at least, Sandfall Interactive doesn’t think they’re worth the trouble moving forward.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> players are dealing with a bugged guns</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">There appears to be an ARC Raiders bug not allowing players to pull their gun out</p> <p>Happened to both Ninja and Nadeshot <a href="https://t.co/I5OHM5yUHr">pic.twitter.com/I5OHM5yUHr</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2003533565330677918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A clip making the rounds online shows Richard Tyler ‘Ninja’ Blevins explaining that he died in a fight because he wasn’t able to take out his gun. Other players in the comments have reported similar incidents where they’re unable to pull out a second firearm. It’s unclear how widespread the issue is but feel free to tell your friends this the next time you’re the first one down.</p>

 <h2>This might be the most painful way to try and pay <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-player-discovers-hornets-taunt-does-damage-proceeds-to-spend-hours-trying-to-beat-every-boss-with-it-this-is-like-watching-sisyphus-push-the-boulder-and-win/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a> that YouTube user <a href="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc">Bloblumordthe3rd</a> is trying to beat <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> using only taunts. It’s going about as slowly as you’d expect. According to them, Hornet’s&nbsp;<em>garama&nbsp;</em>does a total of six damage with the Hunter’s Crest on, or about as much damage as the starting attack. “This is like watching Sisyphus push the boulder and win,” wrote one commenter.</p>

 <h2>A big voice protests Evo over the Saudi deal</h2> <p>Fighting game commentator Stephen&nbsp;“Sajam” Lyon will not be <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">participating in Evo 2026</a>, he said on a recent stream (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/its-a-pretty-big-deal-for-me-as-a-human-one-of-the-fgcs-most-popular-commentators-is-stepping-away-from-future-evo-events-following-its-saudi-buyout/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “You know, I’ve been going to EVO since 2014 and I’m not going now because of the buyout,” he said. “And before you type anything, I’m like ‘Yeah man, if the US Army bought EVO I would also not go.'”</p>

 <p>He explained his thinking future. “Evil corporations purchasing or owning the things you like always sucks. But the difference, I think, for most people here is the purpose of the ownership and then what exactly they’re doing with it. It’s not just ‘The Saudi government owns EVO’, it’s like ‘The Saudi government owns EVO and lots of other things with the express intention of using these as a vehicle to promote tourism and sportwash.'”</p>

 <h2>A <em>Final Fantasy 9</em> remake is MIA but an animated adaptation is still in the works</h2> <p>French magazine <a href="https://ecran-total.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Écran Total</a> reports (via R<a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19263-final-fantasy-ix-animated-serieseemingly-back-in-production-at-new-french-studio-with-2028-release-target">PG Site</a>) that the <em>FF9</em> cartoon in production at now defunct Cyber Studios Group will continue on under Euro Visual. The show will be aimed at kids and have 13 episodes running about 22 minutes each. What does this mean for an eventual remake that’s been rumored forever? <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3mao657g7m22n">Probably nothing</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/james-bond-game-delayed-release-date-hitman-2000655417">The new James Bond game got delayed</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/vince-zampella-death-car-crash-tributes-reactions-2000655379">The video game industry pays tribute to Vince Zampella</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-shadow-generations-limited-run-games-edition-2000655411">Limited Run Games has pissed people off again</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-clears-out-cpu-liquid-cooler-at-its-lowest-price-with-pre-installed-argb-fans-and-aura-lighting-2000655544</link>
            <guid>1391701</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you frequently work with resource-intensive, creative tasks that push your CPU to its limits, liquid cooling can help you enjoy optimal performance while also improving the aesthetics of your workstation. Now is a great time to pick one, thanks to Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6583/">Right now, you can pick the Asus Prime LC 360 ARGB all-in-one CPU liquid cooler for just $100 at the retailer, after a sweet $25 discount</a>. That brings the cooler down to its lowest price this year. The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but the deal is selling out fast. We highly recommend snapping it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6583/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ensures Optimal Performance</h2>
<p>This liquid cooler features a specially designed CPU contact area that’s larger than most options in this range. The bigger size allows for quicker, more efficient heat transfer from the CPU to the cooler. It keeps thermal throttling or performance degradation at bay, even when things get intense. Translation? Consistent performance across all your tasks. It’s especially great for creative, heavier workloads where you can’t afford interruptions caused by heat.</p>
<p>Looks are taken just as seriously. The customizable infinity mirror lenses flaunt a reflective surface with a layered design that produces a mesmerizing illusion with ARGB lighting for a more premium, visually appealing look. Installation couldn’t be simpler. Flexibility (plus durability) comes from the 400 mm tubing, which makes cleaner routing in larger cases possible. You can use a single two-header cable to link both the ARGB lighting and the fans together. The integrated fan design keeps things clean and minimal, while still offering exceptional airflow to improve the overall cooling of your system.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the Prime LC 360 ARGB plays nicely with a wide range of Intel and AMD motherboard platforms, so whether you’ve got a mid-range processor or something a bit on the muscular side, it covers it all. It can be added to a variety of builds without requiring a workaround, which is also helpful when you’re upgrading.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6583/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $125 to enjoy these features, but you can do it for just $100 today.</a> This 20% discount is one of the best we’ve seen this year, so it’s best to grab it quickly. That said, there are plenty of other tech deals available at the retailer too, which makes it a great time to stock up on some accessories (keyboard, mouse, stylus pen), as well as grab some high-ticket items like laptops and mini PCs without paying the full price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[RIP The Art Of The Old Christmas Time Video Game Commercial]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/remembering-christmas-time-video-game-commercials-1840545976</link>
            <guid>1391677</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Christmas is almost here and so this is a time when many of us gather around and do certain things we feel are traditions. Maybe you watch a particular film or bake some sweet cookies. Personally, I like to get in the Christmas spirit by watching old video game commercials from the 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p> <p>These days I don’t really encounter commercials anymore. I mostly watch Hulu, YouTube, and Netflix. (And I pay to remove ads whenever possible.) But there is certain joy and happiness that pops into my head when I go back and watch these ads.</p>

 <p><em>Just a heads up, some of these uploads are low quality. You might need to turn your volume way up and squint a bit. </em></p>  <p>I remember seeing (some of) these ads on TV and getting excited about video games. (The ones from the 80s and before are a bit before my time.) Not even excited about the particular game that was being advertised, just excited to see video games on TV.</p>

  <p>Today it might be hard to remember a time when games weren’t everywhere. But in the 90s and early 2000s games were still a somewhat niche thing. We didn’t all have phones with console-quality games on them or giant eSport competitions getting millions of views on streaming sites. So seeing a commercial for a console or games pop up on my TV was exciting.</p>

  <p>And during the holidays the excitement was even higher. Maybe some of these games would be under my Christmas tree or maybe my friends would get some. Soon I too will get to play that cool looking game!</p>

  <p>Looking back today, a lot of these commercials are cheesy and silly. But then again, most ads, even in 2019, are cheesy and silly. But watching these brings me back to a time when gaming seemed small and scrappy. It also reminds me of the great holidays I spent playing games with my brother or finding that perfect game under the tree.</p>

 <p>What gaming commercials from around the holidays do you remember?</p> <p><em>This story was originally published on Dec 22, 2019. We’re re-upping it today for the holiday.&nbsp;</em></p>
