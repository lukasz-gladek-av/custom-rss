Veterans will know this is a feature that gives players special rewards. This can be in an item drop or an event, but it’s also how Game Freak sometimes delivers special Pokémon to players.<em> Legends: Z-A</em> will give early adopters a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite so it can Mega Evolve when it reaches its final form. The Publisher Information description explains how the player can acquire this gift, and notes that they will have to get about an hour-and-a-half into the game to access something called the “Link Play” menu.<em> Legends: Arceus</em> didn’t have this menu, even when it let players trade critters, and the term “link” has a specific connotation in the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise, as the original <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> games allowed you to play against other players with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Link Cable</a></span>.

If you scroll down a little further, you’ll see it specified that <em>Legends: Z-A </em>only supports one player.

It’s entirely possible we hear more about the game then, and given that the competitive community will have its eyes locked on the show, that seems as good a time as any to announce multiplayer if it exists. For now, however, we’re left with more questions. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158]]></content:encoded>

Itch.io quietly updated its list of banned content over the weekend with the following section on adult games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks. We are unable to support the sale of any works containing these topics:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li><li>Underage or “barely legal” themes</li><li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li><li>Bestiality or animal-related</li><li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li><li>Sex trafficking implications</li><li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li><li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., “scat,” “vomit”)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Developers can appeal individual bans, but with thousands of listings removed and someone needing to actually play each individual title to adjudicate claims, that process seems all but unworkable in the short term. “It’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time,” Itchi.io writes on the site. “If an issue arises with your account that isn’t already covered by our policy, then we will contact you and share what options you may have.”<br></p><p>While Steam has also banned hundreds of games revolving around rape or incest in response to pressure from Visa, Mastercard, and other payment processors.

According to its creator, it includes the option for incestual relationships between characters but doesn’t not demand it. It remains available on Steam but was one of those games purged from Itch.io last week. </p><p>“This completely destroys me—so many games published with love on this platform, and now they won’t reach anyone new,” wrote<em> Love’s Heart</em> creator Capky Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a blog post</a></span> last week. “I don’t have an audience elsewhere; I depend on itch.io to grow.

However, this new group of blue cat people isn’t as nice and kind as the groups we’ve seen before. This is the dangerous Ash Clan, who are led by Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, and who use fire as their main weapon.
