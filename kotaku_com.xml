              <p>Rumors have swirled for weeks now that the next <em>Fortnite</em> season would be a mini-season themed around Fox’s long-running animated series <em>The Simpsons.</em> Now we have new info from reliable leakers that claims the popular battle royale’s next big update will replace the game’s map with a virtual Springfield from the show.</p> <p>In September, reliable <em>Fortnite</em> insiders like HypeX and Shiina began reporting that the next season of<em> Fortnite</em> would be a <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season. Then, earlier this month, dataminers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706">discovered Kang and Kodos inside <em>Fortnite’s</em> files</a>. Descriptions of the two characters mention them not being included in the battle pass, seemingly confirming that the rumors of a <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season, complete with a battle pass, were true. Now those same insiders are reporting that the mini-season will replace <em>Fortnite</em>‘s current battle royale map with a Springfield-inspired battlefield.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">SIMPSONS x FORTNITE MAP IS FULLY SPRINGFIELD</p> <p>Also a Nuclear Plant POI — VIA <a href="https://twitter.com/NotPaloleaks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NotPaloleaks</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpushFNBR</a> <a href="https://t.co/s6H40GbEyK">pic.twitter.com/s6H40GbEyK</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1979986181413622240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On October 19, multiple <em>Fortnite</em> leakers, including Hypex, <span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks">NotPaloleaks</a>, and </span><span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR">SpushFNBR,</a> began reporting that the mini-season’s map would arrive in November and will be “fully Springfield.” Previously, some had theorized that part of Springfield would be added to the current battle royale map, but it sounds like that’s not the case. Instead, it’s claimed that the entire <em>Fortnite</em> map will be replaced with Springfield for the reportedly month-long event. <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Battle">That’s similar to how past mini-seasons have worked</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks/status/1980303035936165911">Paloleaks further reported that the map will be cel-shaded</a>, matching the look of the animated series. It’s also claimed that the new <em>Simpsons</em> season will include mash-up skins, likely mixing and matching <em>Simpsons</em> characters with <em>Fortnite</em> characters. I can’t wait to see what Epic does with Peely. Perhaps a Moleman x Peely skin that will make everyone question their sanity?&nbsp;</span></p> <p>As a giant <em>Simpsons</em> fan, I’m both excited about this <em>Fortnite</em> news and scared that I’m going to end up spending far too much money on a bunch of silly digital skins. <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">Yes, I know, I’m part of the problem and I’m sorry</a>. Epic hasn’t confirmed the new <em>Simpsons</em> season yet, and likely won’t until we get closer to November. Until then, I’ll just rewatch Treehouse of Horror episodes and mourn the loss of <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Simpsons Tapped Out,</em> the last new <em>Simpsons</em> game released in over a decade</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A demo for a free <a href="https://kotaku.com/impressive-simpsons-hit-run-remake-was-made-by-one-f-1847530115"><em>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</em></a> mod that turns the beloved game into a <em>Futurama</em> adventure is finally here, around four years after the project was first revealed.</p> <p><em>Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em> is a still-in-development total conversion mod of 2003’s <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run">Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a>,</em> a fan-favorite semi-open-world game based on the long-running animated TV show and featuring most of the original voice cast and writers. <em>Hit &amp; Run</em> is one of those PS2-era games that has a large fanbase of older fans who desperately want a sequel. But what’s even better than a sequel? A whole new game based on a different animated comedy created by Matt Groening.</p>  <p>On October 19, Slurm Team (a collection of fan modders and devs) released the <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48">first playable demo for<em> Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em></a><em>.</em> The free demo features the mod’s first level and is a small slice of the planned full project, <a href="https://youtu.be/5vhFwQmTD5c">which was first announced back in 2021</a>. Still, what is here is impressive and could easily be mistaken for a game that was released back on the PS2 in the early 00s. It should be noted that the devs behind the mod confirm that the demo contains AI-generated voices, but those will be replaced with real voice actor performances in the full release.&nbsp; Honestly, calling this a mod doesn’t feel accurate, as <em>Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em> is more like a new game built using the engine and tech of the OG <em>Simpsons</em> version. Here’s some gameplay of the demo:</p>

  <p>Considering how few <em>Futurama</em> games we got back in the day, and how we’re currently in the middle of a <em>Simpsons</em> video game drought (with <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Tapped Ou</em>t being shut down</a> in 2024), projects like this are the closest things fans of either animated show can hope for in 2025. Well, besides <em>Fortnite</em> skins and events, like a rumored <em>Simpsons</em> event coming to Epic’s battle royale juggernaut later this year. That might be fun, but I’ll still be over here longing for a new<em> Hit &amp; Run</em> starring Homer and the family. <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-hit-and-run-2-sequel-remake-remaster-planes-1851038958">There were plans to make a sequel back in the day, but it never happened.</a></p> <p>Until then, I can play this new&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Futurama</i>&nbsp;mod using&nbsp;<a href="https://donutteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://donutteam.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Donut Team’s fan-developed modern PC port of Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a><i data-stringify-type="italic">,</i>&nbsp;available here.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Friends, you might not know it by scrolling through my author page here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, but there were a few years where I was really disillusioned with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-games-best-worst-part-scarlet-violet-red-blue-1850084491"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>. For a few generations, I played the games, but I wasn’t living and breathing Game Freak’s monster-catching RPGs like I am now and did as a kid. This wasn’t because the games weren’t resonating with me, but because I’d been kind of annoyed by the types of competitive-focused fans I suddenly found myself surrounded by in my high school years. All these years later, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has you encountering a group of similarly snobby, pretentious, gatekeeping </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>battlers, and putting the smack down on them was one of the most karmically satisfying moments in the game for me.</span></p> <p><span>As the kids around me grew up in my small Georgia hometown, it seemed like their relationship to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>changed. They stopped caring about who their favorite little guys were and started crunching numbers and making spreadsheets, suddenly becoming very concerned about the competitive viability of these monsters above all else. I tell a guy Beautifly is one of my favorite Pokémon and he starts preaching to me about how she’s a weak point in my team because she’s a frail bug. Bro, I don’t give a fuck, look how pretty she is. Eventually, the constant competitive-focused conversational detours those people insisted upon became so obnoxious, they pushed me out of the space. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>was always a social outlet for me, so to feel like I couldn’t really connect with other people through our mutual love of the world and its mysterious creatures soured me on it almost entirely.</span></p>

 <p><span>Eventually, I found my way back. The </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>game was the first step back in the door, as its mystery adventure mechanics and hopeful view of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe struck a chord with me in 2018. Then the movie came out, the </span><i><span>Let’s Go </span></i><span>games and </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span> had me tethered to my Switch, and I could not have been more back. I watch competitive play at arm’s length, but I’m still hankering to go to the World Championships some day. By and large, though, I play these games for the worldbuilding, the story, and to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>hang out with Raichu</span></a><span>. Don’t tell me how to make my Pokémon better for a hypothetical tournament I’ll never compete in. I do not wish to know.</span></p>

  <p><span>I’m not the only one who feels this way, either, as evidenced by a group of kids in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> who call in Lumiose City’s mob equivalent to, with your help, get some competitive snobs to leave them alone. Lumiose City has a group called the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, which is led by the fairy-type trainer Jacinthe, a rich socialite who has a large amount of influence in the Paris-inspired metropolis. She is also, as you will come to find out, someone who insists upon herself, shows up uninvited, and puts literal barriers up to trap people into doing what she wants, and she seems to be involved in some kind of odd, fetishistic relationship in which she makes Lebanne dress up as a maid as some kind of humiliation ritual. That insistence seems to trickle down to the rest of the SBC members, as our first encounter with them is during a quest in which the player is running errands for the Rust Syndicate. A pair of these elites has started hounding a group of children, probably aged between five and eight, about how to make their Pokémon the Very Best Like No One Ever Was. Are you feeding your Pokémon the right supplements to ensure they’re competitively viable? If not, the SBC will come find you and pester you in broad daylight.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637287">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>So these poor kids call in for backup, and because I am indebted to the Rust Syndicate, that backup is me. The kids run up to me with distressed looks on their faces, and say they were just having battles on their own before the two people dressed way too well to be hanging out on a battle court started “lecturing” them about the importance of competitive viability. “I bet they’re just trying to show off to us because nobody their own age will put up with them,” one says. And despite all their insistence upon their own competitive superiority, my team wipes them out, and they go running off to their homebase with their Slowpoke tails between their legs. It was cathartic.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is such an expansive franchise that it can mean different things to different people. Some fans only engage with the games, others with the anime or card game, and some may just like having plushes on their desk. A series this big and broad is never just one thing to everybody, and trying to insist that it should be is the kind of toxicity that pushes people out. There will always be bad apples in the community that want everyone to conform to their vision of things, but at least I got to send my own personal </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>snobs packing.</span></p>
