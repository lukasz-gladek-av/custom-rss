And some of these players are tired of being tossed into matches where their entire team is duelists, forcing them to play healer or tank to help balance the lineup. </p><p>One solution to this problem is a role queue. Found in games like <em>Overwatch 2</em>, a role queue lets players pick a role, like tank, and then find a match that needs that specific role. In <em>Overwatch 2</em>'s case, this means every match has a tank, two attackers, and two healers. This should lead to more balanced teams, but the devs behind <em>Rivals </em>don’t seem interested in adding this system to the shooter.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-dev-offers-update-on-when-to-expect-role-queue&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-dev-offers-update-on-when-to-expect-role-queue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>Dot Esports</em></a></span><em>,</em> Chen said that the studio is “not considering a role queue” at the moment. </p><p>“The team’s goal is to offer a wider variety of team composition through team-up skills and their own designs, to let people play their Marvel superheroes rather than limiting players to choosing a role.” </p><p>Chen further explained that data from matches shows that <em>Rivals </em>currently doesn’t need a role queue system. </p><p>“We want people to have a Marvel experience where they’re free to select what they want. [Since the beta test earlier this year], things have been rational and within expectations. In our Competitive play recently, there is a lot of different compositions emerging from players and we’d like to continue to monitor these fun compositions and how they impact our game.” </p><p>While some might be upset that Chen and developer NetEase aren’t rushing to balance the game or add a role queue system, I’m happy to see an online multiplayer game studio step back and let things be chaotic and messy for a bit before jumping in to sand things down and make everything more fair and balanced. </p><p>One of the reasons I enjoy <em>Rivals </em>is because everyone feels powerful and matches rarely play out the same way as nearly every character seems viable with the right comp or strategy. And while a role queue might be nice in ranked mode, I hope if it is ever added, it doesn’t signal a shift to balancing all the fun out of <em>Marvel Rivals. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now we get an encore during the holidays as well. This year’s Day of the Devs: Game Awards 2024 Edition didn’t disappoint either. Every time I think the heavily curated, very personal, extremely intimate showcase <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297">can’t possibly top the last one</a></span>, somehow it still does.</p><p>As the video game industry ping-pongs from one big-budget sequel and live-service disaster to the next, with seemingly ever less room for creativity, experimentation, and risk-taking, Day of the Devs reminds us that wild, wonderful things are being made all around us as long as you know where to look. And the organization, which started as a collaboration between DoubleFine and iam8bit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dayofthedevs.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dayofthedevs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before becoming a donation-supported non-profit</a></span>, does indeed know where to look. </p><p>This year’s event featured 19 rad-looking games from all sorts of genres, sporting a wonderful assortment of visual styles and coming from devs around the world,  and I can’t wait to try them all. Especially <em>TankHead</em>, which seems like what you’d get if you set <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> in the world of <em>Wall-E</em>. </p></div></div><div><p>A successor to the 2009 cult hit <em>Eliss</em>, <em>Faraway</em> is about a shooting star charting the cosmos while chasing high scores and vibing out to a soundtrack that reminds me of <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em>.  The whole game is operated with a single button input as you use gravity wells to slingshot your way around celestial bodies. “Let me teach you something about infinity,” says the game’s creator. It’s meant to be infinitely replayable like <em>Tetris</em>: simple on the surface but full of lasting depth. </p><p><strong>Developer and publisher:</strong> Little Eyes <strong>/ </strong>Steph Thirion</p><p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2025</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2831000/Faraway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2831000/Faraway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam Wishlist</strong></a></span></p></div><div><p><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</em> follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, <em>Ultimate Chicken Horse</em>, with lo-fi pastel art and chaotic antics.

The junk-crafting game lets you construct a custom robot out of the scrap you find in order to take on other giant robots. It looks like <em>Shadow of the Colossuses </em>by way of <em>Wall-E</em> meets <em>Mad Max</em>. The action takes place in an irradiated wasteland ravaged by warring factions and iron-fisted law enforcement. In addition to customizing your mech, the tank controls reward guarding your weak areas and trying to outmaneuver opponents. It could be really special if it plays half as well as it looks.</p><p><strong>Developer and publisher: </strong>Alpha Channel</p><p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>Out now (Epic Games Store)</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tankhead-2f3b51&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tankhead-2f3b51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Epic Wishlist</strong></a></span></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
