But a lot of work is still needed, something the studio acknowledged in a community update announcing the delayed <em>Hitman</em> mission and future patches. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 25</a></span>, an official representative of Build A Rocket Boy posted an update on Reddit about <em>MindsEye’s </em>future. The bad news is that a planned crossover mission featuring Agent 47, which was teased before <em>MindsEye</em>’s launch, has now been delayed. </p><p>“We apologise that the release of the <em>Hitman </em>x<em> MindsEye</em> Mission, originally scheduled for July, has been postponed to a later date,” said the Build A Rocket Boy spokesperson. “We look forward to delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right and will provide further updates as soon as we’re able.”</p><p>The whole reason Agent 47 was going to show up in <em>MindsEye </em>is that the game was published by <em>Hitman </em>studio IO Interactive, so it was a bit of brand synergy. But now, it seems the team behind <em>MindsEye </em>is more focused on getting the game fixed up and improved before adding any new content. </p><p>Build A Rocket Boy laid out two updates, one coming in August and one arriving in September, that will bring “additional performance improvements, bug fixes,” and community-requested features. This includes the option to skip cutscenes, as well as user-published missions being “instantly accessible” on PC. </p><p>The studio did warn that moving forward, future updates might be less frequent, but the plan is to make them bigger and more substantial and to include more fixes. While this plan makes sense and it’s reasonable for the devs to focus on improving the game instead of adding a fun crossover mission, I can’t imagine anyone involved with <em>MindsEye </em>was hoping to be in this terrible situation post-launch. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-worst-game-2025-update-hitman-crossover-delay-1851787011]]></content:encoded>

But those same Vtubers recently accused the company of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBxw80mZoWI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBxw80mZoWI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failing to pay them the money they were owed</a></span>, including $515,000 raised for charity by Ironmouse last fall in a record-breaking subathon on Twitch. Days later, VShojo announced it was shutting down. </p><p>It was one particular part of CEO Justin “Gunrun” Ignacio’s apology that’s been galling fans the most, however. “I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity, which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative,” he wrote in a statement posted on X. No long after, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/1948540194770084045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/1948540194770084045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a community note</a></span> proving that wasn’t true was attached to the post, which continues to go viral on the platform. </p><p>“Justin claims to not know the purpose of the funds, but he personally congratulated Ironmouse on the completion of her charity fundraising event and reposted Ludwig directly mentioning that half the funds would go to charity,” it reads. There were links to the past tweets in question, which include Ignacio writing, “YOU DID IT MOUSE!!” A tweet from VShojo’s Japanese X account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MyrdinTV/status/1948452975451820315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MyrdinTV/status/1948452975451820315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also acknowledged the fundraiser</a></span>. <br></p><p>Another Vtuber, Veibae, who left VShojo back in 2023, responded to Ignacio’s claims by mentioning her own past problems with the company. “I only found out I didn’t get paid for any of my sponsors after I had already signed the NDA,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X yesterday</a></span>. “After 2 years, I have still not been paid back fully. To add insult to injury, they also demanded I had to pay them back 10k for some of the anniversary assets which when they sent me back months later, were half finished.” She also accused VShojo of allegedly trying to lowball revenue splits and sabotage her departure with rumors seeded on 4chan. </p><p>According to Ignacio, the agency “prioritized creators and community over short-term profits,” but not many Vtubers seem to feel that’s true. Ironmouse has yet to respond to the claims directly. “My brain is running on empty at the moment,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948794001253171664&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948794001253171664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote on Friday</a></span>.
