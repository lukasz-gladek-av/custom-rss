              <p>18 years after <em>Metroid Prime 3</em> launched and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-prime-4-1796058481">eight years after the sequel was first announced</a>, Nintendo and Rare have finally finished<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</em> The long-awaited follow-up arrives later this week on Switch and Switch 2. And on December 2, ahead of release, reviews from critics went live across multiple outlets. In summary, <em>Prime 4</em> isn’t a bad game. But it doesn’t sound like a masterpiece either, falling short of past entries in the first-person shooter series.</p> <p>Launching on December 4, <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is Nintendo’s last big game of 2025 and has a lot of hype and hope surrounding it. Fans have been wanting an <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-metroid-prime-4-zelda-mario-1850098941">entire console generation</a>. So when previews last month featured an overly talkative sidekick, a big departure from the often atmospheric and empty worlds of past <em>Prime</em> games, people were nervous. Would players quickly grow tired of some bumbling sidekick?</p>

 <p>The good news is that many reviews, even the less glowing ones, indicate that <em>Prime 4</em>‘s human characters aren’t overly annoying and aren’t as big a part of<em> Prime 4</em> as some had feared. Another concern fans had involved the open world connecting the various areas of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, which Samus Aran traverses on a motorcycle. Many critics, even those who found the bike cool, weren’t convinced this was a necessary inclusion.</p> <p>Narratively, the world you explore in<em> Prime 4</em> is reportedly filled with excellent worldbuilding and lore teases, but some complained that this latest entry doesn’t feel like a complete story. Instead, it seems like it’s teasing the start of something more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-who-pre-ordered-metroid-prime-4-six-years-ago-have-seen-their-entire-lives-change-2000645936">Hopefully, if <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> gets a sequel, fans won’t have to wait another decade for it.</a></p> <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroidhttps://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-prime-4-beyond">PC Mag</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>At worst, these characters are somewhat stock, providing a contrast against a singularly awe-inspiring figure like Samus. For example, there’s a chatty nerd and an old, gruff general. They leave you alone for long stretches of the journey, so when they’re deployed, it’s with purpose. Initially, your comrades explain tutorials at base camp. Later, they pop up for set-piece moments that advance the story and diversify the gameplay. In a nice touch, soldiers aid you in battle if you can protect them, and a hulking robot companion clears paths blocked by debris. There are some neat hints of worldbuilding as one teammate explains his spiritual beliefs, which sets up a lovely payoff. These supporting characters are Beyond’s weakest element, but they’re inoffensive and serve their purpose well. As always, <em>Metroid’s</em> real story is between you and the planet.</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.polygon.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><em>Polygon</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> thinks you are very, very stupid. Like, unbelievably dimwitted. At one point, I’m running through a room that only has one exit and one entrance. My companion runs over to the only other door I can walk through and shouts “This must be the way!” Later, I blast down a machine while standing on a bridge. Everything explodes around me in a cinematic and the camera focuses on a morph ball-sized hole that has appeared in the chaos. The scene continues long enough for a soldier to point directly at the hole and tell me that it’s the way out. I gain map data for an area at some point and a pop-up tells me that I can press the minus button on my controller to open it. A companion chimes in: “Wanna check your map?” I get it. Metroid games can be alienating for mainstream audiences, and the series has always struggled to find commercial success. Having linear biomes and tighter direction helps ease the on-ramp for players who are intimidated by the idea of getting lost.</p> <p>But Retro Studios has already solved for that time and time again: cutscenes that telegraph where to go, a scan feature that tells players exactly how to kill bosses, on-screen button prompts. The soldiers don’t replace any of those ideas; they quite literally talk over them. You now get up to three nudges at a time when you encounter an obstacle. And all of that is happening in the&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>major Nintendo series that isn’t geared towards its youngest players.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">Game Informer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>The first-person action gameplay is familiar to previous Prime games and feels good. Samus’ new psychic powers don’t radically change the fun lock-on, shooter gameplay, but I enjoyed remote controlling the Control Beam at opportune times in boss fights and to solve puzzles. The pacing and unfolding of each location are immaculately designed, funneling you toward objectives while consistently planting seeds that make you want to return later with expanded abilities. The desert hub area where Samus drives her motorcycle between objectives is the perfect size: Big enough that the motorcycle feels necessary, but not so big that you are ever driving for too long.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">GamesRadar+&nbsp;</a></em></h2> <blockquote> <p id="bf1a2720-ff20-45e4-b300-098b15f2c95a">The overworld, the dune-covered Sol Valley, feels similarly dated conceptually, and, again, closer to classic <em>Zelda</em> than any kind of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> twist I hesitantly expected – especially considering there are literally shrines that offer small puzzle challenges. There’s so few you can count them on two hands, and basically all amount to walking into a room and seeing if you have the power-up to progress or not – this is no bite-size revolution of the <em>Metroid</em> formula but something to fill an otherwise fairly empty open world map Sol Valley is how Samus accesses each of the five main key-hiding areas, which does make it the largest completely interconnected open world Metroid has ever had. Sort of. The problem is how much of a rigmarole it is to get back and forth between anywhere.</p> </blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>The central desert, which you’ll be crossing often as you go back and forth between the main areas, is fun enough. Vi-O-La, the bike, is a blast to drive, with a few fun and simple mechanics to experiment with. The desert does give the impression, though, that it was designed separately from the rest of the game. I genuinely wonder if it was outsourced to a different team. Even the loading zones seem to suggest this, as it doesn’t even directly connect to the dungeons. In each case, there’s a loading zone, then a tiny ‘staging’ area you can cross in about a minute,&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;the dungeon.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is a Frankenstein fusion of ideas, which at its peaks delivers some great series moments, but at its troughs, feels like a dilution of the formula that made these games beloved in the first place. Throughout Prime 4, players neck-jerk between horror-style FPS sequences, open-world vehicle exploration, and comedy banter between a crew of wisecracking support characters. It’s an experience that feels like a collage of styles plucked from past Samus Aran adventures,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda,</em> and&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, but never really settles into a clear identity.</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/"><em>Gamespot</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>All of this is delivered with a visual fidelity on Switch 2 that is among the best we’ve seen on a Nintendo system. Sometimes particular details can look a little rough–some of the flora in Fury Green, or the industrial mesh grating of the Volt Forge, for instance–but other times it’s stunning. The frozen-over laboratory of the Ice Belt, or the futuristic beauty of Lamorn architecture in its artifacts, are particularly strong. It won’t match the best we’ve seen on PC or higher-powered consoles, but it’s a beautiful game regardless. Plus, I just love the look of Samus’ new suit, and in cutscene close-ups, the fidelity did it a lot of favors by showing the layers of its textures and materials.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Inverse</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>It’s possible that a version of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>&nbsp;that leaned into the open-world aspects or even the party of secondary characters could work, but as it is now, both feel bolted onto a game that would be much better without them. Ultimately, much of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>&nbsp;feels like a failed experiment. As great as it is to explore the lightning-struck Volt Forge or pick through the haunted remains of the Ice Belt facility, the game’s standout moments are buried in drudgery.&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is thrilling at times, set across consistently beautiful environments, but it can’t stop getting in its own way.</p></blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[HBO Rolls Out The Red Carpet For Mad Men By Leaving The Barf Machine In]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Mad Men</em> is probably one of the best 10 television shows ever made. It’s certainly one of the most important. It came to define a late aughts “golden age” of TV when the internet was full of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/mollylambert/115625706564/the-almost-complete-ml-mad-men-recaps-s1e1-smoke">show recaps and essays</a> and aspiring networks were racing to land prestige TV hits that would win awards and convince critics that movies were no longer the most important medium for visual storytelling. So it’s equally fitting, in a way, that the 4K re-release of <em>Mad Men</em> on HBO includes sloppy oversights that make it emblematic of media’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">current enshitification</a> in the streaming era.</p> <p>The <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/mad-men-stream-hbo-max-4k-1236581005/">ultra-HD makeover</a> of AMC’s period drama about an advertising agency straddling the cultural revolution of the ’60s became available on HBO Max on December 1, and it includes some unique artistic choices. The most viral of those is leaving in the barf machine for one of the series’ most memorable moments. In season 1, episode 7, “Red in the Face,” Don Draper suckers his boss, Roger Sterling, into a late lunch break filled with booze and oysters and then races him up the Manhattan high-rise stairs when the elevator goes out of commission.</p>

 <p>Sterling gets back to the office just in time to puke in front of the entire agency, including important clients. It’s an important moment that underlines a bunch of conflicting fault lines within their relationship. It’s also very gross. In the new 4K version, viewers are treated to the actual puke machine that hurls clam chowder out of a pipe next to Sterling’s face, as well as the stagehands deploying it. It’s beautifully absurd and also kind of undercuts the entire scene.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the new 4K transfer of mad men on HBO somehow does not have any of the post-production edits added in, which means you get stuff like this where you can see the crew member manning the puke machine after Roger has too many oysters lmao <a href="https://t.co/HNgPRNOsla">pic.twitter.com/HNgPRNOsla</a></p> <p>— johnny (@bigrackspart7) <a href="https://twitter.com/bigrackspart7/status/1995756905755549751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“This is hilarious, and the extra hand on the crew member’s shoulder is killing me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbqafk/red_in_the_face_hbomax_4k_shows_staff_operating/">wrote</a> one commenter on Reddit. “Like someone else is giving him extra emotional support while he shoots fake vomit from a tube.” We’ve seen this sort of thing happen before, but it’s usually when <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paddypadman.bsky.social/post/3m6z3bnqxjs2u">older shows get updated to newer aspect ratios</a> and stuff that wasn’t originally intended to be part of the scene makes it into the frame.</p>

 <p>The fact that the apparatus and its handlers weren’t scrubbed out in post-production, as they were for the original version of the show, raises bigger questions about just how carefully HBO handled the re-release of one of modern TV’s most storied series. What kind of penny-pinching apathy lets the barf machine skate through the review process unscathed, and in the first season no less?</p>

 <p>I casually started re-watching <em>Mad Men</em> while doing other stuff just a couple of weeks ago and made it through the first two seasons in no time. Who at Warner Bros. Discovery thought it was a good idea to bring <em>Mad Men</em> back to a major streaming platform for the first time since it left Netflix back in 2020, and not skim it for issues? Especially since it was being upscaled to 4K? If they didn’t even catch the barf machine, what else did they miss?</p> <p>Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pc20pw/season_one_out_of_order_on_hbo_max/">the episode order for one</a>. At least some users, including myself, tried to watch season 1, episode 7, only to find that it had swapped places <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbth6b/red_in_the_face_replaced_with_5g_on_hbo/">with episode 6</a>, which had swapped places with episode 5. I guess David Zaslav didn’t want to pay someone’s nephew to sit in a room and do a final view test before releasing the 4K cut. Too busy thinking about Scrooge McDucking his way through mountains of cash if Netflix and Skydance <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-new-bids-netflix-comcast-paramount-1236439442/">get into a bidding war</a> over Warner Bros.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-doesnt-care-about-profit-on-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-priced-like-budget-android-tablet-2000649277</link>
            <guid>1370479</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="72447a38-387f-40b8-a390-2b9e2ddb309a" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-1">
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday behind us, you may think the time to save has come to an end. You couldn’t be more wrong. Lots of brands are keeping their discounts hanging around a little longer past the biggest sales event of the year. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is currently available for a drastically reduced price of $150.</a> The Samsung tablet normally sells for $220, so this 32% discount represents a savings of $70. Get it for as low as $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">The design of the Galaxy Tab A9+ is both slim and lightweight, making it perfect for on-the-go use. It’s durable enough to withstand daily handling, whether you’re commuting, working at a café, or just moving between rooms at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h3 data-start="373" data-end="414">Exceptional Display and Sound Quality</h3>
<p data-start="416" data-end="960">For under $150, you get an 11″ touchscreen with an LCD display boasting a 1200p resolution and a 90 Hz refresh rate. Whether you’re streaming videos or just browsing the internet, the visuals are sharp and smooth. The tablet’s built-in speakers deliver clear, rich sound, enhanced by Dolby Atmos technology to give you “cinema-like audio your ears will love.” Now those are Samsung’s words, not mine. Marketing fluff. In practice, the only similarity between the sound when watching something on this tablet and watching something in a movie theater is that they are both indeed sound. So while it’s a bit of a stretch to compare tablet sound to a full cinema experience, it certainly provides better audio than most tablets in its class.</p>
<h3 data-start="1293" data-end="1342">Storage Options and Multitasking Capabilities</h3>
<p data-start="1344" data-end="1675">When it comes to storage, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers two options: 64 GB in the more affordable model and 128 GB in the higher-end version. This gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and videos. However, given the rise of streaming services, you might find that you rely more on streaming content rather than downloading media. In which case, the 64 GB model should suffice.</p>
<p data-start="1677" data-end="1996">Powered by Android OS, the tablet makes it easy to multitask and switch between apps. You can view multiple apps side by side—great for when you’re managing multiple tabs in your browser or just keeping an eye on your email while working.</p>
<p data-start="1998" data-end="2273">File transfer is also a breeze thanks to Samsung’s Quick Share feature. It allows you to easily send files to another device, whether it’s running Android or iOS. Transferring photos, documents, or videos between your devices is quick and convenient.</p>


<h3 data-start="2275" data-end="2299">Perfect for Families</h3>
<p data-start="2301" data-end="2673">One feature that parents will appreciate is the Samsung Kids app. If you’re not ready to buy a dedicated tablet for your child, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers a safe, fun, and educational environment for younger users. With its playful interface and age-appropriate content, it’s a great way to keep kids entertained while ensuring they’re using technology in a safe way.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3001" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">If you’re looking for a deal, now is the time to grab the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+.</a> The 64 GB model is priced at just $150 after the 32% discount. Don’t miss out on this limited-time offer, available on Amazon in this post-Cyber Monday opportunity.</p>
