Complete with refreshed graphics, updated gameplay, and cherished memes intact,  <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>is already topping Steam charts and taking players on an Unreal Engine 5-made trip down memory lane. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

I’m not sure remaster actually does it justice.” While much of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> seems to be a UE5 glow-up with the original game more or less intact under the hood, many critical systems have received an overhaul, including the original RPG’s infamously tedious leveling system in which skills improved through repetition. The result at the time was players putting rubber bands around their controllers to have their characters grind abilities while they went AFK. </p><p>Newer players will also be delighted to discover <em>Oblivion</em>’s surprisingly star-studded cast. It features Patrick Stewart, Lynda Carter, Sean Bean, Terence Stamp, and Alfred Molina, among others. The soundtrack <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oblivion-s-soundtrack-is-perfect-for-adventuring-1845245419&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-s-soundtrack-is-perfect-for-adventuring-1845245419">is also top notch</a></span>. Due to <em>Skyrim</em>’s gargantuan success in comparison and many diehard fans considering <em>Morrowind </em>the “best” <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game, <em>Oblivion</em> has arguably been somewhat overshadowed within the broader pantheon of Bethesda RPGs. It’s great that to see it getting a new lease on life in a form that strikes a decent balance between the legacy of the original and modern playability. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And the teaser promises a <em>Predator </em>sequel unlike anything we’ve seen before.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,197541" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Predator: Badlands</em> is from <em>Prey</em> director Dan Trachtenberg and is set to arrive in theaters in November. Here’s the the teaser: </p><p>And here is the official synopsis from 20th Century Studios and Disney: </p><p>“<em>Predator: Badlands</em> is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator  outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.”</p><p>In case you can’t tell from the trailer, <em>Badlands </em>will make one of the franchise’s deadly alien hunters the protagonist. As seen in the teaser, we are going to be spending a lot of time with this outcast Predator who seems to not wear a mask for large sections of the movie. That lets us get a good look at his alien face and mandibles and it reveals that one of the only flaws of <em>Prey</em>—the goofy maskless Predator design—has been fixed here. No more giant forehead! </p><p>If, after watching that teaser, you’re thinking, “Wait, didn’t we already see a trailer for a new Dan Trachtenberg-directed <em>Predator </em>movie earlier this month?” don’t be alarmed. You aren’t losing your mind. We did get a trailer for a <em>different Predator </em>movie<em>—</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-killer-of-killers-cartoon-animated-disney-hulu-1851775292&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-killer-of-killers-cartoon-animated-disney-hulu-1851775292"><em>Killer of Killers—</em>about two weeks ago</a></span>. That one is an animated movie featuring different Predators in different time periods and is also from Trachtenberg. That movie is set to launch on Hulu on June 6. Will it have any ties or connections to <em>Badlands</em>? Maybe!</p><p>Anyway, <em>Predator: Badlands</em> (the live-action movie) is set to land in theaters on November 7. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*1to08ik*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTQyNjc4NC4zMjUuMS4xNzQ1NDMyOTYwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*1to08ik*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTQyNjc4NC4zMjUuMS4xNzQ1NDMyOTYwLjYwLjAuMA..">Two <em>Predator </em>movies in one year?
