            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve never seen patch notes issued for a press release before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884">but Discord just did exactly that</a>. The company has updated the language around its new age-gating rules to make clear that the “vast majority” of users have nothing to worry about because the company’s AI will be able to accurately estimate their age and bypass the controversial new verification procedures rolling out over the next few months.</p> <p>It’s been a rough 24 hours for Discord, <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">the modern hub for gaming conversations online</a>. The company revealed new age verification requirements on February 9 that would lock users out of certain features, like “age-restricted experiences,” unless they upload a face scan or a picture of their ID. The blowback was swift and loud, with calls to boycott Discord’s paid Nitro subscriptions and return to old-school website forums.</p>

 <p>Maybe that’s why Discord returned a day later to post a “<a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/2021297270281384424?s=20">novel</a>” that goes into more detail about its new age assurance rules. “Discord is not requiring everyone to complete a face scan or upload an ID to use Discord,” the company promised in a new addendum on February 10. “The vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today, without ever being asked to confirm their age.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hmm let me play the roll of Clippy and help you</p> <p>Your Age Inference model is already running and has much more then just Age predictions. <a href="https://t.co/oj7j81DjNI">https://t.co/oj7j81DjNI</a></p> <p>Not requiring everyone: because you are already using your AI to capture data and age predict Age, Sex, etc. Hence…</p> <p>— Rakunvar 👀P.R. for @StreamerHouse🏘️ (@Rakunvar) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rakunvar/status/2021320521011560775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s because Discord’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7czEt1_Zeic">AI&nbsp;inference model</a> will be used to guess most users’ age. If it guesses a number that’s 18 or higher, you’re in the clear. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to give the company your sensitive data in order to get around the new teen safety protocols. But Discord is quick to stress that this doesn’t apply to most people because most people don’t ever access adult content on Discord.</p>

 <p>“You must be a confirmed adult to access age-restricted content and experiences such as age-restricted servers and channels or to modify certain safety settings,” the company <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally#age-assurance-clarification">explains in a new FAQ</a>. “The majority of Discord users don’t access age restricted content and will never go through a facial age estimation flow or ID verification. In the minority of cases where we cannot confirm you as an adult and you need to access age-restricted areas and settings, then you will be asked to go through additional steps.”</p>

 <h2>Archived servers and canceled Nitro subs</h2> <p>All of this “our big announcement wasn’t actually a big deal” energy came after an immediate user revolt that saw, among other things, Discord <a href="https://x.com/discord_support/status/2020863471550927243">repeatedly get community noted on X</a>. People didn’t like the idea that Discord is already constantly surveilling its users to <a href="https://x.com/Vuthakral/status/2020893257987748166">build an anonymous profile of you</a> that I’m sure it’s not hoping to further monetize <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761">once it reportedly launches its secret IPO</a>.</p> <p>It doesn’t help that all of this is coming after a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad-2000633690">pretty bad hack of a Discord vendor last year</a> that saw age verification materials, including photos of users’ faces, obtained by malicious actors. The company says it doesn’t keep this information tagged to your user data, but if you think there’s a safe way to digitally transmit your face and/or your government-issued ID to a company over the internet in 2026, then I have some <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-60-ads-celebs-stars-ben-affleck-dunkin-jurassic-park-ai-de-aged-best-commericals-2000666913">totally not killer AI robot assistants to sell you</a>.</p>

 <p>While the backlash has been noisy, it’s not clear how many people will actually shift away from Discord over the new rules, though some diehard users on the Discord subreddit already claim to be calling it quits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1r09lrn/bailing_and_i_want_to_archive_my_server_are_there/">One popular thread</a> had a server owner looking for help with archiving it before they leave the platform. Some users on social media, meanwhile, have been making <a href="https://twitter.com/KuroSekaiAnime/status/2020954657502515520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2020954657502515520%7Ctwgr%5Ee4437406b5c679e87bcd39b015eb003b843caf6c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fdiscord-nitro-cancelled-age-verification%2F">public displays of canceling their paid memberships</a>, Discord’s main source of revenue.</p> <p>So far, non one seems to be biting on the company’s latest attempt to deescalate people’s fears. “If this isn’t reversed I will be cancelling my Nitro and all Boosts,” one user wrote on X. “I recommend everyone does the same.” Discord’s amended announcement, like the original, is already well on its way to getting ratio’d.</p>
