            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Amazon was celebrated Prime Big Deals Days which had extended from October 7 to October 8. It was a great two-day stretch of time to find yourself some excellent savings on just about anything from kitchen appliances to apparel to tech. Had you been hoping to score a new laptop for yourself, but somehow missed the sales event, all is not lost just yet. You can still find some fantastic laptop deals across the website. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/">Like right now, this HP Intel laptop designed for students and businesses dropped its price by a staggering 76%. Amazon has the full price listed at $1,500, so after the discount, it comes down to just $365.</a> That’s a savings of $1,135.</p>
<p>Now before you get too excited, know that this discount — while good — isn’t enormous as it seems. Lots of Amazon sellers tend to jack up the list price of their offerings and then mark the product back down so that it can be labeled with a huge discount. The specs on offer here would really never justify a price of $1,500. The new $365 price tag is a much better reflection of what you’re getting. Still a great value though.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With this 2025 HP laptop, we’re looking at an Intel N150 four-core, four-thread CPU alongside an integrated graphics card. You’ll have solid performance browsing the web and even doing some light photo or video editing. It’s working with 16GB of RAM and a storage capacity of 128GB.</p>
<p>The screen measures in at 14-inch, keeping it compact and portable to easily fit into any bag on your way to and from class. It displays in slightly above 720p at 1366 by 768 pixels. The HP True Vision 720p web camera and dual-array digital microphone allow you have crystal clear video calls, even in low light conditions.</p>



<h2>Bonus Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Included with the laptop is a set of added accessories to get you going. The HP 2025 laptop comes with a wireless mouse and CD/DVD drive which pretty much no laptop comes with on-board any more. You get a 256GB SD card which effectively triples your storage capacity. Then we also have Windows 11 Pro pre-installed as well as a one-year license to Microsoft 365 which will grant your access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel and all the other Microsoft Office apps. Plus that comes with OneDrive so you can save files to the cloud and access them from any device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/">For a limited time, you can get the HP laptop with all these additional accessories for just $365.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is just a few days away and already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717"><span>leaking all over the internet</span></a><span>, but that’s not the only leak coming out of Game Freak right now. It’s been a full year since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> revealed more information about upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games and anime, and now, the same leaker is releasing some new alleged details on even more future projects. This includes information about the 10th-generation games for the Switch 2, but also the next </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game, and a new MMO that might give some fans something they’ve been asking for for years.</span></p> <p><span>The leaks have begun circulating through </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>leak accounts, and include details and concepts for five upcoming games, and a loose timeline for the next five to six years of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> development. But keep in mind that even if these projects are at some stage of development at Game Freak, pipelines shift, ideas can be scaled back from their initial concepts, and some of these games could be internally canceled and never formally announced.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The biggest info dump is for what appear to be the Generation X games: </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Wave</span></i><span>. Game Freak is apparently targeting a 2026 launch for these games, and they will be Switch 2 exclusives. The games will be set in a region inspired by Southeast Asia, which contradicts original reports that Gen X would be based in a Greece-like region.</span><i><span> Wind</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span> will lean hard into the open-world exploration of recent games like</span><i><span> Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, with procedurally generated islands for the player to traverse. There will also be underwater areas that you can dive into and explore further. Game Freak also appears to have DLC in the works that will launch in 2027.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/qCLnDyOgu7">pic.twitter.com/qCLnDyOgu7</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977791867698737338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>We already knew Gen X was coming, though. The more surprising leaks are those indicating upcoming spin-offs and a new </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game. The third </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game is codenamed Ringo and will be set in the Galar region from </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This game will apparently return to the past like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> after </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s modern-day detour, and will be set 1000 years before the events of </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. Part of the game will focus on the player creating the first Gigantamax Poké Ball, which is used to capture the massive kaiju Pokémon in the Galar region. Game Freak’s pitch documents for the game liken it to </span><i><span>Xenoblade Chronicles X</span></i><span>, implying it may have real-time elements in its combat systems. This may also include boss battles against Gigantamax Pokémon, though the leaks only show concept images of those at this time.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/EjpNJWzA0d">pic.twitter.com/EjpNJWzA0d</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977802307300630534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/nCgbUbdm1N">pic.twitter.com/nCgbUbdm1N</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977798756348137532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Finally, the leaks hint at a multi-region MMO codenamed Project Seed. The game’s initial pitch documents claim it will be set in a region that connects Hoenn (</span><i><span>Ruby</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>) and Sinnoh (</span><i><span>Diamond</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>), and will allow you to travel between them alongside other players. Game Freak is targeting a 2028 launch for Switch 2.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Xptp3QYETK">pic.twitter.com/Xptp3QYETK</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977788607818793207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The leak also has notes about Generation XI, which is currently planned to launch sometime in 2030. While knowing what might be coming is fun, the leaks also give us some insight into things that aren’t in the pipeline, despite long-running fan theories. A </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>remake is apparently not in the works at the moment, with Game Freak noting it wants the eventual project to be a thorough remake.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">From Game Freak docs:</p> <p>“Remakes made for Black and White onwards should have a lot more love and care put into them. I hope that they become good games that will allow people to enjoy eras different from the Legends series.”</p> <p>Note that currently Game Freak has no Unova remake in… <a href="https://t.co/bGKyEYh7rf">pic.twitter.com/bGKyEYh7rf</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977923383623848195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of the more maddening scrapped ideas in the leaks is that Game Freak was, at some point, considering making a </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game set in the Johto region from </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>, and would have released a pair of games rather than just one. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Ho-Oh</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Lugia</span></i><span> were going to be a historical RPG that would have explored the origins of the first Pokémon trainers. Like in</span><i><span> Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, the player would have been transported to the past from modern times. Eventually, Game Freak shelved this in favor of the modern story in Kalos that became </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. I’d like to think the team could revisit this project down the line, but now that it’s been leaked like this, that feels unlikely.</span></p> <p><span>That’s a lot to digest all at once. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>pipeline is a well-oiled machine of nearly annual releases at this point, so it’s not surprising that several projects could be in some stage of development all at once. A lot of these games sound very ambitious, so hopefully the extra year of development Game Freak got by skipping 2024 helps them reach that potential. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16, and was originally planned to launch last year, so we’ll see how much that extra development time paid off.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-bose-skullcandys-anc-headphones-havent-moved-from-that-prime-day-lowest-price-2000633363</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-bose-skullcandy%E2%80%99s-anc-headphones-haven%E2%80%99t-moved-from-that-prime-day-lowest-price.1324432/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s a deal you’ll literally be able to feel: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/">Amazon just dropped a monster post-Prime Day sale on the Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 wireless over-ear headphones, taking the price down by nearly half to just $144.</a> That’s almost $100 off the regular $240 list price, and while you might not be able to physically feel the heft that extra $100 in your wallet, you’ll most definitely feel the heavy-duty Multi-Sensory Crusher Bass sound, probably all the way down to your toes.</p>
<p>Skullcandy’s flagship over-ear wireless headphones may look similar to most other phones, but there’s nothing subtle about the powerful sound they kick out with two extra bass drivers joining the two full-range 40mm audio drivers. Use the adjustable 4-mic active noise cancellation to shut out the few external sounds able to penetrate the sonic wall of the Crusher ANC 2 headphones, and you’re fully immersed in your playlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All About the Bass</h2>
<p>When you have access to deep, heavy bass like what comes from the Multi-Sensory Crusher Bass sound of these Skullcandy headphones, you’re going to want to put it to the best use possible. Cinematic scores when you’re streaming a movie are perfect. So is a high-intensity shooter or battle royal when you use the Crusher ANC 2 headphones for gaming. EDM drops? That goes without saying — the Crusher ANC 2 headphones are absolutely perfect for those.</p>
<p>It should be noted that you’re not completely locked into blasting away with the bass at all times — you can use the Skull-IQ app to fine-tune your EQ, flip the noise cancellation into Stay-Aware mode, and completely optimize your sound with Personal Sound by Mimi. With multipoint pairing, you can connect to two devices at once and easily toggle between them without having to “forget connection” on one before pairing with the other.</p>



<h2>Sound for Days</h2>
<p>If you don’t have the Crusher ANC 2’s active noise cancellation engaged, a single full battery charge is good for a staggering 60 hours. And if you’ve let that charge dwindle and you’re about to run for the door, a quick 10 minutes of Rapid Charge gets you 4 hours of listening time. The Crusher ANC 2 headphones come with an extra 1.6-foot 15W high-speed USB-C charging cable for when you want to use Rapid Charge.</p>
<p>There are times you want to relax with a mellow playlist, and there are times you want to just shut out the rest of the world and blast away with&nbsp; good and heavy mix. The Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 wireless Bluetooth headphones are very good for the former, but they’re unbeatable for the latter. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/">And the Amazon post-Prime Day deal knocking nearly $100 from the price?</a> That’s unbeatable too.</p>

              <p>Dragon Con, Atlanta’s massive annual pop culture convention, featured its usual array of enormously famous guests, booths and of course, cosplayers. As ever, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s intrepid photography heroes Mineralblu were there, snapping the best outfits, compiled here today for your viewing pleasure.</p> <p>The Florida event can certainly bring out the big guns. 2025’s shindig saw the likes of John Boyega, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanaz, Brent Spiner, Simon Pegg, Timothy Omundson, Christopher Lloyd, Karen Fukuhara and William Shatner. It also appears to attract some of the most inventive cosplayers too, with some costumes the likes we’ve never seen before.</p> <p>Among the more familiar sources, such as <em>Elden Ring</em>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em> and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, this year’s Dragon Con also featured cosplay inspired by <em>Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure</em>, the glorious idea of an unpainted Space Marine, and my absolute favorite, a collection of Thumb Thumbs from the mighty&nbsp;<em>Spy Kids. </em>And check back soon, as hopefully we’ll also have a video of the event to add to this post in the not-too-distant future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days has come and gone. This was the online retail giant’s two-day sales event where you’re able to save big on TVs, tablets, coffee makers, and pretty much anything else. The next massive, site-wide sale won’t be here until Black Friday, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a good deal. You just have to look hard enough. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/">This Marshall Bluetooth speaker came down in price at the beginning of the month by a whopping $85 and has remained there through the Prime sale.</a> That 47% discount brought the price down from $180 to just $95.</p>
<p>Marshall has been an industry leader in sound engineering for more than 60 years. The company first put its name on the map when it introduced the world to the JTM45 guitar amplifier. That amp produced a much heavier reverberated sound than all other speakers on the market, which helped defined the sound of rock n’ roll. Music was changed forever. Fast forward to today, Marshall still commits itself to crafting great products featuring its signature sound. That’s what you’re getting with this portable Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Iconic Look and Sound</h2>
<p>First thing you notice about the Marshall Emberton II is its look. This Bluetooth speaker has been models to look like all the iconic Marshall amps of the past, bringing a stylish accent to whatever desk, coffee table, or nightstand you place it on.</p>
<p>The Marshall Emberton II offers a rich stereophonic 360-degree sound that can fill a room and sound great no matter where you are sitting or standing in relation to it. It’s compact in size, but still durable, allowing you to take it with you anywhere without worry.</p>



<p>A portable speaker would be pretty useless without a good battery — so how is the Marshall Emberton II on that front? Well, this speaker will get you over 30 hours of playtime off of a single charge. That over a full day of listening to Ben Platt’s cover of&nbsp;<em>Diet Pepsi</em> on repeat. If you find you have forgotten to charge.</p>
<p>After pairing your phone in your Bluetooth settings, you can start listening with rich sound immediately. Though, if you download the dedicated app, you can customize your sound to your environment and persona preferences. Mess with the equalizer presets to find what’s perfect whether you’re listening in your living room or outside on the beach.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/">Right now, you can grab the Marshall Emberton II speaker for $85 off for a limited time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Call of Duty</i> has been such a staple of gaming that it’s hard to imagine a time when it wasn’t a household name. But way before its yearly release cycle kicked in and modern and futuristic settings became <i>CoD</i>’s bread and butter, even before the franchise made its debut and was largely about simulating World War II battles, there was <i>Medal of Honor</i>. And according to EA’s Vince Zampella (<i>Battlefield</i>, <i>Titanfall</i>, <i>Apex Legends</i>), Activision brought <i>CoD</i> into existence to put <i>Medal of Honor</i> in its crosshairs. Mission accomplished.</p> <p>“The only reason <i>Call of Duty </i>exists is because EA were dicks,” Zampella said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella"><i>GQ</i></a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-only-reason-call-of-duty-exists-is-because-ea-were-dicks-battlefield-boss-vince-zampella-says">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). An FPS OG, Zampella was the lead designer of <i>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</i>, and would go on to co-found Infinity Ward.</p> <p>In what sounds like a dispatch from an alternate universe, Infinity Ward was originally hoping to create more <i>Medal of Honor </i>games. That didn’t happen. EA decided to be “dicks,” and chose to handle things on its own with <i>Medal of Honor</i> (that wouldn’t end up working out well). At the time, Infinity Ward, now without its franchise of choice in its grasp, pivoted to pitching Activision on a new historical shooter, <i>Call of Duty</i>.</p> <p>Zampella would later join EA, creating <i>Titanfall </i>and <i>Apex Legends</i> in his role at Respawn Entertainment. He’s now in charge of <i>Battlefield</i>, which is celebrating its sixth mainline release.</p>
