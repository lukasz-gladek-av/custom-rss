The hero shooter pretty shamelessly draws inspiration from <em>Overwatch</em>. As a result, NetEase’s swing at the genre feels like putting on a familiar glove to long-time players of Blizzard’s game. However, there are a few bits of minutiae that are different and worth keeping in mind, even if you’ve spent hundreds of hours in similar games. I put about 15 hours into <em>Marvel Rivals</em> during its test periods and about a few additional hours since its launch on December 5. So here are a few tips for newcomers if you’re jumping into the game for the first time.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196880" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h140246"><a id=""></a><strong>Spend some time in the practice range</strong></h2><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>launched <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">with a sizable roster</a></span>. With 33 characters right off the bat, it can be overwhelming to find which heroes you jive with. <em>Rivals </em>matches are so fast-paced that deciphering what each character does can be confusing, as well. Your best bet in finding a hero you gravitate toward is to spend some time in the practice range first. Here you’ll have full access to the whole roster and can train on some robot dummies. Just a few minutes in here will give you a starting point before heading into online matches. This way you’re not completely fumbling in the dark without any frame of reference for how characters play. The best way to learn all the intricacies is by playing a real battle, of course, but going in blind will make that on-ramp more difficult.</p><h2 id="h140247"><a id=""></a><strong>Actually read your Hero Profile</strong></h2><p>Part of getting to know all the heroes is learning their moveset, but several of them have passive abilities you’ll never actually press a button to activate but are still worth knowing. In the hero select screen you can access each character’s Hero Profile, which contains a straightforward rundown of all their abilities, active and passive. Read these before you actually run out into a fight if you’re trying someone new, it’ll be the difference between winging it and having some tactics in mind for how to handle a fight.</p><h2 id="h140248"><a id=""></a><strong>Here’s a rundown of the currencies</strong></h2><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is free-to-play, and that means it makes most of its money by way of microtransactions. None of the heroes are locked behind a paywall, but cosmetics like costumes, emotes, and highlight intros cost currency. There are two primary currencies that hold essentially the same value, The gold one is called Lattice, which can be bought with real money, and the blue one is called a Unit, which can be earned by playing and completing challenges. Lattice can be exchanged 1:1 for Units, with $1 USD equating to 100 Lattice. You can only purchase Lattice in bundles, meaning you might have to overshoot to pay for something cheaper. I bought the Star-Lord <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 </em>costume, which cost 1800 Units, but the only bundle that would cover the cost was the $20 Lattice bundle. So just keep that in mind as you navigate buying in-game currency. Beyond those, there are also Chrono Tokens used specifically to unlock battle pass rewards that you’ll gain through events and tasks.</p><h2 id="h140249"><a id=""></a><strong>The battle pass is not time-gated</strong></h2><p>Speaking of battle passes, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is taking the FOMO out of its Luxury Battle Passes by allowing you to unlock their contents at any point as long as you purchase them during the season. The pass itself costs 490 Lattices and contains costumes and other cosmetic items. So if you plan on playing <em>Marvel Rivals </em>long-term and want to unlock everything in the battle pass but might have to take a break every now and then, you can just buy the battle pass and come back to it whenever you feel like it.</p><h2 id="h140250"><a id=""></a><strong>Here’s a free Iron Man skin</strong></h2><p>If you’re reading this before March 5, 2025, NetEase is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1864824576175128653&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1864824576175128653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giving out a free Iron Man skin</a></span>. Redeem the code nwarh4k3xqy in-game and deck out Tony Stark in the black-and-gold Armor Model 42.</p><h2 id="h140251"><a id=""></a><strong>Team-ups can give you an edge, but don’t feel pressured to pick heroes solely for them</strong></h2><p>One of the big distinguishing features of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is Team-Up abilities. These give certain heroe combinations an extra ability that can give you an advantage in a fight. Some are an extra ability in your back pocket like Adam Warlock giving Mantis and Star-Lord a second life, while others like Rocket and Jeff riding on Groot’s back and losing their independent movement in exchange for increased defense will fundamentally change how you play in some ways. These are great when they come up naturally and building your team composition around them is a good tactic. However, they are not the end-all-be-all of strategy in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Plenty of matches can be won without characters who are artificially meant to work better together. It’s all about reading the situation you’re in and sticking with characters you can play well enough to defeat the enemy team.</p><h2 id="h140252"><a id=""></a><strong>Be flexible</strong></h2><p>This rich coming from a Star-Lord one-trick. But do as I say, not as I do. Switching heroes is key to games like <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Overwatch</em>, but it’s very easy to get stuck on one character you really mesh with. However, if you’re losing a match and just can’t seem to get the upper hand, it might be time to switch. Part of the toxicity that permeates these games is the insistence that someone else on the team should switch off who they’re playing and a toxic player couldn’t possibly be the problem. The truth is, sometimes it’s not about player skill, some heroes are just not built for every situation. If the enemy team is playing Black Widow, having a bunch of airborne heroes she can easily clip the wings of is not going to win you the fight no matter how good you are. You can have your main, but take time to learn at least a few characters you can possibly swap to in a pinch.</p><h2 id="h140253"><a id=""></a><strong>You don’t need to cover every role, but you should always have a healer</strong></h2><p>Role spread is another contentious topic in hero shooters, as some fans like having the flexibility to create team compositions that don’t have to adhere to an equal 2-2-2 formation. At the moment, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t have a role queue that forces the team to pick two of each (Vanguard, Duelist, Strategist), but having at least one of each is a decent rule of thumb when deciding who to play. I had a team who was three duelists and three strategists and we did fine, though. However, the key role in all of this that you should make sure you have at least one (preferably more) of is the Strategist. Straight up, you’re not gonna win fights against a decent enemy team if you don’t have someone who can heal your teammates, and if the randos you group up with are unwilling to do so and you want any chance of winning, maybe consider swapping to one yourself. Yeah, that sometimes means you’ll end up babysitting, but if there’s no one to play the medic, nothing’s going to get done.</p><h2 id="h140254"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t trickle in</strong></h2><p>When you’re lost in the sauce and running on adrenaline after a chaotic fight, it’s easy to run out of spawn to try to get back in the scrap. Trouble is, if you and all your five teammates are doing that but aren’t dying at the same time, you’ll end up trickling in one by one for the enemy team to pick off as you enter their line of sight. If you and your team aren’t all grouped up and pushing an objective as a unit, you’ll get nowhere. Always try to move as a group, and if you are trying to lone-wolf it, make sure you have a plan like flanking the enemy team or surprising them with an ultimate.</p><h2 id="h140255"><a id=""></a><strong>Ultimate charge carries between rounds</strong></h2><p>One of the nice differences between <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Overwatch </em>is that Ultimate charge transfers between rounds. This means if you had your Ultimate ready to go or at least close to it in one round, you’ll still have the same percentage when the next round start. As an <em>Overwatch </em>player, it became a habit to use an ult at the end of a round because I might as well hear a cool voice line. It was almost celebratory on a winning round. I did that once in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>on launch night and realized I’d completely forgotten that I’d still have it when the loading screen between rounds was done. So use that to your advantage, as it can give you head start as you and the enemy team descend onto the next point.</p><h2 id="h140256"><a id=""></a><strong>For your sanity’s sake, group up with friends</strong></h2><p>This is a general good idea for most team-based multiplayer games. Grab at least a friend or two before you head online. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is a pretty chaotic game, even with a team of people on voice chat, and thus far I’ve had even less luck solo queuing than I typically have in <em>Overwatch</em>. I’ve always believed the notion of one person carrying in a team-based game to be a power fantasy that is rarely achievable, but it feels especially difficult to pull off in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>right now. Maybe matches will become more lopsided as players learn the game, but for now, try to find people you can coordinate with. You’ll have a much better experience that way.</p><hr><p>We’ll have a full review of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>up in the coming days, but for now, here’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920">our thoughts</a></span> on how NetEase’s comic book hero shooter stands against its obvious inspiration.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each turn (usually) lets you take two grabs, with those two lots of retrieved items used to attack and defend between enemy turns. Via that <em>Slay The Spire</em> model, you then choose map directions, and thus enter event rooms, literal gacha machine treasure spots, upgrade shops, and many other fights.</p><p>That’s the basics, but what makes <em>Dungeon Clawler</em> quite so interesting—beyond the central gimmick being ridiculously hooky (pun so bloody intended)—is that the Early Access game goes to so many other involving places, with a huge pile of novel twists and ideas. For instance, there’s water, and there’s honey. If honey gets into the large container, then swords and throwing stars and golden shields and poisonous knives will all get stuck together, which is great for getting a bunch of stuff at once, but bad if it’s too heavy for the claw and you get nothing. Then water (and other liquids) can fill the tank and dissolve the glue but make items usefully float at the top, and indeed fill weapons like sponges and water pistols, which is especially good if you poison the water in there…</p><div><h4>Buried Treasure</h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

Certain items are more powerful if gathered entirely alone, which makes you want to be more delicate with the claw, but giant handfuls of stuff at once can be a match-winner. You can upgrade items, making them more powerful, but also they can get bigger and so harder to pick up, so you’ll want to grab an ability that causes items to shrink. You can transmute items to have different material properties, such that wooden swords can become metallic and thus magnetic… And on and on and on. There are so many excellent details, letting you adjust your plans based on what you can gather, offering far more sophistication than the initial simple premise suggests.</p><p>So much of this is thanks to the excellent physics. They exude fairness, items flinging and clattering around in a way that makes natural sense, meaning you can have really good instincts about where to drop the claw, and when to close the pincers—and indeed why something might slip out or fly off, without feeling like you’ve been cheated.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-recommend-id="image://b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Stray Fawn Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-recommend-id="image://b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Right now, weeks into its Early Access, it already feels incredibly complete. However, there’s a good amount of balancing that needs doing. There are all manner of characters to play as, with unique starting conditions—bonus shield at the cost of health, for instance, or water-based skills for the loss of other abilities—and they unlock quickly and encourage experimentation, but pretty much all of them can hit the same brick wall of a particular enemy type. There’s one foe who doubles his damage each turn, and so without a particularly aggressive build, it’s pretty much game over if you encounter him too early; there’s just little chance you have shields at a point where you can cope. That sucks. He’s not alone in terms of being too OP, too early in a run, which is disappointing.</p><p>Yet, I play again. And again. And again. Unlike real-world claw machines, which are essentially a con designed to make small children miserable, here it’s a far more rewarding experience. The claws <em>are</em> weak, and so won’t hold a massive pile of large items, and they <em>do</em> swing wildly such that many an item will fly off as it lurches to the dropping area. But it’s not <em>fixed</em>, and there’s a strong sense of skill as well as luck in what you gather.</p><p>With a bit of tweaking to difficulty, it’d be hard to fault <em>Dungeon Clawler</em>. It absolutely mimics a million games that came before it, but the combination of a unique mechanic <em>and</em> so many interesting innovations of its own within the format means a game I figured would be just “that idea but with a claw machine” (which sounded good to me!) is actually something far more rounded, involving, and interesting in its own right. I just need to figure out how to stop playing. (Oh god, no, now I’m installing it on my phone…)</p><p><em>This article originally appeared on </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buried Treasure</a></span>, <em>a site dedicated to unearthing lesser-known indie games.

Each set will include 400 cards and a playmat with rule variants for more casual play and tournament settings. The tabletop companies say the physical edition has the “full support” of CD Projekt Red. </p><p>The beauty of Gwent was two-fold. First, it was perfectly integrated into the larger world of <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Monster slayer Geralt of Rivia could challenge opponents at the pub or in the royal court and wager money, collecting cards and expanding his reputation, including through a Gwent tournament with important ties to the narrative. Second, the game itself was thoughtful but streamlined, letting players bluff and deploy clever tactics without having to engage in some of the more convoluted TCG mechanics of a <em>Hearthstone</em> or <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="cea96d43113b6930442c55f5472b34d5" data-recommend-id="image://cea96d43113b6930442c55f5472b34d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2295" data-height="1291" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Renders of the physical Gwent cards are displayed.

While the project eventually spawned a single-player story-based game called <em>Thronebreaker</em>, the card game’s stalled growth and the studio’s other ambitious projects ultimately led it to be abandoned, first on console and then on PC and mobile as well. </p><p>What CDPR did do, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.si.com/videogames/news/gwent-the-witcher-card-game-final-update#:~:text=It's%20the%20end%20of%20an,year%20by%20the%20Polish%20developer.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/gwent-the-witcher-card-game-final-update#:~:text=It's%20the%20end%20of%20an,year%20by%20the%20Polish%20developer." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is not let the game simply die</a></span>, but instead keep the servers online and empower top players to continue tweaking the balance, to support fans who remained even if there was no new content or big update coming.

Maybe even with a few twists. In the meantime, it’s nice to know fans can immortalize their love of the niche card game with a real-life version. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
