              <p>A mistake we’ve all been making in our responses to the rise of AI slop is deriding it on the basis of its embarrassing mistakes and nauseating uncanniness. The reality is that the tech is improving at an astonishing rate, going from seventeen-fingered body horror images to borderline-convincing live-action film in just a couple of years. It will get better still, and all the while remain an uncreative and immoral act of plagiarism and wanton destruction of both the environment and creative jobs. So while a new AI-generated video doing the rounds showing a fake live-action trailer for a <em>Legend of </em><em>Zelda</em> movie might still have much to mock, that’s really not the issue here. The issue is how clearly it reveals the entire gen-AI grift.</p> <p>The self-named “PJ Ace,” CEO of [grits teeth] viral AI video company Genre.ai, has <a href="https://x.com/PJaccetturo/status/2008559114704875888">posted a thread to X</a> to boast about how he was able to make a trailer for a <em>Zelda</em> movie in just five days, and for only $300, using a suite of AI tools within Freepik. There’s so much to unpack here, but let’s start with the video itself.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo took 40 years to give us a Legend of Zelda movie.</p> <p>I made this in 5 days on a $300 budget. </p> <p>It looks like a $300M blockbuster.</p> <p>Let me show you how I made this in 5 simple steps inside of Freepik: 🧵 <a href="https://t.co/DgkdPDPyGA">pic.twitter.com/DgkdPDPyGA</a></p> <p>— PJ Ace (@PJaccetturo) <a href="https://twitter.com/PJaccetturo/status/2008559114704875888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You know, when it comes to making the most immediate criticism of the footage, I can’t really improve on the reaction from <em>New York Times</em> tech writer Mike Isaac:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">incredible narrative work if your audience largely lacks object permanence <a href="https://t.co/o5FSDY4Khr">https://t.co/o5FSDY4Khr</a></p> <p>— rat king 🐀 (@MikeIsaac) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/2009003874686996706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Like pretty much every so-called AI film you’ll see, characters will change their appearance from shot to shot, because generative AI has no concept of what it’s generating, and so cannot compare one moment to the next. Hence, despite some moments of utterly convincing photorealism, this whole two-minute slopfest makes no coherent visual sense. I mean, go ahead and pick your favorite fake actor who shows up throughout.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658176">© PJ Ace / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yet, as flawed as that is, this is <em>way</em> better than videos we were seeing just last year. These faces are at least similar (if still obviously different, from nose and mouth shape to complexion), given they’re all based on the same “reference material” (pictures of real actors who weren’t asked), and this element of the tech will also get better, fast.</p>

 <p>And let’s not be in denial. There are moments in this clip that are&nbsp;<em>really</em> impressive given that they were entirely created by computerized plagiarism. That’s in some part due to the fact that a human put a vague amount of effort in, rather than just leaving a machine to run away with its own delusions unguided, as “Ace” lays out in his thread. It did, after all, take five days to put together, and a whole bunch of money was spent on credits to speed up the processing. There are also moments that look embarrassingly poor, the sorts of things that would see a real trailer dragged across the internet until the film’s creators promised to go back and fix things.</p>

 <p>So, altogether it took $300, five days, three different AI tools, and one boiled ocean. And for what? No, seriously, for what?</p> <h2>Sloppy Drivel</h2> <p>I’m not going to argue this took away jobs. Pajamas Ace was never going to make this mock trailer if it involved standing up, let alone casting, lighting, make-up, set building, VFX, post-processing, editing rushes, and the huge amounts of money it would have taken to create the above <em>without</em> all the shitty bits. The bits like the awful-looking blood, crappy Moblin animation, that moment where Link looks like a cartoon at the end, and his apparently just shooting Ganon with a single arrow to win. Oh, and my favorite bit is when Link fires that arrow and, rather than the arrow moving, Link’s hand just explodes instead.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658189"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658189">© PJ Ace / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But of course, this is also all about the <em>potential</em> of destroyed jobs, of sacrificing hands-on creativity, human inspiration, improvisational talent, and tangible reality for the sake of sloppy drivel that superficially looks like cinema. You know every movie studio head is watching this garbage and having dollar signs appear in their eyes with a loud “ker-ching!” like they’re a cartoon pig, wondering how long it can be before they can do away with the pesky expenses of dolly grips, second-unit assistant directors, and most of all, those infuriating actors and directors with their heads full of ideas. This is about an existential threat to an entire industry.</p> <h2>Degenerative AI</h2> <p>Getting back to that original X post, let’s go through it line by line because it reveals so, so much about the AI-brainwormed:</p> <blockquote><p>“<span>Nintendo took 40 years to give us a Legend of Zelda movie.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Um, no, that’s not true&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. Nintendo didn’t want to make a&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie until very recently, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-movie-mario-switch-marvel-1851000791">announced this intention in 2023</a>. Last year <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-nintendo-lead-actors-benjamin-ainsworth-1851786373">we received casting information</a>, and toward the end of 2025 <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816">we saw sneak glimpses from filming</a>. The final film is <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-delay-date-nintendo-avengers-secret-wars-1851784080">due to be released in May 2027</a>, meaning short of any further delays, Nintendo will have taken <em>four</em> years to give us a&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie. Let alone that it’s silly to pretend the five days to make this rubbish would be comparable to the 40 years since&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> was created.</p>

 <blockquote><p><span>“I made this in 5 days on a $300 budget.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>A computer made it, with PJ rearranging AI-generated images using the likenesses of the movie’s real-world actors without permission. There wasn’t a “budget,” that was just how much he spent on tokens by the time it was done.</p> <blockquote><p><span>“It looks like a $300M blockbuster.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>It looks like an Uwe Boll movie trailer, lasting less than two minutes, with no discernible plot or character development. It in no sense, from any angle, looks like a $300 million blockbuster, and nor does it look like the trailer for one. It’s very technically impressive stuff given how dreadful gen-AI clips were a couple of years back, but that is very much it.</p>

 <p>And it’s all part of the grift. Scour X and you’ll find thousands of examples of people’s thrown-together gen-AI “trailers,” and precisely zero 110-minute movies. (Don’t actually scour X, to be clear, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/">because&nbsp;<em>fucking hell</em></a>.) This tech is only capable of creating the implication of something real and never the real thing itself. It’s a tissue-thin veneer, all promises and no delivery.</p> <p>A trailer is a promise of a movie to come. A gen-AI trailer is the final product; an empty, plotless, largely incoherent collection of striking clips, edited together in a way that matches our understanding of the language of trailers, and as such is engineered to tell our brains that it’s a taster of something far larger and more significant. It’s a con, a wheeze, and it’s always the act of those invested in the gen-AI industry rather than impassioned creators with a story to tell.</p> <p>These clips will get better and better, look more and more realistic, and the result will be a more convincing promise with exactly the same lack of any delivery. Our new friend PJ Ace and the legions of AI bros congratulating him in the replies on X won’t be going on to make a full-length movie using these tools, because that’s a whole different act, one born of creativity. Scanning a bunch of <em>Zelda</em> assets and a couple of actor’s faces, then arranging the results in the shape of something that reminds us of a trailer, is the opposite—it’s cynicism.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Leaked Synopsis Of The Next Life Is Strange Has Me Worried]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-5-reunion-chloe-max-summary-plot-leak-2000658198</link>
            <guid>1400749</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</span></i><span>, the latest game in the narrative-driven adventure game series,</span> <span>ended on a cliffhanger </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-max-chloe-1851685215"><span>in 2024</span></a><span>. It’s little surprise, then, that despite some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-strange-double-exposure-award-gdc-2025-layoffs-1851771282"><span>strife at developer Deck Nine Games</span></a><span>, it seems–based on a leaked PEGI rating that has been since yoinked off the rating board’s official site–to be getting a sequel. Despite Square Enix’s efforts to plug the leak, the </span><a href="https://x.com/DomTheBomb/status/2009008464127721907"><span>internet remembers all</span></a><span>, so we know the game is apparently going to be called </span><i><span>Life Is Strange: Reunion</span></i><span>, and we also know a bit about the game’s premise thanks to an accompanying synopsis. Some folks are probably celebrating what </span><i><span>Reunion</span></i><span> might entail, but I have questions.</span></p>  <p><span>The full summary that was removed from the PEGI site reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>So there’s a lot to unpack in these few sentences, but to get the obvious out of the way, the “reunion” the game’s title seems to refer to is one between Max and Chloe, the two leads of the original </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span>. At the end of that game, you make a choice that either sees Chloe die or sees the two ride off to an unknown future together, though if you choose the latter, the events of </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>find the two characters taking some time apart. The decision was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-chloe-relationship-1851673763"><span>unpopular with long-time fans</span></a><span>, but </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>did suggest that the two may reunite down the line, and even if I was bummed that Chloe wasn’t in the game, I admired </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span>’s commitment to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><span>respecting both endings</span></a><span> of the original. Now, however, it sounds like Chloe will be part of </span><i><span>Reunion</span></i><span>, perhaps regardless of whatever the player did in the 2015 original?</span></p>

 <p><span>The fact that Deck Nine had players import the Chloe choice into </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span> through an early dialogue option makes me hopeful the team isn’t just throwing away the possibility that Chloe died at the end of the first game in reaction to the backlash it got for omitting Max’s foul-mouthed, punk rock best (girl)friend. The line in the synopsis about Chloe being “haunted by nightmares and impossible memories” makes me wonder if some time travel nonsense could be used to make Chloe show up in </span><i><span>Reunion </span></i><span>even if you did choose the ending in which she dies. Perhaps these “impossible memories” are ones involving both versions of events? </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>has a lot of timeline jumping; maybe this could have affected Chloe as a character existing in many quantum states due to Max’s time traveling?</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case, games that undermine player choice are a pet peeve of mine, which is a big reason why I’m anxious about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><i><span>Mass Effect 5</span></i></a><i><span>. </span></i><span>There are a lot of fans who would be content if BioWare just declared one of the original trilogy’s final decisions canon and picked it up from there, so it seems like a real possibility, but I’m not one of them. It was encouraging to see Deck Nine make a big hoopla of maintaining </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span>’s continuity in </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span>, and I hope the team has put in the effort to carry it through to </span><i><span>Reunion </span></i><span>as well. Hopefully we don’t have to wait too long to find out more about this game. The thought of speculating about this for several months is already making my head hurt.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Jackass 5 Is Happening Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackass-5-is-happening-later-this-year-2000658174</link>
            <guid>1400698</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There is still some good left in this world. We’re getting a new, still officially untitled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/goat-trailer-fart-joke-jackass-sony-zootopia-funny-teaser-2000656133"><em>Jackass</em></a>, and we don’t have to wait a decade like last time. The new comedy is set to arrive in June.</p> <p>On January 8, <em>Jackass</em> ringleader Johnny Knoxville <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTPFikrEXfX/?img_index=1">posted the iconic skull and crutches logo</a> for the franchise on Instagram, with the date June 26 below it. In the text for the post, he confirmed that, yes, a new <em>Jackass</em> movie is a go. Expect lots of wild stunts, gross moments, and of course, some injuries.</p>   <p>“Well, a wang dang and hot damn doodle, we are starting the year off with a bang,” said Knoxville on Instagram. “We wanted to let you know that this summer, Jackass is back!! We will see you in theatres June 26th. More to come, but wanted you to hear it from us first!”</p> <p>That’s all the official information we have at the moment. We don’t know who is returning or which guest stars will be making an appearance in the upcoming comedy flick. In the last movie, 2022’s<em> Jackass Forever</em>, most of the original <em>Jackass</em> crew from the 2000s era TV show on MTV returned, with the notable exceptions of Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn. Margera has struggled with substance abuse issues for years, and while sober now, has had a rocky relationship with the <em>Jackass</em> crew and is likely not returning in the next film. Dunn sadly died in 2011. His last <em>Jackass</em> movie was 2010’s <em>Jackass 3. </em>For <em>Jackass Forever, </em>the crew also added some younger talent to help out. No word if they will be returning this time around.</p>

 <p>The <em>Jackass</em> franchise is a big success for Paramount, with the four main films, and the <em>Bad Grandpa</em> spin-off, bringing in over $560 million worldwide at the box office on relatively tiny budgets. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592">There was even a <em>Jackass</em> video game released in 2007. It was bad. Don’t play it.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-usb-c-hub-drops-below-10-this-5-in-1-adapter-is-selling-out-fast-on-amazon-2000657275</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do you find yourself routinely trying to improve your computer setup, but you have too many cables to make it feasible? You might want to think about getting a multiport. They’re affordable, and thanks to the deal we’ve located, you can get one even cheaper than usual. Plus, you can set up your workstation using just a single USB-C port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">Get the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport at Amazon for only $9.99 (from $15.99), which is a $6 discount and approximately 38% in savings</a>. For this price, you can buy a few and change up all your computer stations just for the sake of keeping things consistent.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An affordable way to improve your compact PC setup</h2>
<p>Here’s how it works. This multi-port adapter instantly adds additional ports to your existing device’s USB-C port when plugged in. When connected via USB-C you can add peripherals like a keyboard, a mouse, a flash drive or external hard drive to your central device, all without needing to swap cables every few minutes. It can essential help turn thin laptops and tablets into more powerful desktop setups when needed. For example, it’s useful whether you’re moving between a home office, a classroom or coffee shop.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can connect your device to a monitor, television or projector for a better viewing experience on a larger screen. This is beneficial for watching movies on a larger screen, displaying slides in a professional environment or extending your display to keep multiple windows open simultaneously.</p>



<p>As compact as they are, most hubs are designed to direct cable flow away from your hands to maintain a clean and organized workspace. The small and lightweight design of the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport makes it easy to fit into a laptop case or backpack pocket and allows you to take it wherever you go without giving it a second thought. Most importantly, this is the type of accessory you’ll likely forget about until you truly need a USB port or an external display, and then you’ll be happy it is available.</p>
<p>We’ve lined out the reasons why, so it’s probably obvious by now, but this USB-C hub can make for a super useful gift or addition to anyone’s PC setup. It’s a practical and affordable upgrade that gives you plenty of space to work with when it comes to compact setups. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">And perhaps most importantly, it’s just $9.99</a>. That’s super affordable, and well worth picking up whether you shop for yourself or others as a gift. Anyone can appreciate the gift of efficiency, especially in a world where complex computing can be the norm.</p>

<h2>Efficient Performance for All Your Tasks</h2>
<p>The HP EliteBook 6 G1a is the successor to the top-rated EliteBook 665. This machine runs on the fast and efficient AMD Ryzen 5&nbsp;220 processor with a 3.2GHz base clock, boost speeds up to 4.9GHz, six cores, and 16MB of L3 cache.

Speaking of video calls, the built-in 5MP camera paired with Poly Studio tuned speakers with AI Noise Reduction makes those a breeze. You will look your best, plus be heard properly as well. What’s more, 400 nits of brightness, paired with the anti-glare coating, ensure visibility in all lighting conditions, whether you’re streaming a movie at night or working on a school assignment while soaking up some sun. Additionally, low blue light emission makes it easy to use the screen for extended periods without compromising your eye health.</p>
