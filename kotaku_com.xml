Health is basically zero. I need help. So I step past a demonic dog and enter a dark, ominous bathroom. I quickly knock on the lone stall inside. It creaks open, I hear...something inside and then a single soda can rolls out. Instead of drinking it, however, I gamble, and knock again. And once again it rolls me a soda. I don’t press my luck, instead returning to the aforementioned evil dog and giving it one of my soda pops. It chugs it and, in exchange, lets me reload my weapons faster. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195189" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="212" data-playlist="195189,196131,195410" data-current="195189"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20647.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After that, it’s right back to the action of running for my life from a pixelated burning apartment while fighting cultists using a revolver, melee items, and my foot. It’s all very weird, but it’s also a blast, and I keep returning to play more <em>Cruel</em>, even though I keep dying over and over. </p><p>Over the last few years we’ve seen the rise of the boomer shooter subgenre of FPS games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571">Stuff like <em>Cultic, Dusk, Fashion Police Squad</em>, and <em>40K Boltgun</em></a></span> all look like older <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-shooters-2022-pc-destiny-warzone-fortnite-apex-1849853877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-shooters-2022-pc-destiny-warzone-fortnite-apex-1849853877">shooters</a></span> from the ‘90s, but often leverage new technology and decades of game design to create shooters that feel retro, but fresh. The latest of these boomer shooters to catch my attention with its fast-paced, roguelike action is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cruel</em>, out now on Steam</a></span>. </p><p>In <em>Cruel</em>, you play as someone trapped in a building that is burning floor by floor. Like any good character from a ‘90s-era FPS you are always running, which is helpful in this case as the fire will kill you quick if you linger. Each floor of the building is filled with cultists, evil ghosts, and soda machines. These machines will heal you if you need it, or you can use the soda to upgrade your character between floors. </p><p>And you’ll need those upgrades, as each floor gets harder and introduces new enemies with better weapons. And if you drink all your soda, well, you can always gamble in the bathroom and hope the evil monster in there gives you a soda and doesn’t jumpscare you and kill you where you stand. Like I said, it’s a weird experience. </p><p>But <em>Cruel’s </em>oddball setup isn’t what keeps me coming back to the game death after death. Instead, it’s the game’s crisp, responsive, and retro-inspired FPS combat. Guns are loud. Enemies pop when you get that perfect headshot. And one mistake can end a perfect run. Then again, if you use all the tools <em>Cruel</em> provides you with—slides, kicks, and melee weapons—you can often improvise your way out of a bad situation. </p><p><em>Cruel </em>reminds me of last year’s <em>Anger Foot</em>, but with better combat and a crunchier, more boomer shooter-inspired aesthetic. The soundtrack is a banger to boot. Oh, and if you click the reload button when your gun has full ammo, your character flips it in the area. 10 out of 10. Love it! </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At only $10 and under 400MB</a></span>, <em>Cruel </em>is a perfect bite-sized FPS to kick the new year off with, just don’t gamble too much in the bathroom.

The PS5 is over four years old now. If you’ve been playing since launch, there’s a good chance you’ve earned a bunch of achievements across all of the games you’ve played, and mementos from those milestones are clogging up your SSD. I knew my PS5 was doing this but I didn’t realize just how much space it was taking up. </p><p>Fortunately, I came across <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hxngn2/psa_by_default_the_console_saves_a_14_second_clip/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hxngn2/psa_by_default_the_console_saves_a_14_second_clip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this really helpful PSA by user wolfgang784</a></span> over on the PlayStation 5 subreddit today. “Just found over 2200 videos while trying to free up space and wondering why my media folder was so big,” the thread reads. Wolfgang784 points out that the PS5 records and stores a 15-second clip of your gameplay every time a trophy pops. If you aren’t vigilant, all of those clips can add up quick. Here’s how to fix that:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Turn on your PS5</li><li>Go to the gear icon on the far right of the home screen to access settings</li><li>Choose the storage option and open up the media folder</li><li>toggle over to the trophy category and then select all and hit delete</li></ol><figure id="" data-id="65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-recommend-id="image://65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips. " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-recommend-id="image://65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like I said, it’s a very simple fix that’s easy to overlook. At least that’s what I tell myself to explain why I never noticed this until now. Usually I’m sorting through albums for various games trying to figure out what precious clips I want to delete to try and win back one precious gigabyte here and another there from my precious SSD space. In addition to everything else, the dedicated trophy section of the media folder makes it easy to quickly nuke a ton of footage without worrying.</p><p>After that, you can go and change the settings for what’s recorded when you earn a trophy. It can be just a screenshot, or you can limit captures to only gold or platinum trophies. If you’re serious about documenting all of that stuff, then by all means feel free to hang onto it or move it to an external drive before purging. I am not, and instantly got back 7GB of storage. </p><p>That’s not much when it comes to behemoth game file sizes like <em>Destiny 2 </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, but as someone who recently went through their digital collection and downloaded a ton of stuff I’ve never played, 7GB is enough to install half a dozen smaller indie games or older PlayStation classics. One of these days I’ll install a bigger SSD. Until then, thank you, wolfgang784, for the super useful tip. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A big install base is a big install base. But usually, this far into a console’s lifespan, you might get, say, one or two new games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For example, in 2018</a></span>—12 years after the PlayStation 3 launched—we got two new PS3 games, and one was <em>FIFA 19. </em></p><p>What we’re seeing with the PS4 in its 12th year is unlike anything in modern gaming history. Nearly two dozen games, at least, are set to arrive on PS4 this year, and not all of them are sports games or old ports. Some are brand new remasters, others are smaller 2D titles, and some are big AAA games like <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> and <em>Elden Ring Nightreign.</em> </p><h2 id="h199632"><a id=""></a>Console generations aren’t the same as before</h2><p>And before someone jumps on me for suggesting PS4 games launching in 2025 is a bad thing, let me be clear: I’m not saying that. Most AAA video game studios have moved on to more powerful hardware, so I don’t think the industry is being held back by the PS4 (or the Xbox One, for that matter, which is also getting new games.)</p><p>The reality is that in 2025, the video game industry and market are very different than they once were. Back in the era of the PS2 and even PS3, tech was advancing rapidly from 2D to 3D to HD to 4K. New consoles felt more necessary every few years. That’s not the case in 2025. </p><p>The PS4 is still a fairly capable machine, especially for indie devs or people making smaller games or RPGs using pre-established tools and tech. And thanks to digital marketplaces, you don’t need to stock your game at Walmart to sell copies. It also helps that modern engines like Unreal and Unity are very scalable and flexible, so a single game can run on Switch, PS4, PS5, and even mobile devices. </p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that some of the most popular games around right now—<em>Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, Genshin Impact, Overwatch 2, GTA Online, Minecraft, </em>and <em>Roblox</em>—are all on PS4, and still receive updates each month. There’s a giant group of players who don’t feel the need to move on because the big games they play every week are still active and alive on PS4, so it’s not shocking that devs are still making plenty of games for the 12-year-old console in 2025. </p><p>The real question now is whether the PS4 can last longer than the PS2. I think it can. Even if, come next year, we only see half as many PS4 games launch as we get in 2025, that’ll still be over 10. We might even be getting PS4 games up until and beyond the launch of a theoretical PS6. Wild stuff. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the podcast episode, Stiller implies they were working on <em>Severance </em>before the streamer’s existence was publicly announced, as he described the early experience as “developing this show for a platform that didn’t exist yet.” What we didn’t know at the time the series order made news is that Apple wasn’t convinced Scott should be Mark, and a year went by with no new developments on the show because they were trying to figure out how to get Apple on board with Scott starring.</p><p> “There was a long process of talking about other ideas. But, really, I was not going to do the show if [Scott] wasn’t going to do it. I kept saying that to them, and they were like, ‘Okay, maybe you’ll think of this actor. Maybe you’ll think of that actor,’” Stiller recalls. </p><p>Stiller was confused as to why the bigwigs at Apple were dragging their feet on accepting Scott, but changed their minds once they saw Scott read for the part. Taking it all in stride, Scott humbly admits his star power might not have been enough for the Apple head honchos. “I understood why they were feeling this way because, the first time I read this script, my first instinct was: ‘There’s no way I’m going to end up doing this. This is too good,’” Scott explains. “If I was Apple, I would likely be wanting a giant star to play this role.”</p><p>Since Apple came to their senses, Scott has gone on to garner an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe nomination for Beat Actor in a Television Series — Drama for his impeccable portrayal of Mark on <em>Severance. </em>Apple were saved from themselves, and we all have Stiller and his year-long persistence to thank for it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
