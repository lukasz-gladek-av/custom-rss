              <p>Sonos guards its pricing religiously throughout the year and refuses to discount even when competitors slash their prices for random sales events. Black Friday on Amazon is<strong> the only time Sonos loosens its grip on retail prices</strong>, and the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">Beam (second gen) soundbar just dropped to a new record low of $349, down from its usual $499</a>. Only 16 units remain in stock for the black color at the time of writing, which tells you how quickly people are grabbing this deal.</p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos in a Compact Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>Beam soundbar packs Dolby Atmos processing into a soundbar that measures just 25.6 inches wide</strong>, which means it fits under most TVs without dominating your entertainment center. Atmos creates a three-dimensional sound effect that places audio above, around, and beside you instead of just firing sound from the front. The soundbar uses psychoacoustic processing to bounce sound off your ceiling and walls and creates the impression of height channels without installing speakers overhead. Explosions in action movies feel like they’re happening above you, rain sounds fall from the ceiling, and helicopters pass convincingly overhead.</p>



<p>Sonos engineered the Beam soundbar with <strong>dedicated drivers for different frequency ranges</strong> including a center tweeter that’s specifically responsible for crystal-clear dialogue reproduction. The clarity of the dialogue is enormously important in modern content, where mumbling actors and aggressive sound mixing often bury conversations under music and effects. The bass response is full of lively low-end that doesn’t require a separate subwoofer, although Sonos does let you add their Sub if you want room-shaking bass when watching movies or listening to music.</p>



<p><strong>Setup, from unboxing to content with better audio, takes about five minutes</strong>. You connect one HDMI cable from the soundbar to your TV’s eARC or ARC port, plug in the power cable, and the Sonos app will walk you through the rest. Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to analyze your room’s acoustics and then auto-adjusts the soundbar’s output to compensate for room size, furniture placement, and wall materials.</p>
<p>The Beam soundbar streams music, podcasts, radio, and audiobooks from just about every major service when your TV is off. You can use it as a dedicated music speaker throughout the day, then seamlessly switch to TV audio in the evening. AirPlay 2 support allows for direct streaming from an Apple device, while the Sonos app provides access to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, and dozens of other services. For voice control, you can use Alexa or Google Assistant built directly into the soundbar, adjusting volume, changing inputs, or controlling playback with ease and without the touch of a remote.</p>
<p>Because of HDMI-CEC, <strong>your TV remote controls the Beam soundbars’s volume automatically</strong> and saves you from having to juggle multiple remotes or programming universal controllers. The soundbar responds immediately to the volume buttons on your existing remote after you set it up, which makes the whole system feel integrated rather than cobbled together.</p>
<p>At $349, the latest Beam soundbar is $150 off its usual price and undercuts a number of competing soundbars that offer similar features but notably worse sound quality. Sonos rarely discounts its products because they’re worth their full value based on performance alone, but this Black Friday deal is a real doozy.</p>

              <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s partnership with Disney has brought it some extraordinary crossover events, not least <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142">the current chapter’s enormous&nbsp;<em>Simpsons</em> tie-in</a>. But you haven’t seen anything yet: After Chapter 6 reaches its big finale at the end of this month, Chapter 7 is going to introduce the most unlikely property yet: Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Kill Bill</em>. In fact, it seems like it might be going far further than that, filling in a gap in the legendary movie’s lore by recreating a lost scripted chapter, Yuki’s Revenge, that was never shot for the film. This is all right in time to promote the cinematic re-release of both movies in one, the four hour and 41 minute <a href="https://kotaku.com/kill-bill-whole-bloody-affair-return-theaters-december-4-hour-tarantino-2000631123"><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em></a>.</p> <p>Yuki’s Revenge was a chapter written in the original script for <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em>, but was never shot for the movie. It was originally going to be Chapter 5 (I know, it’s confusing, both&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Kill Bill </em>use chapters), and <a href="https://kill-bill.livejournal.com/357796.html">you can read the original script here</a>. The scene would have starred Gogo Yubari’s sister, Yuki, who went entirely unmentioned in the released movie, and was originally going to hunt down The Bride to avenge her sister’s death. Well, now, as improbable as this feels to type, it seems the events could finally play out in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>?</p>

 <p>Chapter 7’s first promotional poster (above) has a picture of <em>Kill Bill</em> characters Gogo Yubari and The Bride, accompanied by a shades-wearing Fishstick, along with the words “The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge” before “Fortnite After Dark.” An <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRQXUuwgZjX/">official Instagram post</a> says the same, but this time has Yubari and Peely, because we officially live in the weirdest timeline.</p>   <p>Tarantino and The Bride actor Uma Thurman showed up to an event last night which <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15308673/Uma-Thurman-Kill-Bill-T-shirt-reunites-Quentin-Tarantino.html"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> confusingly describes as “the premiere” of <em>The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge</em>, and the pair were photographed in front of a huge <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>banner promoting the Chapter 7, alongside a model of the movie’s Pussy Wagon. Although exactly what this event really was is peculiarly unclear, with outlets like <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> and&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em> not even having articles about it. Have they filmed the scene? Will it be part of the new seven minute animated sequence that’s being added to the theatrical release of the movie double-bill? It’s all bewildering. We have, of course, reached out to Epic to try to find out more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quentin Tarantino poses by the "P*ssy Wagon" at the "Fortnite Chapter 7" event in LA. <a href="https://t.co/reOwxBjUqH">pic.twitter.com/reOwxBjUqH</a></p> <p>— Variety (@Variety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1991302219904479362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Whether this recreation of the missing chapter will be a storyline event within the game, or some sort of live event taking place on the in-game big screens, is also unknown at this point. What seems fairly certain is that Chapter 7 will feature <em>Kill Bill</em> skins and characters, and we can only assume lots of long swords.</p> <p>However, it also seems The Bride will be showing up sooner than that, as part of Chapter 6’s big finale live event. A new trailer shows her arriving on her motorbike admidst the ludicrous confusion of King Kong, Godzilla, <em>Star Wars</em> X-Wings, and a mostly naked Homer Simpson throwing a giant donut. <em>Fortnite</em>, everyone! That’s all taking place November 29, 2 p.m. ET.</p>
