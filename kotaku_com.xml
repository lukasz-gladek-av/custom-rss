              <p>Things get so busy during day-to-day life because there’s always something new to tackle. A great computer or tablet can make juggling it all a little less frustrating.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a single 2-in-1 device that provides the ability to perform real-world work and has the qualities of a tablet, the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/ Tablet (2024) is that choice. This 13-inch Copilot+ PC comes with a very clear, interactive touch-screen that converts to a canvas, notebook and full laptop upon attaching a keyboard. With the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024), you can replace an old laptop and a tablet with one light weight device that is highly versatile.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/">You can purchase the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) on Amazon today for $989.99 which is $510 less than the original price of $1,499.99 or 34% off.</a></p>

<h2>A flexible laptop and tablet hybrid for plenty of use cases</h2>
<p>Your first impression of the device will be of the 13-inch touch-screen display. The large 13 inch screen allows for ample amounts of viewing area for multiple applications open at the same time, viewing high definition images and reading comfortably. The clarity of the text is excellent, colors appear vibrant for creative professionals, and the aspect ratio of the display offers a wide viewable area for viewing web pages and documents; even watching movies. Additionally, you can use all the normal gestures of a tablet such as tapping, swiping, and pinching, and, when you need to utilize the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet as a more conventional laptop, simply place it upright using the built-in kick stand. When paired with a Surface keyboard and Surface Pen, you create a perfect combination for writing and sketching that still makes for a convenient and portable solution to pack in a backpack.</p>



<p>It’s super easy to change form factors if you’re looking to use the Surface Pro 2-in-1 to its full potential. You can use it flat as a tablet to read books, annotate PDF files, or draw pictures. But you can also tilt the Surface Pro 2-in-1 upright with the the kick stand to watch videos, join online meeting/video conferencing sessions, etc., and attach the Surface keyboard when you need to type.</p>
<p>All told, the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) has everything most users need to be a super flexible device. It’s the perfect alternative to an iPad or other on-the-go laptop and tablet, and you won’t have to go broke picking one up if you need that kind of versatility. We suggest picking it up now before it’s all sold out, because you might not see this Surface at such a price point again for some time.</p>
