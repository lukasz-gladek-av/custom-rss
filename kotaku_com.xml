            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony is shutting Bluepoint Games down <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">just five years after buying it</a>. Hermen Hulst said the decision was the result of an “increasingly challenging industry environment” in a note to staff on Thursday. It’s a shocking end for a studio that Hulst himself admits “delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community” and comes despite a recent jump in profits for Sony’s gaming division.</p> <p>“I wanted to share an update from the Studio Business,” the message, a copy of which was viewed by<em> Kotaku</em>, began. “As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within PlayStation Studios. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> launched to critical and commercial success, <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>MLB The Show</em> continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.”</p>

 <p>It continued:</p> <blockquote><p>At the same time, we’re operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p> <p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We’ve taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p> <p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p> <p>While I know this is hard news to hear, I’m confident in the direction we’re headed. Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for FY26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead. Thank you for your hard work and continued support.</p></blockquote> <p>The message will likely <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404">give some fans a feeling of whiplash</a>. It mentions the need for tough cost-cutting before immediately praising Bluepoint’s work. Its most recent games, a PS5 remake of <em>Demon’s Souls</em> and a PS4 remake of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, were both critically acclaimed. Sony reported in 2021 that <em>Demon’s Souls</em> sold 1.4 million copies in the hardware’s launch year.</p> <p>Instead of continuing to have Bluepoint remaster or remake popular classics, a strategy which has proven very lucrative for Capcom with <em>Resident Evil</em> and Bethesda with <em>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</em>, the Texas-based studio was put on a live-service spin-off of <em>God of War</em> which ended up being canned in early 2025. The great irony now is that Sony is finally remaking the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy but is about to close the most obvious candidate for the job. Bluepoint was one of the co-development partners on 2022’s <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>.</p>

 <p>And despite larger industry headwinds, Sony recently posted impressive profits. While overall sales across the gaming division were down year-over-year, profits for PlayStation last quarter <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ghost-of-yotei-outperforms-ghost-of-tsushima-to-bolster-sony-financials">rose 19 percent</a>. It even revised its forecast for the current quarter upwards. Bluepoint is the third recently acquired game studio Sony has shuttered in less than two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/witcher-game-ending-cdpr-cd-projekt-red-geralt-2000671408</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Artur Ganszyniec’s 26-episode, 40-hour-long <a href="https://youtu.be/fwRtKBkq0N8?si=7_ARugH5g6fJwuER">playthrough of the first game</a> in </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span> trilogy has finally come to an end, but the game developer, who served as lead story designer on the 2007 game, waited until the final five minutes of his trip down memory lane to drop the juiciest piece of info regarding its development. According to Ganszyniec, the writers at CD Projekt Red were “not really” involved in the creation of its final cutscene, and this “mistake” ultimately forced the team to take </span><i><span>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings’</span></i><span> story in a completely different direction.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/original-witcher-story-lead-says-the-surprise-twist-at-the-end-was-a-mistake-because-instead-of-focusing-on-geralt-the-sequel-was-forced-into-a-story-about-witchers-who-are-killing-kings-for-some-reason/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, Ganszyniec decided to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/fwRtKBkq0N8?si=sMosOYVsDO_lHmR_&amp;t=5417"><span>reveal this information</span></a><span> as the final cutscene in </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span> began to play. Those of you with good memories might remember that the game ends with the attempted assassination of King Foltest. After killing the would-be assassin, Geralt discovers that the culprit was a fellow witcher. This leads directly into the start of the second game, where we find Geralt locked up for his suspected part in the assassination.</span></p>

  <p><span>Turns out, Ganszyniec had no hand in writing the final cutscene. “The script for this…it was created not really involving the story team. So it was sort of, we weren’t really paying attention. And that was a mistake, I think.” As he explains, this is why the “open question” surrounding Geralt’s future that’s presented in the narrated section, which precedes the animated cutscene doesn’t match up with the conclusion. “Someone decided, like the board decided, or [CD Projekt co-founder] Michał Kiciński decided, that we needed an animated outro of the game.”</span></p> <p><span>This does explain why Geralt has suddenly teleported back to Vizima at the end of the game. The disconnect between Dandelion posing the open-ended question, “What then happened to the witcher?” in the closing narration and an ending cutscene that immediately answers said question also now makes sense, as the writers clearly intended for this to provide setup for something else entirely. On the plus side, Ganszyniec doesn’t seem bitter about the change, as he rounded off his playthrough by voicing his excitement for Fool’s Theory’s upcoming remake of </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span>. “Let’s hope that the remake will be a really good game.”</span></p>

              <p><span>I guess </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>in the year </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6 </span></i><span>is coming out</span></a><span>, there are worse days for </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span>, the long-awaited sequel to the 2019 deckbuilding roguelike, to enter Early Access. But dang, Mega Crit sure picked a packed day to release this early build. The studio announced that </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2 </span></i><span>will come to Steam on March 5, the same day </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-free-demo-beta-weekend-server-slam-2000668383"><i><span>Marathon</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-ghost-pikachu-peakychu-cloud-island-2000669710"><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>are launching. For a lot of folks, those games might not overlap, but if you’re interested in more than one of them, you’ll have to make some choices about how you spend your day.</span></p> <p><span>The announcement comes with a pretty slick animated trailer showing its various class characters kicking ass, but there’s also a bit of gross fantasy violence in there, so viewer discretion is advised if you’re squeamish.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Check out the trailer below:</span></p>   <p><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> was originally supposed to come to Early Access last year before being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-2-is-now-a-2026-release-but-dont-blame-hornet-2000625257"><span>delayed into March late last year</span></a><span>. The team at Mega Crit said this was due to a combination of personal life disruptions and just a desire to add more to the sequel before it got into player’s hands., though they were also clear that it was not part of the spree of delays that came about as a result of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span> finally getting a release date.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There’s no single dramatic reason,” the announcement read. “Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone’s okay!), we kept saying ‘wouldn’t it be cool if…’ one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards.” Thus another six months development before the game reaches players.”</span></p> <p><span>But the wait is nearly over now. The original </span><i><span>Slay the Spire </span></i><span>launched in 2019 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-is-a-roguelike-card-game-and-im-hooked-1822608254"><span>after its own Early Access period</span></a><span>, and is considered one of the progenitors of the deckbuilding roguelike genre and a major player in its popularity in the years that followed. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sf2-monster-strike-gacha-yoshiki-okamoto-2000671367</link>

              <p>Making games requires testing them. For microtransaction-fueled gacha games, that means putting your own money on the line to sample the merchandise. That’s apparently what led <em>Street Fighter 2</em> producer Yoshiki Okamoto to spend over $500,000 of his own money on his own game’s loot boxes.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-strike-is-the-free-to-play-conquering-japan-1708368978"><em>Monster Strike</em></a> is one of Japan’s most lucrative gacha games and it’s one Okamoto helped create after leaving Capcom in the early aughts. You shoot monsters into one another to earn points and buy lottery tickets to acquire stronger characters. The mobile hit peaked a few years ago but has brought in over <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/monster-strike-surpasses-11bn-in-11-years-with-japanese-dominance/">$8 billion in lifetime</a> revenue. It almost singlehandedly saved the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/business/international/monster-strike-gives-former-social-media-giant-mixi-a-second-act.html">social media company Mixi</a> and spawned Nintendo spin-offs and anime adaptations.</p>

 <p>All of which is to say it’s made Okamoto, whose old startup had been failing before that, pretty rich. He recently <a href="https://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2026/02/14/articles/20260214s00041000066000c.html">told Fuji TV</a> (via <em><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-capcom-producer-spends-over-500000-per-account-on-his-own-gacha-games-to-understand-the-feelings-of-high-spenders/">Automaton</a></em>) that <em>Monster Strike</em>‘s unexpected success led him to go from trying to eat on only two dollars a day to making over $7.81 million a year at his new company, Deluxe Games. Prior to that, Okamoto was known for his work at Capcom and Konami, including the arcade shoot ’em up <i>Gun.Smoke</i> that inspired <em>Red Dead Revolver</em>.</p> <p>But a surprising amount of that money was sunk back into his games so he could experience them like a player would. Those include <a href="https://www.dxg.jp/en/game/">newer releases</a> like last year’s <em>Meteor Arena Stars</em> and <em>Outrankers</em>. Okamoto said he does this to understand the feelings of fans who are spending tons of money and to keep the whales satisfied and coming back. Too stingy and they’ll get mad. Too generous and they’ll get bored.</p>

 <p>He suggested in a <a href="https://x.com/shO8KZ6buaRrqq4/status/2023081539199029457?s=20">follow-up post on X</a> that this would be impossible if he just used admin privileges to unlock all the rewards in his games automatically. Yes, sounds terrible. Definitely not something players would ever want. Who wants to play if you can’t pay?</p>
