It still isn’t a perfect device, but it’s one with potential that continues to grow, and that means you’re likely to be spending more and more time with yours. As such, you may be draining your battery a bit faster, eh?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s true—the PlayStation Portal’s battery life is actually pretty decent out of the box, promising between 7-9 hours on average. But if you’re on an extended trip somewhere with no ability to charge it, you may want to try extending that life even further. Here are some tips for extending the battery life on your PlayStation Portal.</p><h2 id="h2740"><a id="brightness"></a>Reduce screen brightness</h2><p>This one is a no-brainer. The brighter you keep your screen, the faster your battery will drain. If you’re in a dark room, you should be able to keep the brightness close to its lowest setting, but you may need to increase it again to see the screen in well-lit locations.</p><p>The brightness setting can be accessed on your quick settings tabs, or you can go into Settings &gt; Display and Brightness. You’ll want to do that anyway for the next trick.</p><h2 id="h2741"><a id="light"></a>Turn off the light bar</h2><p>The light bar around the rim of the PlayStation Portal controller looks cool, but it can drain your battery a bit. Since the light doesn’t serve any purpose beyond proof that your device is on, it may be worth disabling altogether.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness to turn this feature off. While you’re there, you can also disable the mute button light, though I doubt that tiny light affects the battery much, if at all.</p><h2 id="h2742"><a id="haptics"></a>Turn off the haptics and trigger effects</h2><p>It goes without saying that the PlayStation Portal’s haptic feedback and trigger effects are awesome, but they can also contribute to battery drain in games that frequently use it (this is also true of the PS5’s DualSense controllers). </p><p>If you head to Settings &gt; Controller, you adjust the intensity of these features. I’d recommend turning them all the way off if your goal is to save as much battery as possible, but even just reducing their intensity will help a little.</p><h2 id="h2743"><a id="restmode"></a>Set a reasonable time for entering Rest Mode</h2><p>Lastly, make sure you set a reasonable time for the PlayStation Portal to enter Rest Mode, which will turn the screen off and reduce the amount of power it’s using when you’re not actively using it.</p><p>To adjust this feature, head into Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery. The best time setting would be 30 seconds, but even somewhere around 1-2 minutes should help you reduce battery drain when you’re away from the handheld. </p><p>With all of these settings changed, you should save some battery life on your PlayStation Portal. That means more time to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615"><em>Astro Bot</em>’s new Christmas level</a></span>!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Which, on its face, sounds like someone fell over in the Ubisoft supply closet. But it doesn’t end there, because if you want to play, you have to have an NFT!</p><p>These take the form of Niji Warrior cards, which can be bought via the game’s website, where—like in all normal games—you then have to sign in to your “wallet.” This is where your pretend money and pictures are kept, and in this case it wants you to use something called Eden Online, Ubisoft’s own in-universe creation. (You can also sign into Coinbase or Walletconnect, but not being a crypto-bro, I have no such things.) So, because I actually <em>am</em> an incredible games journalist, I let the thing hook into my personal Gmail account. This apparently generated a wallet I could associate with the account, meaning I was able to “enter the photobooth.”</p><figure id="" data-id="a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-recommend-id="image://a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1126" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-recommend-id="image://a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1126" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here, having repeatedly been told I could “reveal” my card, I was rerouted to a website called magiceden.io, a somehow-surviving NFT “marketplace,” where I discovered that all the 10,000 free options to “mint” a card had already been taken. But I need my Niji Warrior card to be able to play! So, as I read about how this “expanding the universe of the Netflix series” was “built on the Arbitrum blockchain,” and how these “10,000 AI-generated NFTs evolve based on your performance and involvement, unlocking exclusive access to in-game assets, governance rights, and perks tied to iconic Ubisoft franchises like Assassin’s Creed, Rayman and Splinter Cell,” I wondered if it was all too late.</p><p>Only here, on a non-Ubisoft site, written in small print within a section ironically entitled “Vision,” does it reveal that the “mint” is part of an “Early Access for Niji Warrior holders,” the “full launch” happening in 2025, despite the game being listed as out all over Ubisoft’s site and store. It seems we now have to click through to the “Collection” to buy one of them from someone else. Suddenly I’m thinking of Egyptian architects for some reason.</p><figure id="" data-id="19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-recommend-id="image://19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-recommend-id="image://19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I cannot emphasize enough that Ubisoft’s sites imply that you simply “Reveal” your ID card, with no mention of money, no mention that you will need to buy cryptocurrency to have any way to play the actual game.</p><p>Speaking of playing the game, I figured I’d try that instead and see what could be done without shattering my crypto virginity. The first few tries, after discovering that Ubisoft Connect had, of course, yet again forgotten all my login credentials since the last time I was forced to use it, ended in error messages.</p><figure id="" data-id="b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-recommend-id="image://b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1100" data-height="262" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-recommend-id="image://b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1100" data-height="262" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I was told the game was “Unable to start download (Code: 17006)“ and also “(Code: 17017).” The link to the support page told me to visit the “Live Feed Update section on Ubisoft Help,” linking to the latter. The Ubisoft Help page has no Live Feed Update section. This is really very good.</p><p>Then, as I was about to write that up, another attempt saw the game successfully download! (For some reason, it refused to acknowledge my two gaming SSDs in its list of install drives.) It was here! I clicked to launch, and here’s my favorite screenshot of the game so far:</p><figure id="" data-id="71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-recommend-id="image://71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A black screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-recommend-id="image://71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, OK, that’s not fair. It clearly failed to load the first time. I gave it another go.</p><figure id="" data-id="0150ef9d58b9ab3c5e0a828dd3714698" data-recommend-id="image://0150ef9d58b9ab3c5e0a828dd3714698" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Access token was not found!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Access token was not found!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0150ef9d58b9ab3c5e0a828dd3714698" data-recommend-id="image://0150ef9d58b9ab3c5e0a828dd3714698" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Access token was not found!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So no, you can’t even see a menu screen before you allow yourself to become embroiled in the murky, barely regulated underground world of crypto scams. </p><p>The cheapest card you can buy right now is 0.0037 ETH, which works out to $12.06. The most expensive is (oh my actual god) 50 ETH, or $162,975.50.</p><p>Damn, I’m just those two quarters short.</p><p>Oh! And if you thought, “Well, 12 bucks, I could maybe just suck it up and take a look,” the minimum amount it appears to be possible to add to a wallet is $21!</p><p>I cannot tell you anything else about it right now, because Ubisoft is working <em>pretty</em> hard to hide what the game looks like from those not willing to shoot for the moon. The publisher has accidentally forgotten to upload any trailers to its own YouTube channel, instead opting for a hardwired version on their site...which doesn’t show any in-game footage. Like, not even a hint.</p><p>Ubisoft has also, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/ubisoft-releases-new-blood-dragon-game-with-nfts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/ubisoft-releases-new-blood-dragon-game-with-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em> noticed</a></span>, not yet remembered to mention the game on its own socials, instead using an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eden Online sockpuppet account</a></span>. On there, I <em>was</em> able to find a tiny glimpse of the game itself amongst the cartoon sequences.

Others slowly accrue cult status over months and years. Some are finally released and quickly overlooked, cherished by a small coterie of early players and completely unknown to everyone else who might have fallen in love with them. Every year we try to give a handful of the most underappreciated games a quick plug in hopes that others will give them a much-deserved first or second look.

It doesn’t completely deliver on its ambitions, but swings for the fences like anything can happen. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A twin-stick shooter meets <em>Zelda </em>dungeoneering sounds like putting peanut butter on pickles and tastes just as good. <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> is like playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</em> as Star Fox. You explore a top-down map to unlock new paths and upgrades and take on bosses with punchy shooting that controls like a classic arcade game. It’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765">just damned brilliant</a></span>.” — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>I was turned onto Mask Quest by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em>’s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell</a></span>. It’s a precision platformer about controlling your breath while navigating a modern city and all of its contemporary socio-political hazards. It’s short, thoughtful, and brutal. “The cleverness of the game’s level design is as double-edged as the humor,” writes Evans-Thirlwell. ”It gracefully weaponizes and politicizes the casual sadism of any game that defines itself as a series of goals and punishments.” — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>What if<em> Hotline Miami </em>was more like <em>Silent Hill</em>? Enter <em>Conscript</em>, a WWI top-down horror stealth game about smashing enemy soldiers’ heads in while trying to escape the trenches. It’s slow, plodding, and at times tortuous. It’s all beautifully and hauntingly presented. It lures you into a sense of tedious exhaustion and then—BANG—you’re dead. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A cozy sandbox builder where you make shops and homes by the water, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing <em>Summerhouse</em></a></span> is like inhabiting a postcard from a long-lost friend. It’s reminiscent of what <em>Kingdom</em> did for tower defense strategy games, imposing 2D pixel art constraints to bring the virtues into sharper relief. It’s chill, adorable, and breathtaking. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Dungeons of Dreadrock</em> was a sleeper hit in 2022 that now frequently appears in “best of” lists, a fantastically smart puzzle game in which you descended 100 floors of a tower to save your brother from a grisly sacrifice. Its sequel repeats the formula, but this time from a second perspective, a character you likely forgot meeting in the first game, going through her own 100-story challenge. And the result is an even smarter set of excellent puzzles and lovely dialogue that nimbly sets up the third and final part of the trilogy. — John Walker </p></div><div><p>If <em>Minit </em>were a slide puzzle game, it would look like <em>Slider</em>. You move pieces of the world around to rearrange, rebuild, and progress through it. It can be incredibly simple and devastatingly hard at the same time. It’s free and no one has an excuse not to give it a try. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Master Key</em> is another riff on<em> Zelda</em>. This one is is as monochromatic and stripped down as it gets, focusing on the items you collect and the obstacles they help you to overcome. It shares DNA with modern indie gems like <em>Animal Well</em> and <em>Tunic</em>, though it’s more rough around the edges. Do yourself a favor and play it on easy. —Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Too many games are mawkish, and not enough games are honestly sad. <em>The Night Is Grey</em>, with its wonderfully solemn and beautiful story, defies this trend. This point-and-click adventure is a tangle of haunted pasts, and one that is self-aware enough to avoid the traditionally silly puzzles of the genre, even coldly chastising the player when one such traditional, silly solution is tried. It’s a game about a man trying to protect a small child, but it rebels against the tropes of that formula in a way that’ll gut-punch you hard. — John Walker </p></div><div><p><em>Dread Delusion</em> is a <em>Morrowind</em>-inspired low-poly RPG that finally hit 1.0 this year and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896">didn’t disappoint</a></span>. What it lacks in deep first-person combat, it makes up for with an incredible-looking world to explore and a mythical atmosphere suffused with whimsy and horror. The exploration, writing, and story deliver an experience unlike any other. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>The Crimson Diamond</em> looks and plays like something from 1988, an adventure game with gorgeous, vibrant EGA graphics and a text parser interface. Yes, that means you must actually type things like “look” and “open door,” a thought which may have some potential players rolling their eyes, but it’s actually great! The game deftly pulls you into its early-20th-century murder mystery with its plucky heroine and colorful cast of suspects. The text parser, meanwhile, lets you engage with those suspects and the environment in delightful and engaging ways that, despite being nods to games from nearly 40 years ago, feel fresh and invigorating, and make me more optimistic about the state of the adventure game genre today. I’ll allow myself a pun here and just end by saying that this game is a real gem. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>If you like reading random internet pages about made-up things and then leveraging your new expertise in creepy, intimate scenarios with complete strangers, <em>Home Safety Hotline</em> is the game for you. It’s a <em>Papers, Please</em>-like that combines soul crushing call center work with a beautiful Windows 97 aesthetic and a Cryptid-infused riff on <em>Night Trap</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p> There are plenty of city builders on Steam, but not many (if any) are all about creating bustling towns on the side of a giant mountain. <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em>, out in Early Access, asks you to develop and grow thriving cities using tiny cliffs as you and your crew climb up a mountain. The game is a bit tricky at times, but at least the view is lovely up there. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
