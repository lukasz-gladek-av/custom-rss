The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24173039/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24173039/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Overwatch 2 </em>Spotlight</a></span> showcase will take place on February 12 at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern and will unveil “groundbreaking changes to the PvP experience that will be unlike anything you’ve seen before,” as well as new maps, playable heroes, and more. We won’t know what that means for a couple of weeks. Still, given that Blizzard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blizzcon-2024-diablo-warcraft-overwatch-war-within-1851436455&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blizzcon-2024-diablo-warcraft-overwatch-war-within-1851436455">didn’t hold its annual Blizzcon event in 2024</a></span>, I imagine this is the <em>Overwatch 2</em> team’s chance to regain the lost promo time they didn’t get last year.

Several content creators who made careers playing and talking about <em>Overwatch </em>are moving onto NetEase’s game, fans are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-doctor-strange-portal-combo-exploit-kills-1851723986&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-doctor-strange-portal-combo-exploit-kills-1851723986">embracing its fun, unbalanced chaos</a></span>, and its approach to microtransactions and battle passes feels <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-is-an-anti-fomo-win-that-doesnt-expire-at-the-end-of-seasons-theres-no-need-to-worry-about-not-having-enough-time/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-is-an-anti-fomo-win-that-doesnt-expire-at-the-end-of-seasons-theres-no-need-to-worry-about-not-having-enough-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less predatory</a></span> than that of the average live-service game. Sure, the game is young and there’s plenty of time for something to go wrong. But right now <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has a lot of goodwill and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>doesn’t.</p><p>I’m still hopeful that <em>Overwatch 2 </em>can rise from the ashes. Sure, fumbles by top-level management have pushed incredibly talented designers, artists, writers, and others out of a team that was once brimming with passion and promise, but I know there are still people in Blizzard who want <em>Overwatch 2 </em>to be the best version of itself. If it’s not going to be the feature-rich narrative sequel we were promised, I do hope that Blizzard can at least find something to bring the magic back. The team is no doubt aware that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>hangs over <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Every perceived misstep right now might feel like a point on the board for NetEase, and every underwhelming update or recolored skin looks like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>falling further behind.</p><p>I don’t know that a new PvP mode is the update <em>Overwatch 2 </em>needs to get back on top. Returning to the 6v6 format won’t wipe away the stench people associate with the game overnight,  and after gutting <em>Overwatch 2 </em>into a husk of its former self, Blizzard has to know the window to reclaim its place in the hierarchy of hero shooters is closing. The faded glow of its long-gone status as undisputed king has largely sustained <em>Overwatch 2 </em>through years of content droughts and failure to live up to its potential. In the volatile live-service market, you can only stay in the shadow of something else for so long before players stop searching for you on their desktops. I hope <em>Overwatch 2 </em>can find a way out of the darkness it’s found itself in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’d include a trailer below, but I can’t find one. I also can’t find any video on YouTube of someone playing this game.

That don’t look great. And here’s the game’s actual description from its Xbox store page. See if you notice anything that shouldn’t be in there.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Dive into the thrilling world of arcade-style soccer with [Your Game Name Here]!

With 10 unique and fun teams to choose from, you’ll dribble, pass, and shoot your way to victory while defending your goal with a skilled goalkeeper. </p></blockquote><p>Also, in the game’s store page, it mentions that it supports “4v4 matches” and that <em>Mariostro Strikers </em>is perfect for “challenging your friends.” But the game is listed as single-player title. I’d spend money to figure out what’s going on but I have so many other things I’d rather do with my time.</p><p> Something I could do instead of buying and playing <em>Mariostro Strikers</em>?

That eventually got pulled, but only after the internet found it and joked about it for a few days. </p><p>  <em>Mariostro Strikers: Soccer League</em> is out now on Xbox. I’d uh, not buy it, but hey, I’m not your dad. So do whatever you want. Waste your money. I don’t care!</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But some options are clearly better for others, especially if you’re shopping within a specific price range. To help with that decision, I’ve put together a list of my three favorite choices for gaming phones. Let’s get into it.</p><h2 id="h13398"><a id="rog"></a>Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro: A premium experience for hardcore mobile gamers</h2><p>Most phones can play the majority of mobile games in some capacity, so you don’t necessarily need to buy a gaming-specific phone to enjoy playing. But if you want the best of the best performance, software designed specifically for gaming, and a battery that beats basically every other phone on the market, then you should take a look at the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro. That is, of course, if you’re willing to stomach its rather high price of $1,000 for the 256GB model, with an extra $200 and $500 charge for 512GB and 1TB respectively.</p><p>The Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro’s massive 6.78-inch display can hit up to a 185hz refresh rate to ensure your games look and run the best they can. Additionally, this beastly phone comes packed with a variety of hardware and software features that help it stand out as a “gaming phone”, such as air-trigger shoulder buttons and a wide selection of settings that let you customize your gaming experience well beyond that of any other phone. </p><div><h4> <strong>Also consider: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</strong>   </h4><p> Though not technically a “gaming phone”, a large display and flagship  specs make this popular flagship a great choice for daily use and  gaming.  </p></div><h2 id="h13399"><a id="1+"></a>OnePlus 13: A standard flagship phone with solid gaming performance</h2><p>The OnePlus 13 is one of the most versatile flagship phones around with its exceptional battery life, gorgeous OLED display, and near-stock Android software. Luckily, it’s also a wonderful choice for gaming thanks to what’s under the hood. If you’re willing to drop flagship money on this phone, you’ll be rewarded with a high-end processor, plenty of RAM, and some very impressive temperature control that makes sure you stay cool while gaming. The OnePlus 13 starts at $900.</p><p>Like the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro, the OnePlus 13 also includes baked-in gaming-related features that allow you a lot of customization over how your games look and perform, which can make you feel like you’re using a more specialized “gaming phone” during your play sessions. Sure, it can’t quite compete with the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro in terms of features, but it still offers an impressive set of bells and whistles for gamers that elevate this device above many others in its price range.</p><div><h4> <strong>Also consider: iPhone 16 Pro Max</strong>  </h4><p> It’s hard to go wrong with any recent iPhone for killer gaming  performance on a large screen, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max is your best  choice as an Apple user.  </p></div><h2 id="h13400"><a id="gal"></a>Samsung Galaxy A51: An entry level device at an entry level price</h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy A51 proves you don’t have to buy a flagship phone to have fun gaming. While this aging budget phone is missing a lot of the gaming-focused features that you can get with more expensive devices, it’s still capable of keeping up with most modern mobile games even when pushing for high settings with decent framerates.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A51's 6.5-inch screen serves up a nice 1080p picture, but it won’t exactly blow you away with incredible picture quality. Even so, it’s more than enough for the average gamer who isn’t counting pixels. Plus, it’s bright enough to play outdoors or in other well-lit environments. However, the battery isn’t going to hold up to extensive unplugged gaming sessions, so keep a charger on hand if you go with this budget offering.
