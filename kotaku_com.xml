              <p>The Game Boy is back but it only plays music from the Kanto region. Nintendo is spending nearly $2 billion on stock buybacks from Japanese banks. And the cool-looking <em>He-Man</em> brawler finally has a release date. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>I was up until 3:00 a.m. playing <em>Marathon</em> last night and I’m currently paying for it. There have been lots of complaints about everything from the UI to the ammo economy, but I think <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-ammo-pvp-ui-bungie-feedback-server-slam-2000674385">a lot of the complaints so far are kneejerk reactions to a rough onboarding process</a>. The real problem is that nobody’s on proximity chat. <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/2027261704556429662">It’s ruthless out there</a>. Tau Ceti IV is no post-apocalyptic Calabrada.</p>

 <h2>The Game Boy Jukebox is pricey but adorable</h2> <p>It was revealed during today’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383"><em>Pokémon</em> 30th Anniversary Presents</a> and it might be the oddest little lo-fi gadget of 2026. The Game Boy Jukebox plays music instead of games, and only from the original <em>Red</em> and <em>Blue Pokémon</em> games, and only if you insert one of 45 small cartridges corresponding to the track you want. It’s absurd, but I respect it.</p> <p>Also, it’s $70. Which is less respectful and even more absurd. I won’t buy one, but I definitely want one. Maybe DIY chiptune artists can do some really cool homebrew hacks with it. If nothing else, it will look perfect on a shelf since we’re probably not getting an actual Game Boy classic device from Nintendo anytime soon. The Jukebox <a href="https://x.com/videogamedeals/status/2027392133242462559/photo/1">goes on sale later today</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>D</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>gaea</em> gets a surprise action-RPG spin-off</h2>  <p>It’s called <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em> and it turns the long-running tactical JRPG series into a real-time brawl-fest. You play as a candy-loving mercenary who can wield all the weapons you’d find in your standard<em> Disgaea</em> entry. I’m not gonna lie, the action looks floaty and stiff in the trailer, but there are lots of big numbers, and I’m sure endless dungeons to grind. It hits Switch, PS5, and PC this summer.</p>

 <h2>It’s raining XP in <em>Fallout 76</em> after the game’s 66th update</h2> <p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76-adjusted-roughly-50-events-and-activities-for-the-latest-free-update-with-more-xp-for-higher-levels-and-shorter-timers-we-tried-to-concentrate-on-the-broad-strokes/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>, all the in-game events have been buffed. The XP they award now scales with your level; some of them are shorter, so they feel less tedious and unrewarding, and revised icons make it easier to tell which event is which on the map. It might be time to go back to Appalachia for a bit.</p> <h2>Nintendo is doing a massive $1.9 billion stock buyback</h2> <p>That’s a lot of cash to burn making anxious investors happy. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/nintendo-plans-around-19-billion-share-sale-by-kyoto-bank-others-sources-say-2026-02-27/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a> that it’s mostly big institutional banks like MUFG Bank and the Bank of Kyoto selling shares back to Nintendo following political pressure to have companies insulate one another less from outside shareholders.</p>

 <h2>The new retro <em>He-Man</em> beat-em-up finally has a release date</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9Fr8DPSD9E">A new trailer</a> confirms the Saturday-special-looking <em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction</em><em>&nbsp;</em>will be out April 28 across console and PC. It looks cool as heck and very old-school, though hopefully it plays better than some of the other licensed retro brawlers in recent years. It’ll be out just a month and change shy of the new movie’s arrival in theaters.</p> <h2>A former Xbox executive gives the new one some advice</h2> <p>“I wish her all the best,” Xbox’s old E3 tattoo artist Peter Moore <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/for-the-new-xbox-ceo-listening-is-good-peter-moore-interview/">told <em>GamesBeat</em></a> about new Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma. “She’s in a position right now where–keep your head down. Fly low. Avoid the radar. Learn, listen. Spend a lot of time internally. Travel the world. Meet with the studio heads. Do the classic listening tour, which a lot of executives do. I think she’ll be fine. She’s gotta explain AI and her background. That’s a minefield. I would, for me, avoid talking about that if you possibly can. But I wish her all the best.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/project-windless-chicken-protagonist-patrik-methe-2000674111">Gamers are picking sides in the unexpected gambling lawsuit against Valve</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/demon-tides-steam-review-impressions-platformer-3d-2000674085"><em>Demon Tides</em> has the wonderfully breezy spirit of a classic PlayStation platformer</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/project-windless-chicken-protagonist-patrik-methe-2000674111">The makers of <em>Project Windless</em> didn’t expect its swole chicken to steal the show at this month’s State of Play</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Legend of <a href="https://twitter.com/BalatroGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BalatroGame</a> DrSpectred aka Balatro University hits the naneinf with No Jokers Equipped and a 755 card deck <a href="https://t.co/oaadtzqGPe">pic.twitter.com/oaadtzqGPe</a></p> <p>— Yung Skrrt™ (@yungskrrt) <a href="https://twitter.com/yungskrrt/status/2025393531125465102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>

              <p>When it became obvious there was going to be no new mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> game in 2025, it raised a huge question about what would happen to the <em>Pokémon</em> TCG. The three-yearly cycle had become so normal that the card game was built around it, releasing sets themed around the new monsters and mechanics added to each new gaming entry, so what would it do when that was taken away? The answer, it turned out, was the revival of Mega Evolution, loosely tied into the events of <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Z-A</em>, but mostly just doing its own nostalgic thing. But now we know that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Winds</em> and&nbsp;<em>Waves</em> won’t be out until 2027! So what then? Step forward, the 30th Anniversary Set.</p> <p>During the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383">30th anniversary Pokémon Presents</a>, among its lacking assortment of announcements, there was a brief appearance of the <em>TCG—</em>albeit a very opaque one. The one solid piece of information we received was that the new cards will—for the first time ever—release simultaneously worldwide. Cards are usually released in Japan first, in the country’s own bespoke sets, and then repurposed for the rest of the world in differently arranged and titled collections.</p>

 <p>The minute-long inclusion showed a range of favorite cards from the last 30 years, often in non-English versions, before faux-interrupting itself to reveal Mew and Mewtwo seemingly on some sort of LSD trip. But nothing tangible, nothing we could infer. Could it be the case that this wasn’t a gallery of old faves, but potentially cards that will be included in the new sets?</p>  <p>That’s what’s being claimed by some sites, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/30th-anniversary-set-classic-cards"><em>Wargamer</em></a>, convinced that the cards shown will be part of this celebratory series of sets. And you can see why, given the clip is so infuriatingly uninformative, and especially the choice to show the classic cards in very many different languages, and then finishing on the news that it will release simultaneously worldwide. It seems to speak to this international approach.</p>

 <p>I’m not convinced. I think the intention here was to fly through the TCG’s 30-year history, given the cards appeared in chronological order, beginning with that classic Chonkachu #58 and the infamous holo Charizard from the Base Set (although here shown as Glurak, its German name), before jumping to a French Palkia Lv. X from <em>Diamond </em>&amp;<em> Pearl</em>‘s Great Encounters and a Japanese Lugia from Wind from the Sea (2008 and 2002 respectively). We then get a Spanish Uxie Lv. 55 from Legends Awakened (also 2008), followed by the briefest glimpse of both halves of the Darkrai &amp; Cresselia Legend from <em>HS</em> Triumphant (2010), a Genesect EX from 2013’s Pokémon Blast, and a Chinese Solgaleo GX (2017 for the English version). Finally there’s a burst of four: Pikachu &amp; Zekrom’s Tagteam from 2019’s Team Up in Thai, Zacian V from 2020’s Sword &amp; Shield base set in Korean, Arceus VSTAR from 2022’s Brilliant Stars in Indonesian, and finally a silver-edged Amazing Rare Raikou from Pokémon’s 2020 arrival in Chinese.</p>

 <p>The only oddity in there is that Chinese Solgaleo GX, as at that point the game hadn’t launched in China. It was, however, released as part of the Chinese Storming Emergence Radiant set in 2022, making it a&nbsp;<em>really</em> weird pick for this montage. My suspicion is less that this is an indication of a new version of the card, and more that someone made a cock-up.</p> <p>There is of course precedent for re-releasing classic cards as part of an anniversary collection. For the 25th birthday in 2021, Celebrations was released which included the 25-card Classic Collection featuring reprints of various cards from the previous years, marked by a Pikachu head. Then there was 2016’s XY Evolutions that was primarily made up of reprints of Base Set cards, infuriatingly similar to the originals but for a tiny set symbol. So, yeah, it’s entirely possible.</p>

 <p>We’ve reached out to Pokémon to see if we can get any clarification, but given <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/celebration-collection-set-name-trademarked-for-the-pokemon-tcg"><em>PokeBeach</em> is claiming</a> the sets won’t start releasing until October of this year, it seems likely the company will keep quiet about it until nearer the end of this Mega Evolutions era.</p>
