            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch.1361950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google bought up Fitbit back in 2021 and the brand has been incrementally improving ever since. The <strong>Charge 6</strong> is Google’s direct challenge to Apple Watch in the fitness tracker space, albeit at a much friendlier price. This tracker packs serious health monitoring features including built-in GPS and Google app integration, into a slim wristband design. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/"> it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $159</a>. You also get <strong>six months of Fitbit Premium included</strong>, adding even more value to an already great deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Google-Powered Fitness Tracking on Your Wrist</h2>
<p>The Google integration changes how you interact with your fitness tracker throughout the day. On walks and runs, Google Maps gives turn-by-turn directions right from your wrist. With Google Wallet, you’re able to make contactless payments without having to pull out your phone or card. And control from YouTube Music lets you manage your workout playlist sans breaking stride.</p>
<p>That makes heart rate monitoring on the Fitbit Charge 6 a game-changer for indoor workouts, especially with compatible gym equipment. Connect to Bluetooth-enabled treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes that can broadcast your heart rate. Your real-time pulse data appears on the machine’s display to help you stay in your target zone. Previously, this type of gym equipment compatibility had been limited to higher-end fitness watches. You get the premium features without the premium price tag.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in GPS tracks your runs, cycling routes, and hikes</strong> accurately without needing your phone nearby. Afterwards, you can see your pace, distance, and elevation changes in the Fitbit app. The GPS locks in quickly, so you are not standing around waiting before your run.</p>
<p>Health monitoring goes deep on the Charge 6, with continuous heart rate tracking and SpO2 blood oxygen sensing. Sleep tracking analyzes your rest patterns and provides a daily Sleep Score. Stress management tools include guided breathing sessions and an EDA sensor for mindfulness sessions. The tracker monitors your Active Zone Minutes, which count time spent in fat-burning or cardio heart rate zones.</p>



<p>The six-month Fitbit Premium membership that’s included with your purchase will unlock advanced insights and guided programs. With Premium, you get detailed sleep analysis, personalized workout recommendations, and mindfulness content. Video workouts from fitness experts give you fresh routines to try at home or in the gym. Health metrics dashboard shows trends in your data over time. <strong>This membership normally costs $10/month</strong>&nbsp;so you’re getting an additional $60 value included.</p>
<p>Battery life reaches<strong> up to seven days on a single charge</strong>&nbsp;which beats most smartwatches by a wide margin. You can track an entire week of workouts, sleep, and daily activity without touching a charger. When you do need to recharge, it takes about two hours to reach full capacity. The <strong>always-on display option</strong> shows your stats at a glance without tapping or wrist-raising. Less time charging means more time tracking.</p>
<p>The slim band design keeps the Charge 6 comfortable for all-day and all-night wear: <strong>Both small and large bands come in the box</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll find the right fit immediately. Water resistance up to 50 meters means showers, swimming, and sweaty workouts won’t damage the tracker. The<strong> touchscreen is quick to respond</strong> and easy to navigate through menus. You get a premium feel without the bulk of a traditional smartwatch.</p>
<p>At $99, the Fitbit Charge 6 is an absolute steal this Black Friday. This is the best fitness tracker from Google and Fitbit at nearly 40% off retail.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-went-full-charity-mode-the-mx-master-3s-now-sells-for-almost-free-this-black-friday-2000646547</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-went-full-charity-mode-the-mx-master-3s-now-sells-for-almost-free-this-black-friday.1361935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers who also create content, edit videos, or work long hours at their desk need a mouse that handles everything. Your gaming mouse might be great for fragging but it’s probably not ideal for those 10-hour editing sessions or browsing between matches. The <strong>Logitech MX Master 3S</strong> bridges that gap with an 8K DPI sensor, ergonomic design and features that make productivity feel effortless. This Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/">it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $119</a>. If you want one mouse that dominates both work and play, this is the one to grab.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision and Comfort Built for Marathon Sessions</h2>
<p>The <strong>8000 DPI sensor</strong> inside the MX Master 3S tracks on virtually any surface, including glass. You can game on your desk, work from a coffee shop table or use it on your couch armrest with no need for a mousepad. Whichever you choose, the tracking remains accurate and responsive. Sensitivity is fully customizable through the <em>Logi Options+</em> software, so you can really dial in just the feel you want.</p>
<p>The ergonomics of this mouse are really impressive for long sessions of gaming and work: The <strong>sculpted shape fits naturally in your hand</strong>&nbsp;and reduces strain through those marathon streams or nights of editing. Your wrist and fingers stay comfortable even after hours of continuous use. The thumb rest provides support that cheaper mice simply don’t offer. If you have ever felt hand fatigue after extended time at the desk, this design makes a noticeable difference.</p>



<p>The <em>Quiet Clicks</em> feature cuts down the noise by 90% compared to the regular mice and becomes a game-changer in streamers’ and content developers’ lives. Your microphone will not catch any kind of annoying click sound while recording or on Discord with your buddies. They are still satisfying and tactile clicks, just without the audible snap.</p>
<p><em>MagSpeed</em> scrolling is one of those features you don’t know you need until you experience it. The scroll wheel moves with electromagnetic precision, allowing you to scroll through long documents or web pages in a single flick. It’s <strong>90% faster and 87% more precise than conventional scroll wheels</strong>. When you need fine control, it shifts automatically to a ratcheted mode that clicks through line by line.</p>



<p>Multi-device connectivity allows you to <strong>connect the MX Master 3S to up to three computers or devices at once</strong>. Switch between your gaming rig, work laptop, and tablet with the press of a button. Flow takes this a step further by allowing you to move your cursor seamlessly across computers and drag files across them. This is incredible if one runs a dual-system setup for streaming and gaming. The <strong>mouse connects via Bluetooth</strong> or the included Logi Bolt USB receiver for a great wireless connection.</p>
<p>And the battery life won’t leave you stranded mid-session: <strong>a full charge lasts up to 70 days of regular use</strong> and a quick one-minute charge gives you three hours of power when you’re in a pinch. The USB-C charging port also means you can use the same cable as your phone or controller.</p>
<p>The Logitech MX Master 3S is an unbelievable deal at $99 this Black Friday, make sure you don’t miss that opportunity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of my favorite things to do on my Xbox Series S is occasionally trawl the digital storefront archives for <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-on-xbox-360-5878837">my favorite Xbox 360 games</a>. Often they aren’t available or are ridiculously expensive compared to their bargain bin physical versions. But very occasionally they’re available through Microsoft’s backwards compatibility program and only cost less than $10. Today is one of those days.</p> <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday 2025 sale</a> this year happens to coincide with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-favorite-memories-mw2-bastion-halo-2000646286">the 20th anniversary of the Xbox 360</a>. As a result, you can pick up some of the retro console’s best games for just the cost of a cup of coffee or Big Mac:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</strong></em> – $2.25 (normally $15)</li> <li><strong><em>Blue Dragon</em></strong> – $5 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Lost Odyssey</em></strong> – $8.25 (normally $25)</li> <li><strong><em>Alan Wake</em></strong> – $6 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Fable II</em></strong> – $6.60 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Gears of War 2</em></strong> – $8.80 (normally $12)</li> <li><strong><em>Gears of War 3</em></strong> – $8.80 (normally $12)</li> <li><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></strong> – $7 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Fallout 3</em></strong> – $2.50 (normally $10)</li> <li><em><strong>Street Fighter IV</strong></em> – $4 (normally $20)</li> </ul> <p>If you played <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> this year and loved it, do yourself a favor and pick up <em>Lost Odyssey</em>. The cult-classic turn-based RPG was developed by <em>Final Fantasy</em> veterans including Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu and has an emotional bombshell for a narrative arc.</p>

 <p>“For me, Lost Odyssey was the last grand turn-based RPG adventure with realistic graphics,” <em>Clair Obscur</em> director Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a> earlier this year. “Its themes were very heavy and very well handled. It’s the last game that made me cry.”</p>

 <p><em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em>, meanwhile, is a great sci-fi immersive sim with incredible art direction that never got ported. <em>Street Fighter IV</em> might be the best entry in the series ever. And if you don’t want to wait for that rumored <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster to appear, you can revisit the Washington D.C. wasteland today for steal.</p> <p>And if you recent played through the original Gears story by way of <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106">this summer’s<em> Reloaded Edition</em></a>, you can find a local co-op buddy and complete the journey this Thanksgiving break. Rip to some real ones.</p>

              <p>It’s been over a year since Microsoft shut down the Xbox 360’s digital store, effectively putting the final nail in the beloved console’s coffin. While it’s a shame that the decades-old console’s marketplace is gone, it doesn’t take away from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-tribute-retrospective-halo-3-red-ring-e3-1851609358">Xbox 360’s legacy as a popular, innovative, and weird machine</a> that paved the way for the current era of gaming.</p> <p>For better and for worse, when Microsoft’s Xbox 360 launched in 2005 it changed video games forever. And now seems like a perfect time to take a look back at the best and worst parts of its run.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on Jul 31, 2024.

              <p>You have an Xbox 360 controller waiting for you in your living room and a console hungry to entertain you. It’s an older console, sure. But it still has a ton of great games.</p> <p><em>This list was published on April 21, 2016. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.</em></p> <p>As of April 2016, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ends-xbox-360-production-1772042864">Microsoft has ceased production of the Xbox 360 console</a>. It had a great run—red rings and Kinect 1.0 notwithstanding—and it got a ton of great games. These dozen games have occupied our Bests list for a long while, and at this point there’ll probably never be another update. (Never say never, though!)</p>

 <p>Here are our recommendations for the 12 best games on Xbox 360. Enjoy.</p> <h2 data-textannotation-id="9201ab5b178b5c0b91005e103f75f309"><em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646524"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646524">Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p>After years of changes both minor and major, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> series had begun to feel in a rut. (For example: We’d had <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> on this list since its inception.) Finally this year, with the pirate-themed <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, the series has taken a major and unequivocal step forward. It doesn’t lose <em>all</em> of the series’ bad habits—hello follow missions—but it improves many longstanding problems with better stealth, easier-to-navigate cities, and sidequests that actually feel like they help make your character more powerful. Best of all, it adds naval combat and a vast Caribbean overworld that make the game feel like, in the words of Luke Plunkett, “<em>Wind Waker</em> for grown-ups.”</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For: </strong>Pirate fans, history buffs, anyone who’s ever wanted to pull up alongside a British frigate, grab a rope and swing from one deck to the other before fighting your way up the deck to take on the captain. So basically, anyone who’s ever wanted to be a pirate.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For: </strong>Those who demand precision controls. The on-foot controls in <em>Black Flag</em> are probably the best of the series, but they’re still a far cry from where a third-person stealth/platformer should be. It’s time for a crouch button, Ubisoft.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/17WsnAu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646525">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>With an even bigger, wackier, lootier <em>Borderlands</em>, Gearbox has proved that their hybrid RPG/shooter franchise isn’t just a one-hit wonder. Three years after the first release, Gearbox put out a <em>Borderlands 2</em> that doesn’t just have thousands more guns. It’s more complex. It’s even got <em>heart</em>. And yet <em>Borderlands 2</em> still manages to strike a balance between being more soulful while retaining the slapstick, make-no-excuses-for-itself humor for which the series is known. The characters you meet are often borderline (if not full-blown) psychotic, but in the most endearing of ways. Enemies are just as raunchy as they are diverse. It’s colorful, it’s tough, it’s meaty, and it’s a joy to play with up to 3 friends in co-op. It’s also got TONS of extra, downloadable content to keep you busy once you finish the main game.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Gamers who want a fun co-op experience to play through with friends. There are plenty of quests, plenty of guns, and plenty of laughs to be had.</p> <p><strong>Not A Good Match For</strong>: People who want to burn through a game easily. <em>Borderlands 2</em> can be pretty tough, especially without backup. And if you aren’t willing to spend some time churning out sidequests, you just might catch yourself at the tail-end of the game without the chops or stats to finish without getting burnt out.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/18xf2Cr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Burnout: Paradise</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646526"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646526">Criterion Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Automotive destruction’s never looked as sexy as it does in Criterion’s hi-speed racing game <em>Burnout: Paradise</em>. You’re tasked with driving against traffic, scraping against civilian cars and shoving competitors into signature crashes called Takedowns. But, <em>Paradise</em> also deserves praise for a seamless integration of multiplayer where dropping into a showdown can be quick as tapping a button.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Street racing fans. If you’ve ever pulled up to a stoplight and imagined what it’d be like to burn rubber on a wide-open stretch of asphalt—and survive any ensuing mishaps—this is your game.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> To tune the specs of their rides. It may be <em>Paradise</em> but these aren’t real-world cars. You can’t do much more than swap out paint jobs, so those wanting to make changes to brakes, shock or engines will need to get their grease-monkey fix elsewhere.</p>

 <p><b><a href="https://kotaku.com/burnout-paradise-didnt-need-a-remaster-but-its-nice-1823840738">Read</a> our review.</b></p> <h2><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646527">Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> is an impressive crime game. Not perfect, but impressive. The game gives players one of the richest, most beautiful open worlds we’ve ever been able to play in. In this case, the landscape is a fictionalized version of Los Angeles and the California desert. Go anywhere in this vast game. Grab a car, plane, truck, bicycle, boat or tank. Head off in any direction. You’re bound to see extraordinary sights and stumble into some sort of good and probably violent time. The game looks amazing even on the old Xbox 360 hardware. It also plays better than any <em>GTA</em> before it. <em>GTA V</em>’s innovative, swappable three-protagonist system creates the feel of a true ensemble adventure, though crazy man Trevor steals the show.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Players who like to go into a game to break the rules. GTA is still at its best when it’s a playground for virtual misbehavior.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Anyone who can’t stomach the game’s mockery of, well, pretty much everyone.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1aLDtf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646528"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646528">Starbreeze Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> came out of nowhere this year, surprising everyone with its strange control scheme, smart (if simple) puzzles and devastating ending. Can game mechanics be emotionally affecting? Turns out yup, they can be. It’s a nice, short game with almost no fat—and despite the fact that the two main characters don’t communicate in a language anyone could understand, they still manage to communicate a great deal of context and backstory. You’ll never think of your thumbs and your controller triggers the same way.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For: </strong>People looking for something different, those who like weird controls schemes, fans of old-school fairy tales.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For: </strong>Those hoping for a long game—it’s a few hours long and offers no real replayability—people who like their characters to speak actual languages.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/18xsbsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our thoughts</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <h2><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646529"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646529">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>Bethesda Softworks’ hit role-playing game does nothing so much as deliver a giant, Tolkien-styled possibility space to its players. The high-altitude climes of Tamriel feel alive with wonder and threat. The ability to customize your warrior outcast with a singular mix of mystical skills and melee mastery feels as broad as <em>Skyrim</em>’s horizon.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Dungeon &amp; Dragon players. Adventuring in <em>Skyrim</em> feels like spinning your own epic yarn, as songs of your feats spread digitally from town to town in a game world that reacts to your actions. You can spend weeks meandering in its fascinating sidequests, leaving the main story.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who play with urgency. The drive to wander and discover overpowers the drive to complete in <em>Skyrim</em>. If you’re the kind of player who wants those two vectors to meet in a meaningful way, you’ll find <em>The Elder Scrolls V</em> a bit frustrating.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1cdDyGs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Gears of War 3</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646530" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646530"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646530">Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Gears 3</em> fills the marquee spot held by Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> games and with good reason. Epic Games’ scifi shooter threequel represents hardcore shooter nirvana: a tightly-polished campaign that plays great solo or coop and some of the best multiplayer found anywhere. Moreover, the game’s been robustly supported with both campaign and multiplayer DLC designed to deepen an already hearty release, particularly with the addition of many of the best maps from <em>Gears of War 2</em></p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Dedicated online shooter fanatics who play every day. The more you play, the more <em>Gears 3</em> rewards you.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who want deep character development or intriguing story structure. Gears games have always been meat-and-potatoes in terms of plot</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194lQIl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Halo: Reach</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646531"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646531">Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p>Bungie created the best goodbye possible with a “final” <em>Halo</em> title that both looks forward and backward in the blockbuster FPS franchise’s history. Pairing up a health system similar to that of the first <em>Halo</em> game with all-new abilities like jetpacks and holographic decoys makes the decade-old series feel simultaneously familiar and fresh.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Sci-fi fans. To play a <em>Halo</em> game is to be introduced to an expansive fictional universe. <em>Reach</em> places you inside one of the <em>Halo</em>-verse’s pivotal battles and imbues its lead characters and environments with more personality than in previous games.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Anyone who wants Master Chief. The Spartan you control in <em>Halo: Reach</em> isn’t as invulnerable or powerful as the Xbox mascot and the feel of certain weapons gets tweaked when compared to previous games.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194m1Dv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Mass Effect 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646533"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646533">BioWare</figcaption></figure>  <p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> was the one that made you believe. Its predecessor drew players in with expansive world-building and a tense storyline, but it was also a clunky, rough-hewn slab of a game. BioWare’s 2010 follow-up polished the combat, introduced characters who’d become fan favorites and streamlined the overall experience to a fine focus. The first game made you want to experience all the sci-fi action and drama, but the second game made it a lot easier to do so. Pack in a huge number of varied and often terrific downloadable content packs and you’ve got one beefy, galaxy-spanning chunk of video game to play.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Fans of the <em>Star Wars</em> Expanded Universe. Like George Lucas’ signature creation, <em>Mass Effect</em>’s fictional cosmos has multitudes of tales to tell. The extremely good post-campaign DLC chapters expose players to side stories centered on both new and familiar characters, just like Timothy Zahn’s Thrawn Trilogy and the other <em>Star Wars</em> extensions. <em>Overlord</em>, <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> and the other add-ons really made it feel like millions of little lives were at stake in Shepard’s fight against the Reapers.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> People who need closure. <em>Mass Effect 2</em> tells plenty of small stories, but the main narrative arc is still essentially a set-up for the 2012 follow-up.</p> <p><a href="http://www.bit.ly/1bSg7rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646534"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646534">Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the most assured work by the makers of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games finds its success by shedding the trappings of the modern-day world and giving players a vast virtual Southwest to roam in search of revenge. When your lonely ambles suddenly get shattered by an ambush or the plea to stop an unjust hanging, it’s a bittersweet adrenaline rush unlike anything else in modern video games. Silence, then gunfire, then more fleeting silence again.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Admirers of killer endings. The denouement for the turn-of-the-century saga stands as an emotionally powerful finish that can stand amongst the cowboy cinema that inspired it.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Fans of brevity. Redemption’s plot takes a long amount of playtime to resolve and you’ll often feel like you’re doing busy work in the nooks and crannies of its spaghetti Western game world.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194mwNR" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Portal 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646535">Valve</figcaption></figure> <p>Call it the <em>Superman 2</em> or <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> of video games. Valve’s follow-up to a classic improves on the humor, characterization and puzzle-solving of its predecessor to deliver a tight, focused experience full of poignancy and humor.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match for:</strong> Comedy lovers. The voicework alone—performed in stellar fashion by Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain—will make you laugh out loud but the brain-teasing puzzles and embedded gags keep the chuckles coming even when everything else in the game goes quiet.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Mediocrity fans. People who argue with <em>Portal 2</em>‘s greatness are like folks complaining that diamonds came from dirt. Their argument is invalid.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/19mLgNI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>XCOM: Enemy Within</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646536"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646536">Firaxis</figcaption></figure> <p>There it is: proof that a multiplatform game released in 2012 can recapture the glories of a 1994 PC classic. The re-imagined <em>XCOM</em> delivers graphical upgrades and interface refinements like you might expect but what really makes it sing is the added attachment that you feel to the battles and the soldiers who fight them. If you’re considering picking up the game now, get <em>Enemy Within</em> instead, as it contains the original game as well as the terrific 2013 expansion. It’s sold as a standalone for consoles, so be sure to buy the new version.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Efficiency lovers. This version of human-vs-aliens warfare streamlines gameplay when compared to its predecessor. And the importance of cover in combat and clever deployment of perks makes you consider every decision intensely.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who want skirmishes. The combat in 2012 <em>XCOM</em> can stretch on way longer than is necessary. Because the battles require active engagement, you can feel chained to a session.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/ISUJq0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review and our review of </strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ISUN9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the latest expansion.</strong></a></p> <p><em><strong>How has this list changed?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wd-20tb-external-hard-drive-goes-for-mere-pennies-now-cheaper-than-a-sandisk-4tb-ssd-2000646515</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wd-20tb-external-hard-drive-goes-for-mere-pennies-now-cheaper-than-a-sandisk-4tb-ssd.1361764/</guid>

              <p>External hard drives solve the eternal problem of running out of storage space on computers that never seem to have enough room for everything you accumulate. Photos, videos, games, backups, and work files consume gigabytes faster than anyone anticipates, and cloud storage subscriptions add up to serious money over time. The WD <em>Elements</em>&nbsp;drive offers a massive 20TB capacity that can handle years of storage needs in a single reliable device. After<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5832/"> launching at $599 before dropping down to the standard price of $349, Amazon just crushed it to $269 for Black Friday</a>. This <strong>record-low pricing is the deepest discount</strong> this popular drive has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5832/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20TB Capacity Eliminates Storage Anxiety Forever</h2>
<p>Twenty terabytes are ample to the extent that <strong>storage management can be forgotten</strong>. You store around 400,000 high-resolution photos, 5,000 hours of HD video, or even complete media libraries that would fill up in decades. The capacity manages full system backups for several computers and still leaves room for ongoing file build-up. This much space turns your relation to digital files from decisions about what to delete to simply hoarding without consequences.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 interface provides transfer speeds good enough to move big files in fairly reasonable times, considering the mechanical drive inside. You connect to any computer with standard USB ports without requiring special cables, adapters, or driver installations. The plug-and-play functionality means the drive works immediately on Windows and Mac systems out of the box.</p>



<p>The desktop form factor prioritizes capacity and reliability over portability. The drive would sit on your desk, connected to power and USB, serving as a permanent storage expansion rather than as a travel companion. This allows for larger platters and better cooling than portable drives crammed into smaller enclosures.</p>
<p>WD has developed its brand over decades of manufacturing hard drives, and most people associate the company with reliable data storage. The Elements line represents their value-oriented offering, where there is core functionality provided without any premium features that inflate pricing. You get proven WD reliability without paying for software bundles, hardware encryption, or other extras that many users don’t need. The <strong>4.6-star rating across over 332,000 reviews</strong> confirms this reliability extends to real-world usage over years of service.</p>



<p>At this price, the cost per gigabyte beats cloud storage subscriptions within months of ownership. The <strong>cloud plan for 2TB is around $10-15 a month</strong>&nbsp;while equivalent cloud storage would cost hundreds of dollars annually. This drive quickly pays for itself compared to cloud alternatives, and you own the hardware with no recurring fees. Local storage also provides faster access speeds than the internet-dependent cloud services.</p>
<p>Setup involves the<strong> connection of two cables and waiting for your operating system to recognize the new drive</strong>. Windows and Mac both automatically mount the drive without the installation of software or configuration. Drag files to the new drive immediately, and you’re using capacity within minutes of opening the box. The simplicity makes this accessible to anyone regardless of technical expertise.</p>
<p>At $269, you’ll get 20TB of reliable WD storage for more than 50% off its original $599 launch price and 23% off its current list price. The per-terabyte price reaches levels where massive local storage becomes truly affordable. This Black Friday pricing makes the decision to get rid of storage limitations an easy investment that pays dividends for years through avoided cloud subscriptions and permanent file access.</p>

              <p>A 57-inch Dual 4K display with 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and Quantum Mini-LED backlighting. If those specs made your pulse quicken, you already understand what the <strong>Samsung Odyssey Neo G9</strong> represents. This is the monitor that replaces a dual-screen setup with one massive curved panel delivering 7,680 x 2,160 resolution. DisplayPort 2.1 and AMD Freesync Premium Pro complete a spec sheet that reads like a wish list. And the good news, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5831/">has slashed the price to $1,499 for Black Friday, down from $2,299</a>. That’s a 35% discount and the lowest this flagship gaming monitor has ever been.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best 57-Inch Monitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>57-inch panel gives you two 32-inch 4K monitors fused into one</strong> seamless ultrawide display. No bezels interrupting your view, no alignment issues between screens, and no messing with software to manage multiple inputs. The <strong>dual UHD resolution</strong> means you get the exact same pixel density and clarity across the whole surface. Spreadsheets, video editing timelines, and game worlds all enjoy that ridiculous amount of horizontal space.</p>



<p>The <strong>1000R curvature</strong> wraps the screen around your field of view in a way flat monitors simply cannot replicate. This aggressive curve matches the natural shape of human vision to reduce eye strain during marathon sessions. The edges of the screen stay equidistant from your eyes, which keeps everything in focus without constant head position adjustments. Immersion in racing games and flight simulators goes to a new level.</p>
<p>The backlighting is powered by <strong>Quantum Mini-LED technology that features 2,392 individual local dimming zones</strong>. These zones independently govern their brightness to provide deep blacks alongside brilliant highlights, with no blooming or halo effects. The Quantum Matrix processing drives these zones at 12-bit precision, yielding more than 4,000 levels of brightness gradation. Dark scenes in horror games are rendered with inky shadows, while bright elements pop without washing out the surrounding areas. Traditional edge-lit monitors seem flat and lifeless compared to this.</p>
<p>The DisplayHDR 1000 certification<strong> guarantees 1,000 nits of peak brightness</strong> and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. These numbers equate to visible detail in both the darkest corners and brightest explosions of any game that you play. Enemies that were hiding in the shadows now become visible without cranking gamma settings that wash out everything else. HDR content finally looks the way it was intended by creators when you have hardware capable of showing the full dynamic range. Movies and streaming content also benefit massively from this level of contrast performance.</p>



<p>The<strong> 240Hz refresh rate, combined with a 1ms response time</strong>, means competitive-grade responsiveness on this massive panel. Fast-paced shooters and racing games show fluid motion with no ghosting or blur trails behind moving objects. DisplayPort 2.1 provides the bandwidth necessary to push Dual 4K resolution at these refresh rates with support for variable refresh rates.</p>
<p>Connectivity options cover every scenario you might encounter: <strong>DisplayPort 2.1</strong> handles the heavy lifting for maximum performance gaming, while <strong>HDMI 2.1 ports</strong> connect current-gen consoles at their highest output capabilities. The integrated USB hub reduces cable clutter by letting you plug peripherals directly into the monitor. If you need to monitor different sources, picture-by-picture mode can display two separate inputs simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is an incredible value at $1,499 for such cutting-edge display tech. This Black Friday price knocks off a whopping $800 compared to retail and brings a flagship monitor into reach for serious gamers.</p>
