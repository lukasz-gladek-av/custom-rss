              <p>Premium wireless earbuds have become one of those purchases where the options feel endless and the prices keep climbing higher. You’ve got Apple’s AirPods Pro at $249, Google’s Pixel Buds Pro at similar pricing, and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro normally sitting at the same $249 mark. The specs all start to blur together after a while, and trying to figure out which pair actually delivers the best value can feel overwhelming. Price becomes a major factor when everything seems comparable on paper, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">right now Amazon has dropped the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to just $174, down from their usual $249</a>. This is a new all-time low that you won’t even find on Samsung’s official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro <strong>pack AI-powered features</strong> that are constantly adapting to your environment throughout the day. Samsung’s sound optimization technology analyses the shape of your ear canal to adjust audio output for balanced sound that matches your unique anatomy. This happens automatically in the background, so you’re not always tweaking equalizer settings and wondering if you’re missing out on certain frequencies. The <strong>AI continuously monitors ambient noise levels and adjusts the intensity of active noise cancellation</strong> to match and ramps up when you step onto a busy street and dialing back when you’re in quieter spaces.</p>



<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro works through a <strong>combination of external and internal microphones</strong> that capture ambient sound and generate inverse sound waves to cancel unwanted noise. The technology proves especially effective at eliminating low-frequency rumble from airplane engines, subway cars, or air conditioning units. You’ll notice the difference immediately on your commute as traffic noise fades into the background and you can finally hear podcast dialogue clearly without cranking the volume to dangerous levels.<strong> Transparency mode</strong> flips this system around and pips in external sounds when you need to hear announcements, have quick conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings while walking.</p>



<p>Samsung redesigned the fit for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to address one of the most common complaints in its predecessors: This <strong>new ergonomic contour sits more securely in your ear</strong> without creating pressure points that cause discomfort after an hour or two of wear. You get three different ear tip sizes in the box, and the companion app includes a fit test that plays audio to verify you’ve created a proper seal. Getting this seal right is enormously important for both sound quality and noise cancellation effectiveness, since even small gaps let sound leak in and bass frequencies escape.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> maintains stable connections for the typical range you’d expect from modern wireless earbuds, staying paired reliably when your phone is in your pocket or bag. Pairing happens quickly through Samsung’s ecosystem if you own a Galaxy phone, as the earbuds pop up automatically on screen when you open the case near your device. Android users outside the Samsung ecosystem and <strong>even iPhone owners can still pair these earbuds</strong> through standard Bluetooth settings, though they’ll miss out on some of the deeper integration features that Galaxy phone users enjoy.</p>
<p>Battery life gives you about six hours of continuous playback with active noise cancellation enabled, which will cover most daily use scenarios, like commutes, work sessions, or gym visits. With the charging case included, y<strong>ou get about 26 hours of total listening time</strong> before you’ll need to find an outlet; it also supports USB-C wired charging and wireless charging via Qi-compatible pads. With just a five-minute charge, you can attain about an hour of playback in case you are in a hurry and forget that your earbuds are dead.</p>
<p>This is one of the best deals on Samsung’s earbuds so far in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-performance-beast-from-dell-is-70-off-on-amazon-now-priced-like-a-basic-mid-range-machine-2000643568</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-performance-beast-from-dell-is-70-off-on-amazon-now-priced-like-a-basic-mid-range-machine.1351966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding a laptop that can handle everything from pro-level video editing to more casual gaming means spending upwards of $3,000, and that’s something most people simply can’t justify. Everyone wants a powerful machine that doesn’t chug when the work starts to get serious but the budgetary reality most are faced with compromises. Until now. This early Black Friday deal on Amazon completely upends that equation by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">the Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM, etc) from its usual $3,299 price all the way down to just $995</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 70% discount on a true performance powerhouse</strong>, and the deal isn’t even available on Dell’s own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Intel Core 7 150U processor powers this machine with the kind of processing muscle you would expect from significantly more expensive laptops. This chip has speeds up to 5.4 GHz and boasts a hybrid architecture, with <strong>10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, all working across 12 threads</strong>. You get three separate engines inside: CPU tasks, GPU graphics, and NPU AI acceleration. In other words, it handles everything from complex spreadsheets to AI-powered applications with ease.</p>



<h2>Ideal for Daily Tasks</h2>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM changes the way you work as slowdowns that plague machines with less memory are gone. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple Adobe Creative Suite apps at once, have multiple Excel workbooks processing data, and still switch between everything instantly. Compared to DDR4 found in older laptops, DDR5 provides faster data transfer rates which means your processor spends less time waiting for information and more actually processing your work.</p>



<p>The touchscreen features a 16-inch WQXGA display with 1920 x 1200 resolution and offers more vertical real estate compared to the usual 1080p panel. That extra height makes a difference when you code, read long documents or deal with a spreadsheet that requires a few more rows visible at once. The 300-nit brightness is sufficient for you to comfortably work in well-lit offices or near windows while the anti-glare coating prevents reflections from turning your screen into a mirror.</p>
<p>The Thunderbolt 4 port delivers transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps and means you can transfer whole project folders to external drives in seconds, rather than minutes. This same port supports dual 4K displays or a single 8K monitor, turning your laptop into a multiscreen workstation when you’re at your desk. Combined with traditional USB 3.2 ports for peripherals, HDMI for presentations, and WiFi 6E for lightning-fast wireless connections, this laptop connects to everything you need without requiring a drawer full of adapters.</p>
<p>This is one of the best laptop deals you can get right now, and it’s exclusively available at Amazon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678">Superhero workplace comedy game <em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit this year, already selling over a million copies since launching in October. And the fandom around the game is ravenous, with many players deeply invested in the narrative-driven adventure game’s romances. This caught the devs off guard, and might lead to some cut sex scenes returning in some form.</p> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">In a new interview with <em>Inverse</em>,</a>&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em> writer Pierre Shorette talked about how the game came together over the last few years and was asked about fans going wild over the few relationship and romance options in the superhero game developed by some former Telltale folks.</p>  <p>“I don’t know that I anticipated it to be as ravenous as it’s been,” said Shorette of the fan reaction. “It’s probably why we didn’t plan for more romance options, because we didn’t know it was going to be such a meaningful part of the experience for folks.” Shorette explained that he often defaults to romantic comedy when writing and has tried to resist this tendency, but romance was never an intentional focus of <em>Dispatch.</em> Rather, it was just one of the many parts of the game. Still, seeing the fans react to the romance and sex that exist in the game has Shorette wondering if they made a mistake.</p> <p>“We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn’t have,” Shorette told the outlet. “Maybe folks will get to see those one day.”</p> <p>“There isn’t anyone on the development team that wouldn’t have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way. We’re still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it’s doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often, with these games, is branching too.”</p> <p>Regardless, <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-dialogue-options-chair-episode-3-golem-choice-2000640791"><em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit, with fans begging the devs for another season. And that might just happen. But for now, Shorette and the team at Ad Hoc Studios are just happy people like <em>Dispatch</em> so much.&nbsp; All eight episodes of <em>Dispatch</em> are out now on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[16 Cool Details About Valve’s New Steam Console, Controller, And VR Headset]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/16-cool-details-about-valve%E2%80%99s-new-steam-console-controller-and-vr-headset.1351885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">Valve announced not one, not two, but three new pieces of video game hardware</a>: The console-like Steam Machine, the Steam Frame VR headset, and the Steam Controller. All of this stuff launches sometime in 2026 (<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">price unknown</a>) and works together, alongside the Steam Deck, to create what is shaping up to be an impressive Steam ecosystem that rivals anything from Xbox, PlayStation, Apple, or Nintendo.</p>

 <p>But announcing three pieces of gaming hardware in one day means there are a lot of information and interviews floating around. So I’ve read through all of it, as well as all of Valve’s own posts, to narrow down 16 interesting, cool, important, and fun details about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is bringing back Xbox 360-like faceplates</h2> <p>Valve’s new Steam console features a removable faceplate that reminds me a lot of the Xbox 360 faceplates from back in the day. Sadly, the company doesn’t sound committed to selling different plates, but they will be sharing all the files needed to 3D print your own. So I expect a lot of third-party plates will be available after launch. Oh, and Valve, you should totally sell this e-ink plate, please!</p>   <h2>Valve wants every game running at 4K60 on Steam Machine</h2> <p>“Our benchmark has always been that it should have enough performance to play every game on Steam at 4K60 when you do some sort of upscaling like FSR,” Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/steam-machine-specs-availability/">told<em> PC Gamer.</em></a> That’s a pretty big promise and likely will mean some newer, Unreal Engine 5 games will need to have their settings lowered a lot. But games from a few years ago, indie titles, and other similar titles should run like a dream on the device.</p>

 <h2>You can easily expand Steam Machine’s storage and even change the RAM</h2> <p>Valve has designed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">Steam Machine</a> to let you add more SSD storage easily if you so desire. You can also slap in a fast, high-performance SD Card to add more storage. And for those willing to open the console up a bit more, you can even replace the RAM, though Valve says this will be tricky and likely not something most people do.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is reportedly very, very quiet</h2> <p>According to <em>PC Gamer</em>, the Steam Machine is very quiet. Even while playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and standing close to the Steam console, it barely made any noise.</p> <h2>It’s also just a computer, if you want</h2> <p>Similar to the Steam Deck, Valve has designed the Steam Machine to be usable as a computer. Hook it up to a monitor, connect a mouse and keyboard, and you have a beefy little Linux-powered desktop PC that can run Steam and other software easily.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643621"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643621">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can wirelessly connect four Steam Controllers to the Steam Machine</h2> <p>Want to play a game with your pals on the Steam Machine? Well, good news: It supports four Steam Controllers at once without needing any extra dongles. Nifty stuff!</p> <h2>Steam Machine can run Windows, if you like that kind of thing</h2> <p>If you’re someone who prefers gaming on Windows, you can swap out SteamOS for Windows 11 and run that operating system instead. I wouldn’t recommend doing this, but hey, I’m not your dad.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine will be available in every country where the Steam Deck is sold</h2> <p>If you can legally buy a Steam Deck where you live now, you’ll be able to buy a Steam Machine, Frame, and Controller when they launch globally in 2026. Here’s the list of countries where the Steam Deck is currently for sale:</p> <ul id="658bd5bd-5531-4e7a-8de2-8daaef2adc91"> <li>USA</li> <li>Canada</li> <li>UK</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>France</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>Japan</li> <li>South Korea</li> <li>Taiwan</li> <li>Hong Kong</li> </ul> <h2>The Steam Deck, Controller, and Frame VR headset all work together</h2> <p>Valve is making a big deal about how all of these new Steam devices work together and connect in various ways. So you can, for example, stream a newer game from your Steam Machine to your Steam Deck. Or play a Steam Deck favorite of yours natively on the Steam Frame headset while using the Steam Controller completely wirelessly. And of course, all your Steam games and progress hop around seamlessly between every device.</p>

 <h2>Steam Controller’s thumbsticks sound very fancy</h2> <p>The Steam Controller includes <a href="https://tmrjoystick.com/">Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) thumbsticks,</a> which are even better, more reliable, and more precise than Hall Effect sticks.&nbsp;“They’re super responsive, meaning that we’re able to lower the default dead zone by more than half. And super reliable. They’ll keep drift at bay much, much, much longer. These things are super great,” Steve Cardinali, an engineer at Valve, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/steam-controller-specs-availability-hands-on/">told <em>PC Gamer.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>The Steam Controller fully supports gyro aiming</h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/how-gyro-support-was-added-into-the-new-steam-controller-is-a-typical-valve-story/">Here’s a fun story:</a> The Steam Controller features full gyroscopic control because one person at Valve is way into gyro aiming and moved his desk into the same place the device was being designed to help get the feature in the gamepad. All you fans of gyro aiming should thank that person if you get the chance.</p> <h2>Steam Frame is basically a Steam Deck on your face</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000643622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643622">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While they don’t run on the same hardware, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe">Steam Frame VR headset</a> runs the same OS as the Steam Deck and should feel familiar to anyone who has played Valve’s portable PC. And because it’s a standalone device that runs SteamOS natively, all your Steam Deck games can be played on it in a big virtual theater.</p>

 <h2>The new VR headset is built for streaming, so no more wires</h2> <p>While you can plug a Steam Frame into a computer, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/hands-on-steam-frame-impressions/">Valve has designed the device to be totally wireless</a>. It uses a dedicated 6 GHz connection via an included USB dongle to make sure your game is streamed perfectly to the headset. Those who have tried it out say it’s flawless, and the lack of cables is freeing in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>All Steam Deck Verified games will instantly be Steam Machine Verified</h2> <p>Valve is expanding its Verified program with the launch of all this new hardware. So now games can be Steam Deck, Steam Machine, and/or Steam Frame Verified. And because the Steam Machine is so much more powerful than the Steam Deck and supports a controller experience, Valve is automatically marking all Steam Deck Verified games as Steam Machine Verified. That means this device will launch in 2026 with a shit-ton of games that should, in theory, just play without issue on it.</p> <h2>You can stream games from the Steam Machine to the Steam Deck</h2> <p>While someone is watching TV, you can use the Steam Machine to play a newer, more taxing game on your Steam Deck wirelessly via streaming. It’s like the Wii U is back, but actually good.</p>
