And that’s really depressing to think about considering how bad 2023 was for game developers and the media covering the industry. Still, even a shitty year can have nice moments and wonderful surprises.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121">So as we have done before</a></span>, let’s highlight some of the best video game-related surprises in 2024. The stuff that keeps us going. That makes a terrible, horrible year a bit more manageable. I’m not saying a great game coming out of nowhere or a cool announcement happening can fix anything, but it can at least distract us from all the bad news out there. And that’s something, I think.</p></div></div><div><p>It’s hard to remember a time before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span>, but it did exist.

It practically appeared out of nowhere and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617">became one of 2024's best games</a></span>.

For about three years, after its 2019 announcement, people waited and waited until 2022 finally came along and let them play <em>Elden Ring.</em> I think most assumed a similar wait would follow for a sequel, but instead, a<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335"> spin-off co-op sequel was announced in December</a></span> and will be out in 2025. Nice!</p></div><div><p>While you always hope a new video game will be good, sometimes it’s hard not to get nervous or cynical. That was the case with <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>ahead of its December release. </p><p>While I wanted the game to be great, I was nervous. How would a first-person <em>Indiana Jones </em>game work? I wasn’t sure. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174">Then I (and others) played <em>Great Circle</em></a></span><em> </em>and discovered a really special game that plays more like <em>Dishonored </em>or <em>Hitman </em>than<em> Call of Duty</em> or <em>Uncharted</em>. Great stuff!

However, what I didn’t expect was for Sega to make an entire event out of finally giving the brooding black hedgehog his due.</p><p>In April, Sega announced that 2024 would be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shadow-the-hedgehog-fearless-sonic-movie-3-generations-1851398367&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-the-hedgehog-fearless-sonic-movie-3-generations-1851398367">Year of Shadow</a></span>.

After the series made a hard pivot away from its ensemble cast to focus mostly on Sonic and his inner circle, Shadow had become a bit player in most games. Seeing Sega do right by him and make such a grand spectacle of it was easily one of the biggest surprises for <em>Sonic </em>fans this year. And hey, it looks like he’ll be part of the live-action movies in the future as well, so Sega can’t just abandon him again. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d3c559643b3ad87a747f7b9c9d0acfb" data-recommend-id="image://6d3c559643b3ad87a747f7b9c9d0acfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows John Marston from RDR.

But it was still annoying that the legendary open-world game wasn’t available on PC. That finally changed this year, with a solid PC port of<em> Red Dead Redemption</em>. At last, you can play this classic game at high framerates and long draw distances. Oh and you can mod it and make it even better, too. Fantastic! </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2493f761eed24e810247ec3a0cdf6391" data-recommend-id="image://2493f761eed24e810247ec3a0cdf6391" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->GOG</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2493f761eed24e810247ec3a0cdf6391" data-recommend-id="image://2493f761eed24e810247ec3a0cdf6391" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When Good Old Games launched in 2008, the number one issue on PC games players’ minds was DRM. Digital Rights Management was throttling video games, making official, paid-for games work far worse than pirated versions, and it was a whole, grisly mess. Good Old Games launched from the studios of CD Projekt in Poland as a store that revived classic games, got them to work on modern machines, and freed them of all DRM. And the people celebrated.</p><p>As time went on, the store shifted to selling more modern games alongside classics, and dropped the name in favor of its acronym, GOG. While it maintained the no-DRM rule (beyond a couple of controversies), it also somewhat lost its purpose.

If they stick to it, if the commitment is for real, this could set a new standard that other companies may feel compelled to follow. - John Walker</p></div></div><div><p>It’s always been an odd, contentious thing in the <em>Legend of Zelda </em>fandom that the series is named after its titular princess but she rarely plays a starring role. There was hope up to the eleventh hour that <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>would let players actually inhabit Princess Zelda as they explored its open world, but it wasn’t meant to be. </p><p>However, in 2024, we finally got a mainline <em>Zelda </em>game that lets you play as the leading lady.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a></span> is one of the last big hurrahs for the Switch as we head into next year and Nintendo releases the long-awaited successor. The game is a bit divisive, replacing protagonist Link’s typical sword-and-board gameplay for a magic-based “echoes” system used more for puzzle solving than scrapping it up. But hey, fans had been asking for a Zelda-led <em>Zelda</em> game for ages, and hopefully, this is a sign that more could come in the future. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>This year was the 30th anniversary of PlayStation.
