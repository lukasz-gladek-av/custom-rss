              <p><span>Loyalty is a funny thing. Sometimes it’s earned, sometimes it’s bought, and sometimes it’s won over by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-competitive-ranked-hero-bans-fika-2000668681"><span>cute kitty cats in jetpacks</span></a><i><span>.</span></i><span> The latter was on full display this week as</span><i><span> Overwatch </span></i><span>fans reversed momentum in the game’s latest event to unlock new skins in the latest event.</span></p> <p><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s current season has players siding with either titular peace-keeping group or the terrorist organization Talon over the course of the next six weeks. At first, Talon was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-talon-sides-event-allegiance-rewards-lootbox-2000668184"><span>pulling off a decisive victory</span></a><span> against Overwatch, with fans defecting to the villainous group for laughs and lootboxes. Now that the second week is upon us, the rewards have refreshed, and players have been given the option to switch sides to win different prizes. Well, a lot of people did, and have sold out Talon for Overwatch so they can get a bunch of cute </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-tether-bob-dva-ultimate-flight-2000666163"><span>Jetpack Cat</span></a><span> cosmetics.</span></p>

 <p><span>Overwatch is currently winning out on the faction war with a pretty significant lead of 59.42 percent of players siding with Winston, Sojourn, and the rest of the good guys, while Vendetta’s new reign as Talon is only drawing 40.58 percent of the vote. I’m not judging these fickle allegiances too hard. Ideologies are ever changing and contain multitudes. What we believe in one week of February 2026 might be completely different the following week.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000670714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670714">© Blizzard Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But you know what is forever? A profile picture of Jetpack Cat. This week’s rewards include two profile pictures, a voice line, and a profile banner all with the prettiest girl at Watchpoint: Gibraltar. It looks like that was enough to get people to stop doing terrorism on behalf of their Italian mommy.</span></p>

 <p><span>This all comes alongside the latest </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>lore drop, which includes an audio drama of Brigitte recalling meeting Fika, the cat that would one day don a jetpack, and exploring design ideas to get her feline companion off the ground and in the air. </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> is restructuring its seasons to integrate narrative more heavily, and this week it looks like the story content we’re getting corresponds to the rewards players are getting. So if future seasons keep this Splatfest-esque battle going, we’ll probably get used to seeing people hopping back and forth between both sides to unlock cosmetics.</span></p>

  <p><span>Will we get another lore drop next week as the rewards refresh? It’s unclear at the moment, as this is the first season </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> has been using the story-driven format to drive in-game events. The in-game Story menu has two locked story drops left for this season, which is running until April, so we likely won’t get new lore on a weekly basis. Whatever we do get, however, will factor into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s remaining seasons in 2026</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>&nbsp;</em>ended with a <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285">post-credits scene featuring Amy Rose</a>, Sonic’s ally and love interest, but she doesn’t speak during that brief appearance. That’s because they hadn’t cast her yet, but that’s officially changed, as <em>Frozen&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Good Place&nbsp;</em>actor Kristen Bell will be voicing the hammer-swinging hedgehog in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-film-sequel-confirmed-march-spring-2027-sega-1851744323">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>&nbsp;</em>next year.</p> <p>Ben Schwartz, who voices Sonic in the films, announced on Instagram that Bell would be joining the cast in the fourth movie, which is set to premiere on March 19, 2027. The post includes an image of both actors holding little figurines of their characters.</p>

 <blockquote><p>WE HAVE OUR AMY ROSE!!! And I could not be more excited!!! Please welcome the incredible @kristenanniebell to the @sonicmovie family!!!</p></blockquote>   <p>Bell joins the stacked voice cast of Schwartz as Sonic, Keanu Reeves as Shadow, Idris Elba as Knuckles, and Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Tails. O’Shaughnessey is the only actor reprising her role from the&nbsp;<em>Sonic </em>games. Jim Carrey also stars in the films as Doctor Eggman, though it’s unclear if he’ll return for the fourth film given his character’s fate at the end of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. He does <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jim-carrey-says-hes-down-to-return-for-sonic-4/1100-6528618/">sound interested, though</a>. What we know about <em>Sonic 4&nbsp;</em>implies that <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775">some time-travel shenanigans</a> are in order, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Carrey popped back up as some kind of multiverse variant or something.</p> <p><em>Sonic 4&nbsp;</em>isn’t the only movie in the works over at Paramount, as the company is also working on <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-live-action-movie-spin-off-shadow-4-5-2000649220">some kind of spin-off</a> for 2028. Fans are speculating that Shadow, rather than showing up in the fourth movie given its likely focus on Amy, may instead be the focus of this spin-off film. Maybe Rouge the Bat will finally show up in that movie since she was omitted from the last one, despite it being a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, the game in which she debuted.</p>

              <p>Almost everything about Pokémon’s latest set, Ascended Heroes, has been strange. The so-called “special” set officially released on January 30, but due to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-ascended-heroes-delay-booster-2000664086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">undisclosed distribution issues</a> only the triple-pack sticker collection made it to shelves. The next wave of products should go on sale on February 20, including the all-important Elite Trainer Box, and this might perhaps cause the current resale values of the cards to calm down. Because right now, they’re out of control.</p> <p>Thanks to the enigmatic Pokémon Company International (TPCi), we’ve been fortunate enough to have received a bunch of Ascended Heroes packs early, including this week’s ETB, and even a couple of collectors boxes due for release in March. Each contain the same packs you can (in theory) buy right now in the sticker collections, but with different bonus materials (and yes, we <em>could</em> have sold them for four times their recommended retail price as that’s what pre-orders are currently being resold for, but thankfully we have some morals). It is the most peculiar of sets. It’s the largest collection ever, with a record-breaking 217 regular cards (including ex), and then a whopping 77 ultra-rares and higher. This is then made even more bonkers by the fact that every single regular card comes in multiple reverse-holos, with a matching energy-type reverse holo each, and then one of four different Poké Ball variants, as well as Team Rocket reverses for their cards!</p>

 <p>Good luck actually buying them, though. The same issues that have plagued the hobby since November 2024 continue, and at this point it can only be assumed that TPCi is deliberately ensuring they continue by constantly ramping up the number of special rarity cards designed around fervent player nostalgia. Not only does Mega Evolutions: Ascended Heroes feature the continued reintroduction of Mega Pokémon, but it also sees the return of what are now being called “Mega Attack rares,” the cards with their moves written in bold Japanese lettering that last appeared in 2015’s XY Primal Clash, and remain extremely collectible. Oh, and it also brings back Trainer Pokémon cards, revived last year during the swansong of Scarlet &amp; Violet and then weirdly abandoned just as it was getting going. That not enough to cause a frenzy? Well then, why not put in two gold cards, one featuring Mega Dragonite, then other Mega Charizard Y, and then the most astonishingly detailed Special Illustration Rare of Gengar. Yup, it’s like they took everything that can cause a set to go crazy, and put it all into one set, right at the point when buying Pokémon cards at all has become close to impossible.</p> <h2>Pull the other one</h2> <p>Of course, all that would suggest that if you&nbsp;<em>can</em> find some Ascended Heroes, it’s party time, right? Well, somehow no, because despite featuring more special art cards than any set in history, they’re also wildly difficult to pull. We were fortunate enough to open around 35 packs, and didn’t pull a single one of the 22 SIRs, let alone a gold card. Early stats suggest that SIRs are in fact found in one in every 100 packs, which is&nbsp;<em>ridiculous</em>, and the golds are in one in every thousand. This forced rarity is of course making resale prices even more crazy than they’ve been at any point during the last <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">18 months of the TCG’s destructive explosion</a>.</p>

 <p>In fact, from all those packs we only saw a single Illustration Rare, although from watching YouTubers opening packs this seems like it might have been some especially bad luck. There were also six regular ex cards, two ultra rares, and rather pleasingly, two Mega Attack rares, the Lucario and the Diancie. Which is all to say, the pull rates suck compared to those of previous Mega Evolutions sets, rights when we needed them not to the most.</p>

 <p>I realize this is grimly naive, but it does seem such a shame that such extraordinarily beautiful art is created for these cards, and then made outlandishly difficult to actually see. These cards deserve to be owned and loved, but if you pulled a piece of worthless cardboard for which someone would pay you over a thousand dollars, it enters the territory of being morally dubious <em>not</em> to sell it. (I’m delighted to have this debate in much more detail, if you find this crass or flippant.) Again, as I’ve said for <em>years</em>, I cannot think of any plausible reason why TPCi does not sell the artwork for these cards as prints on its stores. Let it be appreciated!</p> <p>Anyway, all that aside, let’s get mercenary about it. If you do find a pack and pull any of the following cards, you’re rich. Because we are in some whole new territory now. Over the years that I’ve been writing these articles I’ve seen the prices fluctuate, but it’s almost always been the case that the cards in tenth place are around $20, and sometimes a lot lower. The card in tenth this time is currently $164. In fact, you’d have to go as low as 18th to find a card under a hundred bucks, and <em>37th</em> for a card under $20. These are record-breaking prices across a set. These are the weirdest times. All prices were accurate (according to <em>TCG Player</em>) at the time of writing.</p>

 <hr> <h2>N’s Zoroark ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670681"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670681">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>With the massive increase in quality of the Illustration Rare cards, the&nbsp;<em>Special</em> Illustration Rares have had to up their game too, and you can really see the result here. N is displayed in his classic anime way, with that watercolor Zoroark, but then look at that background. That is some astonishing detail. And it’ll cost ya. As I said, even at this point in the top 10, we are already in the big money. This card is currently going for around <strong>$164</strong>.</p> <hr> <h2>Mega Feraligatr ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670688" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670688"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670688">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I rather love that this card is getting so much attention. Its 400 attack is hilariously OP, but that applies to the $8 regular ex versio… WAIT, WHAT?! The regular ex is going for EIGHT DOLLARS?! Goddammit, people, get a grip. Those are 50c cards! Anyway, back on track, this is just a joyfully cartoony card that is somehow outselling the likes of <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/ascendedheroes/279.jpg">Iono’s Bellibolt</a> and the astonishing <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/ascendedheroes/283.jpg">Mega Hawlucha</a>. I mean, it’s obviously not worth the&nbsp;<strong>$193</strong> it’d cost you to buy right now, but it’s at least a lot of fun!</p> <hr> <h2>Lillie’s Clefairy ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670690" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670690"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670690">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s your creepy underage waifu card for the set. Beautiful art, but given no one usually gives a shit about Clefairy you know this isn’t fetching&nbsp;<strong>$247</strong> based on it’s strength against Dragon-type opponent Pokémon.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Team Rockets’s Mewtwo ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670691" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670691"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670691">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m delighted people are loving this card so much, but it’s doing nothing for me. Look closely and you can see the detail, but sit back and it just seems such a bland design to me. Still, it’s Giovanni and Mewtwo, and that’s enough for most to smash open their piggybanks. Although it’d have to be a very big piggy, given this costs <strong>$336</strong>. And yeah, you’re right: these prices&nbsp;<em>are</em> jumping up by astonishing amounts.</p> <hr> <h2>Pikachu ex 277 SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670692"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670692">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Oh my gosh I love this card so much. It’s just unburdened joy in pink and yellow, as well as being the most adorable pastiche of the overly serious nature of the terastalized Pokémon we saw in Scarlet &amp; Violet cards, the splendid work of artist James Turner. It also packs a punch with a 300 attack, and the ability to survive a single knock-out hit from an opponent. You’ll want four of these in your deck, right?! And they’re only <strong>$364</strong> each! (And that’s not even close to how expensive this same card is about to get…)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Mega Dragonite ex Gold</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670694" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670694"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670694">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I was very surprised when the reintroduction of gold cards caused such clamor toward the end of last year. They had very much gone out of favor, and an attempt to reintroduce them during Scarlet &amp; Violet with a garish green-n’-gold design was a massive flop. It is notable that the new gold prints are far better than we’ve seen before, and the illustration above does not do them justice. The texturing and holo effect is really something, making them look like something truly special compared to the rest of the cards. And yet, here’s Dragonite—the mascot for Ascended Heroes—stuck down in fifth. Obviously I’m not suggesting it’s not doing well—it will cost you a mindblowing&nbsp;<strong>$458</strong>—but it’s still interesting that it’s significantly behind the far more colorful and joyous SIR Dragonite that’s yet to come.</p> <hr> <h2>Pikachu ex 276 SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670695">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m not certain, and please let me know if I’m wrong, but I think this might be the first time the same Pokémon has had two different SIRs in the same set. Of course, if anyone’s going to get that, it’s Pikachu, and it’s such a pleasure that it’s in two such lovely cards. We have the YIPPEE Pikachu a couple of spots above, and the UH-OH Pikachu here. This one’s by an artist brand new to the TCG, called booota, and if this is the standard I can’t wait to see what’s next. Oh yeah, the price:&nbsp;<strong>$516</strong>. Yikes.</p> <hr> <h2>Mega Dragonite ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670698" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670698"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670698">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Oh what a thing of beauty. Yes, Mega Dragonite is ridiculous with those wings coming out of its head (god, imagine the pain of flying), but it looks resplendent here, and even better for being surrounded by Dragonair in that swirling background. Masterful work by the reliable DOM. The only issue being, if you wanted one, you’d have to give up eating for a month and pay&nbsp;<strong>$564</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Mega Charizard Y ex Gold</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670687"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670687">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yup, they snuck a Charizard into the Dragonite-themed set, just to make things even more unimaginably stupid. And then they made it so rare that it guaranteed the set to be even more valuable to scalpers than any before. The solution to this insanity? Print more of the most collectible cards, so regular people have a greater incentive to buy packs, but the resale market is flattened by over-population. TPCi isn’t making a cent from any of these resales, so what exactly does it have to lose by addressing this problem?</p> <p>Anyhow, it isn’t doing anything to help, and that’s why this card will cost you an eye-watering <strong>$638</strong> pack fresh.</p> <hr> <h2>Mega Gengar ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670702" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670702"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670702">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Poor old Dragonite. Not only does it get usurped by the random inclusion of a Charizard in its own set, but then it gets shoved aside by the ever-mean Gengar. This beautiful, stormy card has blown the top off the market, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ascendant-heroes-mega-gengar-ex-2000664572">at one point selling for as much as $1300</a>. Things have somewhat calmed down over the last couple of weeks, but the price is still out there. Right now, before things hopefully stabilize with the addition of more population with February 20’s new releases, this card is still fetching <strong>$830 </strong>on average.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Normal </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span> fans are excited about Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi action-adventure because </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-mega-man-conspiracy-theory-debunked-2000621414"><span>it reminds them a bit of </span><i><span>Mega Man</span></i></a><span> or because they find its concept, setting, or gameplay intriguing</span><span>.</span><span> But some of the game’s fans are far from normal. Reactions to the infantile appearance of<em> Pragmata</em>‘s android protagonist Diana on the r/Pragmata subreddit have prompted one of its moderators to publicly step down from their role, with them citing the overwhelming influx of “pedo shit” as the cause. Another <em>Pragmata</em> community has been shut down altogether by Reddit over inappropriate posts.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pragmata </span></i><span>community on Reddit has splintered into three distinct subreddits: r/Pragmata, the main subreddit, r/PragmataSFW, a self-described “attempt at building up a sub that isn’t plastered with pedophile dogwhistles,” and r/Pragmata_, which was just banned on February 18 for breaking Reddit’s “Rule 4.” For context, Rule 4 </span><a href="https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules"><span>explicitly forbids</span></a><span> the “sharing of sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving minors.”</span></p> <p><span>In one </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PragmataSFW/comments/1qw54aq/i_was_a_mod_for_rpragmata_and_it_disgusts_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>February 4 post</span></a><span> on r/PragmataSFW, moderator JoeZocktGames stated that none of their “proposals to be more strict were taken seriously,” and derided the r/Pragmata subreddit for inviting “several mods with feeds full of lewd Loli shit.” The user also claimed that another moderator, who is still part of the moderation team on the subreddit, had a post manually removed by Reddit’s main staff because it featured obscene artwork of Diana. “You know it’s bad when mods post CP and Reddit needs to step in.”</span></p> <p><span>Prior to moderator JoeZocktGames stepping down, the moderation team behind the original subreddit attempted to address the “</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pragmata/comments/1qtgjj8/regarding_recent_toxicity/"><span>recent toxicity</span></a><span>” by banning “users who post sexualised content involving Diana” and removing “any sexualised comments, jokes, or content” involving the character. This is what led to the creation of r/Pragmata_, which solely focused on posting “lewd” artwork of Diana. The contents of the subreddit were </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1r7x4ul/dawg_i_just_opened_reddit/"><span>immediately condemned</span></a><span> elsewhere on Reddit.</span></p> <p><span>This wave of r/Pragmata_ scrutiny may be what caused Reddit to take action, leading to the subreddit being banned earlier today. Since Rule 4 states only that “sexual, abusive, or suggestive” content featuring minors and “any predatory or inappropriate behavior involving a minor” is strictly prohibited, it suggests the subreddit’s focus on Diana is the main reason for its removal.</span></p> <p><span>This is, sadly, not the first time that the </span><i><span>Pragmata </span></i><span>community has drawn ire for its inappropriate focus on Diana, as the “Cute” and “Funny” tags, a well-known “pedophile dog whistle,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1l4gobm/steam_users_are_tagging_pragmata_with_pedophile/"><span>were spotted</span></a><span> on its Steam store page back in June 2025.</span></p>
