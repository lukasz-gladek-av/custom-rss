              <p>You know it: your gaming mouse is what makes… or breaks your performance. That split-second delay, the cursor skipping across the screen during a flick shot, or buttons that don’t register fast enough-all deal breakers when you’re trying to rank up. The Logitech G502 Hero has been a favorite among serious gamers for years and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5326/">Amazon just dropped the price from $69 down to $37 as they clear out remaining stock</a>. This<strong> 46% discount</strong> brings one of the most respected gaming mice down to impulse-buy territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5326/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision That Matters in Games</h2>
<p>The Hero 25K sensor tracks with 1:1 accuracy over a range from 100 to 25,600 DPI, which means the cursor goes exactly where you want it without any smoothing, filtering, or acceleration messing with your muscle memory. High DPI settings let you make huge sweeping movements with tiny hand motions, perfect for fast-paced shooters where you need to whip around instantly. Lower DPI gives you pixel-perfect precision for sniping or editing work when you need that surgical control.</p>
<p>The adjustable weight system lets you change how the mouse feels in your hand by <strong>adding up to five 3.6-gram weights or taking them away</strong>. Some gamers like a light mouse to move quickly around, while some like it with more heft for stability and control. You’ll be able to try different weight configurations until you find what feels right for how you grip the mouse and what games you play.</p>



<p>The <strong>11 programmable buttons</strong> give you instant access to abilities, macros or commands without reaching for your keyboard. Map your most-used actions to thumb buttons, assign weapon switches to side clicks or set up complex macro sequences for MMOs and MOBAs. The <strong>onboard memory stores up to five profiles</strong> directly on the mouse so your settings follow you to LAN parties, friend’s houses, or tournament setups without needing to reinstall software.</p>
<p>The <strong>RGB lighting syncs with other Logitech G gear</strong> via Lightsync technology and lets you coordinate colors across your whole setup. You can match your team colors, set up reactive lighting that responds to in-game events or just pick colors that look good on your desk. The lighting isn’t just aesthetic either: you can set different colors for different DPI levels so you know at a glance which sensitivity you’re running.</p>
<p>The <strong>wired connection eliminates any sort of battery anxiety or input lag</strong> that a wireless mouse may introduce. You never have to stop mid-game to charge it, never have drops in connection during clutch moments, and never have to deal with added weight from batteries. The braided cable resists tangling and holds up better than its rubber-coated alternatives, which inevitably crack and fray.</p>
<p>For $37, this mouse is cheaper than going out to dinner but upgrades a piece of hardware you touch for hours every single day.</p>

              <p>VR headsets open up gaming, entertainment and productivity in ways that a regular screen just can’t match but the entry price usually makes you hesitate. The Meta Quest 3S 128GB normally sells for $299 on Meta’s official website with nothing extra included.: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/">undercuts that price by $10, dropping it to $289, and throws in an exclusive Cardboard Hero Bundle for Gorilla Tag worth $45</a> that includes the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor, and 1000 shiny rocks.</p>
<p>You’re essentially <strong>getting $55 in extra value compared to buying directly from Meta</strong>, which explains why Amazon moved over 10,000 units in the past month alone. And you also get a 3-month Meta Horizon+ trial subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mixed Reality That Actually Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S brings mixed reality right into your living room and merges digital objects with your real environment. You could place a virtual screen on your actual wall, play a game where aliens climb through your real furniture or set up multiple browser windows floating around your desk while still seeing your keyboard and coffee mug.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor gives the Quest a double boost in graphical performance for smoother-running games with sharper details, and less stuttering during extreme action scenes. The high-definition resolution makes text readable when you’re browsing the web or working in the virtual space, solving one of the biggest complaints about earlier VR headsets where everything looked fuzzy.</p>
<p>The <strong>128GB storage gives you room for dozens of games and apps</strong> without constantly deleting things just to make space. Most VR games run from 2-10GB, so you can have your favorites installed alongside your productivity apps, social platforms, and entertainment content. Wireless freedom means no cables tethering to a PC or gaming console-just put on and jump into what you want to do.</p>



<p>With Touch Plus controllers, you get precision in games and apps while realistic haptic feedback lets you feel textures, impacts, and interactions. Ditch controllers entirely and use hand tracking to swipe through menus, grab virtual objects, or gesture in social spaces. The flexibility of switching between controller precision for gaming and natural hand movements for casual browsing makes the system adapt to whatever you’re doing, not force you into one control scheme.</p>



<p><strong>Home Theater Mode turns any room into your personal cinema</strong> with a massive virtual screen in front of you while it dimmers your surroundings. You can watch movies, sports, or YouTube on a screen that feels bigger than most people’s actual TVs while you lounge on your couch. You can plug in any standard headphones using a USB-C adapter into the 3.5mm headphone jack or plug in USB-C headphones directly for private audio that doesn’t disturb anyone else in the house.</p>
<p>The <strong>3-month Meta Horizon+ trial subscription</strong> includes access to a rotating catalog of games with new additions each month, giving you plenty to explore right out of the box without buying individual titles immediately.</p>
<p>The Amazon-exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle adds immediate value for one of VR’s most popular multiplayer games. Gorilla Tag has millions of players running around virtual playgrounds using arm movements to climb and jump, and the Cardboard Hero gear gives your character a unique look right from the start. The $45 value of this bonus content combined with the $10 price reduction makes Amazon’s deal mathematically better than buying from Meta directly.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-unloads-the-1800w-ecoflow-power-station-now-priced-below-budget-gas-generators.1343119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages always seem to happen at the worst time—during a winter storm when you need your heat, in the middle of cooking dinner, or right when you’re on an important video call. The problem is solved with gas generators but includes exhaust fumes, constant noise, and the hassle of storing fuel. Portable power stations give you clean backup power without the headaches, and the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic just dropped to $399 from $599 on Amazon</a>. This thing pumps out <strong>1800W with a 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery that lasts over a decade</strong>, charges from empty to 80% in 45 minutes, and kicks in automatically in under 10 milliseconds when the grid goes down. You’re basically getting backup power that costs less than a decent budget gas generator but works indoors, runs silently and doesn’t require you to drag out gas cans every time the lights flicker.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Power for the Devices You Need</h2>
<p>The 1800W continuous output handles most household essentials. Your refrigerator keeps running during an outage so you don’t lose a freezer full of food; your space heater keeps one room comfortable when the furnace goes down, and you can make coffee with an electric kettle or run a microwave to warm up meals. The 3600W surge capacity covers those brief power spikes when devices first turn on, like when your fridge compressor kicks in or you fire up a power tool. EcoFlow’s X-Boost technology even pushes the system up to 2600W for heavier loads and opens possibilities for running larger appliances that might trip smaller power stations.</p>
<p>That 1024Wh capacity translates into very real-world runtime that actually matters: You can run a modern refrigerator for about 12 hours, keep a laptop charged through multiple work sessions, power LED lights for days, or run a CPAP machine through several nights of sleep. Winter camping or RV trips become way more comfortable when you can run an electric blanket, charge multiple devices and still have power left for morning coffee.</p>



<p>X-Stream fast charging fills the battery from 0 to 80% in just 45 minutes, meaning you are not waiting all day for it to be ready. Most portable power stations take four to six hours to reach a full charge, so shaving that time down makes a huge difference when you need backup power in a hurry. The UPS function-all under 10 milliseconds-switches automatically to battery power the instant it detects an outage to protect computers, routers, medical equipment, or anything else that can’t handle sudden power loss.</p>



<p>The battery chemistry LiFePO4 lasts more than 10 years with daily use, which is in another league compared to the cheaper lithium batteries that degrade after a couple of years. EcoFlow uses the same EV-grade battery design utilized in electric cars, and a smart Battery Management System prevents overcharging, overheating, and other issues that prematurely kill batteries. You invest in something that works reliably year after year instead of replacing it every few seasons. The system remains safe at extreme temperatures, handles the stress of frequent charging cycles, and maintains consistent power output even while aging.</p>
<p>At $399, you’re getting emergency backup power, camping comfort, and energy independence for less than most people spend on a basic gas generator that sits in the garage leaking fumes.</p>
