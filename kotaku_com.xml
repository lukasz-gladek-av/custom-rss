              <p>Cyber Monday is the last day of this week-long shopping spree, and gaming laptops have had some of the biggest price drops on Amazon. The <strong>Acer Nitro V</strong> has become one of the most popular gaming machines on the platform, and right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6136/"> it’s at a record low price of $799, down from its usual price of $949</a> – and this setup has an <strong>Intel Core i7-13620H processor, an Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, an 15.6-inch Full HD screen (165Hz) and a 1TB Gen 4 SSD</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6136/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RTX 4050 Offers AI-Enhanced Graphics</h2>
<p>The RTX 4050 GPU has 194 AI TOPS of processing power which lets it use DLSS 3.5 to boost frame rates and improve ray tracing quality at the same time. This technology can handle complicated lighting, shadows and reflections at speeds that would slow down older graphics cards and it means you can use ray tracing in games that support it without losing playability.</p>
<p>DLSS uses AI prediction to make more frames instead of traditional rendering which means you get higher frame rates while keeping the visual quality, which often looks sharper than the native resolution. This is important, especially at 1080p, where the RTX 4050 performs best, pushing most new games well above 60 fps with high settings on.</p>
<p>The <strong>165Hz refresh rate display</strong> updates almost three times faster than standard 60Hz screens. This makes motion smoother, which makes it easier to track enemies in competitive shooters and makes racing games more immersive. This refresh rate noticeably lowers motion blur and input lag and gives you an edge when your reflexes are most important. The 15.6-inch Full HD resolution makes text and details clear without needing the extra power that 1440p or 4K displays do and lets the RTX 4050 run smoothly and give you high frame rates in all of your games.</p>



<p>The <strong>Intel Core i7-13620H processor combines performance cores and efficiency cores</strong> in a hybrid architecture that handles both gaming and productivity workloads effectively. The six performance cores handle tough single-threaded tasks like game logic and physics calculations, while the four efficiency cores handle background tasks without taking resources away from your main apps. This design lets you stream gameplay to Twitch, record it locally, and use Discord all at the same time without the stutters and slowdowns that happen when processors don’t have this core separation.</p>
<p>The 16GB of DDR5 memory runs faster and more efficiently than DDR4 and reduces latency and improving frame times in memory-intensive games while speeding up application launches and file operations. You can upgrade the laptop’s memory from 16GB to 32GB using two DIMM slots. The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD loads games and boots Windows in seconds instead of minutes and it has enough space for your operating system and a large game library, so you don’t have to keep uninstalling games to make room for new ones.</p>



<p>The dual-fan cooling system with its own exhaust vent <strong>keeps the temperature stable during long gaming sessions</strong> and stops the thermal throttling that happens after the first hour of play and makes performance drop. <em>NitroSense</em> software lets you keep an eye on temperatures and fan speeds in real time. It also lets you make your own fan curves that balance noise levels and cooling performance based on what you like. The Thunderbolt 4 port supports simultaneous power delivery, data transfer at 40 Gbps, and display output to external monitors, essentially providing three functions through a single cable connection.</p>
<p>This $799 price undercuts competing laptops with similar specs by $300 to $400, and it brings RTX 4050 performance down to pricing where you’d typically find GTX 1650 or RTX 3050 configurations with weaker processors and slower storage. The Cyber Monday discount expires tonight, making this the last opportunity to grab this configuration at record-low pricing before it returns to regular retail tomorrow.</p>

              <p>Black Friday has come and gone, but you still have one last chance to save on the items you missed bagging during the main event – thanks to Cyber Monday. Most discounts from Black Friday, across a wide range of categories but especially tech, have crawled into this one-day event.</p>
<p>We’re spotting plenty of deals, but one that caught our attention and deserves a mention is the impressive 29% drop on the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 laptop/tablet from last year. It usually sits at $1,200, but the current discount lets you grab one for just $850. Nab it for yourself, or gift it to someone who likes being productive on the go, this holiday season. Since multiple retailers are offering it for less, you might not be able to see the highlighted discount on it right away. If you can’t, click on the “See all buying options” button on the right, and scroll through the list to spot the drop. Add it to your cart, and the offer will apply automatically.</p>

<h2>Vibrant Screen, Plus Exceptional AI Capabilities</h2>
<p>Microsoft calls it a 2-in-1, but it’s not the type where the screen flips all the way around. You’re getting a 13-inch touchscreen display, and you can pair it with a detachable Surface Pro Flex Keyboard, which is sold separately, to convert it into a full-fledged laptop. The screen comes with a built-in kickstand that lets you prop it anywhere you like, whether it’s on a table or your bed for some late-night streaming.</p>
<p>The PixelSense Flow LCD display is bright, delivering sharp, vibrant, and clear visuals to enhance the quality of your favorite shows and movies. The screen is ultra-lightweight at just 1.97 pounds, making it easy to carry around with you on the go. Exceptional power comes from the 10-core Snapdragon X Plus processor, which provides solid performance for both everyday and demanding tasks. You’ll be able to browse, stream, work, and even edit photos/videos without experiencing significant slowdowns. Its powerful NPU is great for those looking forward to using some AI-focused features (real-time translation, noise-canceling, document retrieving, etc) on a regular basis, too.</p>



<p>The built-in 16GB RAM makes multitasking a breeze, whether you’re hopping between a bunch of tabs or trying to use multiple applications at the same time. Storing all your data won’t be a problem, either, thanks to the built-in 512GB SSD. It’s not massive, but still enough to house hundreds of photos and videos, tons of applications, and even a couple of games without feeling limited. Speaking of apps, you’re getting a whole bunch of both useful and popular pre-installed.</p>
<p>Of course, Copilot+ takes the experience even further. Apart from answering your basic questions or generating art from prompts, it provides assistance with retrieving documents, emails, and web pages on your PC. Video calls are made better with auto noise cancellation and distraction blurring. You’ll also enjoy real-time subtitles for 44 languages during video calls or streaming.</p>
<p>Despite all this power and efficiency, the battery life holds up well. On a single charge, you’re looking at around 14 hours of continuous usage, which means you can go an entire day without hunting for your charger or an outlet. There’s a lot more to like about this 2-in-1 machine, whether you’re planning to use it as a tablet or pair it with a keyboard for the ultimate laptop experience. There are multiple color options to choose from, as well, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics. Grab the discount sooner rather than later, as it’s not going to be around forever.</p>

              <p>The biggest sale of the year is coming to an end, but with a bang. Cyber Monday is here, offering one last chance to stock up on the items you missed grabbing during Black Friday. Most of the hefty discounts we saw during Black Friday are still available, but the deals bid adieu tonight. Whether you’re after a multi-port charger or are finally ready to grab a 100-inch TV to enjoy better movie nights during the holidays, today is your day to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Those after a reliable storage solution for their Xbox Series X|S should consider grabbing the Seagate 2TB SSD, which is going for 29% off on Amazon.</a> It normally retails for $260, but the current deal drops the price to $185. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their orders, so there are no extra costs to worry about. Be sure to grab it quick, as the retailer has marked the discount as a fast-selling one. With this speed, it might not even be around after just a couple of hours.</p>

<h2>Massive Capacity, No Compromises on Performance</h2>
<p>No one likes deleting old titles to make room for the latest releases. This SSD gets you a massive 2TB storage capacity, which is enough to house a bunch of games that won’t squeeze into your console’s internal storage. It’s the sweet spot for most casual gamers who are looking to enjoy fresh releases without feeling limited. There’s a 1TB, plus 4TB version of the SSD too, going for $121 and $380, respectively.</p>
<p>The SSD is designed in partnership with Xbox. It uses the Velocity Architecture and lets you play Xbox Series X|S games directly from the expansion card without sacrificing graphics, latency, frame rates, or load times. Thousands of Original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One games offer the exact same experience as the console’s internal SSD, so you won’t feel a difference when you switch between them. You’ll just have way more space, while still enjoying ultra-fast load times and stunning visuals for a truly immersive experience. Additionally, Quick resume support means you can hop between multiple titles from the internal SSD or the expansion card within seconds, without those annoying wait times that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>The setup is plug-and-play. Start by locating the storage expansion slot on the back of your console. Remove the protective cover from the card, and insert it into the slot. Once it clicks into place, you’ll know it’s ready to use. The console will recognize the card and display a notification confirming it. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed. You can also head to your console’s Settings, then choose System &gt; Storage devices to verify the installation. Once everything is set, start playing without feeling limited by storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon throws in a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase, which provides some extra peace of mind.</a> If anything goes wrong, the retailer will replace or repair your expansion card. All things considered, if you’re looking to game better without storage issues coming in your way this holiday season, now is a great time to make the move. This Cyber Monday deal brings the price down of this 2TB expansion card by $75, letting you grab it for $185. If it’s more than you need, consider the 1TB option. Those looking for even more space can grab the 4TB version. Both of these are also discounted. Just make sure to get your orders in fast, because Cyber Monday wraps up tonight.</p>
