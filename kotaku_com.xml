              <p>Capcom confirmed that a big expansion for <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113">last year’s <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> </a>will be revealed later this year. And next week, <em>Wilds</em> will receive more PC performance improvements as part of its one-year anniversary update, which is also the base game’s final major content update.&nbsp; Will it be enough to help turn the game’s ratings around on Steam?</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/j_NjU8O6qSQ">On February 9,</a> Capcom put out a new video celebrating the one-year anniversary of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds.</em> In the fan-focused video, <em>Monster Hunter</em> series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto teased that more information about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds’</em> expansion would be released this summer and offered some hints about&nbsp;how large it will be.</p>

 <p>“We are currently at work on a large-scale expansion similar to <em>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em> for <em>Monster Hunter: Wild</em>s,” said Tsujimoto. “We plan to share more information with you this summer.”</p>  <p>While Tsujimoto didn’t share any other details about the expansion, the producer did provide more details on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/monster-hunter-wilds-new-content-update-and-arch-tempered-arkveld-arrive-february-18/"><em>Wilds</em>‘ big anniversary update arriving on February 18</a>. Players can expect some crossover content with the upcoming spin-off <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3,</em> as well as an anniversary event that will make most previous rewards and quests “re-available.” Each previous seasonal event will also return for a weekly rotation. Players who log in during the event will also receive a free item pack.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, the producer shared some encouraging news about improving <em>Wilds</em>‘ performance, <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-update-optimization-tu4-capcom-when-2000618404">an issue that has plagued and continues to be a problem for the game since its release last February.</a></p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“We have been implementing improvements to game stability and performance since Title Update 4,” Tsujimoto added, “and this [February 18] update will introduce even further improvements.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">This anniversary update is the final “major content update” for the game as the <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> team moves on to developing the upcoming expansion, so hopefully this last big update for the base game can improve performance on PC in a big way. <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">If not, well, I expect modders will keep doing good work on that front</a>.</p>
