              <p>Disney’s 20th Century has announced that a new movie based on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544">long-running animated TV sitcom<em> The Simpsons</em></a> is in the works. The newly announced sequel will arrive in 2027, 20 years after the release of the first <em>Simpsons</em> flick.</p> <p>On September 29,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPMgc7Yj0PE/#"> Disney and 20th Century announced on social media</a> that a new <em>Simpsons</em> film was officially in development. No plot details were shared about the movie, but Disney did post a teaser poster for the upcoming sequel. The poster features Homer Simpson grabbing a pink doughnut covered in sprinkles shaped like the number 2, likely hinting that the movie will be titled <em>The Simpsons Movie 2</em>.&nbsp; The tagline “Homer’s combing back for seconds” is included on the poster. So, good news, Homer is back. Shocking, I know, but there you go.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Woohoo! The Simpsons are coming to theaters with an all-new movie on July 23, 2027! <a href="https://t.co/wVqxwn8rLc">pic.twitter.com/wVqxwn8rLc</a></p> <p>— 20th Century Studios (@20thcentury) <a href="https://twitter.com/20thcentury/status/1972723057396690948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Created by Matt Groening and premiering in 1989,&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons</em> is the longest-running sitcom on TV. While many have criticized the show’s quality since the late ’90, the series has remained extremely popular on TV and is considered an anchor of Fox’s Sunday block of animated TV shows. The original <em>Simpsons</em> movie premiered in July 2007 and was a huge box office hit, earning over $536 million at the global box office. That movie featured a story about a giant dome being put over the town of Springfield due to pollution. It also brought back old former writers, took years to make, and featured a more detailed art style.</span></p> <p><span>We’ve heard rumors for years of a second <em>Simpsons</em> movie, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_Who_Came_to_Be_Dinner#:~:text=However%2C%20according%20to,a%20regular%20episode.">including a proposed follow-up featuring the franchise’s alien characters</a> Kang and </span><span>Kodos</span><span>. That movie didn’t move forward as the writing staff couldn’t stretch the plot out to a full-length movie. But now it seems the writers and producers behind the show have finally nailed the plot for the next flick. Now we just have to wait until 2027.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-retro-trailer-judgement-day-snes-1851766852"><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em></a> is an upcoming video game adaptation of the original ’90s action movie sequel that is designed to look, sound, and play like classic 2D games from that era. <em>No Fate</em> looks really awesome. But sadly, due to ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump, this cool-looking <em>Terminator</em> game has been delayed (again) from October to November.</p> <p>On September 28, <em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau announced that the upcoming side-scrolling action game was being delayed a second time until November 26. <a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-november-26-2025">In a statement posted to the publisher’s official website</a>, the company blamed the delay on “ongoing global trade and tariff changes” that caused shipping issues with components needed to produce the Day One and Collector’s Editions versions of the game. And because the studio and publisher want to ship the game to all platforms and users at the same time, <em>No Fate’s</em> release date was pushed back. This delay affects digital and physical copies worldwide.</p>  <p>“We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we’re sorry for this further delay,” said Reef Entertainment. “The team is working hard to make sure your wait is worth it, and we can’t wait to share <em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> with you all this November.”</p> <p>This isn’t the first delay for<em> Terminator 2D: No Fate.</em> In July, the 2D action platformer based on James Cameron’s iconic action flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was delayed from its initial release date of<a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-october-31-2025"> September 5 to October 31, just in time for Halloween</a>. But that’s not happening anymore, and you can directly blame Trump, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">who continues to screw around with tariffs haphazardl</a>y, causing global chaos for those trying to buy, ship, or import products or resources to the United States.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-max-11-tablet-hits-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days-hundreds-cheaper-than-an-ipad-2000627185</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-fire-max-11-tablet-hits-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days-hundreds-cheaper-than-an-ipad.1311784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’d be telling you that this limited-time deal on the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is hot, or that it’s fire, or that it’s a scorcher, but honestly, would you still respect us in the morning? So we’ll dispense with the terrible puns and cut straight to the deal, because it’s one of the better ones we’ve seen in a while on this great, affordable tablet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/">It’s 32% off for a limited time, turning a very good $280 price into a great one at just $190.</a></p>
<p>To put things in perspective, the Amazon Fire Max 11 is an 11-inch tablet with an octa-core processor, 14-hour battery life, expandable storage of up to 1TB via microSD card, and 2.4 million pixel resolution. As an Amazon product it blends seamlessly with the rest of the Amazon ecosystem, including Prime Video, Kindle, Audible, and Luna, along with your smart home devices via either Alexa or the Device Dashboard. And here’s the kicker — at this sale price it’s over $700 less than the 11-inch M4 iPad Pro, and $375 less than the 11-inch M3 iPad Air.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Features, Not Price</h2>
<p>There are probably metrics and benchmark tests that put those pricier iPads ahead of the Fire Max 11, but not nearly enough to quantify the price difference. The octa-core processor at the heard of the Fire Max 11 is certainly no slouch when it comes to streaming, multitasking, and gaming on Luna. The 128GB of storage is small, but so easily and inexpensively expandable thanks to the microSD card slot that the Apple tablets lack.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 speeds, a robust 14-hour battery life, 8MP camera, and options to expand into a more laptop-like experience with the sold-separately Fire Max 11 Keyboard Case — which also happens to be&nbsp;<em>way</em> more affordable than Apple’s Magic Keyboard — all make the Fire Max 11 highly competitive even before you do a price comparison. Once you check out those numbers, this isn’t even a fair contest.</p>



<h2>Beautifully Basic</h2>
<p>When you look at the Fire Max 11 — and this is the latest, most updated iteration of the Fire Max — in the context of being a fully integrated part of the massive Amazon ecosystem, it’s a brilliant tablet, especially for just $190. It’s not going to compete with a laptop as a productivity machine, although this deal does come with a free 3-month Microsoft 365 trial, but as an e-reader, streaming device, smart-home control panel, and light gaming device, it’s an exceptional tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-octa-core-processor-lockscreen/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6?tag=kotaku01-20">This model of the Amazon Fire Max currently on sale for just $190</a> has the max 128GB storage and also comes with lockscreen ads deactivated. The $90 savings on this deal are great, and even greater when you tack them onto the hundreds you save by avoiding the super-bougie competitor tablets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You would think that The Pokémon Company and GameStop would know that turning something that could easily have been distributed digitally into a physical item, only obtainable in stores, would attract the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>Mandibuzz-like vultures who circle the franchise</span></a><span> looking for a way to scalp its merch to make a quick buck. That’s exactly what’s happened with a partnership to give out free codes for rare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny Pokémon</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span>, as scalpers have found a way to ruin something else for everyone.</span></p> <p><span>Here’s what was supposed to happen: from September 26 to October 15, fans who visit GameStops or EB Games locations would be able to get a code to receive either a Shiny Koraidon or Miraidon, the legendary Pokémon that grace </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s covers. These alternate-colored variants have never been available before, so if you’re the kind of collector who wants every Shiny, this is a pretty big deal. No purchase was required to get one of these codes; all you had to do was show up at participating locations. However, many fans are reporting that their local stores are running out of codes weeks before the promotion ends next month, and some locations say they won’t be getting more. Some customers report that stores still have codes but have been </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/1nqg2ay/local_gamestop_shiny_koraidon_and_miraidon/"><span>giving them out only as a promotional item</span></a><span> alongside other purchases, despite the official word on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s website </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/get-shiny-koraidon-or-shiny-miraidon-at-gamestop-and-eb-games"><span>saying no purchase is necessary</span></a><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>Sometimes these events are digital, meaning that you could download an event Pokémon in a store or through the game itself and go on your merry way. But when they involve a physical card with a code on it, supplies actually </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> limited, and when something is limited, a scalper is waiting just around the corner to swoop in. This also happened the same day as a new </span><i><span>Trading Card Game</span></i><span> set drop, so these people smelled blood in the water, and not only got the codes, but have started listing them for sale on places like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=shiny+koraidon+and+miraidon&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1311"><span>eBay</span></a><span>. Some of the prices are fairly cheap at less than $10, while other sellers are getting bold and asking for much more. Even if the price is cheap, these codes are supposed to be free, so even a dollar is a profit for scalpers.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>As some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFl1XUEqcls">commentators have pointed out</a>, <em>Pokémon </em></span><span>loves brand synergy, which is why every facet of its business releases new products around the same time. The games come out, new TCG sets come out alongside it, and more plushes of new critters show up on the Pokémon Center website, so it makes sense that it would offer these rare Pokémon on the same day people are showing up to game shops to buy the new TCG sets. That said, adding scarcity to a digital good just emboldens some of the worst people to keep taking advantage of other fans. Hopefully, these stores get more codes between now and when the promotion ends in October, because only sending enough for one weekend sounds like poor planning on everyone’s part.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ea-andrew-wilson-saudi-arabia-sale-email-2000629912</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-boss-congratulates-employees-on-55-billion-leveraged-buyout-by-private-equity.1311778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The $55 billion sale of Electronic Arts to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and a group of other private equity investors is a big deal. Some people are going to make a lot of money off it. Others may lose their jobs when the interest bill for the debt-financed portion of the leveraged buyout comes due. CEO Andrew Wilson, who will remain in charge of the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> publisher even after the sale closes, is thanking his employees.</p> <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">“This moment is a recognition of your creativity, your innovation, and your passion. You have built some of the world’s most iconic IP, created stories that have inspired global communities, and helped shape culture through interactive experiences,” he wrote in a companywide email to staff after the deal was announced on Monday, a copy of which was obtained by <em>Kotaku</em>. “Everything we have achieved–and everything that lies ahead–is because of you.”</p> <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">EA stockholders, which would include Wilson, will receive $210 per share. The executive was granted <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">$31 million in cash and stock awards</a> for the company’s last fiscal year, up $5 million from the year prior, even as the company laid off rank-and-file employees and hit sales snags in <em>EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. The 25 percent premium on the company’s mid-August share price comes with a catch, however. A whopping $20 billion of the buyout comes from debt, the interest on which could exceed hundreds of millions of dollars annually, or the budget of multiple AAA blockbusters per year.</p>

 <p>“We are entering a new era of opportunity,” Wilson wrote in his email to staff today. “This is one of the largest and most significant investments ever made in the entertainment industry. Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment. They are committed with conviction to EA–they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together.”</p>

 <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Our mission at EA to—Inspire The World To Play—continues to guide everything we do. Our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged. With continued rigor and operational excellence, we can amplify the creativity of our teams, accelerate innovation, and pursue transformative opportunities that position EA to lead the future of entertainment. Together, we’ll create experiences that are bold, expressive, and deeply connected to inspire generations of players around the world.</p> <p>I am excited to continue as CEO, working alongside our leadership team to advance our strategy. United by our vision, we will deliver experiences that transcend platforms and empower players everywhere to create worlds, characters, and stories that are bold, interactive, and deeply connected.</p> <p>Thank you for your creativity, your commitment, and the passion you bring to EA every day. This is a historic moment, and with the support of our new partners, the future we are building together is brighter than ever.</p></blockquote> <p>EA instituted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lp5wtvv7lc2n">a return-to-office policy earlier this year</a> which would require anyone living within 30 miles of an EA office to come in at least three days a week, while others not designated as remote would need to relocate. At the time, Wilson said the goal was to ignite the “kinetic energy that fuels creativity,” but some employees saw it as a way to incentivize more “voluntary” layoffs.</p> <p>Alongside the likelihood of layoffs are questions about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record and the new ownership’s potential impact on creative freedom within the company and public messaging, including its annual Pride events across its various franchises, most notably <em>The Sims</em>. Wilson told staff EA’s “values” will remain unchanged, but didn’t lay out specifically what they are. The sale is set to close in mid-2026 pending shareholder and regulatory reviews.</p>
