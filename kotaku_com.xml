              <p>A new free mod for <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-ivs-story-is-better-than-gta-vs-1690387521"><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></a> breathes fresh life into the early PS3-era open-world game and its aging visuals, making the dated blockbuster look almost as impressive as some modern releases.</p> <p>Rockstar’s<em> Grand Theft Auto IV</em> launched on Xbox 360, PS3, and (eventually) PC all the way back in 2008. While the console versions were great and are fondly remembered to this day by fans, the PC release was a mess that was often cited as one of the worst AAA ports of that era. <a href="https://kotaku.com/years-later-rockstar-releases-new-pc-patch-for-gta-iv-1789523135">But thanks to some official updates</a> and the hard work of fan modders,<em> GTA IV</em> is very playable on PC in 2025. It even runs well on Steam Deck. And a newly released path tracing mod makes the nearly two-decade-old crime simulator look incredible on a sufficiently powerful computer.</p> <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d">Created by modder Xoxor4d</a>, GTA4 RTX Remix is a mod that adds gorgeous path-traced lighting to the game via Nvidia’s RTX Remix tech. This mod doesn’t change any textures or swap in any higher-res assets. This is still mostly <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> from 2008. But now every light source, like headlights and the sun, reacts more naturally with the objects and environments around them.</p>

 <p>What this mod pulls off without changing any geometry or textures is impressive and, at times, near-photorealistic, <a href="https://youtu.be/vGxPdcMQfwg">as seen in this video</a> that was released when the mod was still locked behind a paywall. And it’s especially impressive when compared side-by-side to the OG game.</p>

  <p>GTA4 RTX Remix is a great example of how realistic, advanced lighting can make even older games look far more impressive. To me, this is the tech I want to see game developers and console makers focusing on as the next big thing. I don’t need 8K resolution or 240 FPS. I want accurate shadows and light bouncing off surfaces naturally. <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-hl-ray-tracing-rt-mod-valve-pc-mod-download-1850150600">As seen in <em>Half-Life</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-mods-modder-max-payne-swat-portal-pc-1849884871">other older games</a>, this kind of tech can make games look truly next-gen.</p>

 <p>Technically, GTA4 RTX Remix has been floating around online for a few months now, but it was only available to folks who subscribed to the mod creator’s Patreon page. However, last week, after it had been thoroughly tested, the mod was made public for all to download and enjoy for free. You can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/gta4-rtx">Xoxor4d’s GitHub page</a>, where the modder has instructions on how to install the mod and how to make it work with the popular <em>GTA IV</em> mod Fusion Fix.</p> <p>While it ain’t perfect, Nico’s head is far too shiny, for example, I still think anyone wanting to replay <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> in 2025 should get this mod and Fusion Fix working together to experience the best version of the game. Who needs Rockstar to remaster <em>GTA IV</em> when fans are doing it already and for free? Just be prepared for some FPS drops if you are playing on an older PC or don’t use DLSS.</p>

              <p>Kalshi’s CEO is bullish on the future of prediction market betting to solve disagreements for people, or at least make him very, very rich. What if every outcome in your life could be turned into a way to win or lose money? Imagine your very existence has been gamified into a gambling roguelike. “The long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion,” Tarek Mansour said at last month’s <a href="https://www.citadelsecurities.com/news-and-insights/kalshi-founders-tarek-mansour-luana-lopes-lara-on-turning-events-into-assets/?series=future-of-global-markets-2025-conference">Citadel Securities conference</a>.</p> <p>What sounds like a loading screen <a href="https://kotaku.com/gen-ai-fps-tom-clancy-shooter-hyperwrite-2000638861">from<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> was enough to make investors jump at the opportunity to turn angry Reddit threads into stock tickers you can gamble on. Kalshi recently raised $1 billion in its latest funding round this week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/prediction-market-kalshi-hits-11-billion-valuation-in-new-funding-round-c4b1ddfe?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdK-C0DhBc1ROkTdmdjauO7NE1xfoRnplk7FG1xKlaVPgwq1j6G1W_GWZ8c32U%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69309f9c&amp;gaa_sig=hKp-ZWblR1czvzvZi6BU2jUgxKi7W5LCwBBoCgom6lbVg_ldgoo9zy88xGYY8empWbRhMBInY0rli8I8qQBvIQ%3D%3D">leading to an $11 billion valuation</a>. What are investors so pumped about? Here’s the pitch Mansour <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/moreperfectunion.bsky.social/post/3m747g22dcc2o">gave in November</a> on stage with co-founder Luana Lopes Lara:</p>

 <blockquote><p>[Prediction markets are] pretty much already close to a $100 billion a year asset class. It’s pretty easy to imagine it 10x from here. We haven’t even started. It’s been a year. I think a very large number of people care, much larger than traditional markets, and I think retail as a pie has just been growing in the U.S. and I think it’s going to keep growing–it’s growing in the stock market, it’s growing outside the stock market.</p> <p>The long term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference of opinion. And I think if you do build a general purpose exchange that can resolve differences of opinions on anything the [total addressable market] is quite massive, quite a bit bigger than the current TAM of the stock market.</p> <p>Putting aside the retail trading and the institutional trading product there’s sort of this separate product which is we are living in a world where we have an abundance of information but there’s a lot of noise and we don’t really understand what’s real from what’s not and prediction markets are an antidote to that, they do a very good job of surfacing information and distilling truth to people.</p></blockquote>   <p>Mansour’s prediction market, i.e. opinion polls turned into casinos, was established back in 2018. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468">Like rivals such as Polymarket</a>, It’s pitched as a sophisticated tool for hedging risk. Picture some big world event like a war or an election. No one knows the outcome or what it might mean for their business so they trade bets to reduce the chance of losing a ton of money.</p>

 <p>I’m not going to weigh in on whether that makes any sense because that’s not what Mansour is saying is going to make Kalshi go 10X. The real moonshot is being able to take the popularity of betting on stocks with apps like Robinhood or sports with Draft Kings, and apply it to the totality of life. Every outcome, not just one in the market or a football game, will be an opportunity for people to gamble, ahem, I mean hedge risk.</p>

 <p>It all feels very Sam Bankman-Fried-coded. Remember <a href="https://kotaku.com/riot-games-ftx-cryptocurrency-exchange-sponsorship-sue-1849909204">that big FTX crypto debacle</a> from the wunderkind that was also making grand pronouncements on stage at conferences just before it all went belly up? Headlines <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/polymarket-and-kalshi-ceos-say-theyre-changing-the-world/">like this</a> about Kalshi and Polymarket don’t drive confidence. Where’s the prediction market for betting against prediction markets?</p>

 <p>If the post-covid era has taught us anything about the current state of the distraction economy, it’s that we love finding new ways to waste time and money on our phones. I don’t actually think most people want to treat break room debates or dinner table arguments like betting on horse racing. Maybe if it was more like <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>.</p> <p>But I think Mansour does and the people prepared to give his company billions do and that’s all it takes for bad things to happen.</p>

              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/ready-or-not">Ready or Not</a>,</em> a popular (and controversial) first-person tactical co-op shooter and SWAT simulator, is getting a free trial on consoles. The trial will feature full access to the game and will be available for the rest of 2025.</p> <p>On December 3, Void Interactive announced a new limited-time free trial for<em> Ready or Not.</em> The trial is available now on PlayStation 5 (with a PS Plus subscription), Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Once downloaded and installed, players will have access to the entirety of<em> Ready or Not,</em> including every mission. Players can enjoy the game for three hours before the trial ends. After that, all progress made in the trial can be carried over to the full game if players decide to purchase <em>Ready or Not.</em> This free taste will be available only on consoles and only until February 20, 2026.</p> <p>First released in 2021 on PC via Steam early access, <em>Ready or Not</em> has been mired in controversy over the years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-loses-publisher-days-after-devs-remind-fans-about-1848258819">The game lost its original publisher</a>, Team17, shortly before launch. The SWAT sim courted controversy over its subject matter, including a level set in a community college. <a href="https://kotaku.com/controversial-steam-best-seller-ready-or-not-is-an-unse-1848317351">When <em>Kotaku’s</em> own Ethan Gach played the game in 2022</a>, he felt it was unfinished and filled with juvenile humor and unsettling copaganda. I recently played it earlier this year, and while the action is tight and snappy, everything around it, including how it makes you treat every human you meet as a threat, is hard to ignore.</p> <p>In July, it found itself buried in a whole different mess of controversy <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-censorship-update-console-mod-uncensored-1851786403">when a patch was rolled out across PC</a>&nbsp;that made changes to some in-game assets, including the censorship of nudity. This was done to make the game easier to release on consoles. Fans who had been playing for years called foul and review-bombed <em>Ready or Not.</em> A modder rolled back the changes within an hour of the patch going live. Things have calmed down a lot since then, and the game has continued to receive frequent updates.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">Earlier this year, the game’s community manager was fired after joking about Charlie Kirk’s killing.&nbsp;</a></p>
