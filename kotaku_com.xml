Developer FuturLab says the new game features an entirely new campaign  with new Muckingham mysteries to uncover, as well as new locations to clean off including Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City. There will also be a home base where players can hang out, decorate, and gaze upon the trophies and trinkets from their cleansing adventures. </p><p>Here’s the new teaser trailer which hints at <em>PowerWash Sim</em>’s garden gnomes playing a bigger role in the sequel:</p><p>At first glance,<em> PowerWash Simulator 2</em> doesn’t look super different from the first game, which launched in 2022 and quickly grew into a major hit thanks to its meditative and therapeutic gameplay loop, as well as its more daunting challenge-based activities. However, the sequel will boast some notable upgrades like “enhanced soap that clings to stubborn stains and annihilates dirt” as well as two-player split-screen. <br></p><p>In the meantime, <em>PowerWash Simulator 1</em> is still getting new content. Following popular cross-over DLC packs like <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>’s Midgar and and <em>SpongeBob</em>’s Bikini Bottom, this year’s roadmap includes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26oE8hq6jnc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26oE8hq6jnc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> collaboration</a></span> and other updates. <em>PowerWash Sim 2</em> is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this year, and who knows, maybe we’ll still get a Switch 2 version announced in the months ahead. The first game was a free PS Plus download back in 2023 and is currently on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
