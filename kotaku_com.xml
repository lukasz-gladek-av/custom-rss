              <p>Your living room deserves smart lighting that doesn’t drain your wallet. Smart floor lamps have become incredibly popular for transforming spaces with dynamic colors and voice control but the price tags often make people think twice. Not anymore. Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Govee RGBIC floor lamp has dropped to just $59 on Amazon, down from its usual $99 price</a>. This Prime Big Deal Days offer <strong>marks an all-time low</strong> for one of the most popular smart lamps on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another mood-decorating, color-changing lamp: The Govee floor lamp is 136cm high and<strong> produces 1000 lumens of light which means it genuinely functions as actual light for your room</strong> (rather than mood decoration). At that level of brightness, it places it on a par with standard floor lamps so you can employ it for reading, working or ambient room light when it’s day, then shift over to bright color modes when night falls.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Smart Lamp Worth Your Money</h2>
<p>The RGBIC tech (that IC means <em>Independent Control</em>) distinguishes this lamp from less expensive ones: <strong>Each of the light strip segments is capable of showing disparate colors at the same time</strong>&nbsp;which lets you have flowing rainbow effects or gradients or multi-color schemes that plain RGB lamps aren’t up for. At your fingertips, <strong>you’re looking at 16 million different available colors and 58 dynamic built-in scenes</strong> named Cheerful, Romantic, and the like. Want your lamp pulsing red and orange, like a campfire? Done. Want a chilly blue-to-purple gradient for a late gaming marathon? Easy. The range goes deep enough that you’ll be able to fine-tune your lamp with holiday decorations or a party theme or just your mood of the moment without ever using the same look twice.</p>



<p>Voice command with Alexa or Google Home allows you never to have to rummage for your phone. Simply ask your smart speaker to turn the lamp on, change the hue, or reduce the brightness while cooking, working, or already settled on the sofa. The Govee Home app (installable through QR code on the box) adds additional control features with scheduling, so your lamp automatically wakes you gently with morning hues or unwinds with warm hues at bedtime. The app interface makes it simple to create custom scenes, allowing you to set specific hues for varying segments of a scene and then save your favorite sets for instant recall.</p>
<p>With sync mode,<strong> this light springs to life at parties, movie nights, or when playing video games</strong>. Inner microphones detect sound in the room and translate it into dynamic, real-time changes in brightness. Thump-heavy tunes create pulsing results, dialogues stay gentle, and action scenes erupt with corresponding changes in color. This dynamic lighting delivers real immersion for entertainment without cluttered setup.</p>
<p>The physical build makes this lamp suitable for real homes: Aluminum construction makes it firm (non-wobbling, non-tipping) yet light enough for simple transport from one room to another. Sections on the base fasten immediately without tools. At 136cm tall, it comfortably inhabits a corner, behind a sofa or next to a desk without overwhelming your space.</p>
<p>Stock sells out fast on Prime Big Deal Days, so this all-time-low pricing won’t last indefinitely.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The 22,000 Pa Roborock With Mop Delivers Luxury Cleaning Power, Now at Its Lowest Price for Prime Members.]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-22000-pa-roborock-with-mop-delivers-luxury-cleaning-power-now-at-its-lowest-price-for-prime-members-2000632151</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-22-000-pa-roborock-with-mop-delivers-luxury-cleaning-power-now-at-its-lowest-price-for-prime-members.1318090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock launched the Saros 10R in June 2025 and introduced its latest flagship generation that redefines what premium robot vacuums can achieve. This is <strong>the most advanced model in Roborock’s entire lineup</strong>, and it delivers power and capabilities that dwarf every other robot vacuum currently sold on Amazon.</p>
<p>Now, for Prime Big Deal Days, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">technological marvel has dropped to a new record low of $1,199, down from its usual $1,599</a>. The reason people invest in premium robot vacuums like this is simple: they want their <strong>floors genuinely clean</strong> without lifting a finger, and cheaper models simply can’t deliver the thoroughness, intelligence, or convenience that justify the automation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22,000 Pa Suction Power Eradicates Dirt on Entire Surfaces</h2>
<p>Conventional robot vacuums are 3.8 to 4 inches high due to the necessity for a raised LDS (<em>Laser Distance Sensor</em>) tower on top for mapping. Roborock Saros 10R features the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 which eliminates the extending sensor unit and <strong>reduces the profile to a mere 3.14 inches high</strong>. The vacuum slides under beds, sofas, cabinets and coffee tables that stand in the way of chunkier rivals.</p>
<p>The 3D sensing capabilities accurately map rooms even under spindly-legged furniture and drop-down cabinets with the VertiBeam Lateral Obstacle Avoidance system avoiding obstructions such as cables and poly-legged furniture legs without getting stuck. The advanced algorithms identify and respond to 108 different types of obstructions, so the vacuum cleans your whole home without incessant supervision or rescue interventions.</p>



<p>The <strong>HyperForce suction system produces 22,000 pascals of vacuum pressure</strong> which is about double/triple what mid-range robot vacuums deliver. This brute strength removes ground-in dirt from carpet fibers, draws out debris from grout gaps between tiles, and sucks up fine dust particles from hardwood left behind by weaker robots. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide main brush features a <strong>dual-sided design that keeps hair from tangling around the roller</strong>, automatically ejecting and depositing long hair and pet fur directly into the dustbin. The FlexiArm Riser side brush <strong>extends automatically when it senses corners and edging</strong>, sweeping out debris from baseboards and cramped corners that round robots almost universally ignore.</p>



<p>The first-of-its-type AdaptiLift Chassis adjusts the height of the robot dynamically, navigating through obstructions up to 4 cm high like door thresholds, area rug corners, and U-shaped chair leg furnishings that would cause lighter robots to stall. As soon as it senses carpet, <strong>the two rotating cleaning mops and their mounting bracket automatically lift up</strong> so you don’t wet your carpets, then lower when returning to hard floors.</p>
<p>The multifunctional dock 4.0 handles ten different maintenance tasks autonomously: It washes mops with 176-degree Fahrenheit hot water, dries them with 131-degree hot air to prevent mildew, <strong>empties the robot’s dustbin automatically with 60 days of capacity</strong>, refills the water tank, dispenses cleaning solution, and even cleans itself with hot water. The dock recharges the robot in 2.5 hours, and when it detects heavily soiled areas during cleaning, it triggers automatic re-wash and re-mop cycles for deep cleaning.</p>
<p>At $1,199 during Prime Big Deal Days, the Saros 10R costs less than several mid-range variants but delivers flagship performance for which full automation is justified.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Power Station (1500W, 7 Outlets) Is Going for Pennies, as Amazon Drops the Price for a Second Time]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-power-station-1500w-7-outlets-is-going-for-pennies-as-amazon-drops-the-price-for-a-second-time-2000632145</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This weekend, Amazon dropped the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2)</strong> to $429 for early <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> access. Now the retailer has taken things even further by lowering the displayed price to $399, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">plus an additional 10% off at checkout for eligible buyers, bringing the final cost down to potentially $359 (down from $799)</a>. This is an absolute record low price for this power station, and here’s what makes it remarkable: <strong>no competitor offering a 1500W portable power station has ever come close to this pricing</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’re<strong> looking at half off the usual $799 retail price</strong> on a product that solves one of the most frustrating problems for campers, RV owners and anyone preparing for emergencies. Running out of power during outdoor adventures or losing electricity during storms creates genuine hardship, and the Jackery Explorer 1000 provides enough capacity and output to keep essential devices running for extended periods.</p>
<h2>Days of Power, Not Hours</h2>
<p>The 1070 watt-hour capacity provides robust energy storage translating to real-world usage most users are familiar with. You’ll be able to <strong>charge a laptop around 10 times, run a mini-fridge for approximately 15 hours</strong>, support LED lights for a few days or run a CPAP unit for a number of evenings. The LiFePO4 battery chemistry is a step up from lithium-ion batteries employed for lower-end power stations: LiFePO4 batteries last for approximately 4,000 charge cycles until capacity dips at 80%, for reference, standard lithium-ion batteries last for around 500 to 1,000 cycles at the 80% level.</p>
<p>The majority of portable power stations have a peak output of between 300W and 500W which makes for charging small devices like cell phones or a mini portable fan at once. The <strong>1500W of continuous output with a 3000W surge delivers</strong> sufficient power for actual household devices like microwaves, electric kettles, power tools, or a small air conditioner unit. The surge amount addresses the starting burst of power when starting motors which is relevant for devices like refrigerators that consume several multiples of their-rated wattage for a number of seconds at starting time. The unit contains <strong>everyday AC outlets</strong> which accept typical three-prong plugs, and a<strong> 100W USB-C Power Delivery outlet</strong> for quick charging a laptop or tablet without bulky AC adapters.</p>



<p>The fast charging for one hour <strong>allows you to go from zero to full battery in 60 minutes</strong> via a common wall outlet which is extremely fast for a battery of this size. Most rival power stations need 6-8 hours for a full recharge. This quick turnaround is priceless on multi-day camping trips when you may have shore power available for a few hours here or there, or when there are rolling blackouts when you have a quick top-off between outages. The unit also has solar charging capabilities with optional solar panels, allowing you to have power on tap indefinitely off-grid when you harness energy from the sun during the day.</p>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 currently the <strong>highest-rated best-seller on Amazon for generators for outdoors</strong>, with over 4,000 units sold this month alone and a 4.6-star overall rating out of nearly 3,000 reviews. At $359 using the checkout discount on Prime Big Deal Days, you pay less than some 500Wh power centers with half the capacity and a much lower lifespan.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This MacBook Air (M4, 256GB, 16GB RAM), Now Costs Half the Price of a Pro, Amazon Rushes to Clear Out Space]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-macbook-air-m4-256gb-16gb-ram-now-costs-half-the-price-of-a-pro-amazon-rushes-to-clear-out-space-2000632140</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-macbook-air-m4-256gb-16gb-ram-now-costs-half-the-price-of-a-pro-amazon-rushes-to-clear-out-space.1318066/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Air models dominate Apple’s laptop sales because they handle everyday computing needs for the vast majority of users (without the complexity or cost of Pro models). The catch has always been the price: You need to budget at least $1,000 for the standard configuration and upgrades can quickly push you toward $1,500, the territory where MacBook Pro models begin.</p>
<p>For <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em>, Amazon has essentially eliminated its entire profit margin on the best-selling configuration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">bringing the 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with M4 chip down to $799 from its usual $999</a>. This represents the lowest price ever for the 2025 model <strong>with 256GB storage and 16GB unified memory</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Designed for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s latest silicon design which is <strong>custom-built for handling Apple Intelligence features</strong> which require intensive processing for on-device AI calculations. That means features like sophisticated editing of photos, real-time translation, voice transcription, and intelligent writing assistant are executed locally on your laptop rather than being sent off to cloud servers.</p>
<p>The performance benefit extends beyond AI features: The M4 handles dozens of web tabs, many productivity applications, video calling and background applications without a hitch or fan functioning. Because it is fanless, the <strong>MacBook Air stays silent for any amount of intensive usage</strong>&nbsp;which is not possible for regular Intel-based laptops which require active heat management when under load.</p>



<p>Apple’s unified memory architecture pools RAM across the CPU, the GPU, and the Neural Engine, so data moves between disparate processing units without the performance penalty that individual pools of memory cause in older computer architectures. The 16GB setup affords sufficient headroom for professional uses like photo editing in Final Cut Pro, video editing or virtual machines. This is important because earlier versions of the MacBook Air had 8GB, which meant that users had to constantly juggle what apps they had open.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display uses IPS LCD tech with a resolution of 2560 pixels by 1664 pixels</strong>. The Liquid Retina display includes the P3 wide color gamut, a brightness of 500 nits and remains legible outdoors under direct sunlight when cheaper laptop screens dim down and become unreadable. True Tone tech automatically changes colour temperature based on ambient illumination for less eye strain when working for long periods at a time.</p>
<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera at last elevates MacBook video call quality. <strong>Center Stage utilizes machine learning when you’re on the go</strong>, automatically framing you by zooming and panning to create the ideal video call composition. This gives you a more professional appearance when participating in online Zoom conferences and eliminates the bothersome need for you to repeatedly shift your position or angle to remain visible on camera.</p>
<p>This laptop sells for $799 on Prime Big Deal Days, which places the 2025 MacBook Air M4 on equal terms truly with mid-range Windows notebooks but with Apple’s superior build quality, battery life, and ecosystem integration.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-sequel-mina-hollower-delay-yacht-club-2000632148</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October was going to be a special month. For the first time since <em>Shovel Knight</em> came out over a decade ago, Yacht Club Games was going to release a new game that had nothing to do with its hit 8-bit platformer. It’s a <em>Link’s Awakening</em>-sized adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-mina-the-hollower-zelda-castlevania-game-1848463038">called <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>. Unfortunately, it also just got indefinitely delayed.</p> <p>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay <em>Mina the Hollower</em>,” the studio wrote in <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a new blog post on Monday</a>. “The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.”</p>

 <p>Unlike its 2D side-scrolling predecessor,<em> Mina the Hollower</em> is a top-down action game that focuses a bit more on puzzles and combat. Think <em>Castlevania</em> if it fell on the ground with a <em>Zelda</em>-inspired interconnected map. It has all the signs of becoming another clever, charming retro homage if Yacht Club can deliver. Apparently, it still needs more time to cook. There’s no new release date yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily far away from finally coming out.</p>

 <p>“We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line,” Yacht Club wrote today. “The game is&nbsp;<i>so</i> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day.” In the meantime, the developers say they’re working on finalizing design, art, sound, game balance, localization, and QA.</p> <p><em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the third notable game <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-release-october-2025-pokemon-battlefield-ninja-gaiden-2000630373">to drop out of the busy October release calendar lineup</a>. Roguelike dungeon game <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>moved to November and <i>Kingmakers </i>is missing its Early Access date this week with no new date announced yet. <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the one I was looking forward to most, however. I’d love to be spending my end-of-year travel season cozied up to my Switch like it’s 1998 again and the Game Boy Color just came out. We’ll see if it still ends up arriving in time for the holiday.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-sequel-mina-hollower-delay-yacht-club-2000632148]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon-2000632012</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon.1318015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>GoPro almost never puts its cameras on sale</strong>. Outside of a handful of major shopping events each year, and exclusively through Amazon, you’re paying full price. That’s why <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> and Black Friday are the only real opportunities to snag a deal on their latest gear. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/">the HERO13 Black bundle (including two batteries) is down to $399 from its usual $499, and this is an all-time low for the newest model</a>. If you’ve been waiting to document your ski trips, capture your kids’ soccer games from unique angles, mount a camera on your mountain bike for trail footage or simply record your travels in stunning quality that your phone can’t match, this is your moment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This package comes complete with goodies that truly make a difference: You receive <strong>two Enduro batteries</strong>, which is a big deal because action camera batteries have a short life when you’re recording in chilly weather or capturing high-def video. Enduro batteries are also designed to hold up better when it’s cold outside and have a longer overall life, <strong>giving you up to 2.5 hours of solid 5.3K recording per battery pack</strong>.</p>
<p>Another welcome innovation is t<strong>he waterproof shutter remote</strong> which allows you to initiate recording or stop recording from a distance of up to 196 feet away. This allows you to affix the GoPro HERO 13 Black camera on your helmet, your ride or a tripod and operate it without awkwardly pressing the small buttons on the camera which is extremely handy when your hands are gloved or the camera is mounted somewhere out of easy reach.</p>



<h2>Film-Like Experience That Accommodates Your Trek</h2>
<p>The <strong>HERO13 Black captures at 5.3K resolution</strong> which provides 91% more information than regular 4K and a whopping 665% more resolution than 1080p. That extra resolution provides serious leeway in post-editing. Crop-in on your shots, firm up shaky frames or punch-in on details without sacrificing quality. The GoPro Quik app even allows you to <strong>pull 24.7-megapixel still images straight out of your 5.3K video</strong>&nbsp;so you never have a bad photo because you happened to be recording video rather than pics.</p>
<p>One of the coolest capabilities is <strong>Burst Slo-Mo which takes action at 13 times normal speed</strong>. Just think about being able to capture a skate trick, a breaking wave, or a bike jump with all the little details witnessed in silky smooth slow motion. And you <strong>can capture 4x slow motion at the full 5.3K resolution</strong>&nbsp;which creates extremely detailed slo-mo video that freezes movements and moments your eye might otherwise miss.</p>



<p>The GoPro HERO13 Black includes native support for HB-Series Lenses that are automatically switched when you put them on the camera. The Ultra Wide Lens Mod is perfect for POV shots when you need to see all that’s in front of you, from ski slopes to surf sessions. The Macro Lens Mod places you very close to the subject for close-ups of small objects, details, or animals. Neutral Density filters enable you to naturally blur fast-paced scenes for motion blur and exposure control for sunny scenes, adding a cinematic effect to your clips.</p>
<p>Designed to withstand the toughest environments, the <strong>HERO13 Black is water-resistant up to 33 feet without the need for extra housing</strong>. Water-repellent lens cover minimizes lens flare, giving you clear shots even when wet.</p>
<p>For that price, getting the complete bundle with two batteries is a steal.</p>
