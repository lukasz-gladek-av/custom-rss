              <p><em>Hades 2</em> has its long-awaited 1.0 release later this month, but if you haven’t played the first game yet, you should really start warming up with that first. Supergiant Games’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803">2020 GOTY contender</a> is currently on sale to celebrate its five-year anniversary. You can grab <em>Hades 1</em> for less than most meals on the McDonald’s menu. Your heart will be better off, too.</p> <p>The action-RPG roguelike is about the son of Hades trying to escape the underworld and reach Mount Olympus. Players have to choose between competing upgrades and survive isometric bullet-hell battles to do so. A range of weapons and buildcrafting options, combined with incredible art and rich worldbuilding, make it an all-around exceptional game. Part classic arcade beat ’em up, part engrossing visual novel, <em>Hades</em> has something for everyone. Maybe that’s why it inspired Supergiant to make its first sequel.</p> <p><em>Hades</em> is normally $25, but right now it’s 75 percent off until September 30 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hades-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOorNEZO4qZlxH5rvIgBR45p8YVScR59SD9KL2Tl8FfcUrFXtCTbS">the Switch eShop</a>. At just $6.24, it’s a steal. If you don’t already own it on Switch 2, now’s the time.</p>

 <p>Now I know what you’re thinking. Why buy<em> Hades 1</em> when <em>Hades 2</em> is just around the corner? <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-release-date-1-0-patch-switch-2-pc-early-access-2000625272">The sequel launches September 25</a> after years in Early Access and is, on the surface at least, simply more <em>Hades</em>. But it tells a completely different story, stars a hero that’s more ranged-centric than the first game’s Zagreus, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575">definitely harder overall</a>.</p> <p>Is this a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> situation? Based on my time with the Early Access version I’m not ready to say, but new players will definitely benefit from warming up in the first game and getting a feel for the flow and decision-making that comes with selecting between all of the different upgrade paths. And hell, by the time you actually finish <em>Hades 1</em>, maybe the second game will be on sale for $6.29 too.</p>

              <p>It’s been a fittingly chaotic launch week for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The cacophony of player feedback ranges from praise for the best new entry in the loot shooter series since <em>Borderlands 2</em> to very loud and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">angry complaints about bugs, crashes, and performance stutters on PC</a>. Even the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions have some weird issues. Gearbox Entertainment now says a second patch to address PC performance is on the way as it also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">investigates problems on console</a>.</p> <p>Not one to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">calmly monitor feedback</a> from atop his 2K Games-funded Ivory Tower, studio CEO Randy Pitchford has been arguing almost nonstop with fans since the game released about whether their gripes about how it runs are legitimate or not. Wit<em>h Borderlands 4</em> sitting at at a mixed rating on Steam with just 65 percent positive reviews, the veteran poster has been handling criticism in classic <em>Borderlands</em> fashion.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Randy is now doing personal tech support for Twitter users and recommending 4x frame gen for a 5080 and telling them to turn off fog which is literally not an option in the game <a href="https://t.co/WzRMiDO8Pt">pic.twitter.com/WzRMiDO8Pt</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Here’s an abridged recap of the post-launch Pitchford timeline:</p> <ul> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650">Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985">Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013">If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">Fun facts: Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">I have personally helped users go from 30FPS to 90FPS+</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">The game is pretty damn optimal</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">Please get a refund from Steam if you aren’t happy with it.</a>”&nbsp;– September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Would you like help tuning with your personal specification?</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Turn down or off the volumetric fog</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968388123534180815">Oops. You are correct: the bottom setting for fog is ‘low’ not “off</a>” – September 17</li> </ul> <p>Reactions to this approach have been mixed. “At what point do the crashouts stop making sense?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ni56df/randy_pitchford_code_your_own_engine_and_show_us/">asked</a> one player. Another claiming to be a game industry veteran who was definitely not Pitchford writing under an alias <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1n4ljjl/in_which_i_a_game_industry_veteran_give_sincere/">applauded</a>:” “Randy Pitchford cares. He manically, catastrophically, awkwardly, SINCERELY cares.” I would simply add that <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">this drama is as much a part of <em>Borderlands</em></a> at this point as the bandit psycho masks, terrible Claptrap puns, and glowing ammo hidden in toilets.</p>

 <h2>A second patch to fix <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC is on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shroud's game crashed on Borderlands 4 and cost them all those legendaries RIP😅 <a href="https://t.co/we3m1onoZp">pic.twitter.com/we3m1onoZp</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1968064528052314348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>To help set the record straight or at least cut through the noise a bit, Gearbox released <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1968451501803651131">an official statement</a> last night clarifying the team’s ongoing priorities as we approach <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s one-week anniversary. Here are the priorities following an emergency update over the weekend to try to improve optimization on PC:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming this Thursday. <strong>This is our top priority. </strong></li> <li>A Field of View [FOV] slider option for consoles is in testing right now and more information is coming very soon on that. Some console players have reported concerns with performance and we’re investigating those with planned updates coming.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The studio also released additional Shift codes for gold keys, including a Break Free Pack, to sweeten the deal with more bonus loot. At least one research firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false">has suggested</a> <em>Borderlands 4</em> has already sold over 2 million copies in its first couple of&nbsp; days. Official player stats from Gearbox indicate 764,733,586 total items looted and 4,563,416 deaths by grenade as well as a quarter of all attempted boss fights being failed. I’m sure at least some of them will blame it on not being able to play <em>Borderlands 4</em> at 120fps in 4K.</p>
