              <p>The Pixel 10 phones from Google are direct competitors to the iPhone 17 lineup, and they offer great value that makes Apple’s prices look high in comparison. The great news is that there’s an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/">unlocked Pixel 10 128GB currently on sale on Amazon for $549, which is $250 less than its $799 list price</a>. Google’s flagship phone comes with Google’s own Tensor G5 chip, a triple rear camera system with 5x optical zoom, and seven years of guaranteed Android updates.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gemini AI Built-In Tensor G5 Processing</h2>
<p>The Tensor G5 chip is the newest version of<strong> Google’s custom silicon made for AI processing</strong> and computational photography on devices, not just for getting high benchmark scores. This processor can do complicated machine learning tasks right on your phone, so you can use features like real-time language translation, advanced photo processing, and Gemini AI interactions without having to send data to cloud servers. The architecture focuses on making everyday tasks as efficient as possible while also giving you extra performance when you need it.</p>
<p>With <strong>Gemini AI integration</strong>, the Pixel 10 becomes an interactive assistant that can understand natural conversation through Gemini Live and you can point your camera at things or text you don’t know and ask questions in everyday language. The camera will give you answers based on what it sees and this visual lookup feature can be used in a variety of situations, such as recognizing plants while hiking or translating signs in other languages in real time.</p>



<p>The <strong>main sensor in the triple rear camera system is 48 megapixels</strong> and has optical image stabilization, so it takes clear pictures even when your hands aren’t perfectly steady. The<strong> 10.8-megapixel telephoto lens gives you 5x optical zoom</strong> which keeps the quality of the picture when the subjects are far away. The 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens gives you a wider view for landscapes and group shots and the Super Res Zoom uses both optical and digital methods to get 20x magnification while keeping details that pure digital zoom destroys on other phones.</p>
<p><em>Camera Coach</em> looks at your composition in real time and suggests changes to make your shots better and gives you tips on framing, lighting, and positioning that help casual photographers take better pictures. You can see this advice as you frame shots, not after you’ve already taken bad pictures which makes the learning process quick and useful.</p>



<p>The <strong>Actua OLED display is 6.3 inches wide and has a resolution of 1080 x 2424,</strong> and the refresh rate changes from 1Hz to 120Hz depending on what you’re watching (to save battery, static content like reading drops to lower refresh rates). The screen is clearly visible even in direct sunlight, where many phones become unreadable, because the peak brightness is 3,000 nits and the IP68 rating means that the screen can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes and still be safe.</p>
<p>The <strong>4,970mAh battery lasts for more than 24 hours of normal use</strong> between charges, so you can use it all day and night without needing to charge it in the middle of the day. Fast charging sends 30 watts through the USB-C port to quickly charge the battery when you need it and Qi wireless charging at 15 watts lets you charge your phone without a cable at home or in the car.</p>
<p>The Pixel 10 costs $549, which makes it a flagship option that offers high-end features without the $1,000 or more price tags that come with premium iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices. This long Cyber Monday deal shows that December can be a better time to shop than the first holiday shopping weekend for people who are willing to wait.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bose Headphones Stuck at Cyber Monday Price, Amazon Never Raised It to Clear Stock Out]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-headphones-stuck-at-cyber-monday-price-amazon-never-raised-it-to-clear-stock-out-2000650104</link>
            <guid>1372357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kept pricing steady on select flagship products after Cyber Monday ended, and the Bose <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones remain discounted at what marks their lowest price point yet. These<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/"> wireless noise-cancelling headphones now sell for $199 instead of the regular $349 tag</a>&nbsp;which brings premium Bose audio and industry-leading noise cancellation down to a price bracket where you’d typically find mid-tier alternatives with compromised performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adaptive noise cancellation</h2>
<p>The <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones have <strong>microphones around each earcup that constantly pick up sounds</strong> from the outside world and they make sound waves that are opposite to the noise that is coming in, which cancels it out before it gets to your ears. This active noise cancellation works over a wide range of frequencies and gets rid of everything from the low rumble of airplane engines to the mid-frequency chatter of people talking in an office. The system changes in real time as your acoustic environment changes and for example, it automatically lowers the cancellation strength when you move from a quiet room to a busy street. The plush over-ear cushions block out noise passively by making a physical seal around your ears. This works with active cancellation to make the silence even deeper than either method alone.</p>
<p>When you need to concentrate or sleep while traveling,<strong> Quiet Mode turns on full noise cancellation</strong> for the best isolation, while Aware Mode lets outside sounds through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or traffic without taking them off. This mode of transparency uses the same outside microphones that cancel out noise. It picks up sounds from the outside world and mixes them in with your audio playback in a natural way and with the push of a button, you can switch between modes, which lets you quickly adapt to situations where being aware is important for safety or socializing.</p>



<p>High-fidelity audio drivers make sound clear across the whole frequency range, bringing out vocal and instrumental details that are lost on cheaper headphones. You can change the bass, midrange, and treble settings right in the Bose Music app. This lets you change the sound to fit your tastes or make up for different types of music. When you want cleaner mids in bass-heavy electronic music, lowering the low-end can help. On the other hand, adding treble to acoustic recordings can bring out string details.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on,<strong> the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong> which is enough for multi-day trips or full work weeks without needing to plug in. Plugging it in for just 15 minutes gives you 2.5 hours of playback time, which is great if you forgot to charge it overnight and need to leave right away. The included audio cable with an inline microphone lets you connect the headphones with a wire when Bluetooth isn’t available or when the battery dies in the middle of a flight.</p>



<p><strong>With multipoint Bluetooth</strong>, you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch between them automatically based on which one plays audio first. You can stay connected to both your laptop and your phone at the same time, you can answer calls on your phone without having to disconnect from your computer or miss notifications while watching videos. The seamless switching between devices makes it easy to switch audio sources without having to go into Bluetooth settings every time.</p>
<p>The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head, stopping the pressure points that form when you wear poorly made headphones for a long time. The over-ear cushions are made of memory foam wrapped in synthetic protein leather. This makes them feel soft against your skin and keeps their shape even after years of daily use and these headphones stay comfortable even on long flights across the ocean or during eight-hour work days.</p>
<p>The $199 price drop is $150 less than Bose’s top-of-the-line noise-canceling headphones, which puts them in competition with brands that can’t match their adaptive ANC, sound quality, and comfort all day long.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-liquidates-playstations-elite-pro-controllers-dualsense-edge-selling-at-record-low-2000650140</link>
            <guid>1372333</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon still has PlayStation controller inventory left over from the holiday rush including both standard models and the DualSense Edge that’s built specifically for serious gamers. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">Edge is currently sitting at its all-time low price of $169 instead of the usual $199</a>, and this Black Friday pricing has stuck around in both available colorways (black and white versions).</p>
<p>This controller matters because <strong>it gives you the kind of customization and performance features</strong> that competitive players actually need, with swappable stick caps, adjustable triggers, and back buttons you can program for complex game mechanics. Sony designed this as their pro-level answer to third-party controllers, which means you get official hardware with warranty support instead of gambling on aftermarket alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Upgrade to the Edge Controller</h2>
<p>You can <strong>switch between three different cap styles</strong> on the modular stick design, depending on the game you’re playing and how you like to hold your thumbs. Most of the time, regular caps work just fine but in shooters, high dome caps help you aim more accurately, and in fighting games or racing games, low dome caps let you move faster. You can change these out in seconds without any tools, so it takes less time to set up your gaming system than it does to load the game itself. The sticks use the <strong>same haptic feedback and adaptive trigger technology as the regular DualSense</strong>&nbsp;so you still get that immersive tactile response that makes PS5 games feel different from games on other systems.</p>



<p>Those back buttons change the way you play complicated games that need you to input multiple things at once: You <strong>can assign any button function to the back paddles</strong> so you can reload, jump, or crouch without taking your thumbs off the aiming sticks. In competitive shooters, where a split-second delay in moving your thumb to hit X can mean the difference between winning and respawning, this becomes very important. The controller has built-in memory that can hold multiple profiles. This lets you set up different button layouts for different games and switch between them with a special function button.</p>
<p>With the <strong>adjustable trigger system</strong>, you can set how far you need to pull L2 and R2 before they register. There are also multiple stop points that shorten the distance you have to travel. In shooters, shorter trigger pulls mean faster firing because you don’t have to wait for the trigger to hit the bottom before the next shot registers. You can also change the dead zones on the analog sticks in the console’s settings menu.</p>



<p>The<strong> carrying case that comes with it protects the controller</strong> while it’s being moved and has extra stick caps and a USB cable for wired play. You can connect via USB-C for tournament play or when wireless latency is important. However, the Bluetooth connection is already fast enough that most players won’t notice a difference. The battery life is about the same as the regular DualSense <strong>so you can expect it to last about 5 to 7 hours</strong>, depending on how much you use the haptics and adaptive triggers.</p>
<p>At first, Sony priced this controller at $199 which made it hard to sell compared to the $74 DualSense (currently selling around $55-$60). You pay less than 2.5 times the cost of the base controller for features that really improve your competitive performance and comfort while playing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba at 50% Off, Now Cheaper Than Basic Stick Vacuums but Only on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/irobot-roomba-at-50-off-now-cheaper-than-basic-stick-vacuums-but-only-on-amazon-2000650099</link>
            <guid>1372309</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon keeps some Black Friday deals going until early December and the <strong>iRobot Roomba 105</strong> is still at its lowest price ever which makes robot vacuums affordable: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/">model is now on sale for $149 on Amazon instead of the usual $299</a> which is the same price as a basic stick vacuum without any smart features. Robot vacuums do the work for you, so you don’t have to push a vacuum around your house several times a week and you can use that time for anything else while your floors stay clean.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>LiDAR Mapping</h2>
<p>The <strong>ClearView LiDAR sensor spins around the room</strong> while the Roomba moves, sending out laser beams and measuring how long it takes for each beam to bounce back from walls, furniture, and other things in the way. The robot uses this information to make an exact map of your home’s layout which it keeps and uses during every cleaning session. The<strong> mapping process goes quickly at first</strong> but the Roomba gets better at knowing your space over time as it runs into new obstacles or sees that the furniture has been moved.</p>
<p>The navigation system makes sure that the cleaning paths are efficient and cover your floors in neat, parallel rows, like how you would mow a lawn. This methodical approach makes sure that everything is covered while cutting down on unnecessary passes over areas that have already been cleaned. This extends battery life and speeds up the completion of tasks. Specialized sensors keep the Roomba from falling down stairs or off ledges by finding stairs and drops.</p>



<p>The three-stage cleaning system uses a brush that works on multiple surfaces, an edge-sweeping brush, and a suction channel to pick up dirt from different types of floors.<strong> iRobot says that this model has 70 times more power-lifting suction than their older 600 series robots</strong> and it creates enough airflow to pull dirt out of carpet fibers and cracks in hardwood floors. The edge-sweeping brush goes beyond the robot’s round body and into corners and along baseboards, where dust collects and circular vacuum paths usually miss.</p>
<p>You can control the Roomba Home app from your phone and you can start cleaning sessions from anywhere, set up automatic runs based on your daily routine, and make sure the robot stays away from pet bowls or other delicate areas. You can change the suction power and set the number of cleaning passes for each room. This lets you change the intensity based on how much dirt and traffic there is in different areas.</p>



<p>Spot cleaning mode cleans a small area over and over for up to five minutes which is helpful when you’ve spilled something or see a really dirty spot that needs extra attention. <strong>Voice control integration works with Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant</strong> and it lets you start or stop cleaning sessions with your voice when your hands are full or you’re in another room. There are physical buttons on the robot itself that let you start cleaning quickly without having to open the app or look for your phone.</p>
<p>At $149, robot vacuums go from being a luxury item to a useful investment that costs the same as stick vacuums that you have to use your time and energy to operate. The 50% off sale makes advanced LiDAR navigation and smart mapping features available at a price that was only available with basic random-pattern cleaning in earlier models.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-has-leftover-stock-from-black-friday-now-quietly-sells-macbook-air-m4-at-record-low-on-amazon-2000650134</link>
            <guid>1372300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday came and went with some decent Apple deals on Amazon, but the retailer didn’t move all its inventory during the rush. That means the all-time low pricing on the MacBook Air M4 256GB, which launched in March 2025, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">is still available right now at $749 instead of the usual $999 tag.</a> This matters because Apple rarely sees discounts this deep, especially on hardware that’s less than a year old.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Changes the Way This Machine Works</h2>
<p>The Apple M4 processor makes things a lot faster and you’ll notice it right away when you switch between demanding apps. Video editing software that used to stutter now works perfectly with 4K video, and you can run multiple Chrome tabs and Photoshop at the same time without hearing a fan noise because there isn’t one. The chip <strong>architecture puts the CPU, GPU, and neural engine all on one piece of silicon</strong> which makes data move faster between parts and uses less power. This means that the <strong>battery can last up to 18 hours</strong> without dying when you’re doing real work instead of just browsing Safari.</p>



<p>This<strong> hardware can run Apple Intelligence on its own</strong> and it can do things like help you write, make images, and organize your files without sending your data to other servers. The privacy architecture does everything on the device, so your personal information never goes to the cloud for processing. This is very helpful when you want to summarize long email threads, make custom emojis based on descriptions, or have the system sort notifications by how important they really are.</p>
<p>The<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has a brightness of 500 nits</strong> and can show one billion colors: This means you can work outside without having to squint at a dim screen. The text is clear enough that you won’t strain your eyes when you write for a long time, and the colors in photos are accurate enough that designers and photographers can trust them. The bezels around the screen are thin enough to give you the most viewing area without making the whole thing too big to handle.</p>



<p><strong>Two Thunderbolt 4 ports handle charging, data transfer at 40Gbps</strong>&nbsp;and video output to external displays, so connectivity is complete. You can use two external monitors at the same time, which turns this light laptop into a real workstation when you’re at your desk. <em>MagSafe</em> charging is back and it has a magnetic connection that safely disconnects if someone trips over the cable. This keeps both your laptop and your sanity safe. If you have a router that works with Wi-Fi 6E, your wireless speeds will be faster. The<strong> four-speaker system with Spatial Audio</strong> makes the sound surprisingly immersive for a chassis this thin and the three-mic array also does a good job of isolating your voice during calls, even in noisy places.</p>
<p>This price of $749 is $250 less than what the hardware usually sells for which is a good deal because it usually holds its value all year. You’re getting a current-generation processor with twice the base RAM, which will keep the machine up to date for years to come with software updates and more demanding applications. This <strong>is the lowest price ever for anApple laptop</strong> that can handle both creative work and everyday tasks without any problems.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-twin-stick-shooter-is-the-new-geometry-wars-and-it-rules-2000650227</link>
            <guid>1372282</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m very annoyed that I have a job, that I have to go to the bathroom, that I have to write this damn blog. All I want to do is play more <em>Sektori</em>, a newly released roguelike twin stick shooter that all fans of <em>Geometry Wars</em> should play ASAP.</p> <p>Out now on <a href="https://www.gimblll.com/sektori/#:~:text=Store%20Links%20(Game,Steam">Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, <em>Sektori</em></a> is one of those games that takes less than five minutes to understand and yet will suck up hours of your life in no time. You control a small, colorful shape that must destroy other vibrantly glowing shapes and objects that will damage you if touched. Blast and dodge these bastards with your laser canon, which, like your shield, overall speed, and dash ability, can be upgraded during each run, to defeat the boss and set a new high score. It’s very simple and very, very good.</p>

 <p>Oh, and <em>Sektori</em> looks incredibly sharp and slick, with loads of particle effects and eye-popping neon art. Seriously, look at this game in action.</p>  <p><em>Sektori</em> understands that the main appeal of games like <em>Geometry Wars</em> is watching the playfield fill up with all manner of colorful objects and shapes, and then systematically evaporating them using your blasters and power-ups. But it builds on that formula by pulling in some gameplay mechanics found in games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Halls of Torment.</em></a> Each little shape you blast away leaves behind some shiny glimmer. Pick up enough of this stuff, and you’ll spawn an upgrade token. Save a few of these up, and you can replenish your shield, unlock missiles, or upgrade your laser gun.</p>

 <p>Occasionally, you’ll be asked to pick a card to unlock a new perk. I’m not entirely sure how this works, and that’s because <em>Sektori</em> has one other cool ace up its neon-lined sleeve: It ain’t as simple as you might think. There’s more going on here that the game chooses not to explain in the brief tutorial, and discovering the secrets in <em>Sketori</em> and how everything works has made it extremely easy for me to just go “Well, one more run won’t hurt!” And then suddenly I’ve been playing for two hours. It helps that the game runs flawlessly, features great music, and feels incredibly snappy to play.</p> <p>I mean, I literally downloaded this game on my father-in-law’s Xbox Series X while visiting for Thanksgiving. I just wanted to play a few more rounds. And now, I’m done writing about <em>Sektori</em>, and I’m going to go back and play more of it. Leave me alone. Thanks.</p>

              <p>When you’re looking for a good daily driver that can handle web browsing, productivity apps and streaming without breaking the bank, you don’t need to spend $2,000 on a MacBook Pro: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">HP 15.6″ (256GB SSD, 16GB RAM, Intel Core chip) laptop is now on sale for $369 on Amazon, down from its usual price of $1,999</a>. This seems to be an inventory clearance sale that has brought this model’s price down to its lowest point ever.</p>

<h2>Everyday Computing Performance</h2>
<p>The<strong> Intel Processor N100 has four cores that run at a base frequency that can go up to 3.4GHz</strong> when tasks need more processing power. It also has 6MB of L3 cache to help frequently accessed data load quickly. This chip is part of Intel’s lineup of chips that are made for thin and light laptops, where battery life and heat management are more important than raw benchmark scores. This processor won’t let you work on 4K video projects or play demanding games, but it can handle the everyday computing tasks that most people do without slowing down.</p>
<p>With 16GB of DDR4 RAM, you can keep dozens of browser tabs open at the same time as Microsoft Office apps and video conferencing software without having to move data to the slower SSD and this much RAM is enough to make you stop worrying about closing programs to free up memory. The 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD loads Windows and apps faster than mechanical hard drives, but you’ll need to be careful about how you use the space because modern games and big media libraries can fill it up faster than you’d like.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD screen shows content at a resolution of 1920×1080</strong> and has an anti-glare coating that cuts down on reflections from windows and overhead lights. The 250-nit brightness rating is good enough for most indoor lighting, but you might have trouble reading the screen in direct sunlight or very bright places. Intel UHD integrated graphics can play videos and do basic photo editing and they have enough power for casual older games, but not enough for modern AAA games or heavy creative work.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 connections are faster and work better in crowded networks than Wi-Fi 5 connections; Bluetooth 5.3 keeps wireless mice, keyboards, and headphones connected without dropping out. Two USB-A ports let you connect older peripherals without needing dongles, and the HDMI 1.4b output lets you connect to external monitors or projectors for presentations and more workspace.</p>



<p><strong>Windows 11 Home</strong> comes with a desktop interface that most people are used to and works with a huge number of Windows programs that have been made over the years. You can use traditional desktop programs like Adobe apps, business software, and games from Steam on a Chromebook without the limitations that come with web-based workflows. The headphone/microphone combo <strong>jack works with standard 3.5mm audio devices</strong>&nbsp;and the built-in webcam is good enough for video calls for work and school from home.</p>
<p>At $369, this HP is at the same price as a Chromebook, but it has full Windows functionality and more RAM than you’d expect to find at this price point. Amazon is probably clearing out its remaining stock, which is why the price has dropped so much from the inflated $1,999.</p>
