Here are some tips on how to beat it and what to expect.</p><h2 id="h280503"><a id="1"></a>Preparation</h2><p>Like its normal form, <strong>ES Fulghor is still weak to lightning elemental attacks</strong>, so a corresponding weapon will be helpful in dealing damage. However,<strong> ES Fulghor seemingly starts in the original’s second phase and will use its most dangerous move: the one where it charges up an aura to summon blades of lightning from the ground</strong>. Lightning elemental attacks will break its guard and prevent it from executing that attack.</p><p>Any class composition will suffice as long as players are skilled enough, but <strong>having more melee based classes like </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-play-guardian-tank-defend-magic-1851783574&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-play-guardian-tank-defend-magic-1851783574"><strong>Guardian</strong></a></span><strong>, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-guide-onslaught-claw-shot-1851783361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-guide-onslaught-claw-shot-1851783361"><strong>Wylder</strong></a></span><strong>, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-executor-beast-dexterity-arcane-1851784376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-executor-beast-dexterity-arcane-1851784376"><strong>Executor</strong></a></span><strong>, and </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-raiden-ultimate-art-strength-1851783752&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-raiden-ultimate-art-strength-1851783752"><strong>Raider</strong></a></span><strong> will be useful</strong>. Fulghor hits hard and is very aggressive, so you’ll need players who can dish out damage just as well as they take.</p><h2 id="h280504"><a id="2"></a>Fighting Everdark Soveriegn Fulghor</h2><p>ES Fulghor retains most of its normal attacks, which involve swiping its giant weapon on the ground and creating shockwaves. The swipe itself is easy to dodge, but there’s a delay between the shockwave’s emergence, which can be a bit difficult to avoid. When Fulghor swipes at you, it’s best to dodge <em>towards</em> it, so you don’t get caught in the shockwave after.</p><p>Visually, one of the biggest changes to Fulghor is that it now has its other arm back! It’ll still grow out that grotesque purple arm, though, just like the normal version. When Fulghor reveals the giant purple arm, it’ll slam the ground, unleashing a purple shockwave AOE. This attack comes out incredibly fast, and you’re very unlikely to outrun the blast radius, so your best option is to time your dodge to avoid it.</p><figure id="" data-id="3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-recommend-id="image://3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1101" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-recommend-id="image://3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1101" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>ES Fulghor carries over its rush attack from its normal version. Here, Fulghor will charge at you a few times, leaving a trail of explosive light behind. It takes a few seconds for the light trail to blow up, so it’s to just move out of the way.</p><p>One of ES Fulghor’s new tricks sees it floating up in the sky, and then creating “clouds” that shoot arrows of light towards the ground. The clouds can track your position, so be aware, but they will dissipate shortly. </p><figure id="" data-id="d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-recommend-id="image://d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-recommend-id="image://d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fulghor can now also turn its weapon into a giant twinblade of light. It’ll then perform a 360 degree sweep around itself twice before jumping up and slamming the blade down into the ground, creating a small shockwave. The best way to avoid these attacks is to just dodge-roll through them.</p><p>Last and certainly not least, ES Fulghor’s new most dangerous attack is when it gallops into the air and charges up a giant arrow of light. This attack has an absolutely huge AOE radius and is hard to run away from. Your best option here is to have the entire team disperse in different directions so that when Fulghor targets one of you, the other two are far away enough to avoid the explosion that comes after the arrow.</p><figure id="" data-id="3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-recommend-id="image://3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-recommend-id="image://3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After defeating Fulghor, you’ll earn 25 Sovereign Sigils, which can be spent at the new Collector Signboard outside of the castle hub area. With the introduction of ES Fulghor, there’s a new Relic based on it called the Dark Night of the Champion. It costs 12 Sovereign Sigils to purchase and comes with the following effects:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Increased Maximum Stamina</li><li>Boosts Attack Power of Added Affinity Attacks</li><li>Defeating enemies fills more of the Art gauge</li></ul><p>Everdark Sovereigns cycle in and out every week.

The fan says they have, but it was a while ago. To that, Ryan responds: “Well, you might have to beat it again...” Ryan then nods, knowingly, and smiles. </p><p>“Is this true? I gotta run through all of them again,” says the fan. </p><p>“Well, especially this one,” says Ryan in response. “There’s a reason I say that, but I can’t say anything.”</p><p>So yeah, it seems like Ryan is teasing <em>something </em>about <em>Black Flag</em>. Now, it could be a comic, maybe a new novel, or perhaps some special update that’s coming to <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> that will contain some <em>Black Flag</em>-themed content. But it seems odd that the voice actor for Edward Kenway would have insider knowledge about that stuff or would tease it like this. More likely, this is Ryan teasing the rumored and reported still-in-development <em>Black Flag</em> remake or remaster project. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Ubisoft for comment. </p><p>As previously mentioned, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">in 2023 <em>Kotaku </em>reported</a></span> that it had learned from multiple sources that a remake of the 2013 <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>game was in early stages and would not be completed for a few years. It’s said to be more than a straight port of the old game to new consoles.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-messy-stalled-reckoning-at-an-assassins-creed-co-d-1847336158&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-messy-stalled-reckoning-at-an-assassins-creed-co-d-1847336158"> A team at Ubisoft Singapore</a></span>, one of the studios that has led development on the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise’s evolving ocean tech, is said to be heavily involved in helping to modernize<em> Black Flag. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mp1st.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-more-than-visual-upgrade-new-systems-mentioned&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mp1st.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-more-than-visual-upgrade-new-systems-mentioned" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another report from <em>MP1st </em>in January</a></span> further claimed that the remake was not just a simple port and would include new systems and content. That would likely mean Matt Ryan would need to be brought back in for some voice recording. And considering that voice acting generally doesn’t happen until later in a game’s development, this <em>Black Flag</em> remake may be launching sooner than later. In fact, Ubisoft doesn’t have any big games coming out this holiday season.

The shooter just entered its 17th season, bringing with it a retro-game-themed battle pass, new heroes and maps for Stadium, and map voting across all modes. All of that sounds good on paper, but the addition of map voting and the way Blizzard implemented the system has split the community. After playing around with it myself, I yearn for the days of getting randomly assigned a map before a match.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The way map voting works in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>is that players are presented with three maps before a match begins. Everyone votes for their preferred stage, and then those votes are put into a roulette that picks between them at random. The idea is that the more people who vote for a map, the higher the chance it has of getting picked. This also means that less popular maps aren’t off the table entirely, and that is the first point of contention folks are voicing about the system, as several clips are being published online of a map that gets one vote being selected over a majority decision from the rest of the players in the game.</p><p>A cursory glance <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/map-voting-just-made-me-ragequit/971593&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/map-voting-just-made-me-ragequit/971593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at the Blizzard forums</a></span> will show you people arguing the merits of the system, with some asserting that a system that gives every player a chance to play on a map they want means that you won’t have to play the same maps over and over, even if they still feel like they’re playing on less-popular maps at an alarming frequency. Some are even speculating that the map voting system might be weighing maps with fewer votes differently, but that’s just conjecture. Others would rather Blizzard scrap the roulette system entirely in favor of a majority rule, which would probably fix some folks’ issues with being forced to play on maps they don’t like, but would also likely result in most <em>Overwatch 2 </em>matches taking place on the same handful of popular maps.</p><p>Anecdotally, my frustration with the system is that it makes it difficult (if not impossible) to get time in with newer maps. Season 17 added a new Flashpoint map called Aatlis that I haven’t been able to play a match on even once. In my experience, people vote for the maps they know, and that means that statistically, fewer players are voting for something new they aren’t used to playing on. Every time Aatlis has shown up on map voting, it’s been pretty handily outvoted, so I haven’t even seen the map for myself yet. Before map voting was added, matches would be randomly assigned a map with no input from players, so you would eventually get to see new maps as they came through standard play. Now, I guess I have to jump into a custom match to even run around in it?</p><p>One fix would be for voting to be removed from quick-play modes. I see the argument for having such a system in ranked because people in that mode get sweaty and want to craft what they view to be an optimal game. For those of us who just want to jump into an easy, uncomplicated match, however, map voting adds a new potential frustration without enough benefit to make it worth it. I wanted to get in a match or two on the Pride March Midtown map before it went back into the vault at the end of Pride Month, but now I can’t even stumble upon it without having to cross my fingers that someone else votes for it to improve the odds. The system isn’t even a week old, so there might just be some growing pains for fans and Blizzard to sort through. Hopefully, the team makes some quick improvements to map voting as season 17 goes on.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-new-map-voting-season-17-patch-push-escort-1851785326]]></content:encoded>
