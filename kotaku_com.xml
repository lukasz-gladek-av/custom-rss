Top-ranked former world champion Magnus Carlsen recently showed up to a tournament in jeans, refused to change, got fined, and then threatened to back out of the event altogether. The International Chess Federation (FIDE) then proceeded to blink first.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The drama kicked off on December 27 when Carlsen showed up to the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in New York wearing denim instead of slacks. FIDE said the chess world all-star was in violation of the event’s dress code and hit him with a $200 fine. When Carlsen refused to go pick up dress pants from the TJ Maxx just a block away from the Cipriani Wall Street venue, the federation upped the ante and removed the champion from his 9th round matchups.</p><p>Carlsen then called the federation’s bluff by saying he would back out altogether, ditching the Blitz Chess Championships in which he was set to defend his current title. The federation responded with a lengthy blog post announcing possible exceptions to the dress code to be made at the judges’ discretion. </p><p>“The principle is simple: it is still required to follow the official dress-code, but elegant minor deviations (that may, in particular, include appropriate jeans matching the jacket) are allowed,” the December 29 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fide.com/news/3366&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fide.com/news/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement read</a></span>. “In the end, it is New Year time, and I sincerely hope that nobody would try to undermine the festive mood, including by abusing this additional flexibility.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5T4w5bEz8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5T4w5bEz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview directly after the incident</a></span>, Carlsen said that he had come to the event from a meeting and hadn’t had time to change. He added that while he had offered to change for the matches the following day, that wasn’t enough for the federation. “I’ll probably head off to somewhere where the weather is a bit nicer than here,” he quipped. But now that FIDE has backed off of its “draconian” decision, Carlsen is once again set to appear in the Blitz side of the tournament. </p><p>The five-time world champion wasn’t the only one dinged over his attire. Eighth-ranked Ian Nepomniachtchi was also fined by FIDE for wearing “sport shoes.” But Carlsen’s protest certainly made for more drama. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-cheating-scandal-lawsuit-1849684477&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-cheating-scandal-lawsuit-1849684477">Hans Neimann</a></span>, who Carlsen previously accused of cheating in chess’ now-infamous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639">“anal beads” scandal</a></span>, said the champion had manufactured the jeans fiasco on purpose. </p><p>“Allowing a single actor to make a mockery of the tournament and then bending the knee is disappointing,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1873549360862232682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1873549360862232682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span>. “FIDE has a responsibility to protect the sanctity of the game.

While you could argue that this situation has folks throwing around the phrase “pay to win” a little too liberally, the bug in question is certainly one that should be addressed by developer NetEase.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,195859,196032" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have realized that when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-concord-best-hero-shooters-1851726774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-concord-best-hero-shooters-1851726774"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is running at lower framerates, some hero abilities do less damage or are generally less efficient than they are at higher framerates. In other words, if you’re playing the shooter on a high-end PC that can run the game at a higher framerate, you’ll find your enemies will take more damage from certain attacks than they would if you were playing on a machine that runs the game at a lower framerate. Other idiosyncrasies include certain attacks executing more quickly, or seemingly losing range at lower framerates. The reason some fans are calling this “pay to win” is because if you can afford a beefier PC, you can circumvent the issue entirely.</p><p>Currently, this bug is known to impact five characters: Star-Lord, Wolverine, Doctor Strange, Magik, and Spider-Man. At the moment, this is a bigger problem for players on PC than on console, as those all play at the same framerate across the board. However, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is crossplay, which means you could be teamed up with a PC player affected by this, so it’s a problem for everyone until it’s fixed.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>has received a few patches that have primarily focused on bug fixes, so that seems to be top of mind for the team. Now that this issue has been discovered, hopefully NetEase will be looking into a fix.

Historically, Sonic’s one-sided love affair with the pink, hammer-wielding hedgehog has consisted of Amy fawning over the blue blur. He’s fast, charming, and a hero to the people. It’s easy to see why Amy would grow infatuated with a guy who saved her life but is emotionally unavailable. However, the <em>Sonic</em> series has started to flip the dynamic in recent years. The <em>Sonic Boom </em>version of our hero is implied to have feelings for Amy, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@captaintoadthemushroom/video/7303124575229938976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@captaintoadthemushroom/video/7303124575229938976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mostly through gags and teasing</a></span> from his friends. And in <em>Sonic Frontiers</em>, Sonic is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBIH0j3UyLE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBIH0j3UyLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more or less confirmed</a></span> to have finally come around to the idea of a romantic relationship with Amy, so we’ve definitely moved out of the “Amy hopelessly chasing Sonic” era of their dynamic. With Sega having mostly shed this lopsided relationship, Paramount has the opportunity to turn the entire thing on its head in the live-action universe.</p><p>We still don’t know anything about Amy’s role in the movies, but we do know that Ben Schwartz’s take on Sonic is defined largely by him being a pop-culture-brained doofus prone to bursts of emotion, often in the name of defending those he cares about. As shown in the first movie, he’s been in isolation for much of his life, and he’s not quite the smooth talker we’ve seen in the games. Hell, I’m not even sure Sonic has ever spoken to a woman hedgehog based on what we’ve seen of him in the movies. He was forced to leave his home planet and go to Earth at a young age, and he was the only hedgehog we saw in those early scenes. You expect me to believe that guy is gonna be anything other than an absolute dumbass tripping over himself trying to sort through all those feelings? Amy, meanwhile, is shown to be confident and capable in the few seconds we see of her, rather than the damsel in distress she started as in the games. This seems like the perfect opportunity to play with the relationship, and fans are already hoping to see the two’s romantic story flipped on its head.</p><p>What’s notable about Amy’s debut in the movies is that it’s a direct inverse of her introduction in the games. When Amy was first brought into the fold in <em>Sonic CD</em>, Sonic saved her from his robot doppelganger, Metal Sonic. In <em>Sonic 3</em>’s post-credits scene, she is the one who saves him from a squad of robot hedgehogs. So it seems like Paramount is already sowing the seeds for a “reverse” Sonic and Amy relationship. Still, we won’t know for sure until <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em> premieres in 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first trailer is full of nostalgia for the ‘60s comic books that launched the superhero, but with some stutter-y cel-shaded visuals that aren’t rubbing everyone the right way. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,196053,195859" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Streaming on Disney+ starting January 29, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> tracks Peter Parker experimenting with his powers, costumes, and burgeoning social media popularity while juggling friendships and homework. The first trailer also teases the show’s different timeline in which Osborne, who is normally the Green Goblin, is the technological visionary standing by Spider-Man’s side instead of Stark’s Iron Man. It ends with a first look at the web-slinger’s white and black Fantastic Four suit as well. </p><p>Parker is voiced by Hudson Thomas, Osborne by Colman Domingo, and Aunt May by Kari Wahlgreen, with appearances by Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock, Hugh Dancy’s Doctor Octopus, and other members of the <em>Spider-Man</em> supporting cast. Originally pitched as an origin story for Tom Holland’s version of the character in the MCU, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> is now its own thing, free from the shackles of the live-action productions’ deep and convoluted lore. </p><p>The trailer nails the fusion of modern sensibilities with retro-looking styles, though its lithograph-inspired animation isn’t impressing everyone. Some fans think it looks too choppy and flat. Others are wondering if it’s a budget issue or if this was the intended effect. It certainly doesn’t look smooth, but the comic-book aesthetic comes with its own virtues.</p><p> There are already plenty of <em>Spider-Man</em> cartoons in more traditional styles, so I’m excited to see something that’s taking a fresh visual approach to the well-worn source material. Then again, I’ll also go to the mat defending the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Mm4ZGawqdk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Mm4ZGawqdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wild-looking 3D MTV series from 2003</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
