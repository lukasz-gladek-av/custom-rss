              <p>The window to get gifts in time for Christmas is pretty much closed, but there’s nothing wrong with a slightly belated gift. And if the big fella left you some gift cards or green paper in your stocking, a little indulgence for yourself isn’t the worst idea. A great idea for either scenario is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6579/">Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8, especially since it’s somehow still at its Black Friday pricing of just $250 at Amazon.</a> This deal is for the 40mm Bluetooth model of the Galaxy Watch 8, in graphite or silver color.</p>
<p>The steep price drop for a brand-new 2025 Android smartwatch was a Black Friday and Cyber Monday shocker. Even more surprising is how that $250 price has endured all the way through the holiday shopping season and, apparently, beyond. The Galaxy Watch 8 earned stellar reviews when it dropped this past July and its sales numbers have been consistently excellent. It’s not a refurbished or scratch-and-dent sale or a previous-generation markdown. Best advice? Don’t question it, just buy it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 8 Is Great</h2>
<p>The release of the Galaxy Watch8 series this summer was a huge hit, in no small part because of the number of major upgrades from the very popular Watch7 models. The body of the Galaxy Watch 8 is slimmer and more streamlined, and the screen brightness goes as high as 3,000 nits — 50 percent more than the 2,000-nit max of the Watch7. The Watch8 also comes with a bigger, longer-lasting battery than its predecessor, and improved interaction with Galaxy AI across all of its features.</p>
<p>The Galaxy AI features of the Watch8 really shine when they’re integrated with the watch’s fitness tracking and coaching tech. The watch tracks your performance and compares it to past activity, with AI-powered insights that help create recommendations and prompts throughout the day. Galaxy AI also bolsters the heart-rate analysis performed by the Galaxy Watch8 by filtering out your body’s movements to capture a clearer, more accurate reading.</p>



<h2>Join the Galaxy</h2>
<p>As a standalone smartwatch, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is great, but when it’s an intertwined part of a larger collection of Samsung devices, it really shows its true potential. Paired with a Samsung smartphone, the Galaxy Watch8 receives and displays your text messages and other alerts, and lets you reply to the texts without having to grab your phone. Breaking news, weather alerts, scoring updates from your favorite sports teams — they’re all delivered straight to your wrist, and easily seen and read thanks to the enhanced brightness of the Watch8.</p>
<p>It’s not for us to question the wisdom of Samsung or Amazon when they put one of Samsung’s newest and most advanced smartwatches on sale for 29% off, and then leave it at or very near that exceptionally low $250 price for weeks on end, all through the holiday shopping season. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6579/">The best solution is to accept this $250 Amazon deal on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 as a end-of-year gift.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>I’d hoped 2025 would be a better year than 2024. And in some personal ways, it was. But it was also yet another year filled with layoffs, AI slop, greedy execs, price increases, and more signs that the entire game industry is collapsing.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-bad-news-disappointments-concord-ps5-pro-1851725872">So, like</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-fees-game-awards-ai-nft-women-hacks-price-hike-1851115189">we’ve done</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/2022-gaming-elon-musk-twitter-microsoft-overwatch-2-1849865844">in years past</a>, <em>Kotaku</em> has rounded up a collection of some of the worst, most disappointing video game news and events from 2025 and catalogued it in a handy dandy list. Take breaks as you scroll through this, and let’s all hope 2026 is better. It can’t be worse, right? Please, tell me it can’t be worse. Please…</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>So Many Canceled Games</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000339"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000339">©Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This was the year in which, more than ever before, a lot of big games got canned, or we learned about projects that were binned not long ago.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531"><em>Perfect Dark</em>,</a> the slick-looking reboot of Rare’s sci-fi shooter series? Canned, and the studio behind it shuttered. A <em>Wonder Woman</em> game from Monolith? <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Canceled</a> taking the beloved studio behind <em>No One Lives Forever</em> and <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> down with it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">An EA-published <em>Black Panther</em></a> game from some former Monolith devs that would have reportedly featured a version of <em>Mordor’s</em> popular Nemesis System? Dead and the studio behind it closed, too. <a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">EA also shelved a <em>Titanfall</em> extraction shooter</a> spin-off; Sony killed a few live-service games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">including a <em>God of War</em> multiplayer project</a>; and <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122">a cool-looking <em>Transformers</em></a> game from Splash Damage got the axe this year, leading to, you guessed it, layoffs.</p>

 <p>And these are just the ones that we know about. I’d bet a lot more games were canceled in 2025 as publishers continue to focus more and more on fewer franchises that can be reliably counted on to turn a profit. And as noted, many of these cancellations led to layoffs and studios being closed, a problem worth talking about separately, because in 2025, these cuts and closings happened <em>a lot.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2><strong>More Layoffs And Studio Closings&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000650604" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650604"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650604">©Three Fields Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2025 wasn’t as bad for industry layoffs as 2024, but it was still pretty terrible. Nearly 10,000 developers lost jobs, </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/games-industry-layoff-figures-were-down-slightly-in-2025-but-it-was-still-horrendous-year-in-review"><span>according to layoff tracker Amir Satvat</span></a><span>. That’s down from the over 15,000 pink-slips peak of 2025, but still up from 2022. The big cutbacks were once again at Microsoft, which shaved hundreds of jobs across its gaming division, including at Rare, Zenimax, and King.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But those were hardly the only ones. Notable teams like Cloud Chamber, working on</span><i><span> BioShock 4,</span></i><span> lost dozens of staff, Amazon Gaming cut over 100 positions, and Square Enix made cuts across its international publishing business. Indies were also still hit hard. Heart Machine had to lay people off and end <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> Early Access development early, while <em>Wreckreation</em> maker <a href="https://kotaku.com/burnout-co-founder-studio-three-fields-wreckreation-closing-down-patreon-2000650564">Three Fields Entertainment turned to Patreon as it looks for new funding</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Randomly looking up the developer behind</span><i><span> Floppy Knights</span></i><span> to see what they were working on next, only to find </span><a href="https://www.rosecitygames.com/news/thanks-for-playing"><span>a shutdown notice</span></a><span> on their homepage, pretty much summed up the ongoing industry vibe.&nbsp; – Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong>Generative AI Slop Spreads Through The Game Industry</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000651805" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651805"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651805">©McDonald’s / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Generative AI isn’t new tech. It’s been floating around for a few years now. But in 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791">it felt like AI popped up more than ever</a> across different games and studios. Swen Vincke, the head of&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;</em>maker Larian Studios, <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">stepped into it big time in December</a> after he sounded shockingly bullish on AI generation tools. And Vincke wasn’t alone. Plenty of other video game executives and bosses had lots of positive things to say about AI generation tools.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-swen-vincke-larian-bruce-straley-ai-warhorse-2000654591"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> director Daniel Vávra</a> is all for AI usage if it lets his studio make games faster. Chris Cocks, the CEO of <em>D&amp;D</em> parent company Hasbro, said AI is <a href="https://kotaku.com/guy-in-charge-of-d-d-says-ai-is-supercharging-fandom-1851768792">“supercharging fandom.”</a> Nexon CEO Junghun Lee, whose company owns the studio behind<em> Arc Raiders,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">said in an interview</a> that it’s “important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” and that other companies needed to rely on the tech to “increase [their] competitiveness.”<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-gen-ai-arc-raiders-brendan-green-2000644914"><em> Helldivers 2</em> boss Shams Jorjani thinks</a> people are being too quick to dismiss AI and called <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ use of the tech interesting, adding that in his view the tech “actually makes gaming better.” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/level-5-ceo-says-games-are-now-being-made-80-90-by-ai-making-aesthetic-sense-a-must-for-developers/">Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino reportedly said</a> that it’s “becoming common sense in the creative world to rely on the power of AI to boost work efficiency.” Level-5 is the studio behind <em>Professor Layton</em> and <em>Ni No Kuni.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>The gung-ho attitude so many gaming execs and bosses have toward gen AI tools likely explains how ugly, wonky AI slop keeps ending up in big video games, including<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167"> Battlefield 6</a>,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>,</a>&nbsp; <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">Anno 117: Pax Romana,</a>&nbsp;</em>and others. And despite players almost universally being against AI art and other slop, this trend isn’t going away in 2026. PUBG publisher Krafton plans to spend nearly $70 million on becoming an “<a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-ai-pubg-bloodlines-2-motion-blur-2000638553">AI-first” company</a>. Ubisoft, meanwhile, is investing a lot into leveraging the controversial tech into its future video games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251">even showing off an FPS that was built entirely around AI tech</a>.</p> <p>The shit has even worked its way into <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-gzdoom-source-port-graf-zahl-ai-chatgpt-2000636055">stuff like GZDoom</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazons-fallout-season-1-recap-is-inaccurate-ai-wrong-slop-2000652678">television show recaps</a>. This is our future. It fucking sucks, and until the AI bubble pops, we all will have to put up with more slop in 2026, so greedy execs can make the line go up more by replacing devs and artists with AI chatbots and hoping gamers eventually get over it.</p>

 <h2><strong>Playing Video Games Is Becoming A Very Expensive Hobby</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000003611" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003611"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003611">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s never been cheap to play video games. But in 2025, this already expensive hobby became even more pricey. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/2025-video-game-price-increases">As noted by Stephen Totilo over at <em>Game File,</em></a> since April, there have been eight price hikes total from<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220"> Nintendo</a>,<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"> Sony</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">Microsoft</a> on consoles, accessories, and subscriptions. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">This is likely one big reason why console sales were in the gutter in November.</a> And even if you tried to buy a used Xbox or PS5 to save money, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-cant-believe-how-much-microsoft-is-selling-used-xbox-consoles-for-2000650923">it would still likely be more expensive than that same console would have cost at launch</a> in 2020.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Nintendo became the first publisher to break a shocking price barrier when it announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">Switch 2 launch title <em>Mario Kart World</em> would be priced at $80</a>. Later, Xbox announced that <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> would also be $80, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-outer-worlds-2-price-80-lowered-70-pre-order-pc-1851786791">but the backlash was so strong</a> that it relented and lowered the price to $70. However, Xbox didn’t back down on raising prices on Game Pass and turned the service, once called the best deal in gaming by many, <span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into</a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">&nbsp;a more complicated and expensive subscription service</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">Sony raised prices on PlayStation Plus as well.</a></p>

 <p>Perhaps you decide to skip consoles entirely, build a PC, and take advantage of all the great deals on stores like Steam and GOG. Well, thanks to a number of factors, including tech companies gobbling up parts for AI usage and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">President Trump’s idiotic tariffs</a>, <a href="https://overclock3d.net/news/memory/ddr5-nightmare-memory-prices-continue-to-skyrocket/">RAM and other PC parts</a> are<a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803"> becoming more and more expensive</a>. And this also means that PC handhelds, like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally, will likely cost more when newer versions are announced, and prices on existing models will probably increase.<a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-game-over-for-the-steam-deck-lcd-rip-2022-2025-2000702545"> Valve has also announced</a> that it is done making the cheapest version of the Steam Deck, which isn’t good news for folks looking for an affordable and accessible entry into PC gaming. I mean, none of this is good news, and with rumors swirling that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">next-gen machines will be expensive</a> behemoths, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">I’d recommend gamers start saving up money as we enter 2026.</a></p> <h2><strong>Valve And Credit Card Companies Decide What Games Are Allowed To Exist</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614399"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614399">©EroticGamesClub</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281"><span>five months</span></a><span> since <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-nsfw-adult-games-visa-mastercard-collective-shout-2000614199">Steam and itch.io</a> began purging certain NSFW games from their storefronts following pressure from payment processors like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">Mastercard.</a> Despite an immediate backlash and ongoing calls not to let banks censor art, tons of games remain unavailable to purchase on the world’s biggest PC gaming storefronts. </span></p> <p><span>The worst part of all is that it’s still not even clear who the corporate partners are trying to appease with the crackdown. The message to potential censorship advocates is that if you make enough noise, controversy-averse companies will back down. – Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <p><span>With the current administration being this brain-rotted and online, I imagine most people want to just keep their heads down and not put the spotlight on themselves for longer than they have to.

Some physical game releases on the Switch 2, the hottest new console around, make use of Game Key Cards, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">which are basically little pieces of plastic that don’t contain the game</a>, but instead a digital DRM key that lets you download and play a specific game.

 <p>Meanwhile, I walked into a Target to do some Christmas shopping and discovered that my local store has just stopped selling Xbox games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-physical-code-outer-worlds-1851784446"><em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> skipped</a> a physical Xbox release entirely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699">And PlayStation made only 3 percent of its total profits in 2024 from physical game sales.</a> Yikes.

Fans were given a second trailer to make up for the delay and marked the new date on their calendars. And then, about six months later, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787">Rockstar announced another delay</a>, pushing <em>GTA 6</em> back all the way until November 2026.</p>

 <p>Of course, this wasn’t the most disappointing news to come from Rockstar Games in 2025. No, that would be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">union-busting accusations leveled against the company</a> after it fired over two dozen employees for allegedly sharing confidential information on Discord. The staff who were fired deny these allegations and, with the support of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain, <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/">continued to</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-workers-protest-nyc/">protest at Rockstar’s offices.</a> This whole situation has blown up so much that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-union-busting-firing-keir-starmer-2000652135">UK’s Prime Minister has openly called out Rockstar Games</a> and demanded further investigation. It’s clear this isn’t going away like Rockstar Games likely hoped, and when (if?)<em> GTA 6</em> finally launches in 2026, the company’s firing of these employees will likely be a hot topic among the press and fans.</p>
