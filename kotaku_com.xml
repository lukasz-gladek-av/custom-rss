              <p>Barbie maker Mattel announced that it’s planning to make a live-action movie based on Tony the Tattooed Man, one of the company’s biggest flops ever. It’s yet another example of the toy giant tossing everything at the wall as it desperately tries to create another <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-barbie-movie-makeup-flash-games-y2k-lost-media-pc-1850680031"><em>Barbie</em></a>-sized movie success.</p> <p>On February 3, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/tony-the-tattooed-man-tracie-laymon-directing-mattel-movie-1236707313/"><em>Deadline</em> confirmed that Mattel</a> has teamed up with up-and-coming director Tracie Laymon to develop a live-action film based on the toy maker’s failed 1992 product. The toy, <a href="https://failure.museum/tony-the-tattooed-man-1992/">which was quickly pulled from shelves after parents complained</a>, allowed children to cover a nearly nude man in tattoos that could also be applied to kids themselves.</p>

 <p>Making a movie out of this toy is a wild idea that seems destined to fail, assuming it ever even happens. But things get even wilder and funnier when you read the quotes Mattel and the director provided to <em>Deadline</em> about the toy and the film. These are all real, folks!</p> <p>“After seeing <em>Bob Trevino Likes It</em> [Laymon’s recent Sundance flick] and the specificity and emotional depth that Tracie brings to her characters, I knew that she was the perfect person to develop Tony the Tattooed Man,” said Robbie Brenner, Mattel Studios’ President and Chief Content Officer. “It’s a story that feels especially relevant today, one that explores looking beyond first impressions and leading with empathy.”</p>

 <p>Keep in mind, we are talking about a toy that nobody remembers, that Mattel only released in an odd attempt to appeal to boys, and which flopped so hard that buying these figures online is tricky, as they are considered somewhat rare and collectible. With that in mind, let’s check out what the film’s director and writer had to say about the project:</p>

 <p>“I was immediately drawn to Tony the Tattooed Man from the minute I saw his name and then learned about his short-lived journey as a discontinued toy,” said Laymon. “His story is a reminder of the healing power of second chances and not judging a book – or a person – by their cover, a message I believe the world needs right now. It is an honor to partner with Mattel, who are true allies for artists, on a film that will help restore our faith in humanity.”</p> <p>Read those last few words again and truly ponder them. A movie based on Tony the Tattooed Man will “help restore our faith in humanity.” We really do live in the weirdest and worst timeline, huh?</p>

 <p>Perhaps this is all just a way for the people involved to try to get folks talking about the movie. If that’s the case, it worked. Then again, I’ve heard plenty of execs talk earnestly about the dumbest stuff, so I know all of this could also be genuine. Well, as genuine as this crap can be. It all feels like this is a deleted scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63br4rwl6IM">Apple TV’s <em>The Studio</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Anyway, good luck, Mattel. I bet this movie will <em>definitely</em> match the success and <a href="https://kotaku.com/barbenheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-meme-wikipedia-war-1850664668">cultural impact of 2023’s <em>Barbie</em></a>. I mean, I won’t make that bet, but if <em>you</em> want to waste your money on it, go ahead. I’ll be there to see whatever arrives in theaters.</p>

              <p>Can the latest knock-off Vita out of China impress without breaking the bank? Blizzard QA testers win protections against AI and crunch. And <em>Apex</em>&nbsp;<em>Legends</em> will be unplayable on the original Switch starting later this year. Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture is back after unexpectedly taking a day off so this is a bit of a beefier edition.</p> <p>I’m getting to be an old man and recently said “$2 for beans, in this economy?” out loud at the supermarket to nobody in particular. So I feel this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miski.bsky.social/post/3mdwvnfrcik24"><em>Earthbound</em> inflation meme</a> deep in my bones.</p> <h2>Anbernic reveals a bunch of new Vita-inspired retro handhelds</h2>  <p>From the Ayn Odin 2 Mini to the Trimu Smart Pro, the market for Vita-likes continues to grow. However, Anbernic, which arguably leads the pack when it comes to new retro and Android-based handhelds, announced new Vita-likes that literally have “Vita” in their names. The RG Vita and Vita Pro come in white and black with some slick little design touches. There’s no pricing yet or specs, so we’ll have to wait to see how they stack up. The Pros look very nice, though. The OG Vita still looks the best, but these should be fun alternatives, at least until Sony announces <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119">its own new rumored handheld</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division: The Definitive</em> edition is just a DLC bundle</h2> <p>There was some speculation, and lots of fan copium, <a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970">that the recently leaked definitive edition</a> of <em>The Division</em> would be some sort of next-gen port or include new content. Instead, it has appeared on the Xbox store and in the process revealed that it’s simply a new SKU that bundles a bunch of existing DLC for $50. <em>*Long, extended sigh*</em></p> <h2><em>Arknights: Endfield</em>‘s rogue gacha microtransactions, explained</h2> <p>The <em>Genshin Impact</em> meets <em>Factorio</em> action-RPG had to shut off PayPal integration after players randomly got charged thousands of dollars. What happened? “Based on our review, the issue affected 3,429 orders across servers, involving around 1,800 players,” the company told <em>Eurogamer</em> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000">a statement</a>. “The total value of the affected orders was approximately $80,000, with the highest single affected transaction amounting to $5,289.” On the plus side, everyone accidentally defrauded gets their money back and the rewards they were accidentally charged for.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo’s Switch 2 Edition strategy lowkey sucks</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Getting hands on (head on? 🤔) with the Virtual Boy attachment for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> Online. <a href="https://t.co/8dL44ZQRUa">pic.twitter.com/8dL44ZQRUa</a></p> <p>— GameSpot (@GameSpot) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameSpot/status/2018697252156424389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Okay, that sounds harsh, but I think <em>IGN</em>‘s Logan Plant makes a compelling case for it. Nintendo held a recent round of media previews for its upcoming late winter and early spring lineup. The optional Virtual Boy attachment sounds <a href="https://twitter.com/GameSpot/status/2018697252156424389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2018697252156424389%7Ctwgr%5E94b492268872a61b9810d9c128ea6ba1a6c9f1cf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000665133action%3Dedit">too uncomfortable</a> to be worth $100 for an authentic way to experience such a random assortment of subscription-only games. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mario-tennis-fever-preview-switch-2/">The new <em>Mario Tennis</em> <em>Fever</em></a><i> </i>sounds fun, but not necessarily like the Switch 2’s first killer multiplayer game. And what about the curious Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>?</p>

 <p>Its new edition includes some extra modes, bosses, and multiplayer minigames. “Nothing here comes close to justifying the $80 price tag attached to <em>Mario Wonder</em>’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-already-tired-of-nintendo-switch-2-editions-and-even-new-mario-wonder-content-cant-change-that">Plant writes</a>. “Yes, there’s a $20 upgrade pack for folks who already own <em>Wonder</em>, but for new buyers, a visually upgraded version of a 2023 Switch 1 game with a few new Bellabells and whistles costs more than 2025’s Switch 2-exclusive <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which just feels completely out of whack.”</p> <h2>Blizzard QA testers ratified their first union contract</h2> <p>It guarantees annual wage increases, protects against mandatory crunch, and includes guardrails for how genAI is used. “After nearly two decades in the video game industry, it feels great to work with my fellow union members in ratifying a fair contract that makes it easier to see a real, long-term career in this work,” Blizzard Austin senior quality analyst Matt Gant <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzard-quality-assurance-workers-ratify-video-game-union-contract-microsoft">said in a press release</a>. “This agreement gives us a better working environment with increased pay, benefits, and layoff protections that include recall rights and ensures that quality assurance work remains a stable and respected role for the workers who will build games long after us.”</p>

 <h2>Sony patents an endlessly customizable PlayStation controller</h2> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-has-patented-a-touchscreen-playstation-controller-that-lets-players-choose-where-to-put-the-buttons/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> on a new PlayStation controller patent that turns the whole thing into a touchpad. It was filed back in 2023 and covers “designs and methods for a game controller.” Instead of remapping the individual buttons, the patented design would allow players to customize where the buttons themselves go. “Due to the size of physical control elements, game controls may be limited. In addition, inclusion of controls can increase controller size,” it reads. “There exists a need and a desire to allow for improvements and modifications to game controllers.” Probably not actually happening anytime soon, but it’s a neat idea!</p> <h2><em>Apex Legends</em> is quietly ditching the OG Switch</h2> <p><a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/2017296851247018038">Respawn announced the move</a> late last week, with season 29 being the final season update to come to the older hardware. “Starting August 4, 2026 (Season 30), <em>Apex Legends</em> will no longer be playable on the Nintendo Switch system,” the studio wrote. “Until August 4, 2026, players can continue to jump into the action, earn rewards, and enjoy matches per usual.”</p> <h2>How does Larian’s new RPG end?</h2> <p>“With a lot of fire.” The tease came from CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNKGRnvy5ds">during a studio livestream</a> of <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> on Switch 2. He also confirmed the game’s ending will include credits and be dependent on players’ choices.
