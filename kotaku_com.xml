However, it looks like the publication is gearing up for a return based on posts on its social media channels.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The magazine’s Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram, and YouTube channels have all been revived and now feature a teaser video of a laptop screen displaying the goodbye message that has been sitting on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Informer </em>website</a></span> since it shut down in August. That message was notably not written by any of the staff members and was the only thing you could see on the website for the past seven months after GameStop wiped the publication’s online archive. But in the teaser, the screen glitches out, and the text “{CONSOLE.WRITELINE (CONTINUE?);” appears on the bottom right corner. It ends with a date, March 25, 2025, teasing some kind of announcement next week.</p><p>After the teaser went live, several members of <em>Game Informer</em>’s staff at the time of the shutdown have posted similar teasers on their personal social media accounts, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-content director Brian Shea</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former editor-in-chief Matt Miller</a></span>. So if you were worried that GameStop had revived <em>Game Informer </em>as some kind of AI slop machine, take heart: it looks like some of the people who were working at the site before its shutdown are involved.</p><p><em>Game Informer</em>’s closure in August was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-informer-magazine-shutting-down-closed-react-staff-1851611950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-informer-magazine-shutting-down-closed-react-staff-1851611950">a brutal blow not only to the games media landscape</a></span> but to video game history, as the publication had provided a window into the work of many beloved developers and the evolution of many popular franchises throughout its 33-year run. If the site is coming back, hopefully the archives are as well. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

College sports are growing and changing, and our focus at EA Sports is on continuing to put athletes first as we bring them in the game in <em>College Football 26</em> and beyond.”</p><p>It’s believed that around 11,00o players will allow their likenesses and names to be used in <em>College Football 26</em>, which is roughly the same as last year.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
