A skateboarder recently claimed that he will be included in a yet-be-announced remaster of a <em>Tony Hawk</em> skateboarding video game. It’s yet one more piece of evidence that a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>game is in the works. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="338" data-playlist="195805,196470,196163" data-current="195805"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21320.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On February 18, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/3umK3xG7Ly4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/3umK3xG7Ly4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with the <em>Breakfast Club</em> podcas</a></span>t, professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones talked about how he started skating, and his ongoing career.

This remake of the first two games in the series launched in 2020. This is the only <em>THPS</em> game that Jones has appeared in, so he seems to be indicating that a new game—his second appearance in the series—is coming soon. Activision has yet to announce anything.</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about a new <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> game being in development.

Or maybe it’s a remaster or remake of <em>T</em>o<em>ny Hawk’s Underground</em>, my favorite game in the series and a fan favorite. Or <em>maybe </em>its a totally new mobile game and we are all getting way too excited about these teases. </p><p>One thing is for sure: There seems to be a new <em>Tony Hawk</em> skateboarding game in our near future.
