            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been over a decade since the last numbered <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game. While the precision-based hack-and-slash series was sleeping, most action games went one of two ways. They either morphed into sprawling RPG adventures full of bloat or tried to ape the obsession with Soulslikes, incorporating methodical hitbox dodging and disciplined stamina management. But one of the kings of 3D arcade action is awake again and ready to dispense with all of the popular trend chasing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-ryu-xbox-game-pass-release-date-1851746372"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> is mostly a game about killing tons of guys by executing the most lethal combos and flashiest executions you can master, and it seems to be completely content with that. I am too.</p> <p>I had a chance to play a recent build of the game at Microsoft’s campus (Xbox is publishing the game) during <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/pax-west-2025">PAX West 2025</a> ahead of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>‘s release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21. The joint venture between Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta</em> makers Platinum Games appears to be going great. Rather than a disjointed sequel divided between two game design philosophies struggling with each other and the series’ infamous legacy, what I played of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> felt smooth, focused, and fun. Most importantly it exuded confidence about what it is: a high-skill action game that rewards diligent fans with satisfyingly gory thrills.</p> <p>The story revolves around returning frontman Ryu Hayabusa and a new hero, the Raven Clan’s Yakumo, as they scale a cyberpunk-infused Sky City Tokyo infested with new daemon horrors and futuristic ninja soldiers. Each character has access to different weapons and skill sets, and which you play depends on the chapter your in. The option to replay any chapter as either one unlocks after you finish, and for demo purposes I opted to go with Ryu for old times’ sake.</p>

 <p>Within seconds I was chopping off heads and staggering enemies with throwing stars. A perfect dodge gives you a small window to press the attack with a counter-strike that breaks through enemy defenses. There’s also a perfect parry that consists of attacking an enemy right as they’re about to attack you, but it’s an awkward window to exploit and doesn’t feel nearly as satisfying when you’re in the heat of combat (and for those who want a less crunchy experience, there’s an option in the settings menu to turn hitstop completely off).</p>  <p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> thrives when you’re constantly moving and trying to combo light, heavy, and projectile attacks into a conveyor belt of carnage. Doing so builds up meter to unleash special attacks or enter a time-limited transformation that alters your moveset an also makes it more lethal, culminating in stylish new insta-kill animations that swap the screen to black, white, and red. The old obliterations are there too, letting you unleash geysers of blood as you quickly execute foes already suffering from severed limbs. The pulled-out third-person camera also performed well during the demo, rarely tripping me up with off-screen attacks amid the controlled chaos.</p>

 <p>I only had time to experience the first layer or two of combat, and can see how two characters, a handful of weapons each, and all of the other secondary moves can add up into a combat system with enough depth to keep things interesting while never losing sight of the moment-to-moment satisfaction that propels a game like this forward and keeps you from rage-quitting once you hit a difficulty spike or two (there are three difficulty modes in<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em> that you can swap between at any time).</p> <p>What I’ll be most curious to see from the finished game is whether its level design will feel equally refined or just like a means to an end. The early couple of sections I experienced included some wall running, wall jumping, and grappling hook swinging, both for platforming and combat. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> has collectibles and I encountered the occasional fork in the road to explore, while statues dotting the level offer checkpoints at which to buy items from and upgrade skills.</p> <p>But most of the action was confined to flat arenas without many interesting features outside of some split elevations and grappling hook points. If Team Ninja and Platinum Games are able to imbue the later stages with as much drama in-between the big battles as during them, N<em>inja Gaiden 4</em> could be the return to demanding hack-and-slash action fans have been waiting for, perfecting the essentials and carving away the rest.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/wb-warner-bros-streak-weapons-box-office-record-opening-weekend-minecraft-2000616900">Media giant Warner Bros.</a> is suing Midjourney, claiming in a newly filed lawsuit that the AI company offers a service that creates “infringing images and videos” without WB’s “consent or authorization” and stating that Midjourney “thinks it is above the law.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/911515490/WBD-v-Midjourney-Complaint-Ex-a-FINAL-1#from_embed">The new WB lawsuit against Midjourney was filed on September 4</a> in a U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. In it, WB lawyers argue that Midjourney did nothing to protect rights holders from users being able to create images and videos using copyright-protected characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Scooby-Doo. WB’s legal team called the choice not to stop people from creating all of this infringing slop a “calculated and profit-driven decision.” It also claims that Midjourney is fully aware of the “breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement.”</p> 

 <p>In the lengthy filing, WB lawyers provide multiple examples of Midjourney’s AI generating near-carbon-copy recreations of famous WB-owned characters like The Joker and Batman. It also includes some examples of users sharing generated images of characters like Rick and Morty and R2-D2 in Midjourney’s own Discord server.</p> <p>“Midjourney thinks it is above the law,” explained WB in its lawsuit. “It sells a commercial subscription service, powered by artificial intelligence technology, that was developed using illegal copies of Warner Bros. Discovery’s copyrighted works. The Service lets subscribers pick iconic Warner Bros. Discovery copyrighted characters and then reproduces, publicly displays and performs, and makes available for download (i.e., distributes) infringing images and videos, and unauthorized derivatives, with every imaginable scene featuring those characters. Without any consent or authorization by Warner Bros. Discovery, Midjourney brazenly dispenses Warner Bros. Discovery’s intellectual property as if it were its own.”</p>

 <p>Warner Bros. isn’t the first big entertainment company to go after Midjourney.&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/midjourney-ai-disney-lawsuit-copyright-marvel-star-wars-1851784340"> Earlier this year, Disney and NBCUniversal teamed up</a> to file a massive lawsuit against the AI company. Disney and NBC had similar complaints and evidence as that which WB has compiled. In response to Disney suing the company, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/midjourney-disney-ai-training-lawsuit-1236481167/">Midjourney pushed back</a> and claimed training its AI on copyrighted works was “fair use” and added that “copyright law does not confer absolute control over the use of copyrighted works.” The AI company also said that Disney and other media giants want to have it “both ways,” using AI and then suing AI companies. According to Midjourney’s lawyers, the company has many accounts tied to NBC and Disney email addresses, suggesting both media giants are using Midjourney’s services themselves.</p> <p>As AI-generated content becomes easier to produce and cheaper to create, these types of lawsuits are likely to become more common, with rights-holders and artists attempting to fight back against the <a href="https://kotaku.com/leaked-fallout-merch-ai-art-target-hot-sauce-bethesda-2000622731">growing flood of AI-generated slop</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-layoffs-fifa-22-ea-sports-fc-microtransactions-profi-1848945221">Electronic Arts</a> is seemingly giving up on its plans to develop a new college basketball game and letting 2K Sports make one instead, according to a leaked email obtained by <em>Extra Points</em>.</p> <p>A little background: <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339">In June, EA Sports teased online</a> that it was developing a new college basketball game, which would have been the first from EA since 2009’s<em> NCAA Basketball 10</em>. So a lot of fans were excited about the news. However, there was a problem. <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1869824116339159465">2K also had video game plans</a> that involved college basketball teams and players. Unlike EA’s plan to develop a whole video game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-college-hoops-ea-college-football-26-1851784967">2K wants to create college basketball</a> DLC for <em>NBA 2K</em> and/or a new mode in the game as a way of testing the waters for a full, standalone release later. And despite the College Licensing Company asking schools to sign EA’s deal, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-ncaa-2k-hoops-ucla-2000621071">it was reported last month</a> that many Division 1 schools were taking 2K’s deal instead. As a result, EA is taking its digital ball and leaving.</p> <p><a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/ea-sports-college-basketball-may-be-in-big-big-trouble">As reported by<em> Extra Points</em> on September 4</a>, a leaked email from EA Sports VP of commercial licensing Sean O’Brien to multiple college licensing directors seems to indicate that the publisher is giving up on its plans. In the email, O’Brien wished the schools “good luck” while expressing that everyone at EA was “disappointed” that “some schools” were “choosing to accept” 2K’s deal.&nbsp; Here’s the full email:</p> <blockquote><p>Hi…I hope you had a great Labor Day weekend.</p> <p>Given there are some schools choosing to&nbsp;accept the 2K Sports proposal for inclusion in <em>NBA 2K</em>, the offer to be included in a college basketball video game will unfortunately have to be rescinded.</p> <p>Everyone at EA SPORTS is disappointed that we all couldn’t find an acceptable path forward, but we appreciate your support in trying to bring a stand-alone college basketball game with all men’s and women’s Division 1 institutions and student athletes, conferences as well as the NCAA, in a way that fans have told us they want.&nbsp; We really appreciate your support.</p> <p>Good luck with back to school and an exciting start to the football season.</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Sean O’Brien<br> VP Commercial Partnerships &amp; Licensing<br> EA SPORTS</p></blockquote> <p>Of course, it’s also possible that EA Sports purposely leaked this email to <em>Extra Points</em> in an attempt to use angry fans to pressure schools into accepting its game proposal. “See,” EA can say. “Blame 2K and the colleges for not letting us make a whole new game. Enjoy your DLC instead.” That’s pure speculation, but even if that wasn’t the plan, it’s likely that fans hoping for a new college basketball game in the future aren’t going to be happy that EA is giving up, while 2K is reportedly just doing DLC for NBA 2K.</p> <p>Is this wild saga over? Will EA actually make a college basketball game after all? Will 2K get bullied into changing its plans? Who can say? <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339">But considering how well <em>EA’s College Football 25</em>&nbsp;game sold last year</a> and how much money a college basketball game could make, I imagine we haven’t seen the end of this.</p>
