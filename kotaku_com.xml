The sequel hasn’t panned out the way Blizzard promised after it reportedly canceled the story campaign that was the whole point of a sequel. So it’s easy to look at all the changes <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has implemented and wish we could just go back to the original game. Well, it looks like Blizzard might be teasing something that will poke at the yearning veteran fans are feeling, as a rebrand of its socials has fans wondering if something like a “Classic” <em>Overwatch </em>might be in the works.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It all started today, November 8, when the <em>Overwatch </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayOverwatch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social channels</a></span> were updated with images spotlighting poster girl Tracer in her original game design, rather than the updated look she dons in the sequel. This was accompanied by a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1854569505822756915&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1854569505822756915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of posts highlighting different events in the last eight years</a></span> since <em>Overwatch </em>launched in 2016, as well as a new trailer set to premiere on Monday, November 11, at noon Eastern. The trailer itself includes the old school Tracer art as the thumbnail, but is otherwise pretty nondescript.</p><p>It’s unclear if this might be a proper <em>Overwatch Classic </em>similar to the <em>World of Warcraft Classic </em>Blizzard released in 2019 that brought the MMORPG back to basics or if this is in reference to the previously announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742">6v6 test</a></span> that will allow players to engage in 12-player matches like they did before <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s release. If it’s the latter, it seems a little soon considering those tests aren’t set to begin until Season 14, which begins in December. But whatever’s going on, this mystery trailer seems to be about something old becoming new again.</p><p>Will reverting back to 6v6 put <em>Overwatch 2</em> in fans’ good graces again? Part of me wonders if the stink has just gotten too potent for some people to ever come back and stay for an extended period of time. But I’ll take anything that makes the game feel fresh again <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081">instead of a giant bummer</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I’ve been playing around with Sony’s most expensive console ever for the past week, and the biggest issue I have with it, besides the high price, is that its really hard to actually figure out what games run and look better on it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">PlayStation 5 Pro</a></span> is not a console you probably need to buy. However, if you have a really good 4K TV and you care about framerates and ray tracing, then it’s an impressive machine that provides truly fantastic looking upgrades to games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-cloud-cross-save-ps5-pro-mass-effect-1851691865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-cloud-cross-save-ps5-pro-mass-effect-1851691865"><em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span><em>.</em> But unless you look up a list online, its hard to actually find which games in your library or on the store are PS5 Pro enhanced. </p><p>When I booted up the PS5 Pro, the first thing I did was hop into my library to see which of the games that I already owned supported Sony’s new powerful console. This isn’t easy. There is currently no symbol or text on a game’s tile or cover to indicate if its PS5 Pro enhanced. Even when I click on game and it opens up a sub menu, there is still no indication if it’s going to take advantage of the new features.</p><p>Currently, the only way to figure this out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-specs-list-enhanced-upgraded-games-elden-ring-1851688507?_gl=1*18f4ggf*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTA4NjIyNC4yMi4xLjE3MzEwODcwMDYuNDcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-specs-list-enhanced-upgraded-games-elden-ring-1851688507?_gl=1*18f4ggf*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTA4NjIyNC4yMi4xLjE3MzEwODcwMDYuNDcuMC4w">besides checking our list  or Sony’s website</a></span>, is to look at the PSN Store. You can either do this directly in the store or via a “Show Product” option in your game library. There you’ll see a PS5 Pro Enhanced badge, letting you know that yes, this game will look and run better on your new expensive machine.</p><h2 id="h153918"><a id=""></a>Sony, steal this idea from the Xbox Series X</h2><p>At first, when I got the PS5 Pro last week, I assumed that Sony would have a plan to make it easier to find Pro Enhanced games while using the console and its store. So I waited until after the PS5 Pro launched on November 7 and... nothing. I still can’t quickly tell at a glance what is or isn’t enhanced.</p><p>Sony has added a PS5 Pro enhanced section to the store, but as far as I can tell it doesn’t show every game that is actually enhanced. And for a day or so it showed <em>Dead Rising 2</em>, which is a PS4 game that isn’t at all enhanced. (It’s been removed since and replaced with<em> Dead Rising Deluxe Remaste</em>r, which <em>is</em> enhanced.) </p><p>Thankfully, there is now a PS5 Pro enhanced filter you can apply to the store, which is helpful. However, this filter can’t be applied to your own library of games, which seems silly! </p><p>As someone who plays a lot of Xbox Series X, I really appreciate that Microsoft uses icons to quickly indicate what games are native Series X/S titles and which ones aren’t. I hope Sony looks into adding some indicator or icon for games that run better on PS5 Pro, so its easier for folks to actually take advantage of the most powerful PlayStation console ever made. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
