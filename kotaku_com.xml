              <p data-start="75" data-end="854">Upgrade your gaming experience by investing in quality audio. If you’ve been relying on the standard speakers built into your television, you’re in for a dramatic improvement. Transitioning from basic TV sound to a dedicated over-the-ear gaming headset is like discovering you’ve needed glasses your entire life, only to finally put them on and see clearly. Suddenly, subtle details come alive. The soft scuffle of enemy footsteps, the direction of distant gunfire, or the echo of movement in a cavernous environment. With proper spatial audio, you gain the ability to pinpoint opponents with sound alone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5800/">Fortunately, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X multi-platform gaming headset is now available at a 30% discount, dropping its price from $150 to just $105 ahead of Black Friday.</a></p>

<h2 data-start="856" data-end="1431">What Makes the Arctis Nova 5X Stand Out</h2>
<p data-start="856" data-end="1431">Though the Arctis Nova 5X is built with Xbox consoles in mind—both in terms of design and technical optimization—it’s a flexible headset that works across a wide range of systems. It’s compatible with Xbox Series X and Series S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. It also supports VR devices and mobile platforms, making it a versatile audio solution for varied gaming environments. The fit is designed for lasting comfort, featuring an adjustable steel headband paired with memory-foam ear cushions that keep you cool and comfortable during long play sessions.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="2027">The headset’s magnetic drivers deliver an exceptionally detailed sound profile. You’ll hear crisp highs, accurate mids, and rich low frequencies that bring game worlds to life. The Arctis Nova 5X also supports 360° spatial audio, allowing you to get the most out of the next-gen audio systems built into your console and hear sound coming from all directions. The sound levels are customizable. You can choose between over 100 Xbox presets in the Arctis Nova 5 companion app on your smartphone.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="2027">Wireless connectivity is fast and dependable. The headset connects over a portable USB-C dongle, ensuring a lag-free, lossless audio experience. A USB-C to USB-A cable is also included, giving you flexibility when you need to plug in.</p>


<p data-start="2029" data-end="2392">Battery life is another standout here. The Arctis Nova 5X delivers up to 60 hours of use on a single charge, meaning you can game for days without plugging in. When you do need power in a pinch, USB-C Fast Charge support gives you six hours of playtime after just 15 minutes of charging—perfect for those moments when you’re eager to jump back into the action.</p>
<p data-start="2394" data-end="2904">The headset’s dual-audio capabilities allow you to stay connected beyond your console. By linking your mobile device simultaneously, you can take phone calls during a gaming session, listen to podcasts while grinding through hunts in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, or coordinate strategies with friends over Discord while battling opponents in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. And if you’re only interested in game audio and not chatting, the retractable microphone tucks away neatly, keeping the headset’s profile clean and unobtrusive.</p>
<p data-start="2906" data-end="3081"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5800/">For a limited time, you can take advantage of a 30% discount on the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X, bringing this quality gaming headset down to an appealing price of just $105.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modders celebrate <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-new-update-next-gen-patch-stop-bethesda-mods-1851473401">10 years of improving <em>Fallout 4</em></a> with their own anniversary collection, Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt earns a big defender, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334">very good Analogue 3D</a> (I’ve tested it but still need to publish my full review) is finally getting a Bluetooth N64 controller that actually looks cool. Welcome to the latest edition of <em>Morning Checkpoint</em>, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s Black Friday season which means I’m about to stock up on extra controllers to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. It’s not great that modern game pads cost more than ever and wear out twice as fast.</p> <h2>Modders have put together their own <em>Fallout 4</em> Anniversary Collection</h2> <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15406">The package includes</a> a curated round-up of all of the community’s favorite free fan-made add-ons for Bethesda’s decade-old RPG. But the <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Collection</em> is more than that. “It’s a thank-you to the creators who’ve kept <em>Fallout 4</em> evolving long after launch, and a gift to players returning to the Wasteland with fresh eyes,” wrote Nexus user ModularCocoon. “Whether this is your first playthrough in years or your fifteenth settlement build this month, this is the Commonwealth at its most refined: a snapshot of what ten years of modding can achieve.”</p>

 <p>That’s in contrast to the official update from Bethesda which recently messed a bunch of things up and drove the game down to its lowest user rating ever on Steam with “overwhelming negative” reviews. “Game has been out for a decade and received two recent updates,” one player wrote. “I still get a black screen on startup and have to track down an ini file to make it work.” Bethesda is <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-patch-anniversary-edition-hot-fix-bethesda-2000643952">trying to fix it</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> devs promise to fix the new motion blur issue</h2> <p>The 2023 release recently received its new, free <em>Valley of Memory</em> DLC expanding on Basim’s adventure with new content and new parkour options. But it also got rid of the ability to toggle motion blur off, in addition to tuning up the effect way beyond what fans were used to. It’s been making players dizzy and making the game look bad. Ubisoft promised it’s <a href="https://x.com/AccessTheAnimus/status/1991544515702784466">prioritizing a fix</a> to add the settings toggle back in ASAP.</p>

 <h2>One Geralt compliments another</h2> <p>Doug Cockle, who voices Geralt in the <em>Witcher</em> video games, says Liam Hemsworth, who now plays him in Netflix’s&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em> series, is doing a fine job, despite season 4’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-season-4-reviews-liam-hemsworth-2000640506">abominable reception and ratings</a>.</p> <p>“I loved Henry. He was a fantastic Witcher, Geralt, specifically, so I was sad to see him go, but I have watched the newest season, and I think Liam holds up pretty well,” Cockle <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/geralts-game-actor-says-he-was-sad-to-see-henry-cavill-go-but-that-liam-hemsworth-holds-up-pretty-well-in-the-witcher-season-4-hes-made-it-his-own-character/">told <em>GamesRadar</em></a>. “He’s different. He’s made it his own character, and that’s what he should have done as an actor, and I think he’s done a fantastic job. So I’m looking forward to seeing Season Five eventually, and seeing where it goes.”</p>

 <h2>This is the N64-style gamepad the Analogue 3D should have shipped with</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller for Analogue 3D (Grey) up for preorder on 8BitDo ($44.99) <a href="https://t.co/Jd9OH3869E">https://t.co/Jd9OH3869E</a> <a href="https://t.co/P8Si5rhRsQ">pic.twitter.com/P8Si5rhRsQ</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1991538298934747585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>8bitdo<a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-64-bluetooth-controller"> just revealed</a> a gray variant of its Bluetooth controller for its new retro console that plays Nintendo 64 games. It’s $45 and looks great compared to the all-black base model, but it’s not shipping until the end of January 2026. Hopefully, it has a better thumbstick than the current Analogue 3D controllers as well.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur</em> could get an <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair drop</h2> <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> designer Gavin Verhey said he’s into the idea of a collaboration with the surprise turn-based RPG hit of 2025. “My general theory recently is that gaming brands are just really good collaborations for <em>Magic</em>,” he <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/magic-the-gathering/lead-magic-the-gathering-dev-is-hoping-for-a-clair-obscur-expedition-33-collab-3282548/">told <em>Dexerto</em></a>. “When you bring someone new in with a gaming collaboration, they’re already gamers. You don’t have to explain what hit points are, what an objective is, or what mana is. They just get it.”</p>

 <p>He added, “I mean, it’s the talk of the town this year right? <em>Expedition 33</em> would be really fun to get to do…who knows if it’ll happen or if they’re even up for that kind of thing, right?”</p> <h2><em>Silent Hill 2</em> sneaks onto Xbox Series X/S</h2> <p>The remake port was quietly shadow-dropped this week with a big 50 percent off discount. Any Xbox fans who haven’t already played it on another platform can grab it for just $35, which is almost as good as having it on Game Pass (or even better for those who prefer to own). Konami <a href="https://t.co/DAImTnGEDc">recently teased</a> that it’s planning more<em> Silent Hill</em> games in addition to the recently released <em>Silent Hill f</em> and an in-development remake of <em>Silent Hill 1</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-november-2025-reanimal-trailer-free-demo-2000645835">Xbox’s surprise showcase yesterday had some neat surprises, including <em>Echo Generations 2</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-game-reddit-steam-reviews-2000645900"><em>Where Winds Meet</em> is Steam’s latest big free-to-play MMO and it’s full of weird stuff</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/expedition-33-verso-actor-ben-starr-speech-awards-layoffs-2000645930"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> swept the Golden Joystick awards and actor Ben Starr had a message for the industry</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-14-port-docking-station-gets-a-black-friday-price-tag-despite-being-a-new-release-but-only-a-few-units-exist.1360906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most of us rely on multiple devices to get through the day. These are great to stay productive, but things can often get a little messy on the connectivity side. Before you know, you’re dealing with a whole bunch of cables and adapters on your desk; not a good sight.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make your workstation cleaner and more efficient, investing in a docking station can be a smart choice. These tiny but mighty devices serve as a connectivity hub, letting you add multiple external peripherals at the same time, plus charge your essentials as well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5535/">Today is a great time to pick a top-rated option, as Amazon’s early Black Friday sale has dropped the price of the 14-port Anker Prime Docking Station by 30%.</a> It’s now available for just $210, after a whopping $90 discount. The deal applies to the gray color option and is open to all shoppers. The black version is going for $272 (down from $340), but the discount is exclusive to Prime members on that one. Note that most early deals wrap up before the event, which means this one is only around for a limited time. It’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for Multiple Essentials</h2>
<p>Anker has packed this docking station with 14 ports in total. You’re getting a 140W 10Gbps USB-C upstream port, two 100W 10Gbps USB-C ports, one 100W 5Gbps USB-C port, two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, two 5Gbps USB-A ports, one 480Mbps USB-A port, a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, a headphone and mic combo jack, and SD and TF card slots. That’s enough to add all your essentials without feeling limited. Think mouse, keyboard, laptop, external monitors, headphones, external storage, and more.</p>
<p>The three USB-C ports at the front support both charging and data transfer. You can juice your laptop up with up to 140W via the upstream port, and use the rest to charge other devices. The full 140W power can be achieved when you only have the laptop connected at the front. The two HDMI and DisplayPort let you add up to three external monitors to your setup simultaneously, including one in 8K.</p>



<p><strong>The station is compatible with both macOS 13.5 or later and Windows 10/11</strong>, but you will need to install the latest DisplayLink driver if you want to add more screens to the setup. It’s not that complicated, as all that you need to do is head over to the Anker website, find the DisplayLink installer that matches your system, and proceed with the download. Just make sure to uninstall any older versions of the driver already on your system, and then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. macOS users will also need to enable screen recording and allow the driver to launch automatically after login to proceed.</p>
<p>The process shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and once it’s done, you can enjoy multitasking on a bigger setup. Take video calls on one screen and present using the other. Or work on your main display, while having reference material and relevant documents open on the others! The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>There’s also a smart display on the front, just above the USB-C ports. It provides real-time updates on charging power, display performance, and other settings. Anker has even included a built-in fan paired with ActiveShield 3.0 to keep things cool as the docking station works. The box comes with the docking station itself, USB-C to USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 cable for upstream port (3.3 ft, 10 Gbps), 6ft AC power cord, safety sheet with user manual, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>Get your orders in fast, before Amazon decides to shoot the price back up to the not-so-friendly $300.</p>

              <p>As “pedophile hellscape”&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> finally adds <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/roblox-introduces-age-based-chat-to-enhance-user-safety-gaming-parent-controls-robloxs-facial-checks-adult-minor-teen-chatting-chatbox-safe">a rudimentary measure</a> to try to prevent children from being exploited via its network of games and chatrooms used by 151 million people, the company’s CEO <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">spoke to the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em></a> podcast Hard Fork about child safety. And it didn’t go great. It&nbsp;<em>really</em> didn’t go great.</p> <p><em>Roblox</em> is coming under increasing scrutiny after decades of failing to implement even the most basic of protective measures to keep its pre-teen players away from the networks of pedophiles who use the game to find victims. Described last year as <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">“a pedophile hellscape for kids”</a> by Hindenburg Research<a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">,</a> the game quickly introduced a <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">new assortment of measures</a>&nbsp;last October that did next to nothing, leading this year to a great deal of legal interest. Three months back, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-brainrot-grow-a-garden-hellscape-2000618002">the state of Louisiana announced its intentions to sue&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em></a> for the dangers it was allowing, joined since by Kentucky and Texas. These actions come alongside <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/roblox-announces-new-safety-measure-amid-spate-lawsuits/story?id=127626071">35 other ongoing lawsuits</a>, including one from only yesterday <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/investigations/cuyahoga-county-family-sues-roblox-says-online-gaming-app-led-to-sexual-exploitation-of-13-year-old-boy">by a family in Cuyaho County</a> following <i>Roblox</i>‘s alleged use in the tragic and too common abuse of their 13-year-old son.</p>

 <p>On Wednesday of this week, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat"><em>Roblox</em> announced</a> it was beginning to roll out a new method of checking player ages before they could access chat, this time using facial recognition to try to restrict players to only talking to others in their age range. Such facial ID checks have become commonplace in the UK following the disastrously poor UK Online Safety Act, by which porn sites and other age-restricted outlets are required to verify users’ ages. This has led to sites like X, Bluesky and Discord also requiring British users to prove their age, usually by showing their face on camera in a measure that entirely thwarts all seven people who haven’t heard of a VPN.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646197" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646197"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646197">© Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>Regarding this rollout, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>‘ Casey Newton spoke to&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> co-founder and CEO David Baszucki about the new plans</a>, and whether they can really help. It doesn’t begin well. When asked about the “scope of the problem” of predators in the application, Baszucki came in shoulders first saying, “We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well.” Ah, the good ol’ opportunities available when your company’s product is rife with pedophilia. He continued, outlining how wonderful it is that young people can build and communicate together, how they have “150 million daily actives, 11 billion hours a month, like what is the best way to keep pushing this forward.” It is the most astonishingly tone-deaf response.</p>

 <p>Newton attempts to get some sensible answers from Baszucki about how the ID checks will work, and why they won’t be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">as easily evaded as so many others</a>, and amidst Baszucki’s corporate waffle he’s told that <em>Roblox</em> is apparently always looking out for “weird signals” and will ask for further age verification should these appear, although he didn’t explain what those signals might be, nor what these further checks would be. But then Newton goes on to ask the painfully necessary question: why has it taken 19 years to even <em>try</em> to stop adults from being able to speak to children?</p>

 <p>Baszucki responds by talking about the evolution of <em>Roblox</em>‘s text filtering tech for inappropriate language and personally identifying information over the last two decades, and how it’s always improving, which is great but clearly not relevant to the question. Newton is having none of it, responding, “Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. When I read these lawsuits and these investigations into the company, it does not seem like predators are having that hard of a time getting around your filters…So I’m curious what’s made you so confident that things are working?” Baszucki’s response is incoherent.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“I don’t want to comment on it. We do see the chat logs of those. And we can see interesting and, many times, ways of people trying to—I’d say, many times people who are fairly sophisticated, and I’m not going to say all of them, many times kids who are over 13, who actually in any other app are not running in a filtered situation, unfortunately, figuring out how to jump to some other platform where they can communicate unfiltered, where they can share images, all of it. It’s one of the primary things we’re doing is trying to keep people on our platform. It’s an interesting industry situation. I would say, we’re not waiting for the rest of the industry. We’re like, we’re always trying to stay ahead of it. On the California age-appropriate design code, for example, we’re like, we are already doing all of that stuff. And the same thing with age estimation: We’re not doing this because of any laws that are coming, we think it’s the right thing to do.”</p></blockquote> <p>Newton very impressively keeps his cool, and rather than pointing out that this answer had nothing to do with the situation, nor indeed how unbelievable it is that the CEO of the company would say “I don’t want to comment on it” when asked why he’s confident in age tech that clearly doesn’t work, he instead points out that the lawsuits are demonstrating that “<em>Roblox</em> is kind of, you know, where predators go to find kids.”</p>

 <p>Things become increasingly tense, as Baszucki tries to claim this is a misrepresentation, and when pressed on whether he truly doesn’t believe&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> has a predator problem replies, “I think we’re doing an incredible job at innovating relative to the number of people on our platform and the hours, in really leaning in to the future of how this is going to work.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000646198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646198"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646198">© Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>What becomes so grimly apparent is that even now, even after a year of extraordinary scrutiny and legal pressure, Baszucki still doesn’t have a grip on the situation at all. To be so ill-prepared for such obvious questions, to have no coherent responses for why the new tech will be effective, and to go so out of his way to appear so uninterested in the subject, is astonishing. As he’s pressed further on the ease with which predators can suggest children speak to them on another platform, Baszucki eventually unravels into literal gibberish:</p> <blockquote><p>“I would actually say that is a very simple red flag. Like, that sounds like text filter many prior generations. So I would say the techniques are much more sophisticated than that. We’re constantly getting better than that and sometimes it’s adversarial. Like, we’re getting into, you know, if we cryptographically were going to try to have an exchange of how to share your Snap handle or whatever handle. We see some of that starting, like things we’ll have to essentially prevent in the future.”</p></blockquote> <p>The CEO seems to believe that the scale of&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> is somehow an excuse to justify its problems, repeatedly coming back to its 150 million users and 11 billion hours a month, as if this explains it all away. But more problematically, as Newton points out that the company wants those numbers to grow, Baszucki immediately switches back to talking about what an amazing financial opportunity this is. Given&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/roblox-150-million-users-into-ad-dollars/"><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>is really struggling to turn those users into money</a>, it reads like he’s only speaking to investors and analysts who are increasingly concerned about&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>‘s lack of profits. So many responses begin with an infuriatingly irrelevant attempt to avoid the question, and then end with words like “And you could imagine&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> at 20-X this scale, having 50 percent of the gaming market space all in a single place.” It’s so crass!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646195"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646195">© The New York Times / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But not nearly as crass as Baszucki’s response to a question over <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">the Hindenburg Research report into the scale of the issue with pedophiles</a>. Hindenburg was an activist short-selling research firm that would investigate companies for fraud, malfeasance and indeed rampant use by predators, until <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/gratitude/">its creator chose to disband the group in January this year</a>. At the time of the report, Baszucki said that it was wrong to claim that&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> had reduced its spend on trust and safety, so Newton asked for specifics.</p> <p>“Fun,” says Baszucki, a man who appears pathologically incapable of reading the room. “Let’s keep going down this. And so, first off, Hindenburg is not longer in existence, correct? So, you should report on that. They went out of business for some reason…” He then demanded to know if Newton had researched the answer for himself, before saying that it’s because they’ve moved so much of the safety regulation onto AI, all while sounding absolutely furious that he was being asked. He then demands that Newton agree that if AI is more effective, it’s better to use it, and when Newton does, Baszucki starts to behave incredibly immaturely. “Good, so you’re aligning with what we did. High-five.” Then when Newton tries to ask a question, he interrupts to say, “Thank you for supporting our <em>Roblox</em> decision matrix<em>.”&nbsp;</em>Then interrupts yet again to say, “I’m so glad you guys are aligned with the way we run&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>. High-five.” Think he’s done? Nope. Yet again he interrupts the question with, “Is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we’re doing and you’re here to stealthily support it?”</p>

 <p>And he doesn’t stop. When co-host Kevin Roose tried to get things back on the rails, Baszucki kept going with the same pathetic line. Challenged on how AI has proved very ineffective for social media companies, he just carries on saying it. The only thing that stopped this tantrum was allowing the CEO to talk about Polymarket, a cryptoscam-based prediction market, letting people place bets on things as ridiculous as awards ceremonies and future weather patterns. Some believe it’s becoming a useful way to predict markets, and that group includes Baszucki who is…and I cannot believe I’m typing this…looking to put it into <em>Roblox</em> so children can gamble.</p> <p>He wants to find a way to do this that’s “legal” and “educational,” at which point the podcast hosts begin openly mocking the stupidity. And then, thank god, they run out of time.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="719">In recent years, handheld gaming PCs have become increasingly popular, with devices like the Steam Deck leading the charge. Following its success, models such as the Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally have also gained attention. These portable systems offer the ability to play PC games on the go without the bulk of a laptop. However, despite their appeal, handheld gaming PCs remain focused primarily on gaming, and lacking the versatility needed for everyday tasks. If you’re after a device that can handle both gaming and traditional computer tasks, a gaming laptop is still a better option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Right now, Amazon is offering a great deal on the Alienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop, dropping its price from $1,250 to $900, a savings of $350.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="719">Optimized for Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="721" data-end="1309">The Alienware 16 Aurora is a solid gaming laptop at this discounted price point. It features a 16-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, delivering QHD resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. Its 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare coating make it usable even in harsh lighting conditions, like if the sun is peaking through into the room midday. The screen’s refresh rate peaks at 120Hz, which is great for fast-paced or competitive games. Additionally, the laptop supports. The slim bezels around the display offer more screen space while keeping the overall laptop size manageable.</p>
<p data-start="1311" data-end="1573">As for the keyboard, the Alienware 16 Aurora comes with a full-size layout, including a number pad, which is becoming less common in modern laptops.</p>
<p data-start="1575" data-end="1963">Inside, the Alienware 16 Aurora is powered by an Intel Core 7 240H processor and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 laptop GPU, paired with 16GB of RAM and a 1TBGB PCIe Gen4 SSD. It has two upgradable PCIe Gen 4 SSD slots and two upgradable DDR SO-DIMM memory slots if you want to push the current memory and storage even further. While it might not run every AAA game on ultra settings, it’s a strong performer for the price. Indie titles will run effortlessly, and most larger games should perform well at medium settings, balancing quality and performance.</p>


<p data-start="1965" data-end="2197">Looking along the side of the laptop, we have an array of useful ports. It contains two USB-C ports capable of data transfer, device charging, and can be used to display onto an additional monitor. On that same note, an HDMI 2.1 port is found on the backside as well. There’s also two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports as well as a global headset jack so you can connect a microphone, headphones, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p data-start="2199" data-end="2434" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">At just $900, the Alienware 16 Aurora offers a solid mix of gaming performance and everyday usability. It provides more flexibility than a handheld gaming device, all while maintaining a price that’s hard to beat ahead of Black Friday weekend.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/"> If you want to push your graphical capability even further, a model is offered with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 for a $300 discount. T</a>hat one normally goes for for $1,400, but has come down to just $1,100 in this early Black Friday deal.</p>
