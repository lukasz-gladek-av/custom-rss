These phantoms last around one minute and there can be multiple phantoms on the field at once.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-unlock-revenant-fight-summon-1851782968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-unlock-revenant-fight-summon-1851782968">How To Unlock Revenant, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign’s Hidden Necromancer Class</em></a></span></p><p>This ability works on pretty much all of the smaller enemies and even some of the minor bosses. If you can raise multiple phantoms simultaneously, they can easily overwhelm enemies. The phantoms also serve as distractions for you and your teammates. Unfortunately, phantoms can’t follow you to other areas, so you’ll have to reanimate some new ones as you continue to defeat enemies in new areas.</p><h2 id="h1167240"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Summon Spirit</h2><p>Summon Spirit is Revenant’s Character Skill, which lets her call forth one of three family ghosts to fight alongside her. Helen the Page is a small but nimble sword fighter, Frederick the Pumpkin Head is a large and slow, yet more powerful beast, and Sebastian the Giant Skeleton is a humongous stationary monster.</p><figure id="" data-id="08666234e00a0af652da4a2d51a2ef3e" data-recommend-id="image://08666234e00a0af652da4a2d51a2ef3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large spirit stands next to Revenant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large spirit stands next to Revenant." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="08666234e00a0af652da4a2d51a2ef3e" data-recommend-id="image://08666234e00a0af652da4a2d51a2ef3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large spirit stands next to Revenant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Revenant can summon only one of these ghosts at a time </strong>(regardless of how many phantoms were reanimated through Necromancy) and they each have a separate HP bar. When called back, they gradually recover HP. Your ghostly buddies will work well against regular smaller encounters, but they struggle during boss fights with their limited damage output and relatively low health. At least they’re good as distractions.</p><h2 id="h1167241"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Immortal March</h2><p>Revenant’s Ultimate Art is called Immortal March, and it makes herself, her ghosts, and allies immortal for about 15 seconds within her range. To clarify, <strong>being “immortal” doesn’t mean that incoming damage will be negated. It just means that they will still retain 1 HP while under the effects of Immortal March even if they get hit with a deathblow that would have otherwise downed them.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="165ecd94943064e454bde3e8972d33eb" data-recommend-id="image://165ecd94943064e454bde3e8972d33eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Revenant uses her ultimate attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Revenant uses her ultimate attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="165ecd94943064e454bde3e8972d33eb" data-recommend-id="image://165ecd94943064e454bde3e8972d33eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Revenant uses her ultimate attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Immortal March also activates her ghost family’s ultimate attacks. Helen will attack with a sword combo, Frederick will spin around its hammer and hit enemies multiple times, and Sebastian will fire a giant beam at enemies.</p><p>Immortal March, however, is best used as a defensive maneuver. It will automatically revive any downed teammates nearby.</p><h2 id="h1167242"><a id="4"></a>A look at the Revenant attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: D</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: B</li></ul><p>Revenant is unique in that she doesn’t have any preferred weapons or equipment, but there are a few to look out for that could help. Greatshields can be helpful to block incoming enemy attacks and buy time for her phantoms and ghost friends to take care of them for her. You might also want to give her a crossbow so she at least has a weapon to fight back with.</p><p>You’ll most likely want to gather as many incantations as possible to cast spells. If you happen to come across any rare weapons like Sword of Night and Flame and the Dark Moon Greatsword, be sure to pick those up as her S rank in Faith scales well with them.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-magic-fp-residue-cocktail-1851783591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-magic-fp-residue-cocktail-1851783591"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>: A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Recluse</a></span></p><p>Unlike <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-magic-fp-residue-cocktail-1851783591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-magic-fp-residue-cocktail-1851783591">Recluse</a></span>, Revenant doesn’t have a way to recover FP on her own, so she relies heavily on consumables like Starlight Shards. Players should also prioritize equipping relics and choosing passive drops that will either boost the amount of runes dropped by enemies or decrease shop prices. That way, she can purchase as many Starlight Shards as possible.</p><hr><p><br><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company has recently announced, ahead of the start of the third season of the best of all those shows, <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, that it’s to get a fourth <em>and</em> a fifth season too! Woo! Although that fifth run will be truncated, and be its last. Boo!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197583" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ironheart's New Trailer Delivers A Couple Cool Surprises" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="197583,197582,197580" data-current="197583"><div><p>Ironheart's New Trailer Delivers A Couple Cool Surprises</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23104.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The experiments in the final frontier have had mixed results over the last decade. Beginning with the very promising <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> in 2017, the long-abandoned television franchise returned from a 12-year hiatus since the (merciful) demise of <em>Star Trek: Enterprise </em>in 2005—a period that had otherwise only been populated by J. J. Abrams aimless and soon-abandoned reboot movies. This was then followed in 2020 by <em>Picard</em>, quickly accompanied by animated comedy <em>Lower Decks</em>, kids animation <em>Prodigy</em> in 2021, and then in 2022 the beginning of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>.</p><p>Now, clearly making judgement on anything <em>Star Trek</em> is a surefire way to get a person in all manner of trouble, but who cares: <em>Discovery</em>’s five seasons offered diminishing returns, its fourth series reaching a nadir of utter dreadfulness that was only mildly improved upon in its fifth meandering final run. <em>Picard</em> was so excruciatingly bad as to have been ruled illegal under the Geneva Convention, although its third and final season—while still rubbish—delivered joyfully silly fan-service as it reunited as much of the <em>The Next Generation</em> crew as would agree to stagger onto set. <em>Lower Decks</em> was utterly brilliant for five glorious years and you should watch it immediately. No one, not even the people who wrote and drew it, watched <em>Prodigy</em>. And <em>Strange New Worlds</em> has made the entire roller coaster worthwhile.</p><p>The mistake both <em>Discovery</em> and <em>Picard</em> made was to believe <em>Star Trek</em> was ever supposed to be more than people in pastel colors exchanging sci-fi gobbledegook, blowing up a spaceship, and then learning a jolly nice lesson in time for the credits. Presumably attempts to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle moments from the earlier series, like “The Best of Both Worlds” or “In The Pale Moonlight,” they failed to understand these only worked <em>because</em> they stood out from the usual amiable chatter. Both series just felt morose, hopeless, and as such, distinctly un-Trek.</p><p><em>Strange New Worlds</em> (and <em>Lower Decks</em> for that matter) understands the brief. Set before the events of the original 1960s <em>Star Trek</em> TV show (well, in between the events of the pilot and the rest of the series, nerds), it span off from one of <em>Discovery</em>’s finer moments, as we see Captain Pike faced with a vision of a gruesome accident that would ruin his life. But, put that aside, because now we’re off to enjoy the voyages of the Starship Enterprise before Kirk gets into the captain’s chair, and it’s going to be so much fun.</p><figure id="" data-id="409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-recommend-id="image://409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-recommend-id="image://409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The previous two seasons of <em>Strange New Worlds </em>have brought us some of the best <em>Star Trek </em>ever. It’s bright, and positive, and features an incredibly capable crew driven to be a force of good in the galaxy. They are very much on a five-year mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no humans have gone before. And if that means getting trapped in a fairy tale, or a space creature causing the entire crew to communicate in musical numbers, then dammit they’ll do that so flipping well. And they’ll do it with impeccable haircuts.</p><p>As such, when things do get more serious, they’re mostly earned, and you know aren’t going to end in inescapable doom. (Although, let’s be fair, S02E10's “Hegemony” was an embarrassing miss in its attempt to suddenly turn into <em>Alien</em>.) So, it is with absolute delight that I greet the news that Paramount is letting it serve its full five-year mission.</p><p>It’s vanishingly rare for any TV series, let alone streaming ones, to get guaranteed episodes for a further two seasons in advance. It means that on top of season three’s 10 episodes, we’re promised another 10 for season four, followed by an abbreviated six-episode run for season five. And yes, admittedly, the 26 episodes this assures us of is the same number as a single-season order for <em>Trek</em> in the 90s, but times have changed, and honestly, I’m grateful we get <em>any</em>.</p><p>Also, while I’d love the idea of the show running for as long as the cast and writers are willing, it does make a lot of sense to give <em>SNW</em> a termination date. As much as the joy of things as daft as seeing cartoon characters from <em>Lower Decks</em> appear in this live-action show distracts us, the reality is we <em>are</em> heading toward Pike’s accident, determined not only by his earlier vision, but also by August 23, 1969's episode of <em>Star Trek</em>, when the disfigured post-accident Pike appeared, sealing his fate some 56 years ago. They can’t keep putting it off forever.</p><p>But, we’ve got a solid 20 episodes before we need to worry about any of that! And the trailer for the new season, which starts July 17, suggests it’s going to be fun times. Including Patton Oswalt as a Vulcan! And, thank goodness, it doesn’t look like Nurse Chapel is going anywhere.</p><p>It’s all on Paramount Plus, which can more conveniently be accessed through Amazon Prime, along with all the episodes of the other mentioned shows. But honestly, just watch this and <em>Lower Decks</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Marvel was ascending into superhero supremacy, but Warner Bros. had a goal to bring Batman back onto the big screen. After two good films, the then-up-and-coming director Christopher Nolan was chosen to helm Batman’s return to the movies. Along with David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan, these Batman films would take the influences of Michael Mann’s crime films and political thrillers to move the superhero into the post-9/11 world we were living in at the time.</p><p> Christian Bale portrayed this new version of Bruce Wayne, which showed his transformation into Batman from start to finish, including the classic characters he encounters during his missions to protect Gotham. It’s been twenty years since <em>Batman Begins’</em> broad gothic epic of an origin story ushered in a new era of gritty and grounded superhero movies. From that beginning to <em>The Dark Knight</em> ending with real-life-inspired class conflict cataclysm, these ten unforgettable characters had the most profound impact on Bruce Wayne, Batman, and Gotham City itself. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="04f447bf4e0629d27c993768007aa6b1" data-recommend-id="image://04f447bf4e0629d27c993768007aa6b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1598" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Prisoner looking disconcerted " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Prisoner looking disconcerted " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

But for the story and the audience’s reaction to seeing Tommy “Tiny” Lister’s huge, imposing presence on the screen as a handcuffed prisoner, he perfectly plays on our preconceived notions of a bad guy. It’s Deebo from <em>Friday</em>, man. In <em>Dark Knight’s</em> epic ferry scene, the Joker (Heath Ledger) rigs two separate ferries with explosives, one holding citizens and one holding prisoners, and places each ferry’s detonator on the opposite boat. He wanted to show Batman that the citizens of Gotham aren’t worth saving because they’d kill each other to save themselves.</p><p> No one saw that ingenious plan being shattered not by a good, upright, working citizen but by this criminal who took it upon himself to do what the police and the citizens on the boats couldn’t. He was the one who knew the only choice was to choose life over the false choice of “survival.” Batman’s speech to the Joker after the boats in Gotham Harbor fail to explode is due to someone who could be on the opposing side of the Dark Knight. Did Batman inspire this person to make this choice, or did even the lowest in Gotham have enough moral and ethical standards and community with everyone in Gotham to inspire Batman from falling to the Joker’s nihilistic outlook and continuing to protect the city? </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e55c46ad0443ecf638a97caf5c15d2fe" data-recommend-id="image://e55c46ad0443ecf638a97caf5c15d2fe" data-format="webp" data-width="1200" data-height="680" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Scarecrow flicking a lighter" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Scarecrow flicking a lighter" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Besides <em>Batman Begins</em>, each appearance was a surprise to the audience. Jonathan Crane exploits the many factions in the city to see people overcome with fear because he gets off on it. He even joins Bane’s (Tom Hardy) autocratic government judging the wealthy and the state in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. You see early on how Batman utilizes his own fears as a tool and engine for his crusade for justice and protection of the people. That head-on conflict with Scarecrow embodies this internal triumph, illustrating how it’s an ongoing battle for all of us to overcome our fears.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bfa247d380222c28ee06bc002a68da2" data-recommend-id="image://0bfa247d380222c28ee06bc002a68da2" data-format="webp" data-width="1405" data-height="695" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bane standing proudly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bane standing proudly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

His whole purpose in <em>The Dark Knight Rises </em>is to show Bruce that he’s washed, he doesn’t have it like he used to, and that he can’t just come back from retirement. Even Alfred’s (Michael Caine) plea for Bruce to not face him early in the film feels like Mickey pleading with Rocky not to fight Lang at a similar point in that film. Rocky jokes aside, Bane’s false class savior is an excellent foil for Bruce (and Gotham) to overcome in order to finally save the city from the mistakes he and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) made after the events of Joker’s (Health Ledger) reign of terror and Harvey Dent’s (Aaron Eckhart) fall from grace.</p><p>Bane is the manifestation of those lies coming home to roost, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests in real life; it plays with the idea of a rich billionaire taking it upon himself to decide the best for the city while others have less. Should Bruce have become a costumed adventurer? Was stopping that crusade the right path for everyone in Gotham? Hardy’s performance also sold the transition from the monster-heel luchador look of the comics to a captivating European populist terrorist, which has become iconic in its own right.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbdd215fa7378b598abe0173ef565753" data-recommend-id="image://fbdd215fa7378b598abe0173ef565753" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catwoman being sneaky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catwoman being sneaky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

This Selina, more inspired by Frank Miller’s retooling of <em>Batman: Year One</em>, has shed the mystical cat powers from Tim Burton’s film adaptation and evolved into a more grounded, lower-class Robin Hood-style figure from modern comics. Another character bringing class disparity and a different inspiration for Bruce to suit back up after retirement, Selina opens his eyes to the world in a much different way than his usual allies have.</p><p> Through her, he gains an actual voice from the poor and lower-class citizens of the city, as well as from individuals who commit crimes out of necessity due to a lack of options rather than grand plots or a desire to exploit the Gotham citizenry. She comes into his life and reignites his drive to help Gotham, which had been dormant since the loss of Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes and Maggie Gyllenhaal). Her perspective, much like Dawes’s, forces Bruce to come to terms with the fact that he’s not doing enough for the people of the city, even if he thinks his boogeyman persona is enough to let the police, politicians, and his fellow rich folks decide, at the cost of so many under them. There is, of course, attraction and the usual cat-and-mouse chase we want and expect from Batman and Catwoman, with Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale having the right chemistry to pull off this duo.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="67e910127767b71d1545b618faca5c29" data-recommend-id="image://67e910127767b71d1545b618faca5c29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two women looking " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two women looking " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

She’s a character who knows Bruce the best, outside of Alfred, and possesses the moral center and dedication to not only justice but also to Gotham. She’s an inspiration for Bruce’s journey, just as much as seeing those bats in the cave. Rachel is a person Bruce loves and trusts so much that he trusts her with his identity from the moment he creates it.</p><p> This love for Rachel is one thing that separates Nolan’s Batman from other interpretations; as much as he wants to protect the city and make it better, he also doesn’t want to be the Caped Crusader forever because he wishes to be with her and have a life beyond being the city’s protector. Her desire to also fight crime as a prosecutor, and her relationship with Dent, beautifully complicates the story of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. With Joker targeting both Rachel and Dent, it threatens Bruce’s hopes and, in turn, destroys his goals. His only choice is to sacrifice Batman’s reputation to save the city. She was his north star, and her loss caused our gritty hero to cease being Gotham’s savior.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d2ba3ef36ef3cb47fb8ea4651d65af32" data-recommend-id="image://d2ba3ef36ef3cb47fb8ea4651d65af32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucius Fox looking suspicious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucius Fox looking suspicious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

This version of Fox is much of a mentor-like character, someone who can call Bruce on his mess and also show him some things he might not know. As a man who knew Bruce’s father, he’s one of the three father figures in the orphan hero’s heroic journey to save an embodiment of the 21st-century American city. While not similar to the comics, having Lucius Fox work with Bruce to create the physical persona of Batman by utilizing unused Wayne Enterprises technology also gives the billionaire vigilante a James Bond-esque relationship. By the end, the student becomes the master as Bruce finally fixes something that Fox couldn’t, giving their mentor/mentee dynamic a fulfilling closing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7285224a3e7187bb021e2879bde66e0" data-recommend-id="image://f7285224a3e7187bb021e2879bde66e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harvey Dent speaking" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harvey Dent speaking" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

That was a campaign slogan that meant more than just running for District Attorney; it was the heart of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Harvey Dent is more of a damsel than Rachel Dawes. He loved her, and she loves him, but her goal is to protect him. She introduced him to Bruce because of her belief in what Dent could do for Gotham and its people. He fought corrupt police; he went after organized crime; he went out and inspired Gotham. Bruce thinks&nbsp;he can stop being Batman, and can pass the responsibility of looking after Gotham to someone like Dent.</p><p> Just as Bruce sees what he sees, Joker sees it as well and that little bit of darkness there. With just one bad day, Joker can destroy that hope, and he cunningly got just what he wanted – to make Harvey like him and not Batman. From that point, Dent’s submission to his darkest side puts the reluctant hero in a despair that he doesn’t escape until his back is broken by Bane halfway through <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. While Gotham survived, that hope it had at the beginning of <em>The Dark Knight</em> is gone, and so is eventually Bruce. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3cd5120fc0ccbfe080bfe5ac9cad56e5" data-recommend-id="image://3cd5120fc0ccbfe080bfe5ac9cad56e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Joker being devious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Joker being devious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

It is an interpretation that, when first seen in a picture, initially received negative feedback. But now, all that has essentially been erased from reality, as if no one had ever had a negative thing to say about it. Heath Ledger’s Joker reinterpreted this character for a new era in our culture, and this Joker, not much different than other versions at its core, was perfect for this Michael Mann crime film-inspired world of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. It was an interpretation that changed the way the Oscars work. This take on the Joker is one of the first times I recall a superhero movie where people argue that the Joker is right.</p><p> From his messy makeup to his dark jokes about his scars he uses to scare people, the Joker is something Bruce just doesn’t understand, even with constant advice from Alfred. The Joker’s terrorism in Gotham shakes everyone to their core, from citizens and the government to even the criminals, as he attacks the soul of Gotham to prove his nihilistic views of the world.</p><p> The Joker attacks what is in this film the heart of the city—Harvey Dent—and shatters Batman’s hope. Batman loses in this film; while the Joker is stopped, he ultimately achieves his goals in the end. It wasn’t Batman who proved the Joker wrong – it was a convict. Batman and Gordon had lied to everyone so that the city wouldn’t fall apart, and in the end, Batman had to become the villain to the public. It’s rare to see Batman lose, but with the Joker, it’s the only time it ever makes sense. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5681d8d6f465d6cc4f3970722d8b975a" data-recommend-id="image://5681d8d6f465d6cc4f3970722d8b975a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Commissioner Gordon looking sly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Commissioner Gordon looking sly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

He’s the only police officer Batman ever truly trusts. Gordon, at times, works almost like a point-of-view character for the audience as he navigates being an honest cop in a corrupt city, where he must deal with some of his own people he can’t trust. Yet he trusts Batman through each major event that befalls the city, from poisoned water to the Joker and then losing control of the city to a madman while being left for dead by the federal government. Yet it’s the trust that Bruce has in him, as the policeman who was there for him on the night his parents were murdered and helped keep alive that small flame of faith in the goodness of people and justice, that helps lead Bruce to become Batman. His loyalty to Batman remains even through the flawed plan of the Dent Act. The climax of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> makes their connection apparent to Gordon as he finally discovers who Batman is and just how his simple act of being there for a child helped save the city and many lives.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="175325980bd9bc474643c12539987017" data-recommend-id="image://175325980bd9bc474643c12539987017" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alfred looking concerned" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alfred looking concerned" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

First, having Michael Caine play the classic character completely changed how you viewed Alfred. He wasn’t the stereotypical image of the English butler with the tuxedo and the little mustache and bald head that brings Bruce soup and can also perform an oil change on the Batmobile. Changing his backstory to that of a former soldier changed how this character has been adapted ever since. Also, Caine is just cool, and he brings that coolness to Alfred as he advises Bruce on his new journey to protect Gotham through his own means. He has stories and experiences to call upon that inform each film. From the soldier who threw away jewels and wanted to see the world burn to his pitch-perfect read on Bane, he is there to tell Bruce the truth no matter what.</p><p> He reminds Bruce of his father’s lesson in the first film: “Why do we fall, Master Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.” He’s constantly there in many ways to remind Bruce and the audience of that lesson, as it’s not just for Bruce but for all of Gotham. Their falling out in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is literally heartbreaking, featuring some of the most emotionally resonant performances in the entire trilogy. With the end of the trilogy focused on Alfred seeing Bruce living out the future he wanted for him, Nolan’s Batman canon achieves an ending that no other version of Batman gets to have – happiness. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
