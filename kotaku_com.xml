              <p>If you’re a fan of LEGO sets featuring Harry Potter, Star Wars, and other pop culture icons, you probably already know they usually become collectibles rather than play sets. But when you must let your imagination run rampant and build anything you can imagine, nothing beats a big box of hundreds of colorful bricks.</p>
<p>With Prime Day coming in October, Amazon just dropped an unbeatable deal on a two-pack of huge LEGO Classic Creative Brick Boxes, which together total nearly 1,600 bricks: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4350/">The package is available for $78, reduced from the original $120</a>, which makes an all-time low on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4350/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Unleash Endless Building Possibilities</h2>
<p>This package has <strong>two large boxes with a total of 790 pieces in 33 different colors</strong>. That variety enables every builder of every age to construct anything ranging from simple toys like houses and scooters to more complex figures and castles. The bricks come with eight types of toy windows and doors to complete your constructions realistically, and six toy tires and wheel rims perfect for cars. These include two green baseplates of differing size-one about 6 inches square and the other, smaller-one-that serve as a stable base for imaginative play scenes.</p>
<p><strong>All the pieces are compatible with every other LEGO building set</strong> so this kit seamlessly fits into and expands your existing collection. Unlike theme-based sets that come with complex instructions and a single-minded focus, this creative brick box is all about open-ended play with no rules or limits. Kids can play with colors and shapes and refine their fine motor skills and spatial awareness in the process.</p>



<p>The packaging itself serves as a <strong>clever storage system</strong>, keeping tidy time simple at home or in the classroom. With <strong>nearly 30,000 reviews averaging 4.8 stars</strong>, customers appreciate the amount and quality of bricks, along with the creative freedom it provides for imaginative building sessions. This makes it a perfect gift option for girls and boys who love hands-on play.</p>
<p>With Prime Day discounts, this set provides you with <strong>double the bricks for close to half the price of one box</strong>. That kind of value is hard to find elsewhere, especially given the prolonged entertainment that you get out of this set. It turns playtime into a creative exercise that involves problem-solving and storytelling in a manner that is beyond a digital device.</p>

              <p>LEGO has just revealed its advent calendars for the 2025 holiday season. Every year, these calendars fly off shelves thanks to popular licenses like Star Wars, Harry Potter and Minecraft. But the runaway favorite, and once again for 2025, is the <strong>LEGO City Advent calendar</strong>. What’s catching everyone’s attention right now is that it’s the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/">only one available at a 30% discount on Amazon for its launch, priced at $25 instead of the usual $35</a>. However, this deal won’t last long—the closer we get to the advent season, the faster these discounts will disappear.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Advent Calendar</h2>
<p>This advent calendar offers a countdown to the holiday season <strong>with 24 sweet treats for kids aged 5 and above</strong>. Behind each door, little builders can find adorable mini-figures like <strong>Santa and Mrs. Claus</strong>, characters dressed in cozy outfits like polar bears and reindeer and numerous mini builds to spark imagination and holiday stories.</p>
<p>One of the cool features is the included Christmas party playmat that folds out to create a cozy winter ambiance for the mini-figures and buildings to be constructed. Each surprise has simple building instructions printed right within its window, created in special consideration for young LEGO fans.</p>



<p><strong>With 186 pieces in total</strong>, the LEGO City Advent calendar becomes a fun winter holiday party by the end of the month. Holiday accessories and mini builds encourage imaginative playtime – children can make up their own adventures or mix and match with other LEGO City series for endless fun after December. And it’s an exciting gift that girls and boys alike will enjoy, so it’s perfect for any building enthusiast child who loves holiday fun.</p>
<p>For $25, a 30% discount from the original $35 price, the LEGO City Advent calendar is an amazing deal. This is <strong>not usually done at launch on Amazon</strong> so it’s a fantastic opportunity to obtain this well-liked set ahead of time. Parents and gift buyers rave about this deal because it combines quality, fun and value without taking anything away</p>
