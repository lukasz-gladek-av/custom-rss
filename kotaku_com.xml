              <p><span>The Pokémon Company seems likely t</span><span>o reveal the upcoming Generation X games in February on the series’ 30th anniversary, but if leakers have anything to say about it, Game Freak might not have much new information to give us by the time that showcase arrives. On December 24, a series of new leaks about the games, allegedly titled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>, began spreading online. We’ve gotten a few waves (sorry) of information since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> in October, but now we know a little bit more about the games’ map, battle gimmick, and have even our first look at the new region’s professor.</span></p> <p><span>The latest info was posted on X early today by self-described <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2003786462651932797">Pokémon detective Moot Monthly</a>. All of these new images, animations, and illustrations are reportedly from this existing leak, so it’s entirely possible they aren’t indicative of the final games that will eventually ship on Switch 2. But they do give us some interesting insight into what Game Freak has been working on for the next mainline entries.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Christmas came early, heres ur pokemon gen 10 leaks </p> <p>&gt;Gen 10 map<br>&gt;Majin Pikachu<br>&gt;professor<br>&gt;gameplay</p> <p>Join gaiachads discord for a q&amp;a when i wake up link in bio <a href="https://t.co/QmIuuTqgTi">pic.twitter.com/QmIuuTqgTi</a></p> <p>— Moot /ムート (@Mootmonthly) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mootmonthly/status/2003786462651932797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>First, we have a new look at the beta versions of the male and female protagonists, and their previously reported Rotom scooter that they’ll ride around on. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>really popped off with its fashion, so hopefully we’ll be able to customize our characters’ fits in </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>.</span></p>

Apparently, the professor will ride around in a car and appear in multiple locations in the games’ archipelago setting. Right now, all we know is that he appears to be an older man with thick eyebrows and a beard.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: the new Professor (he drives around in a car!) and how the new Pokémon Centers will look <a href="https://t.co/erGuj76bUM">https://t.co/erGuj76bUM</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003838143943094555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Speaking of the archipelago, we also have a new illustration of the Gen X region. Its beta map shows several islands that the player will be able to explore. Early reports say they will be procedurally generated, so it’s unclear if the map is a sort of presumed “default” shape for these islands or if the terrain is what changes for each player, rather than the shape of the landmass.&nbsp;</span></p>

What we can see for now is that this phenomenon will seemingly distort a Pokémon’s physical shape and then create some kind of cloud to obscure them. Looking at what this shit does to Pikachu in the leaked animation, I’m not immediately onboard. But hey, it’s leaked in-development footage from a hack. We’ll see how it actually changes up battles when the games are eventually revealed.</span></p>

For now, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is keeping me busy, so I’m not starving for something new right now.</span></p>

              <p>It’s certainly true that&nbsp;<em>Strange Jigsaws</em> came out as long ago as August, and it’s also very much the case that the game has a blistering <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/">“Overwhelmingly Positive” rating on Steam</a> with a remarkable 99 percent of player reviews giving the game a thumbs-up. But somehow, this stunning follow-up to 2024’s lovely <em>20 Small Mazes</em> has not received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/strange-jigsaws/">a single published review</a>, and has gone forgotten in end-of-year lists. What a peculiar situation. Let’s address that a little bit by talking about why <i>Strange Jigsaws </i>is such a wonderful game, and how it’s a brilliant choice to play during your winter holidays.</p> <p>2024’s&nbsp;<em>20 Small Mazes</em> was a free game created by FLEB that was so much more than its title suggested. I mean, it&nbsp;<em>was</em> literally 20 small mazes, but it was also <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/02/20-small-mazes/">an extremely clever collection of puzzles</a>, each presented as if it were a simple maze but in actuality loaded with completely lovely ideas. It was bonkers that it was free, but perhaps it was something of a runway for <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>, a spiritual sequel that at first looks like it employs a similar conceit, but quickly reveals a whole new realm of intricacy.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655426">© FLEB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This time out, there are 50 “jigsaws” to solve, and I use quotes here because it’s so often more involved than that. As with <em>Mazes</em>, none is straightforward, each possessing a unique twist or original way of being solved. Even the main menu is part of its elaborate mystery of interconnecting elements that defy the laws of physics. Or rely on them, in one case.</p>

 <p>I love that it seems, on reflection, as if <em>20 Small Mazes</em> might have been part of this project, a deliberate effort to create expectations that&nbsp;<em>Strange Jigsaws</em> constantly defies. “Yeah, you thought this was another cute little bunch of novel ideas? Well, now figure out how this factory game spoof fits in to the creation of a lifeform you inadvertently engineered. Oh, here’s a puzzle that’s arrived from the future, locked behind a code and labelled ‘THE PAST.’ (It’s near the puzzle that’s on fire.) Once you’ve solved it, you can enter the infinite zoom!” Oh my goodness, I’m not sure gaming has offered anything else as clever as <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>‘&nbsp;infinite zoom this year.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655429" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655429"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655429">© FLEB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a masterful creation, and it’s rather mystifying why no one (including me!) reviewed it. It’s not too late, of course. And right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/">you can get it for yourself for just $4</a>! That’s madness. Do that, for goodness sakes. Then buy another one for a friend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>More on the<em> Clair Obscur</em> AI drama, a new Arc Raiders bug that’s the perfect excuse for dying, and the French <em>Final Fantasy 9</em> cartoon is still in the works. Welcome to a special Christmas Eve edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Why am I sitting here at my desk click-clacking away on my keyboard instead of watching my kids play <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>? Because of you, dear readers. The words written mean nothing without the people on the other end. From all of us here at <em>Kotaku</em>, we wish you a happy holiday and a restful winter break.</p> <h2>No AI in <em>Clair Obscur 2</em></h2> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="11 minutes, 54 seconds and how do you plan to use it in the future?&quot;&nbsp; Guillaume , yeah, we're aware of what's been going&nbsp;&nbsp;">Director Guillaume Broche was asked about the controversy surrounding the game and the tech in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MSRfVKC-Tc">a recent Q&amp;A with YouTuber Sushi</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-admits-sandfall-tried-ai-during-the-jrpgs-development-but-didnt-like-it-and-everything-in-the-game-is-human-made/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). “Yeah, we’re aware of what’s been going&nbsp; on with that, but I can say everything in the&nbsp; game is human-made,” he said. “When AI first really came out in 2022, we’d already started on the game. It was&nbsp; just a new tool.”</p> <p>He continued, “We tried it and we didn’t like it at all. It just felt wrong. We had originally&nbsp; used it as a placeholder for textures we missed, but we took it out as soon as we saw it. But&nbsp; yeah, the concept art, voice actors, everything is humanmade. It’s pretty hard to predict what&nbsp; the future of the industry will look like, but everything will be made by humans from us.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="11 minutes, 54 seconds and how do you plan to use it in the future?&quot;&nbsp; Guillaume , yeah, we're aware of what's been going&nbsp;&nbsp;"><em>Clair Obscur</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119">was recently stripped</a> of its Indie Game Awards wins over AI-generated textures that were in part of the game at launch but quickly removed. But the devil is in the details. Everything in a finished game being made by humans isn’t quite the same as saying no gen AI tools will be used <em>at some point</em> in the process, though it sounds like so far at least, Sandfall Interactive doesn’t think they’re worth the trouble moving forward.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> players are dealing with a bugged guns</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">There appears to be an ARC Raiders bug not allowing players to pull their gun out</p> <p>Happened to both Ninja and Nadeshot <a href="https://t.co/I5OHM5yUHr">pic.twitter.com/I5OHM5yUHr</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2003533565330677918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A clip making the rounds online shows Richard Tyler ‘Ninja’ Blevins explaining that he died in a fight because he wasn’t able to take out his gun. Other players in the comments have reported similar incidents where they’re unable to pull out a second firearm. It’s unclear how widespread the issue is but feel free to tell your friends this the next time you’re the first one down.</p>

 <h2>This might be the most painful way to try and pay <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-player-discovers-hornets-taunt-does-damage-proceeds-to-spend-hours-trying-to-beat-every-boss-with-it-this-is-like-watching-sisyphus-push-the-boulder-and-win/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a> that YouTube user <a href="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc">Bloblumordthe3rd</a> is trying to beat <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> using only taunts. It’s going about as slowly as you’d expect. According to them, Hornet’s&nbsp;<em>garama&nbsp;</em>does a total of six damage with the Hunter’s Crest on, or about as much damage as the starting attack. “This is like watching Sisyphus push the boulder and win,” wrote one commenter.</p>

 <h2>A big voice protests Evo over the Saudi deal</h2> <p>Fighting game commentator Stephen&nbsp;“Sajam” Lyon will not be <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">participating in Evo 2026</a>, he said on a recent stream (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/its-a-pretty-big-deal-for-me-as-a-human-one-of-the-fgcs-most-popular-commentators-is-stepping-away-from-future-evo-events-following-its-saudi-buyout/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “You know, I’ve been going to EVO since 2014 and I’m not going now because of the buyout,” he said. “And before you type anything, I’m like ‘Yeah man, if the US Army bought EVO I would also not go.'”</p>

 <p>He explained his thinking future. “Evil corporations purchasing or owning the things you like always sucks. But the difference, I think, for most people here is the purpose of the ownership and then what exactly they’re doing with it. It’s not just ‘The Saudi government owns EVO’, it’s like ‘The Saudi government owns EVO and lots of other things with the express intention of using these as a vehicle to promote tourism and sportwash.'”</p>

 <h2>A <em>Final Fantasy 9</em> remake is MIA but an animated adaptation is still in the works</h2> <p>French magazine <a href="https://ecran-total.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Écran Total</a> reports (via R<a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19263-final-fantasy-ix-animated-serieseemingly-back-in-production-at-new-french-studio-with-2028-release-target">PG Site</a>) that the <em>FF9</em> cartoon in production at now defunct Cyber Studios Group will continue on under Euro Visual. The show will be aimed at kids and have 13 episodes running about 22 minutes each. What does this mean for an eventual remake that’s been rumored forever? <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3mao657g7m22n">Probably nothing</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/james-bond-game-delayed-release-date-hitman-2000655417">The new James Bond game got delayed</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/vince-zampella-death-car-crash-tributes-reactions-2000655379">The video game industry pays tribute to Vince Zampella</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-shadow-generations-limited-run-games-edition-2000655411">Limited Run Games has pissed people off again</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Doom Is The Ultimate Holiday Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/doom-is-the-ultimate-holiday-game-1821585374</link>
            <guid>1391704</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>OK, hear me out.</p> <p>Christmas might be contained in its dread North Pole tomb until it bursts free next year and once again unleashes festive hell on earth, but we are still very much in the midst of the holiday season. This means that many of us, myself included, remain under our relatives’ roofs, or they’re under ours, possibly until the year is over.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on Dec 26, 2017.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>To pass the time, I’ve been playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-amazing-that-doom-can-even-run-on-the-switch-1820336390">2016’s <em>Doom </em>on the Switch</a>. I tend to lose myself in a game or two every holiday season, but never before has one clicked like this—let alone one that I’ve previously beaten on another platform. I’ve come to the inescapable conclusion that <em>Doom </em>is the ultimate holiday game. Let’s run down the reasons.</p>

 <h2>Blasting away my inner demons</h2> <p>This is the most obvious of the bunch. Returning home for the holidays is super relaxing until it’s super not. Family getting on your nerves? Kill some demons. Uncle wants to argue more about Colin Kaepernick? Kill some demons. Is your mind, bored and listless, probing the cracks and crevices that lead to the traumatic childhood origins of your neuroses? Definitely kill some demons.</p>

 <p>Even on the Switch’s tiny speakers, <em>Doom</em>’s audio makes it all so satisfying. Each meaty crunch is like an egg cracking open, your stress and anger oozing out. Oh, and then there’s the metal AF soundtrack, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/listening-heavy-metal-punk-extreme-music-makes-you-calmer-not-angrier-study">science says</a> will calm you down (probably).</p>

 <h2>Bridging the generation gap</h2> <p>The original <em>Doom </em>came out in 1993, when hardly anyone was alive and there were no <em>Spider-Man </em>movies, let alone reboots, yet. Your parents might have played it, or failing that, come to fear it after scaremongering convinced them it’d turn you into a Satanist who was <a href="https://kotaku.com/satanists-say-video-games-help-them-practice-their-reli-1819226570">too cool for them to handle</a>. In this way, 2016’s <em>Doom </em>can not only help you calm down after stressful interactions with your family, but also strengthen the bonds between you. “Look, mom and dad,” you might say, “I am, in fact, an extremely cool Satanist now, but this game is a lot like that one from 1993, and it can teach you to be an extremely cool Satanist, too. Also nostalgia or something.”</p>

 <h2>Chainsawing the clutter</h2> <p>When did the holidays get so complicated? Used to be, you’d open some presents, eat some food, and sleep until the football men disappeared from the television. Now there’s hours, even days, of preparation involved, not to mention countless Facebook events and social obligations to juggle.</p>

 <p><em>Doom </em>has a chainsaw.</p> <p>Close your eyes. Imagine it revving up and slicing right through all your troubles as your troubles’ feeble hands rise to block it, only to give way like blood-soaked wrapping paper. Inhale. Exhale. Smile. Did you know that this is how Santa obtained enlightenment and became king of Christmas? It’s true. Look it up.</p>

 <h2>Eating, but never becoming full</h2> <p><em>Doom </em>is a sumptuous dessert plate in video game form. Every interaction, whether it’s nailing a Hell Knight with a shotgun blast or just clambering onto a ledge, is rich with full-bodied flavor. And yet, it will never make you feel sick or gain weight. It’s the best part of the holidays, infinitely repeatable.</p> <h2>Decking the halls with boughs of holly (and demon guts)</h2> <p>Is there anything more Christmas-appropriate than punching demons, the spawn of Hell, so hard that they break in half and decorate the landscape and walls around them with festive arterial sprays? I mean, seriously.</p> <h2>Ringing in the new year</h2> <p>If <em>Die Hard</em> is a Christmas movie, <em>Doom </em>is a New Year’s odyssey. The subtext is so plain to see that it’s practically just regular text. There are fireworks all over the place, and everyone’s drunk—or I guess zombie demons, but that’s basically the same thing.</p>

 <p>More importantly, though, it’s a game about resolve. Doom Guy’s single-minded determination to break everything by kicking it to death no matter how much various jerks in his life protest is truly inspiring. You want a role model for your New Year’s resolution? Look no further. This year, I resolve to be more like Doom Guy in everything I do(om).</p>
