              <p>After 30+ years, longtime <a href="https://kotaku.com/florida-woman-mortal-kombat-legi0n-juicy-2000630181"><em>Mortal Kombat</em></a> audio director Dan Forden is no longer a part of the team working on the fighting series. The veteran game developer, famously known as the guy who pops up in the corner and yells “Toasty!” when uppercutting someone in a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> game, has left NetherRealm.</p> <p>On October 2, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/the-guy-who-says-toasty-in-mortal-kombat-has-left-netherrealm-after-more-than-30-years-with-the-team/">as spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a>, Forden <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPTnVKxE6Ch/">posted on Instagram</a> that Wednesday was his last day at the WB-owned studio behind the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> franchise. Previously, Forden had worked at Midway Chicago, the predecessor to NetherRealm and the studio that originally developed the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games. Forden has worked on every mainline entry in the franchise, starting with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1527016/">1992’s <em>Mortal Kombat</em> all the way up to 2023’s<em> Mortal Kombat 1</em>.</a></p>

  <p>He’s most famous for being the guy who popped up in the corner of the screen during fights in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em> and<a href="https://youtu.be/pRFMgHBNA5Y"> yelled “Toasty!” in a high-pitched voice</a>. This <a href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Toasty!">Easter egg</a> continued into nearly every subsequent game in the series, including some spin-offs and modern entries. Now, Toasty Dan, as he’s called online, has left behind the franchise he helped build over the last few decades.</p>

 <p>“Wednesday was my last day at NetherRealm,” posted Forden on Instagram. “We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff. There are so many smart, talented people there – look for more great things to emerge over the next several years.”</p>   <p>On Instagram, Forden shared a photo of what appears to be a bathroom inside the studio. And on the mirror inside the bathroom is a little sticker of him yelling his famous catchphrase as seen in <em>MKII</em>. Forden added that he “loved” these “little touches that people left around the studio.”</p> <p>“I wouldn’t have lasted 37 years in the industry if fans weren’t out there playing the games we made,” said Forden. “Thanks to all of you for supporting what we’ve done. Live long and…Toasty!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Two of director <a href="https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-best-movies-walton-goggins-kill-bill-1851759855">Quentin Tarantino’s</a> most popular and successful movies, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kill-bills-most-violent-scene-required-blood-wires-an-5936137#!"><em>Kill Bill Vol. 1 </em>and <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em></a>, are merging back into one large 4-hour movie as first envisioned. This longer, uncut version will arrive in theaters nationwide in December with 70mm and 35mm showings in some select locations.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-release-date-1236567983/">Lionsgate and Tarantino announced</a> plans to combine both volumes of <em>Kill Bill</em> into one large movie. Technically, the director behind <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and <em>Django Unchained</em> has shown a version of<em> Kill Bill Vol 1 </em>and <em>Vol 2</em> edited together at past events. But the <em>Whole Bloody Affair</em> will be the first time that general audiences around the country will get a chance to see the two action-packed revenge movies starring Uma Thurman like this.</p>

 <p>“I wrote and directed it as one movie — and I’m so glad to give the fans the chance to see it as one movie,” said Tarantino. “The best way to see <em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair&nbsp;</em>is at a movie theater in glorious 70mm or 35mm. Blood and guts on a big screen in all its glory!”</p>

  <p><em>The Whole Bloody Affair</em> arrives in theaters over 22 years after <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em> was first released in 2003. That gory martial arts movie told the first half of the tale of Thurman’s Bride, who seeks revenge after a group of assassins ambushes her wedding and tries to kill her. Originally, <em>Vol. 1</em> ended with a cliffhanger ending that was resolved in <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2,</em> released the following year in 2004. And that movie started with a recap of what happened in the first film. Both the recap and the cliffhanger have been removed from this version to create a more seamless one-film experience. This new version also includes a new seven-minute animated sequence.</p> <p>Tarantino’s <em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em> arrives in theaters on December 5. It has a runtime of around 4 hours and 18 minutes.</p>

              <p><span>Generative AI continues to plague every creative industry you care about, and despite the obvious copyright infringement and legal cases that surround it, companies like OpenAI keep training their models on licensed art. Sora, OpenAI’s video generation model, launched its updated “Sora 2” model on September 30. The app trains itself on copyrighted material by default, with the burden on </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a"><span>copyright holders to actively opt out of it</span></a><span>. As a result, there’s a lot of AI-generated slop leaking out onto the internet featuring huge characters you know and love.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I tested the AI model Sora 2 on classic anime, the result is hardly believable…</p> <p>I can already see the hundreds of fanmades and parodies that are going to come out! Sora 2 is definitely a new step in AI anime.. <a href="https://t.co/npWkSJjjML">pic.twitter.com/npWkSJjjML</a></p> <p>— Naegiko (@naegiko) <a href="https://twitter.com/naegiko/status/1973171308868542578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am not going to be posting a ton of these or anything but just to get extent of the capabilities and copyright violations of Sora 2, here’s Zagreus riding a scooter through hell (sound on) <a href="https://t.co/zCCNNppQ0k">pic.twitter.com/zCCNNppQ0k</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1973377707791552984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.404media.co/openais-sora-2-copyright-infringement-machine-features-nazi-spongebobs-and-criminal-pikachus/"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a> <span>has some videos of Pikachu and what appears to be a Nazi version of SpongeBob SquarePants doing everything from ASMR to boxing matches. By default, Sora 2 can generate animated videos of almost any copyrighted material you prompt it with because genAI companies seem to think the rules governing how copyright IP is typically handled don’t apply to them. So now, companies like Nickelodeon and Nintendo will have to hit OpenAI up to tell the company to stop using their characters and iconography, rather than the other way around. It’s a bold strategy considering that Disney, NBC, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wb-lawsuit-midjourney-ai-art-slop-batman-joker-disney-nbc-2000623232"><span>Warner Bros.</span></a><span> are all </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/midjourney-ai-disney-lawsuit-copyright-marvel-star-wars-1851784340"><span>suing Midjourney</span></a><span> for using characters from their IP. Artists who work on the </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>card game have also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-midjourney-ai-art-lawsuit-1851143250"><span>sued Midjourney for scraping their artwork to train the generative AI model</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Pokémon Company may </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>not be taking immediate action against the Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span> for using its characters in a video posted to social media, but I can’t imagine the litigious company is going to sit by while Pikachu’s image is used in AI slop that puts the mascot in a bad light. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company, Supergiant Games, and Toei Animation about their respective characters appearing in videos generated by the app.</span></p>

 <p><span>On top of the slop featuring copyrighted characters, Sora 2 seems to let people make deepfakes of </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/788786/openais-new-ai-sora-ios-social-video-app-will-let-you-deepfake-your-friends"><span>themselves or public figures</span></a><span>. The new app has a TikTok-like feed that lets you endlessly scroll through the generated videos, and if you scroll long enough, you might see deepfakes of real people, despite OpenAI claiming it has safeguards in place to protect people from this. Some have even reported seeing some wild shit, like a blackface version of actor Scarlett Johansson performing in the musical </span><i><span>Hamilton</span></i><span>. OpenAI notably got into </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her"><span>legal hot water</span></a><span> with the actor last year when the company was using a voice that sounded very similar to her performance as an AI in the movie </span><i><span>Her</span></i><span> for its own ChatGPT AI chatbot.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx/app.bsky.feed.post/3m23nnoegpc2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibal4konbfyadx3sib5opich4cmc6kg3eei7iyfgvtrjahahj3hru"> <p lang="en">I literally have seen someone posting on Twitter a version of Hamilton where Scarlett Johansson is in it. </p> <p>On top of this likely costing OpenAI a dollar a second to generate, they are potentially going to get sued into a fine paste by multiple different parties</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx?ref_src=embed">Ed Zitron (@edzitron.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx/post/3m23nnoegpc2w?ref_src=embed">2025-09-30T23:13:44.116Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>The entire thing seems like a series of legal battles in the making, but it also has some artists and animators disheartened as the possibility looms that animation companies may be increasingly inclined to use it to cut costs at the expense of a human touch.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Man, sometimes i feel like giving up as a real animator when I look at this.<br>AI animation is advancing way faster than I expected.

Even the more fluid, action-packed scenes Sora generates still have clear tells of AI generation, like unnatural shifts and glitches in the animation. But for any who hope to use this to cut costs, quality is probably not a priority. Bigwigs who insist that AI is the future only do so because they’re the ones who stand to benefit from it, while the artists who create and the people who enjoy their work get the short end of the stick. Maybe some of IP lawyers will step in and try to put a stop to it all, but it sometimes feels like every time one AI slop machine gets taken down, another one sprouts up in its place.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4%E2%80%98s-worst-vault-hunter-should-suck-way-less-now.1315192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new update for <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is available now on all platforms, and after installing it you’ll discover that all of the game’s playable vault hunters are now stronger. But one in particular, Amon, is much, much more powerful after the patch, which is great because many (myself included) considered him to be the worst and weakest of the bunch.</p> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> launched last month to mostly positive reviews and big numbers on Steam. I really like the game and its chaotic mix of looting and shooting, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">even if performance issues have been a problem</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">over the last few weeks</a>. But performance has <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">improved steadily with the last few patches,</a> and now Gearbox is targeting balance tweaks. But don’t worry, the studio isn’t nerfing anything yet. Instead, the latest patch for the open-world FPS is all about buffing the vault hunters. And Amon, a large space warrior, <a href="https://x.com/FervorGamingYT/status/1971346313968316591">got the most buffs following complaints that he wasn’t much fun to play</a> and didn’t feel as exciting during firefights as other characters.</p>

 <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">On October 2, Gearbox pushed out a new patch for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that is focused entirely on improving each of the game’s four vault hunters. After the update, Harlowe does more stasis slam damage, Rafa’s APOPHIS Lance skill is deadlier, and the Siren Vex got some buffs to make some of her builds more viable. But it’s Amon who got the most tweaks by far, with the new patch notes listing 60+ buffs. Yowza! And some of these are huge, with one buff to “Massive Forgewave Damage” being listed as a 100-percent increase!</p>

 <p>While it might seem drastic, Amon truly needed these buffs. I’ve now played as Rafa, Vex, and Amon in <em>Borderlands 4,</em> and by far the most boring and weakest was the big, tanky Amon. It often felt like I was tossing points into his skill tree without ever feeling the effects. Hopefully, these buffs help his kit feel more exciting and effective to use during combat encounters.</p> <p>Anyway, here are the full <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch notes as shared by Gearbox on Thursday:</p> <hr> <h2>Character Balance Adjustments:</h2> <h3>Harlowe</h3> <p><b>Action Skills – Zero-Point</b></p> <ul> <li>Stasis Slam Damage increased by 30%</li> <li>Stasis Immune Damage

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some things happen slowly and then all at once. So it appears to be with Xbox Game Pass. Once hailed as the “best deal in gaming,” it’s now best known as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059">the deal that just keeps getting worse</a>. A 50-percent price hike this week feels like a death knell, if not for Microsoft’s $5 billion annual subscription business, then at least for the perception that the company is trying to meaningfully compete by rewarding its long-time fans with something they can’t get anywhere else.</p> <p>It feels like the shift began way back in 2022. “We’ve held price on our console; we’ve held price on games and our subscription,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer said on stage at the <a href="https://techlive.wsj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Tech Live conference</a> that year. “I don’t think we’ll be able to do that forever. I do think at some point we’ll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was really important that we maintain the prices we have.”</p>

 <p>After years of Game Pass boosterism, he was also noticeably cool on the subscription service’s long-term growth prospects. “Game Pass as an overall part of our content and services revenue is probably 15 percent,” he announced at the time. “I don’t think it gets bigger than that. I think the overall revenue grows so 15 percent of a bigger number, but we don’t have this future where I think 50–70 percent of our revenue comes from subscriptions.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “We’re seeing incredible growth on PC…on console, I’ve seen growth slow down, mainly because at some point you’ve reached everybody on console that wants to subscribe.”</p> <h2>Game Pass now costs more than Netflix</h2> <p>Three years later, with over $70 billion in acquisitions weighing on Microsoft’s gaming division, we’re seeing what that calculus means for the math on the ground. Microsoft has doubled the price of Game Pass <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048">in the last two years</a>, in addition to tariff-fueled hikes on its consoles and briefly flirting with releasing its first $80 game this fall. Even as the company has touted Game Pass’ self-sustaining profitability, it’s also laid of hundreds of developers, closed studios, and canceled some of the biggest games it promised players at summer showcases past.</p>

 <p>To me, the most shocking part of Game Pass Ultimate’s jump to $30 a month wasn’t the price tag, even if it is more than every other mainstream content subscription service out there (you can currently get Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundled together for the same amount). It was how little Microsoft offered in return: <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, old <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, and <em>Fortnite</em> skins. These are the types of fine-print perks Verizon gives you for adding a new phone line, not the basis for a premium flagship subscription service.</p>

   <p>What the latest Game Pass overhaul is really about is extracting a premium from existing customers for day-one access to <em>Call of Duty</em>. Microsoft tested the waters last fall with a $3 a month price hike ahead of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and, just as importantly, the removal of day-one access from Game Pass’ middle tier. Microsoft is now promising that all of its first-party day-one Game Pass games will come to Standard, which remains $15 a month, within the first year<span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->except <em>Call of Duty</em>.</p>

 <p>That’s on console. The picture on PC is even more explicit. There, the service is going from $12 a month to $16.49 with no other changes. That’s almost a 40-percent increase in exchange for nothing except the ability to continue playing the new <em>Call of Duty</em> each year without paying for it. Microsoft apparently got tired of not being able to charge PC players for online multiplayer, which still costs $120 a year on Xbox.</p>

 <p>Microsoft hasn’t announced new Game Pass subscriber numbers in over a year, which strongly suggests that it hasn’t grown much beyond the 34 million number shared in early 2024. Having now hit the ceiling Spencer alluded to back in 2022 on PC as well as console, the company seems content to soak its remaining users for as much as it can. Instead of growing Game Pass revenue by growing the program, it will make the number go up by getting its highest rollers to spend even more time at the tables.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631109"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631109">Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In this regard it’s taking its cues from Sony. Part of what has made the PS5 generation the “<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-sony-borderlands-4-patch-performance-mgs4-2000629168">most successful ever</a>” is that the most dedicated PS5 players keep spending more and more. While PS5 sales are largely in line with the PS4 before it, fans are buying accessories and <em>Fortnite</em> skins, and staying subscribed to the most expensive version of PS Plus. With sky-high hardware prices and fewer exclusives than ever, Microsoft has clearly given up on growing its own share of the gamer pie. Instead it’s leveraging a massive publishing apparatus to try to squeeze its remaining users for even more cash.</p> <p>This makes it sound like there is cold, hard financial logic governing Microsoft’s strategy here. But while I concede the new Game Pass might look good in a spreadsheet, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">I have no idea who it’s actually for anymore</a>. At $360 a year you could buy <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> and still have almost enough left over to pay the Xbox online multiplayer tax. If you’re only in it for the service’s impressive parade of neat indie games, well, you could buy A LOT of indie games for that much. And if you are a daily <em>Fortnite</em> player, I mean, are you even playing anything else?</p>

 <h2>The ‘Play Anywhere” platform is pricing fans out</h2> <p>Perhaps this is just Microsoft’s way of teeing up a cheap, ad-supported tier sometime in 2026. Call it Game Pass Lite. “The big question going forward is if Game Pass can be a sustainable product off console and how best they can reach this audience,” Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973424993909211530">wrote on X</a>. “At the very least that’s going to require a lower entry cost (Essential) and experimentation with cloud only, ad supported, or mobile-first offerings.”</p> <p>In the meantime, the company seems content to price out large parts of its audience that stuck with it for years <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">waiting for Xbox to finally turn a corner</a>. This reflects a larger reality in the current market. The top 10 percent of income earners now account for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/top-10-of-earners-drive-a-growing-share-of-us-consumer-spending">nearly 50 percent</a> of consumer spending. “Everything is being priced for them while Xbox leaves everyone else behind,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m27xpbowkk2w">wrote</a> <em>Giant Bomb</em>‘s Jeff Grubb.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m27ychwabs27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreib3b42zpkv6eiuq4to3475pktxeidlkcfzhd4lzmbbb2zqcrk3qcu"> <p lang="en">Been talking about this trend for years when it comes to games spending. Why are there premium gamepads, $149 collector's editions, Pro consoles and general rising prices? Because the price-insensitive, affluent players are the ones doing more of the spending as everyone else shifts more to f2p.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m27ychwabs27?ref_src=embed">2025-10-02T16:34:58.378Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Motley Fool <a href="https://www.fool.com/money/research/video-game-spending-statistics/">recently teased this out</a> using Bureau of Labor statistics. “The top 20 percent of earners spent $1,722 on ‘other entertainment,’ including video games, in 2023, according to BLS,” it reported last month. “The next lowest income quintile spent $657 and the lowest income segment spent just $125 over the course of the entire year. The average spend on ‘other entertainment’ across all income levels was $653.” We don’t how those spending averages breakdown exclusively for games, but it suggests a similar picture: fewer people are accounting for a larger share of total spending on games, at least in the U.S.</p> <p>Others are seemingly rushing to ditch their Game Pass subscriptions before they auto-renew at the higher price. Microsoft’s webpage for subscriptions was <a href="https://twitter.com/_sunday_rain_/status/1973396317838684668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973396317838684668%7Ctwgr%5Edf010dc9c39e8cf74d700fae117ede4d9f27065d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fxbox-game-pass-price-increase-cancel-subscription-page-crash%2F">briefly overloaded</a> after the announcement yesterday, <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973756477098872841">and searches</a> for how to cancel peaked. The whole episode might leave a less unpleasant taste in people’s mouths if it seemed like it was all in service <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-arkane-tango-gameworks-closure-1851464470">of some larger ambition</a>. Instead, it feels like Microsoft is setting a house it spent decades building ablaze and telling everyone inside to strip the copper wiring out of the walls before they leave.</p>
