Japanese </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> creator churip_ccc announced on X that their adults-only </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> island had been shut down by Nintendo, </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/"><span>according to a translation of the post on </span><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Actually, just a day before the update, the Dream Address for the Adult Island was deleted by Nintendo,” chrip_ccc wrote. “To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

There’s a pachinko parlor and a luxury, uh, love suite with a rose-shaped bed, in-house jacuzzi, and dim lighting.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> players were able to visit the island using the Dream Island feature, which essentially made a public copy of an island.
