The esports pro was banned for inappropriate behavior during the livestreamed event and subsequently dropped from his team, Cloud9. “I’m sorry everyone,” he wrote afterwards. “Wish I was better.

People got more inebriated as the tournament progressed, with Marquez in particular eventually ditching his Wario costume and walking around shirtless.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1936735705905909912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1936735705905909912%7Ctwgr%5Ee6199bbf3867ad16a635891e580ec302a3687341%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1936735705905909912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1936735705905909912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1936735705905909912%7Ctwgr%5Ee6199bbf3867ad16a635891e580ec302a3687341%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1936735705905909912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A clip from the livestream</a></span> at one point showed him appearing to drunkenly dry-hump behind Twitch streamer Maya Higa who was sitting next to Emily “ExtraEmily” Zhang while they talked to the livestream camera. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SICunchained/status/1936793274196410781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SICunchained/status/1936793274196410781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple other clips</a></span> show him seemingly continue to act inappropriately toward the pair at other points during the event. The livestream shows various people calling out Mang0's behavior during the <em>Mario Kart </em>tournament, though it’s not clear that any of the organizers intervened at the time. </p><p>“I reached out to anyone who I thought might have felt uncomfortable and talked to them but also, and I already told Mang0 this, no longer inviting Mang0 to Mogul Moves events,” Ludwig said in a June 22 livestream, referencing his company that organized the tournament. “It’s a privilege to go to an event, the whole point of an event is it’s a fun thing to do, to have a good ass time and if somebody appearing jeopardizes somebody else having a good time that just can’t be a thing.”</p><p>On June 23, Marquez acknowledged the incident and said he had a problem with alcohol. “Sorry to everyone I’ve let down or hurt,” he wrote on X. “I know it just looks like I’m trying to save face but I genuinely feel so awful about it.. all I’ve done is reflect on my life and realized I’m a broken human   I will try and redeem myself over time as I always do  Gonna stop drinking immediately and get it together.”</p><p>Later that day, however, Cloud9, the team which Marquez has been representing in <em>Smash Bros.</em> tournaments for over a decade, announced it was parting ways with the esports player. “Following an internal evaluation, we have made the decision to release mang0 from Cloud9,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cloud9/status/1937299762119868534&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cloud9/status/1937299762119868534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a statement</a></span>. “Regardless of tenure or accomplishments, the behavior demonstrated is entirely unacceptable and directly conflicts with our organization’s core values. We maintain a zero-tolerance stance regarding harassment or any other form of inappropriate conduct.”</p><p>It’s unclear how the Beerio Kart World Cup incident will impact Marquez’s involvement in the <em>Smash Bros.</em> competitive scene moving forward. One of the next big events, Supernova 2025, takes place in August. Currently ranked third among all <em>Melee</em> players, Marquez suggested he might be taking a break. “C9 dropping me.

They can stick the camera <em>really </em>close to his face, too.

His flesh looks less plastic-y and his eyes look more natural. Even his eyebags look more fleshy and real. The old Sam, in comparison, looks like a Halloween mask. </p><p>Here’s a great video comparing the two games via Nick930: </p><p>“Norman Reedus 720p vs Norman Reedus 4k,” joked one Reddit user. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lihzuw/comparison_goes_crazy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lihzuw/comparison_goes_crazy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another replied to an image comparison of the two</a></span> with: “My guy was legit sick in DS1, made some connections and powered up like Mario in <em>DS2.</em>” </p><p>My favorite theory as to why Sam Porter Bridges looks so much better and healthier in <em>Death Stranding 2</em> comes from Reddit user gpost86: “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lihzuw/comment/mzcsv0d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lihzuw/comment/mzcsv0d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First one was chugging Monster.</a></span>” Honestly, that makes sense.
