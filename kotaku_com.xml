              <p>As we find ourselves at the beginning of the new year, it’s a natural time to think about fitness goals—whether that’s running your first 5K, sticking to a consistent workout routine, or training for your first marathon. The challenge, of course, is motivation. While the days stay short and temperatures low, even the best intentions can be hard to follow through with. One of the most effective ways to stay on track is to make your workouts something you genuinely look forward to. For me, that’s turning my runs into dedicated podcast time—and the right gear makes all the difference.</p>
<p>I’ve been working my way through the third campaign of <em>Not Another D&amp;D Podcast</em>, and four days a week I’m out running, listening, and actually excited to lace up. My go-to headphones for this routine are the OpenRun Pro from Shokz. If you’re looking to upgrade your workout setup for 2026, now’s a great time:<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/"> they’re currently 39% off on Amazon, dropping from $180 down to just $110</a>.</p>

<h2>Bone Conduction Listening</h2>
<p>What sets the OpenRun Pro apart is their bone conduction design. Unlike traditional earbuds, these don’t go in your ears. Instead, they sit just in front of them and transmit sound by vibrating through your cheekbones. You still perceive clear audio, but your ears remain completely open. Elder millennials might remember those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ca4tfXefk">novelty lollipops from the ’90s</a> that played music through your teeth. This is a far more refined version of that idea.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of bone conduction is safety. Because your ears aren’t blocked, you can hear what’s happening around you. When you’re running outdoors, especially near traffic, being aware of approaching cars or cyclists is crucial. The OpenRun Pro lets you stay entertained without tuning out the world fully.</p>



<p>Comfort is another standout feature. The headphones sit around your ears like a backwards pair of sunglasses and use a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame. They stay firmly in place even during high-intensity workouts, which eliminates the constant worry of an earbud slipping out mid-run. Personally, I find them far more reliable than in-ear options.</p>
<p>Battery life is dependable, offering up to 10 hours of listening on a single charge. There’s also a fast-charge feature that gives you about 1.5 hours of playback from just five minutes plugged in—perfect for those times you forget to charge them overnight.</p>
<p>Shokz also offers a mini version for smaller heads. The standard model measures 20.7 cm across, while the mini is about 21 mm shorter at 18.6 cm. Both versions are currently discounted, with color options including black, beige, and blue.</p>
<p>If one of your 2026 goals is to stay consistent, safe, and motivated with your workouts, the Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones are a smart investment to help you get there.</p>
