            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When I first heard about EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to implement an <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700">open weapon system in the upcoming<em> Battlefield 6</em></a>, I scoffed! And playing the game in Los Angeles for an event last month didn’t sell me on it, either; I still worried it would make classes feel less unique. Now, after playing the open beta for nearly 20 hours, I’m here to say: I was wrong.</p> <p>Let’s back up for a moment and explain, briefly, open and closed weapon class systems in<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"> <em>Battlefield</em>.</a> (I promise this won’t be too boring.) Basically, for nearly as long as the franchise has been around, classes were locked to certain weapons. Recon, for example, had to use a sniper rifle. Over time, developers at Dice tweaked this and added “neutral” weapons that could be picked by multiple classes, or they spread specific types of weapons across a few classes. <em>Battlefield 2042</em> threw a lot of this out the window when it launched without classes and let players essentially build custom heroes who could use any gadget or gun. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/dev-notes-classes-in-battlefield-2042">It then added classes back in when people got angry</a>. Anyway, <em>Battlefield 6</em> is trying to find a happy balance between <em>2042</em>‘s total, unbalanced openness and the classic closed weapon system of the past games. And I think, despite being nervous about the change and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/open-vs-closed-weapons/12440854?after=MjUuNHwyLjF8aXwxMHwzOToxfGludCwxMjQ0MTg0MSwxMjQ1OTQ5MQ">all the debate raging online among players on both sides</a>, Battlefield Studios has mostly nailed it.</p> <p>In <em>Battlefield 6,</em> any class can use any weapon. So you can spawn in as a recon soldier, but instead of a sniper rifle, you could bring an SMG. Engineers, traditionally a class that uses SMGs, can rock snipers and LMGs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384#:~:text=This%20is%20extremely,Lots%20of%20destruction">At first, this seemed like a bad idea to me</a>. I worried that players would just pick the class with the best abilities and pick the best assault rifle, and you’d lose all the uniqueness that comes from <em>BF’s</em> old-school class system. And in some smaller, more combat-focused modes, this is indeed the case. But in bigger, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">more <em>Battlefield</em>-y modes, like Conquest and Rush</a>, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how things have worked out.</p>

 <p>In my hours with the beta, I found that in many matches players were spread all around the four classes. In some past games (looking at you, <em>Battlefield 3</em>),&nbsp;people would pick whatever class had the best assault rifle, and that was that. During a Q&amp;A with the devs last month in LA, they talked about this and said that the open weapon system was partly designed to combat this. The idea is that now people will pick classes based on what the team needs and their unique abilities and tools, rather than the weapons they can and can’t use.</p> <p>And yeah, that’s exactly what I saw happening in many <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em></a> open beta matches. If the enemy team, for example, brought in a bunch of vehicles or tanks, I’d see players swap to engineers to use that class’s RPG to take all those machines out. Likewise, I saw players and friends swap to the support class to help hold a point and revive people, or swap to recon to help pin down a target. It seems now that weapons can be freely equipped on any class, people are far more open to playing different classes and helping out the team. Sure, maybe some of these players have just equipped the same assault rifle on all of the classes, but if it helps my team stop a tank from destroying us, I’m fine with it. That’s a much better scenario than in past <em>BF</em> games, where a whole team might be assault soldiers and you’d be unable to get ammo resupplies or fight back against helis.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> also rewards players for choosing a weapon that is more aligned with their class. Recon soldiers get a ton of exclusive sniper perks that make it almost silly to use a sniper rifle on any other class. But you can do it, if that makes you happy. And this is where I’d suggest some tweaks.</p>

 <p>I think rewarding players who pick class-specific weapons is a smart idea, but I almost feel like the devs could do more to make sure picking an assault rifle on every class isn’t an easy option. Perhaps class-specific weapon punishments could work? An assault class soldier picking a sniper rifle might mean they don’t get the recon benefits, and perhaps they also reload the big rifles more slowly. Or an engineer picking an assault rifle has more kick and can’t carry as much ammo for it. These tweaks would reward people playing classes more traditionally, could be overcome with skill or teamwork, and would still allow for the weapon freedom the devs want in <em>BF6</em>.</p> <p>But even if <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs don’t steal my totally-awesome-and-perfect idea, I think the open weapon system is a good change. It lets players enjoy all the classes without forcing them to play with specific guns. This leads to matches in which all the classes are used, and that leads to more enjoyable <em>Battlefield</em> action. And that’s what I’m looking for. Sure, maybe it means that I’ll be killed a lot by a few popular assault rifles, but it might also mean that there will be more medics running around who can heal me. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">That would be nice</a>. And don’t worry; if you hate the open weapon system, EA is going to offer playlists and modes that feature locked weapons, too. Everyone wins.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>We are still firmly in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-popcorn-bucket-barbie-ghostbusters-best-worst-1851336690#content">“Gimmick Popcorn Bucket Era” of movie theaters</a>, and it shows no signs of stopping. Usually, these gimmicky popcorn buckets are items that fans want to buy and collect. But it seems like not many people want the creepy bucket for <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites</em>, featuring iconic haunted doll Annabelle. I wonder why.</p> <p>On August 18, Regal Cinema shared a photo of its popcorn bucket for the upcoming horror film, <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites,</em> the ninth (?!) film in the wildly popular <em>Conjuring</em> series. The movie is being marketed as a sort of ending for this era of the spooky franchise, though it sounds like more <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-best-horror-movies-1851282873/5"><em>Conjuring</em> universe</a> movies will happen in the future. Anyway, <a href="https://youtu.be/FSAz556s0fM">as seen in <em>Last Rites’</em> new trailer</a>, the franchise’s famous haunted doll, Annabelle, is returning for the <em>Conjuring’s</em> finale. And to celebrate, Regal’s new popcorn bucket features the doll herself, connected to a faux-wooden bucket with the movie’s logo slapped on it. The bucket will be available to order on Wednesday, over two weeks before the movie’s release.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">She's been released once more… Annabelle popcorn buckets coming to Regal this Wednesday.🍿 <a href="https://t.co/9cPobQ1Nkt">pic.twitter.com/9cPobQ1Nkt</a></p> <p>— Regal (@RegalMovies) <a href="https://twitter.com/RegalMovies/status/1957476386852979164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In the <em>Conjuring</em> universe, where she has three of her own spin-off movies as well as appearances in the main series, Annabelle is portrayed as scary, dangerous, evil, and just generally not a good doll you want to take home. I wasn’t surprised, then, that a lot of fans online don’t want this cursed piece of plastic in their homes.</p>

 <p>“Oh hell no lol,” said one user. “Um, that’s one bucket I don’t want,” said another person. Someone else replied: “Y’all can keep that one.”</p> <p>“Am I supposed to take this home?” asked someone in a reply to <em>DiscussingFilm</em>‘s tweet about the doll bucket. A diffferent user replied to the same tweet with: “<span>Nah nah nah nah you’re not gonna get me Annabelle, nice try.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haunt your popcorn with our <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheConjuring?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheConjuring</a>: Last Rites Annabelle popcorn bucket available starting August 22! <a href="https://t.co/UiYfek3Nft">pic.twitter.com/UiYfek3Nft</a></p> <p>— Cinemark Theatres (@Cinemark) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cinemark/status/1957534818465726527?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Meanwhile, on Monday, Cinemark shared a first look at its own <em>Conjuring 4</em> popcorn bucket and uh, well, reactions were different. That’s mainly because Cinemark’s gimmick bucket featuring Annabelle makes you eat the popcorn out of her ass. Would Tom Cruise eat popcorn out of Annabelle’s ass? Probably, the dude loves popcorn. But others aren’t as interested. This bucket will be available on Friday, August 22.</p> <p><em>The Conjuring: Last Rites,</em> alongside all the fake Annabelle popcorn buckets you desire (or fear), arrives in theaters on September 5.</p>

              <p>Everyone is waiting for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to come out. It’s the most wishlisted game on Steam. You can’t watch <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-switch-2-screenshots-date-1851775219">a new gaming showcase these days</a> without the chat being flooded with stuff like “Show<em> Silksong</em>? Where is <em>Silksong</em>? <em>Silksong</em> when?” Due out before the end of 2025, time is running out for a release date announcement or even a same-day shadow-drop. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-2024-e3-microsoft-gaming-show-1851638178">With Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live</a> just around the corner, could this finally be the moment of truth? Host Geoff Keighley is certainly acting like it.</p> <p>Gaming’s veteran hype man has been sharing images of Gamescom ONL prep, including one of him in front of a mirror wearing a clown nose. It’s a clear wink to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup"><em>Silksong</em> fanart clown makeup meme</a> about perpetual disappointment. The trend started years ago when developer Team Cherry was MIA, but hit a new fever pitch after Xbox claimed <em>Silksong</em> would arrive in 2022, only for it to never come out. Many gaming showcases have come and gone since, with the Metroidvanaia Soulslike only ever appearing briefly as part of a sizzle reel here and there.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First time? 🤡 </p> <p>See you tomorrow for <a href="https://twitter.com/gamescom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gamescom</a> ONL. <a href="https://t.co/59ef5sFysJ">pic.twitter.com/59ef5sFysJ</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Keighley is either tipping his hand that big <em>Silksong</em> news is just around the corner or paving the way for the biggest collective letdown ever. Since the game will be playable at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1mjunk6/silksong_confirmed_to_be_playable_at_the_nintendo/">multiple booths</a> on the Gamescom show floor, my money’s on the former. It’s coming to Switch but has also been promised to be available day-one on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld, rumored to release in October. Plus, the soundtrack was j<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1mtoufc/silksongs_ost_has_been_added_to_gog_though/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1">ust added to the backend of GOG</a>.</p>

  <p>Keighley’s showcase will take place on August 19, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. ET. It will run approximately two hours with a pre-show that starts at 1:30 p.m. ET. You can stream it live on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVC_dBNUZGc">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oh7zD_jxI">Twitch</a>. The event tends to have new game announcements sprinkled in with trailers and updates on already revealed games coming out in the next few months, plus occasionally brief intros from the developers themselves. This year’s Gamescom ONL will also include a live orchestra performance of music from surprise hit <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and the first footage <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233">of <em>Fallout</em> season 2</a>.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVC_dBNUZGc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>What games will be shown at Gamescom ONL?</h2> <p>Beyond the tease for <em>Silksong</em>, Keighley has already confirmed the following nine games will also make an appearance:</p> <ul data-cy="list"> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></li> <li><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em></li> <li><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight</em></li> <li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></li> <li><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em></li> </ul> <p><em>Black Ops 7</em> is expected to reveal the first footage from its updated multiplayer, while<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-ps5-exclusivity-date-sale-1851783817"><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> is headed to Xbox this week and could potentially be showing off its long-rumored DLC expansion. With no BlizzCon this year, Microsoft will also be using ONL to debut the next <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion, though a much bigger deal would be if it ever gets a much-requested console port. And what about <em>Diablo 4</em>‘s recently leaked Paladin subclass, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1mq4i45/the_d4_vendor_builds_were_updated_and_it_looks/">rumored</a> to be part of its next expansion? <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is Microsoft’s other big fall release, but with few updates on its biggest in-development games at its Xbox showcase in June, there are plenty of other big releases that could make surprise appearances at ONL.</p> <p>We haven’t heard much from Ubisoft this year either. Amid big delays and internal restructurings, the French publisher declined to hold its usual Summer Game Fest-adjacent June showcase. With the next <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and<em> Splinter Cell</em> remakes all in development, any one of them could get a tease at Gamescom. The developers behind <em>The Division 2</em> have already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1mtq98p/the_division_2s_gamescom_schedule_this_week/">teased</a> news on the ongoing loot shooter’s big winter update. Who knows, maybe Gamescom 2025 is when <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> will finally resurface</a>!</p>
