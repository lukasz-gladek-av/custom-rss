But this needs to be made right.<em> Subnautica </em>has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds was sold to Krafton in 2022 for roughly $500 million. If the studio hit revenue targets this year, the founders were on track to get an additional $250 million payout, with a percentage of that going to the rank-and-file developers on the studio floor. But delaying<em> Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access launch to 2026 makes hitting that goal basically impossible. Krafton says it didn’t fire them to avoid the payout, but because the founders failed to deliver a launch-quality version of <em>Subnautica 2</em> as promised. Cleveland, who directed the first game, has for his part clamed the game was ready. </p><p>There are now also alleged leaks of an internal May 2025 milestone review <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating around online</a></span> that paint a messy picture of the game’s development timeline. It includes an assessment that <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access version was too content-light to “drive IP growth and expansion” and calls for 30 percent more content, including additional biomes, creatures, and narrative chapters. If accurate, it would lend credence to Krafton’s recent claims, though for now the alleged leak remains unsubstantiated. </p><p>This would hardly be the first time that studio founders got into a messy and drawn-out fight with their parent publisher over debates about scope, timelines, and bonus payouts. The most notorious version of that was Infinity Ward leaders Vince Zampella and Jason West’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinity-ward-founders-suing-activision-over-unpaid-roy-452579213?_gl=1*2f6910*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyNDA5NjQkbzkkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinity-ward-founders-suing-activision-over-unpaid-roy-452579213?_gl=1*2f6910*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyNDA5NjQkbzkkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw">high-profile 2010 lawsuit against Activision over <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare </em>royalties</a></span>. The litigation went on for two years before it was settled, filled with tons of wild revelations about everything from corporate espionage to Activision’s then-unannounced plans for the first <em>Destiny</em>. </p><p>We’ll see how long this lawsuit lasts and what it eventually reveals. Hopefully, Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 employees are able to still ship a good game and get what they’re owed in the process. “As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue,” Cleveland wrote in his latest update. “I’m in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well. They deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101]]></content:encoded>

Props to the studio for acknowledging the game’s popularity and trying to curb some of this kind of behavior. The full list of guidelines is as follows:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center to discover if visits are possible.</li><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center for details on the times of visits.</li><li>Follow the instructions provided by the staff working at the stables.</li><li>Do not enter stable buildings or grazing land without permission.</li><li>Do not shout or make loud noises.</li><li>Never touch the horses.

And now we have <em>Red Sonja</em>? It was weird enough in 2012 when the never-climactic Len Wiseman (<em>Underworld</em>, <em>Ballerina</em>) thought it a good idea to try to remake perfect cinematic classic <em>Total Recall</em>, with a stunningly miscast Colin Farrell playing Douglas Quaaaaaiiiiid.</p><figure id="" data-id="6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-recommend-id="image://6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Millennium Films / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-recommend-id="image://6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike <em>The Running Man</em>, which has a big-name director and main star, <em>Red Sonja</em>’s 2025 revision is perhaps a little more low-key. It’s directed by M. J. Bassett, who has a healthy credit sheet when it comes to directing solid television shows (including four episodes of the wonderful <em>Ash Vs Evil Dead</em>), but she perhaps has a slightly less impressive record on the big screen. Remember 2020's Megan Fox vehicle <em>Rogue</em>? No? How about 2021's <em>Endangered Species</em>, starring Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O’Connell? That slipped by you too? But even critics didn’t see those films, so what about a movie that did get reviewed? 2012's <em>Silent Hill: Revelation 3D</em>? That had Malcolm McDowell, Sean Bean, Carrie-Anne Moss and Kit Harrington! And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-hill-revelation-3d/critic-reviews/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-hill-revelation-3d/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Metascore of 16</a></span>. Ouch.</p><p>It’s not exactly an all-star cast, either. Sonja herself is played by Matilda Lutz (<em>Rings</em>, <em>Magpie</em>), and the only other names I recognize are Trevor Eve and Rhona Mitra, and that’s because I’m British. Meanwhile, Arnie’s character from Richard Fleischer’s 1985 movie, Kalidor, doesn’t appear to be in the film at all!</p><p>You know what, that’s probably a good thing. As hilariously dreadful as Arnie was in absolutely everything, seeing someone else trying to reprise one of his roles is always so awkward. It was very much his scenery-chewing, bicep-popping, terrible-acting ways that made him so completely charming, and everyone else just seems like a cardboard cutout when stood in his shoes. And, rather crucially, a film about Red Sonja really ought to have been about Red Sonja, but even as early as then, Arnie’s star power made him the focus throughout. Things look very different this time out.</p><p>And yes, sure, it looks like absolute gibberish, but I’m totally here for it. There is perhaps rather a lot of “BUT SHE’S DOING IT EVEN THOUGH SHE’S A GIRL!” energy throughout the trailer, but that’s still better than Brigitte Nielsen fighting to ever actually appear on screen as the main character. </p><p>The source material was written by Robert E. Howard, he of <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> fame, and while he was a giant old racist, he was also an advocate of presenting powerful female characters. That leaves me hopeful that under M. J. Bassett’s helm, we can at least see Sonja be a more significant brute.</p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that Fleischer’s version was absolutely bloody awful! He may have given us <em>Soylent Green</em> (1973) and <em>Fantastic Voyage</em> (1966), but they couldn’t all be bangers. It was deservedly mauled on release, with Gene Siskel handing it a single star in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. But try telling that to teenage me, watching it with mates, swigging from painfully cheap two-liter plastic bottles of cider.</p><p>The new movie doesn’t have a release date yet, beyond being some time this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/red-sonja-arnold-schwarzenegger-bassett-movie-trailer-1851786097]]></content:encoded>
