            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The multi-functional, portable Anker MagSafe Charger Stand powers your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods simultaneously in one location. This compact cube connects to an outlet via a single USB-C AC adapter connection and can be easily placed on any available desktop or nightstand. On top of the stand is a fold-down charger for an Apple Watch, and on the bottom of the unit is a designated area for wireless charging cases for AirPods. Plus, you can fold up the entire unit and take it with you if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/">Go to Amazon to purchase the Anker 3-in-1 Multi-Device Wireless Charging Stand for just $97, saving $53 and reducing the price by approximately 35% from the original $150.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2><span>Set it on your desktop, charge everything, and forget about it </span></h2>
<p><span>The design of Anker’s 3-in-1 multi-device wireless charging stand allows you to place your iPhone in a horizontal position to view your screen, and place your Apple Watch on top of the unit and your wireless charging case for AirPods at the bottom, all in a relatively uncluttered manner. In addition, the iPhone portion of the unit is adjustable, allowing you to view your screen in both portrait and landscape orientations. Also, the stand is collapsible and can fit in a small drawer or travel pouch when collapsed.</span></p>
<p>As part of the Anker MagSafe wireless charging system, the unit supports MagSafe-compatible iPhone models with up to 15 watts of fast wireless charging. The internal magnets ensure the iPhone lines up correctly and that you don’t have to slide it around to find the optimal charging spot every time. The charging dock for your iPhone holds it steady in either portrait or landscape orientation, allowing you to view your screen while it charges.</p>



<p>Support for Apple Watches is extensive, covering most models. The raised platform for the watch allows the bands to hang naturally, and the back of the watch rests on the charging surface, eliminating the need to bend your watch straps into awkward positions. The base of the unit includes a pad specifically designed for wireless charging cases for AirPods, providing a specific charging location for your earbuds rather than forcing you to share the space with your iPhone.</p>
<p>A major advantage of this wireless charging stand’s travel-friendly design is that it can be used even when you don’t have access to multiple outlets. Closed, the unit appears to be a standard small black plastic box with a single USB-C port on the side so that it won’t snag on anything else in your backpack or carry-on. When opened next to a bed or on a small table, it eliminates the need for three separate charging stations while requiring only a single outlet.</p>
<p>Ready-to-go out-of-the-box accessories make using the Anker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Stand a breeze. Included with the unit are the 3-in-1 charging dock, a 30-watt USB-C wall adapter, and a five-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6773/">For the low price of $97, reduced from the original $150, you’re receiving a compact charging dock that wirelessly charges your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods with a single cable.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Although the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger is only about the size of a credit card and fits in a back pocket, it has a 10,000 mAh battery, a built-in USB-C cable, and dual USB-C outputs, along with a single USB-A output. It also features protection against overcharging and automatically turns off when the device goes dormant, so you won’t waste electricity. Plus, it’s approved for flight travel by many airlines, so you don’t have to leave it behind on vacation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/">You can purchase the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger today from Amazon for $20. This is a savings of 17% off the usual $24 price tag.</a></p>

<h2>Power in your palm, no matter where you travel</h2>
<p>One of the things that makes the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger so convenient is its lightweight, thin design. It is designed to be a very portable power source and is perfect for all types of travel, including weekend trips, business trips, and daily commutes. It meets the FAA requirements for travel on many domestic and international flights (check with the carrier for specific requirements), so you can take it in your carry-on luggage. The charger is made of a rubberized material that is comfortable to hold and resists scratches, making it easy to carry in your hand or attach to your belt via the built-in lanyard. The built-in USB-C cord serves double-duty as a quick-clip attachment to a purse, backpack strap, etc., allowing you to attach it to whatever accessory you choose, freeing up your hands.</p>
<p>In addition to charging a single mobile device, the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger can charge two devices simultaneously via the Dual USB-C ports and a third device via the USB-A port, giving you the flexibility to charge your phone, headphones, and other accessories at the same time. The 45-Watt output allows you to quickly recharge many newer smartphones and small tablets. Because of this high output, even a brief charging session can result in a significant increase in the mobile device’s battery level. This charging capability means you can continue using your equipment for longer periods before needing to recharge it at an electrical outlet.</p>



<p>The built-in protections in this portable charger will protect it and your mobile device from damage caused by overcurrent, overvoltage, or excessive heat buildup, giving you peace of mind when you are charging with it. In addition to the protections mentioned above, simple LED indicator lights display the battery’s status, so you can tell whether it needs charging, and you’ll always know when your mobile devices are topped up.</p>
<p>All in all, the INIU Ultra Slim 45W Portable Charger was designed to provide users with reliable power to keep their mobile devices charged on the go without having to carry large, cumbersome batteries. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/">At $20, it’s an affordable solution for anyone looking for fast, reliable portable power.</a></p>

            <guid>1409899</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You really can’t have too many USB cables, can you? And now that Apple finally in the last couple years went ahead and ditched its proprietary Lightning cable to join the rest of the world in using the USB-C standard, you have even more reason to have USB-C cables readily available in every room in your house. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6770/">UGREEN is well established brand in the field of charging accessories, and right now, Amazon has a number of their cables on sale for as much as 42% off.</a></p>
<p>The UGREEN USB-C to USB-C 100W cable comes in four different sizes and your choice of buying them individually or as a pair. Breaking down the various options, we first have the smallest 1.6ft cable which only is available in a bundle of two. That normally goes for $17, but has come down to just $13. Going a size up, we have the 3.3ft cables which you can get on for $7 (down from $12) or two for $7 (down from $13). That should be a no brainer on whether to get one or two. Doubling the length to 6.6ft, you can the single for $8 ( down from $10) or $2 for $14 (down from $17). Lastly, we have the super long 10ft option which you can either get one of for $10 (down from $14) or two of for $18 (down from $23).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>One of those long 10ft ones are great to keep in your living room. This way no matter where you or a guest is sitting on your couch, they’ll be able to charge their phone while keeping it comfortably on their person, instead of needing to return to a different corner of the room to check for messages every 15 minutes. These cables are threaded with nylon braiding too, so they’re less susceptible to fraying or splitting.</p>
<h2>Wide Compatibility</h2>
<p>As a USB-C cable, this has a broad range of compatibility for various devices. It can be used to charge laptops like the new MacBook Pros, cell phones like the iPhone 17/16/15 Series, Samsung S25/S24/S23, and Google Pixel, as well as the newly released Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The UGREEN USB-C cable is equipped with smart chip protection. It’s built with an E-marker which can intelligently match the required current while increasing charging efficiency. It’s 100W so it’s capable of ultra-fast charging with PD3.0 and QC3.0 tech. You can expect to be able to bring an iPhone 17 Pro Max from dead to 50% in just 20 minutes time.</p>
<p>As a USB-C cable, it’s also capable of data transfer. You’ll be able to send and receive files at transfer speeds of up to 480Mbps, allowing you to quickly move massive files like movies or entire photo libraries in no time flat.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-on-its-32%e2%80%b3-odyssey-gaming-monitor-with-42-off-making-it-cheaper-than-the-27%e2%80%b3-model-2000660302</link>
            <guid>1409872</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A monitor can make or break your gaming experience. If you’re looking to enjoy consistent, high-quality visuals and snappy performance for your favorite titles, you need a solid option in your gaming setup.</p>
<p>Samsung makes some of the best out there, and we just found a way to grab one of its top-rated screens for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">The 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G50D Series is currently going for $250 at Amazon, after the retailer generously slashed a whopping 42% off its price.</a> This is one of the lowest prices we have seen in a while, but there’s a catch. The discount ends soon, so there isn’t much time left to save. It’s best to snap it up as quickly as you can!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brighter Whites, Deeper Blacks</h2>
<p>For just $250, you’re getting a spacious 32-inch screen. Expect lifelike visuals with QHD resolution that packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for better detail and sharper images. The fast IPS panel offers exceptional color accuracy, while the wide 178-degree viewing angle makes it easy to enjoy consistent visuals from nearly every side; you don’t have to sit exactly at the front of the screen to see what’s going on, which also makes it great for multiplayer matches with friends.</p>
<p>VESA DisplayHDR 400 support offers more contrast, helping you see all the shades better. Think brighter whites and deeper blacks, with even the shadows being visible. Translation? You will be able to spot enemies hidden in the dark easily, plus enjoy better contrast overall. The monitor also comes with an eye saver mode that actively minimizes blue light to help keep your eyes relaxed when gaming for extended periods.</p>



<p>As for the performance, the 180Hz refresh rate does an excellent job of eliminating lag, resulting in ultrasmooth action, even during those fast-paced games. A 1ms response time, on the other hand, reduces blur, making it easy to jump on enemies as soon as you spot them. Additionally, the AMD Radeon FreeSync keeps your monitor and graphics card refresh rate in sync for an even more immersive experience, whether you’re just streaming a show or teaching bad guys a lesson.</p>
<p>Samsung G50D can also be freely moved to accommodate the way you play. You can adjust the height, swivel, and tilt it to find the right viewing angle for a competitive edge. Sitting upright for an intense battle? Position it straight. Feeling tired of sitting and want to game while standing? That’s possible too.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been looking to enjoy better visuals that make you feel like a part of the action, the Samsung G50D is an excellent option to consider. It offers impressive detail, vibrant colors, and a solid refresh rate – all of which come together to deliver an immersive gaming experience. The monitor is now going for $250, down from $430, which makes today a great time to pick it up for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">If the 32-inch version is bigger than what you’re after, there’s also a 27-inch version of the same model. It’s going for $250, too, after a 29% discount</a>. However, considering how the 32-inch version offers more in the same price, it’s definitely a better pick.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s Why Pokémon Sun And Moon Is The Only One I’ve Never Finished]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sun-moon-ultra-alolan-raichu-kanto-evolve-2000660687</link>
            <guid>1409869</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I try not to have a backlog. I’m choosier with what I spend time on at this stage of my life than I used to be, and if I care enough to play a game, I usually see it through. But there is one white whale on my shelf that, despite multiple attempts, I’ve never been able to commit to seeing through: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sun-and-moon-the-kotaku-review-1789134713"><i><span>Pokémon Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i></a><span>, as well as their enhanced re-release, </span><i><span>Ultra Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ultra Moon</span></i><span>. The reason why is…a lot more stupid than you’d probably expect.</span></p> <p><span>With the exception of the Alola games, I have finished every mainline </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game at least once. I played through the first three generations endlessly on loop as a kid, creating new challenges for myself and catching new monsters to make the most of the game for as long as I could. It wasn’t until Generation IV that I became a “one and done” </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>player before moving on to the next thing. This was both because I was old enough to buy more games for myself so I wasn’t constantly pulling water from the stone, and because I was starting to lose interest in the stories they were telling.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games have had cool worldbuilding but lackluster narrative, so as I was getting older and playing grander RPGs like </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>wasn’t holding my attention the way it once had. But still, I was playing these games as if out of obligation. I finished them, put them on my shelf, and didn’t think about them much beyond that. So what could have possibly happened with </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span> and their “definitive” editions that finally pushed me over the edge and made me </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> finish a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game? Let me tell you about my pancake-eating archnemesis, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Alolan Raichu</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>readers will know that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, the evolved form of Pikachu, is my favorite Pokémon. Because his little brother is the mascot of the whole dang franchise, Raichu is often forgotten, and sometimes, in the case of the anime, actively set up for failure to make Pikachu look good.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For many years, I grinned and bore it. To me Pikachu, Raichu, and their pre-evolution, Pichu, were all the same Pokémon anyway. If one form got love, it was like my partner in crime was getting attention at different stages of his life. But man, Game Freak was adamant about making sure everyone and their mother knew that Raichu was the red-headed stepchild of the family. Pikachu has a held item that makes it more powerful than Raichu, so there’s even a mechanical reason not to use a Thunder Stone and evolve it. Raichu’s </span><i><span>Ultra Moon</span></i><span> Pokedex entry even says, “Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often.” Relax, Game Freak.</span></p>

 <p><span>So when </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon </span></i><span>was coming out, I was already halfway off the wagon. Then it arrived and Game Freak revealed that every Pikachu in the game would evolve into a new regional variant. The Alolan version of Raichu is…cute, I guess. It gains the psychic typing which lets it levitate and surf around on its tail, and all of this is apparently a result of Pikachu overeating Alolan pancakes, which is why it emits a sweet scent when it rubs its electric cheeks. But I saw through its facade. I don’t smell maple syrup, I smell some bullshit. I want to fistfight him in the streets.</span></p>

  <p><span>Behind this syrup-smelling surfing psychic’s cute round face is a nasty, vile truth: Game Freak and The Pokémon Company were only willing to give Raichu attention if they changed him into something else entirely. The boy cannot get respect in his own form, and that has only become more clear in the years since </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. Pikachu gets a Gigantamax form in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, an exclusive Z-Move in </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>, and is always the playable version in games like </span><i><span>Pokken Tournament</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>. Raichu, meanwhile, gets scraps…unless it’s the Alolan variant, which is featured in games like </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</span></i><span> and is playable in </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>A lot of this disrespect and preferential treatment has come after </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>, but I still called Alolan Raichu for what it was. </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon </span></i><span>was already primed to push me away with its less interesting tropical setting and a Pokedex with too few standouts to keep me hunting for new favorites, so to not even be able to explore this region with my favorite electric rat? To be told to settle for an imposter that smells of hotcakes and psychic power? I just couldn’t push through. And y’all, I have tried so many times over the past 10 years. However, maybe I can finally go back after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659337" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659337"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659337">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The latest RPG in the series finally gives Raichu his due. He has not one, but two Mega Evolutions now, after having been oddly overlooked when </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>came out and first introduced those transformations. I’m obsessed with both of these forms, though I have a preference for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>the flying, physical-attacking X form</span></a><span>. I admit, however, there is some part of me that still feels a little bit of that lingering resentment because both forms carry distinct visual similarities to Pikachu, almost as if Game Freak wanted to make a Mega Pikachu but couldn’t based on their own rules, and so my rat son finally got love. Yes, Alolan Raichu felt like a slight to us OG Raichu lovers at the time…but now that my favorite Pokémon finally isn’t being ignored, do I have it in me to forgive the dopey-ass surfer boy for his crimes?</span></p> <p><span>As the resident </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>guy around these parts, </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span> is one of the only examples I have of a backlog game that feels truly wrong to have not seen through to the end. Usually, if I don’t finish a game, there’s a less stupid and prideful reason like I just wasn’t enjoying it, so I don’t carry the baggage of games left incomplete on my shoulders as I head out to new worlds on unknown adventures. But I’m a certified champion in every other </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> region besides Alola, which I left unconquered mostly because I didn’t want to do it without my best friend by my side. I might not go back any time soon, but for the first time in over a decade, I’m starting to feel like I’m letting go of the pride that has kept me from seeing it through.</span></p>
