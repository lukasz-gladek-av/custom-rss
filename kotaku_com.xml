            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> was one of the most surprising announcements to come out of last week’s Nintendo Direct. It’s yet another remake for the often overlooked PS1-era Japanese RPG, and it’ll arrive amid a recent influx of other<em> Dragon Quest</em> remasters. This one has my full attention, though, and not just because the original game is a sprawling adventure I’ve always wanted to go back to and properly finish. It’s also the art style, which moves past the recent obsession with HD-2D pixel art glow-ups and offers a blueprint for how to revive tons of other beloved JRPG classics.</p> <p>The new “hand-crafted” aesthetic is more akin to the toys-and-dioramas-style visuals of<em> Yoshi’s Woolly World</em> or the<em>&nbsp;Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> remake than what we’re used to getting from Square Enix. <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> <em>Reimagined</em> sits somewhere between the HD-2D retro sensibility of last year’s excellent <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake and the hyper-realistic, Unreal Engine visuals of the <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>remake trilogy, with detailed graphics that exaggerate the storybook whimsy of Akira Toriyama’s original designs rather than running away from them.</p> <p>The big secret to this new look? Scanning actual dolls. Hi-res captures of IRL toys for characters like Hero, Kiefer, and Maribel helped ground the new art style while retaining all of the whimsy. “For this game, we scanned figurines, like this one here, to create the in-game models,” the remake’s producer said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTTfUC4MUZs">a short overview</a> with series creator Yuji Horii. “They’re very well done. Using a graphical aesthetic we call the ‘diorama style,’ we’ve depicted the stories and the characters’ emotions in an entirely new way.”</p>

 <p>The game isn’t far away either. It comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, and Switch 2 on February 5, 2026 (one small bummer is that the Switch 2 physical version is a game key card only and progress <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1nfv3i9/dragon_quest_vii_reimagined_the_switch_2_version/">doesn’t transfer</a> between the two console generations).</p>  <p>Alongside exploring dungeons, engaging in familiar turn-based battles, and tinkering with a meaty job system, <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> revolves around an island-hopping adventure that sees its heroes time-traveling between the past and present as they confront the Demon Lord Orgodemir. It’s a very, very long game, clocking in at up to 100 hours just for the main story. Despite the heft, it was mostly overlooked when it first came to PlayStation due in part to its dated-looking graphics. It didn’t get localized in the West until 2001 after the PS2 was already out and just a month before the arrival of <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p>

 <p><em>Dragon Quest VII</em> got a second look when it was remade for the 3DS in 2013 as <i>Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten</i> <em>Past</em>. It completely overhauled the graphics into 3D polygons and abridged much of the story to shave dozens of hours off the average runtime. <em>Reimagined</em> will make further improvements, including an even more streamlined story and new quality-of-life features like a redesigned UI to make the game easier to navigate. But the most pivotal change will probably be the new “Moonlighting” mechanic that lets characters use abilities from two different jobs simultaneously.</p> <p>We’ve seen Square Enix take all sorts of different approaches to reviving its back catalog in recent years. While <em>FFVII</em> got the full remake treatment, other PS1 games like <em>Chrono Cross</em> and <em>Legend of Mana</em> have simply received HD resolution boosts and additional features that would be considered barebones even by the standards of a third-party emulator. Then there’s stuff in the middle like <em>Dragon Quest III</em> and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> which are ground-up overhauls that still try to remain as faithful the originals as possible.</p> <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em><em>&nbsp;</em>offers a fourth alternative that would be perfect for other games like the original <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, which Toriyama also designed the characters for. It even looks perfect for seemingly impossible-to-remake RPGs from other publishers like <em>Earthbound</em>. Players have been sharing fan art of that SNES classic in the style of <em>Reimagined</em> for decades now. We even recently <a href="https://noisypixel.net/earthbound-clay-figure-set-hobonichi/">got new clay models</a> of the main cast that are perfect for scanning. I hope the <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </em>model proves to be viable for projects beyond Square Enix, though I could certainly see it working for something like the long-rumored <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>remake as well.</p>

              <p>Massive game install sizes and the diminishing role of physical media continue to be frustrating. This time around, <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i>’s Switch 2 “physical version” is in the crosshairs. A “Game-Key Card,” <i>Remake</i>’s physical Switch 2 release contains no data itself but will initiate a massive download that’ll Kirby up a ton of the Switch 2’s otherwise generous built-in storage capacity.</p> <p>Despite having a pretty-looking case design, <i>FF7R</i> will ship on Switch 2 with a card that merely serves as a physical license to download a whopping 90GB (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), which is around a third of the spacious (or so we thought) 256GB storage capacity of the Switch 2. But as Switch 2 connoisseurs will point out, Square Enix probably didn’t have much choice. The maximum size of an actual physical Switch 2 game is only 64GB. While file compression can work wonders, <i>FF7R</i> with its <i>Intergrade</i> expansion is just too damn big to fit on a cart.</p> <p>As our comrades at <i>Eurogamer</i> wonder, however, is this Nintendo’s fault for “not offering larger game cards?”</p>

After all, the Switch 2 is clearly making a play to be the premiere place to go for AAA experiences on handhelds–and it’s got the horsepower to do it, as we’ve seen with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></a> and even <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, one can buy a 256GB SD card for peanuts (if peanuts is just $25 to you), so why are the Switch 2’s carts limited to just 64GB? It feels like an arbitrary decision that, if Nintendo was invested in physical media and the ability to play a game on a dedicated <i>handheld </i>device without any internet connection whatsoever, it would have made efforts to solve–especially for ambitious (and very good!) games like <i>FF7R</i>.</p> <p>And let’s be honest, 90GB isn’t uniquely large when it comes to AAA games. It’s early days for the Switch 2, so what’s this problem gonna look like as games only continue to bloom in size?</p>

              <p>Video game companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">still sell millions of physical copies</a> of games every year, but that’s not where they make the bulk of their money. As Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf">latest corporate report</a> shows, physical game sales for PlayStation 5 and PS4 are practically a rounding error on a rounding error, and the number just keeps going down. The total percentage of revenue from physical software sales is now half of what it was before the PS5 launched.</p> <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment made <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sie-fy24-revenue-31-5b-9-operating-income-2-8b-43-software-sales-17b-14-hardware-18-5m-11.1188738/">roughly $31.5 billion</a> in its last fiscal year, which ended in March. That was up nearly 10 percent from the year prior as gaming works overtime within Sony to bolster the company’s financials. But within its games and services division, AKA PlayStation, only 3 percent of that revenue came from physical games. That’s still $945 million! Nothing to sniff at, for sure, but also a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the skyrocketing division.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000625711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625711"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625711">Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s also the lowest share of PlayStation revenue that’s ever come from physical game sales. For the year prior to the PS5’s launch in 2020, <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2020_E.pdf">Sony reported</a> 6 percent of revenue came from discs. The next year it dropped to just 5 percent. That number stayed flat for a few more years before dropping to 4 percent in its 2024 corporate report and then 3 percent this past year, half of what it was at the end of the PS4 generation. One reason the number might have been so low last year? Even fewer first-party Sony games than usual, which hardcore fans traditionally buy more physical copies of.</p>

 <p>While the percentage of overall sales that physical games make up for PlayStation continues to decline, the fact that the total revenue from those physical games isn’t falling as fast could be one reason Sony might be thinking of keeping a disc drive as an option for the PS6 but moving away from having it as the default. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/">recent report from<em> Insider Gaming</em></a> claimed the next-gen console will continue the detachable disc-drive trend where an all-digital machine is the default and players have to pay extra to utilize their physical media.</p> <p>Each console maker is currently grappling with the transition away from physical games in their own way. Many first-party Xbox games don’t even ship with a physical version anymore, and Nintendo’s controversial game key cards for the Switch 2 mean that the majority of third-party games on the new handheld hybrid don’t truly have a physical version either. The PS5 console cycle could end up being the final nail in the coffin for physical game media.</p>
