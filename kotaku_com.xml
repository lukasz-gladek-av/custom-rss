            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today marks the 40th anniversary of </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>. Originally released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986, Nintendo’s ambitious adventure kicked off the most beloved high-fantasy video game series of them all. Through decades, the tunic-wearing hero has slain stalfos, obliterated octoroks, and harassed cuccos. But behind all the sword and sorcery lies another campaign in waiting, an adventure Link has never braved but come very close to undertaking: some outer space shit.</span></p> <p><span>In 2017, </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, art director Satoru Takizawa and technical director Takuhiro Dohta </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMsF31NdNc"><span>gave a keynote at GDC</span></a><span>. It offered a rare and candid glimpse at the production behind the latest (and to some, greatest) </span><i><span>Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>, released only a few days prior. Getting a peak behind the curtain at how the toybox of physics and elemental effects came to be was a treat, but one of the more bizarre parts of the talk regarded an earlier pitch.</span></p>

 <p><span>In a segment called “Trial and Error,” Takizawa reviews concepts for a version of the game called <em>The Legend of Zelda: INVASION</em>. “This is where things got a bit dodgy,” Takizawa said. “And here’s an invasion from outer space.”</span></p> <p><span>As chuckling swells in the crowd, bizarre slides of this would-be </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> cycle. It features a UFO descending on to Hyrule, a storyboard for an alien autopsy, spacesuits and Ganondorf in what appears to be a Metallica t-shirt. Most offensive of all were slides of the most fuckboy Link ever developed. Dressed like a frosh week volunteer, Link dons baggy denim pants, a striped winter hat, a Triforce guitar and a motorcycle. To think we came this close to a Link with a </span><i><span>Superbad</span></i><span> poster in his room still gives me chills.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfefbrnvn32w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreia5cy4hgcgd5aosdhkyvbjbew2mpr72ppojm5jvkofahie7z6mkgq"> <p lang="fr">The Legend of Zelda is 40 today 🤯<br> *check notes on space*</p> <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017): UFO concept, artist unknown<br> Art director Satoru Takizawa: "Some of our younger designers came up with very unique suggestions, like the idea that UFOs could invade from space and abduct cattle.”</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz?ref_src=embed">The Spaceshipper 🚀 (@thespaceshipper.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz/post/3mfefbrnvn32w?ref_src=embed">2026-02-21T10:15:00.535Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>Thankfully we got the incredible game we got instead, but it’s probably no coincidence that Takizawa brought up <em>INVASION</em> when discussing the design for </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>’s ancient ruins and Guardians. Sheikah technology has a strong, otherworldly and out-of-place appearance to it. Mechanical octopus arms. Ominous glowing spotlights. Metallurgy so distant to the masonry everywhere else. Hell, Link’s main weapon is a damn smartphone. It always felt like some of the sci-fi elements remained deep in Hyrule’s soil, built by ancient visitors.</span></p>

 <p><span>This </span><i><span>Stargate</span></i><span>-aside wasn’t </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>’s only near miss with a different genre. Fact is, since day one Shigeru Miyamoto considered giving </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> a harder sci-fi bent. In </span><a href="https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/interview-miyamoto-un-equilibre-difficile-a-trouver-165131.html"><span>an interview with the French publication </span><i><span>Gamekult</span></i></a><span>, Miyamoto confirmed that the series’ original idea revolved around time travel.</span></p>

 <p><span>Obviously time travel is a frequent occurrence, but this initial concept is less </span><i><span>Ocarina</span></i><span> and more </span><i><span>Back to the Future Part II</span></i><span>. This plot seemingly concerns a bygone era of steel and shield rubbing up against strange future devices, and the source of the Triforce’s incredible magic being microchips and computer parts. In that same conversation, Miyamoto even muses that </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> producer Eiji Aonuma might have added the Sheikah Slate as a kind of callback to this original idea. 1992’s </span><i><span>A Link to the Past</span></i><span> got so close to Link facing off against flying cars that concept art was drafted for a tubular, ‘90s, cyberpunk Princess Zelda, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216074731/https://kotaku.com/5979669/your-favorite-zelda-game-could-have-looked-like-this"><span>resurfacing in 2013’s </span><i><span>Hyrule Historia</span></i></a><span>. Come to think of it, the title </span><i><span>A Link to the Past</span></i><span> would make a lot more sense for a game about time travel than one in which you merely hop between a good dimension and a scary dimension.</span></p> <p><span>After 40 years, it feels unlikely that Nintendo will send Link, Zelda, Tingle, all our Hyrule friends spiraling into wormholes and far off nebulas now. When Hylians land on the moon, it usually means the moon came to the Hyrule. Nintendo has reigned in their style guide before. As they venture </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-yoshi-birdo-baby-2000662854"><span>into movies</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-nintendo-lead-actors-benjamin-ainsworth-1851786373"><span>Netflix shows</span></a><span> and theme parks I expect them to only become more conservative on what their IPs do and do not do. Still, as much as <em>INVASION</em>’s Link… disturbs me, I am that steadfast </span><i><span>Jackie Brown</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ed Wood</span></i><span> are their best movies kind of hack who finds that great artists often do their greatest work beyond the comfort zone. Throughout the ages, people who work on <em>Zelda</em> seem to dream of one day lobbing Link into the cold void of space. Perhaps, one day, they will get their wish.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Freshly minted <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma</a> has kicked off the newest era of Xbox leadership with an open thread on Elon Musk’s social media platform. Coming from Microsoft’s AI division, the former marketer with little experience in gaming faces a wave of skepticism from fans at the exact moment when trust in the Xbox brand has never been more challenged following waves of developer layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures.</p> <p>She began with a simple question to her influx of new gaming followers. “Top 3 greatest games ever? Why? GO” reads her <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025255912521486368">second post on X</a> since replacing outgoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">38-year Microsoft veteran Phil Spencer</a>. “For me it’s <em>Halo</em>, <em>Valheim</em>, <em>Goldeneye</em>,” she told one user. Others asked which<em> Halo</em>. An Xbox Gamertag Sharma shared with another user included playtime in both <em>Halo Infinite</em> and <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">New <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> CEO Asha Sharma has now publicly shared her Gamertag. She has a 10,860 gamerscore and seemingly only started playing on Xbox or this GT one month ago.</p> <p>She (or whomever runs the account) has played 29 games in the span of that month. <a href="https://t.co/3EMvDVLNo3">pic.twitter.com/3EMvDVLNo3</a></p> <p>— NIB (@nib95_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nib95_/status/2025279480621682906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The account has a shocking number of achievements in <em>Ball x Pit</em>, one of 2025’s breakout indie games that debuted on Game Pass. One user recommended <em>Borderlands 2</em> which Sharma said she would try. A short time later, it appeared on her recent activity list. For some it’s a sign that the executive from Meta and Instacart is engaged, accessible, and no stranger to games. Others are skeptical that it’s not all just part of some carefully and artificially curated PR rollout.</p> <p>Amid the more than one thousand responses, Sharma was asked the obvious question on most Xbox players’ minds: what about exclusives? Microsoft’s shift from fierce console war competition with Sony to actively porting its biggest franchises to PlayStation 5 has read to many long-time fans as a betrayal and, perhaps even worse, a sign that the tech giant <a href="https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114">has given up on Xbox as a viable contender in the console gaming space</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hear you</p> <p>— Asha (@asha_shar) <a href="https://twitter.com/asha_shar/status/2025253764136141169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“Hi Asha Sharma, </span><span>as the new Xbox CEO I hope that you understand how important exclusive games are and how games like Halo, Forza, Gears. Fable… Created an identity for Xbox and its players becoming a key point for Xbox’s success,” wrote one player with a Gamerscore over 200,000. “Xbox games must be only on Xbox.”</span></p>

 <p>“Hear you,” she wrote back.</p> <p>The sentiment, vague and noncommittal as it was, instantly gave some hope to the diehard Xbox fans in Sharma’s mentions. Others think it’s just a cheap way to buy a little good will before Microsoft accelerates Xbox’s pivot to being just a third-party publisher or moves forward with more cuts and closures as the tech giant continues shifting all of its resources and energy into the AI race.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the informal Q&amp;A, some users on X accused Sharma’s answers of being written by a chatbot. “I don’t believe you,” wrote one person. “In fact, I think your account is an AI.” The new CEO of Xbox responded: “Beep Boop Beep Boop.”</p>

              <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> was an unexpected hit. Rising above the tide of urban sandboxes in 2006, the game pushed its tomfoolery further than even </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> dared. The most recent entry, however, was a misfire. 2022’s reboot was busted from a technical standpoint and tonally out of sync for fans. Last year, rumors arose that the series might get another shot, but Chris Stockman, design director for the original game, now says the long-running </span><i><span>Row</span></i><span> has a fork in it.</span></p> <p><span>“I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately,” </span><span>Stockman <a href="https://twitter.com/papaRPG/status/2024941290492694703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2024941290492694703%7Ctwgr%5E5b5766a4b2f5941f6a7dde345eab9a61c98bcdd8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fi-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director">told a fan on Discord</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>)</span><span>. “I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it.”</span></p> <p><span>Though Stockman hadn’t been with </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> developer Volition for years, he claimed last November that Embracer Group approached him to help with a course correction for the franchise. The pitch, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-original-saints-rows-design-director-says-hes-been-asked-to-create-a-pitch-for-a-potential-prequel/"><span>as he described it</span></a><span>, was a </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> prequel set in the 1970s. This new setting could have done a more balanced job of giving </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> a desperately needed fresh coat, while affording itself ample opportunities for its signature buffoonery.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember when we got excited about the prospect of a Saints Row prequel? Well according to Saints Row 1 Design Director Chris Stockman, Embracer is completely ignoring the idea.</p> <p>Saints Row is once again dead. <a href="https://t.co/cpPVcRjxwD">https://t.co/cpPVcRjxwD</a> <a href="https://t.co/FWpjC6kmkT">pic.twitter.com/FWpjC6kmkT</a></p> <p>— rpg! (@papaRPG) <a href="https://twitter.com/papaRPG/status/2024941290492694703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Promising as that was, it did not get very far. Only a few months later, Stockman now believes he is being “ghosted” by Embracer and that it’s probably the end of the road for </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span>’s 20-year joy ride. “I wish things were different,” he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>While it’s since become the norm, Embracer Group were one of the earlier conglomerates who got into the practice of hoovering up game studios and squeezing them dry. They’ve toyed around with portfolios like Gearbox, Crystal Dynamics, THQ and dozens more, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-sells-studios-collapse-nintendo-classics-black-ops-7-update-2000647577"><span>all to mixed results</span></a><span>. Their acquisition of Volition occurred in 2018, part of a package in the purchase of Koch Media. The 2022 reboot would be the only game Volition made under Embracer, developed under routine restructuring and staff transfers between other studios. When this banged-up </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> failed to meet sales expectations, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-studio-volition-after-30-1850792734"><span>Volition was shuttered</span></a><span> by Embracer in 2023.</span></p>

 <p><span>This end is merely another page in the book of Embracer squashing out potential sequels, having recently binned revivals for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/more-details-about-xboxs-canceled-perfect-dark-reportedly-leak-2000627538"><i><span>Perfect Dark</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-group-deus-ex-cancelled-eidos-montreal-layoffs-1851205890"><i><span>Deus Ex</span></i></a><span> before that. Having picked up Crystal Dynamics in 2022, their first outing with the </span><i><span>Tomb Raider</span></i><span> series is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/crystal-dynamics-tomb-raider-open-world-layoffs-2000644117"><span>already facing turbulence</span></a><span> as Embracer enacts their signature restructuring.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Promises Two Far Cry Games Are Coming As Open-World Shooter Continues Its Longest Hiatus Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-extraction-shooter-assassins-creed-hexe-ubisoft-2000672574</link>
            <guid>1442764</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-far-cry-game-1680319871"><em>Far Cry 7</em></a> was not supposed to take this long, but Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot is promising the wait will be worth it. Asked about the state of the publisher’s biggest franchises and why they’re taking so long to make in a recent interview, the cofounder took the unusual step of confirming the existence of two previously reported upcoming<em> Far Cry</em> projects.</p> <p>“We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios,” he <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">told <em>Variety</em></a> this week. “Under the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year. On <em>Far Cry</em>, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development.”</p> <p>The existence of both of these projects was <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-multiplayer-ubisoft-star-wars-snowdrop-1850038103">first reported back in early 2023</a>.&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7</em> was being developed under the codename Project Blackbird while the second game, a multiplayer spin-off, was being developed under the codename <em>Project Maverick</em>. While Ubisoft mentioned both games in internal presentations at the time as the company doubled down on its biggest franchises, they continue to face delays and remain MIA <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">as the company tries to implement quality checks with higher standards</a>.</p>

 <h2>Why is <em>Far Cry 7</em> taking so long?</h2> <p>Historically, big <em>Far Cry</em> sequels have come out every two to three years, with smaller spin-offs releasing in-between. Since Ubisoft bought the franchise and launched <em>Far Cry 2</em> back in 2008, the longest gap between new entries has been four years. It will have been five years since <em>Far Cry 6</em> released come this fall. A similar breakdown in the pipeline has hit other major Ubisoft franchises as it gets more complex and expensive to develop AAA blockbusters.</p> <p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>, the <em>Far Cry</em> multiplayer spin-off Maverick in particular has faced major challenges. While it started as an extraction shooter, Maverick has continued to evolve and morph during development. While Ubisoft has continued to produce impressive, massive open-world single-player adventures, its forays into multiplayer have gone terribly. From <em>Hyper Scape</em> to <em>XDefiant</em>, and all of the botched and canceled live service projects in-between, Ubisoft has been unable to recreate the success of its biggest multiplayer staple, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>

 <h2>“Several” <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games are just around the corner</h2> <p>On the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> front, the path forward is looking much clearer. An unannounced remake of <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> appears to still be on track for release in 2026 despite a recent delay. The previously teased multiplayer spin-off Invictus is also still “locked-in,” according <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">to <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, with the next single-player game, <em>Hexe</em>, reportedly slated for 2027. Multiple unannounced mobile spin-offs were recently canceled, however, and a mobile game from <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568694651800133632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1568694651800133632%7Ctwgr%5Eb9b4ae047170f42a47dc2044f55096d535b137cb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fassassins-creed-red-mirage-ubisoft-hexe-jade-netflix-1849521945">Netflix called <em>Jade</em></a> seems unlikely to ever see the light of day as the streamer pivots to licensed party games.</p>

 <p>Whatever happens to Ubisoft as it partitions its sprawling empire of studios into easily sellable “Creative Houses,” <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> will remain cornerstones of whatever’s left. There’s already a <em>Far Cry</em> TV series in development at FX and a new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> historical drama coming to Netflix. All Ubisoft has to do is actually release a new<em> Far Cry</em> game at some point while bringing some excitement and shine back to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last week, Discord </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951"><span>users reported seeing prompts to submit personal information to Persona</span></a><span>, a third-party age-verification service. As Discord commits to universal age-verification, the new measures have come under </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><span>intense scrutiny</span></a><span> after </span><a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service"><span>previous security failures</span></a><span>. Now a trio of hacktivists say they’ve successfully breached Persona, getting a closer look at how the company uses submitted biometrics. They say their findings raise alarms beyond the possibility of leaks.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.therage.co/persona-age-verification/"><span>According to </span><i><span>The Rage</span></i></a><span>, Persona’s front-end security left a lot to be desired. Worse, however, were investigative findings that suggested Persona’s surveillance of the users whose data it collected was way more sprawling than originally believed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was initially meant to be a passive recon investigation,” </span><a href="https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona"><span>writes vmfunc, a cybersecurity researcher and one of the hackers</span></a><span>, “that quickly turned into a rabbit hole deep dive into how commercial AI and federal government operations work together to violate our privacy every waking second.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm sharing all email correspondences between <a href="https://twitter.com/vmfunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmfunc</a> and myself in advance of <a href="https://twitter.com/vmfunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmfunc</a>'s later blog posts because without context, a signed statement from myself has only created more conspiracy theories regarding Persona. <a href="https://t.co/nDJorLEP4H">pic.twitter.com/nDJorLEP4H</a></p> <p>— Rick Song (@rickcsong) <a href="https://twitter.com/rickcsong/status/2024423711559102578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>On top of finding it surprisingly easy to access data gathered by Persona, the research showed that faces and biometrics were not just being scanned for age verification, but flagged for suspicious behavior and bounced off watchlists as well. To some, particularly those who don’t worry about their face being deemed “suspicious,” this may not sound like an Orwellian level of intrusion, until you remember Persona’s full network.</span></p>

 <p><span>Persona </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>received $150 million in 2021</span></a><span> from the Founders Fund, a long-running tech investor group headed by Peter Thiel. Thiel’s main business, on top of </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>palling around in Jeffery Epstein’s emails</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000"><span>waiting for the antichrist</span></a><span>, is Palantir, an intentionally ominously-named data brokering service that is currently </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><span>peddling user information to support ICE raids</span></a><span>. The findings of vmfunc and co’s research doesn’t directly tether Persona and Discord’s operations to Palantir or Thiel, but it wouldn’t be conspiratorial to point out that all this data seems to be funnelling along similar slopes.</span></p>

 <h2>Trust but verify</h2> <p><span>Persona has confirmed the breach, CEO Rick Song corresponding and </span><a href="https://x.com/rickcsong/status/2025038040599810385"><span>even thanking the</span></a><span><a href="https://x.com/rickcsong/status/2025038040599810385"> hackers</a> for flagging the security exploit. This has not, however, </span><a href="https://x.com/vmfunc/status/2024433404683374921"><span>tempered concerns</span></a><span> among those hacktivists about how the user information is ultimately being used.</span></p> <p><span>“Transparently, we are actively working on a couple of potential contracts which would be publicly visible if we move forward,” writes Christie Kim, chief operating officer at Persona, </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-and-persona-end-partnership-after-shady-uk-age-test-sparks-outcry/"><span>in an email regarding the security breach and speculation around Discord</span></a><span>. “However, these engagements are strictly for workforce account security of government employees and do not include ICE or any agency within the Department of Homeland Security.”</span></p>

 <p><span>After the alarm was initially raised about Persona, Discord claimed its work with the Thiel-backed firm was only temporary, and that it didn’t have new contacts with it moving forward. It also promised user info was being wiped from servers within seven days of being gathered.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement provided to </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, Discord said the “limited test” had concluded, though what Persona does with the information in that period isn’t clarified. It seems to go much further than verifying which PlayStation you grew up with. Even after the dust settles, it’s unclear if the trust can ever be repaired as an exodus of Discord users have already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-alternative-teamspeak-age-verification-check-rivals-2000669693"><span>flooded alternatives like TeamSpeak</span></a><span>.</span></p>
