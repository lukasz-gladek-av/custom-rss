            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Recently, the topic of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599">2010’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> and Bethesda creative director Todd Howard came up during a New Year’s Eve party I attended. During the conversation, a few people, myself included, joked about how Howard doesn’t like <em>New Vegas</em>, a <em>Fallout</em> game developed not by Bethesda but by Obsidian. Look around online, and you’ll see plenty of others joking and suggesting the same thing. Howard hates <em>New Vegas.</em> Or is at least annoyed by its success.</p> <p>Here’s the thing: There’s no evidence this is true, and in fact, Bethesda’s famed creative director has stated multiple times publicly that he thinks <em>New Vegas</em> is great. And yet, this myth is so persistent that even I have to remind myself that it ain’t true.</p>

 <p>So what’s up with that? Why is this rumor so popular and so widely believed, to various degrees, by so many <em>Fallout</em> fans and gamers? And exactly how and when did it start?</p> <h2>The history of the Todd Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> rumor</h2> <p>Looking around online, it doesn’t seem like this was a topic until a few years after <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> arrived. Specifically, after the launch of <em>Fallout 4</em> in 2015, you started to see discussion of this topic pop up online.</p>

 <p><a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/959557-fallout-new-vegas/72818844">Here’s a November 2015 GameFAQs thread</a> in which someone asks if Howard hates <em>New Vegas,</em> because he doesn’t talk about it much, and people complaining about <em>Fallout 4</em> being worse than Obsidian’s spin-off. And I think this is a key part of this myth. A lot of people were disappointed by <em>Fallout 4 </em>for&nbsp;feeling less like an RPG and more like an open-world shooter. And at this point, enough time had passed that 2010’s<em> New Vegas</em> was more fondly remembered as a cool RPG and not a buggy mess.</p>

 <p>Over time, this opinion that <em>New Vegas</em> was good and <em>Fallout 4</em> was bad has solidified online and helped convince many that Bethesda and Howard must surely be mad or jealous over the perception that their latest big installment in the franchise pales in comparison to Obsidian’s rushed-out spin-off. This belief even helped fuel the idea that season one of the TV show was removing<em> New Vegas</em> from the canon. (It wasn’t.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/orc0n5/does_bethesda_actually_resent_new_vegas/">And now it’s easy to find people</a> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/22380/discussions/0/7625232196037861261/?l=greek">claiming Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> online</a>.</p>

 <p>But if you look back over the last 15 years, there’s zero evidence that Howard and co. hate <em>New Vegas</em>. &nbsp;You can, however,&nbsp; find plenty of evidence that Howard doesn’t hate <em>New Vegas.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>All the evidence that Howard likes <em>New Vegas&nbsp;</em></h2> <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/fallout_new_vegas/b/pc/archive/2010/05/04/what-you-should-know-about-fallout-new-vegas.aspx#:~:text=While%20we%20wouldn%E2%80%99t,I%20don%E2%80%99t%20care.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D">All the way back in 2010,</a> in a <em>Game Informer</em> preview of the then-upcoming<em> Fallout: New Vegas,</em> Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart and game director Josh Sawyer were speaking pretty positively about working with Howard. Here’s what Urquhart told the outlet:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Todd [Howard] was awesome. I would say sometimes I was more resistant to some of the things [Josh] wanted to do than Todd was. Todd has a great way of looking at games. It’s all about the player. If we had ideas that we could all see would make it a lot more fun for the player, he was like, ‘Go kill that sacred cow—I don’t care.’”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Joshua_Sawyer_Formspring_posts/2011#:~:text=JESawyer%20responded%20to%20larzma,He%27s%20a%20great%20guy.">In 2011,</a> while answering fan questions about <em>Fallout: New Vegas,</em> Sawyer once again mentioned that Howard was a “great guy.” Then, in 2013, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/and-heres-obsidians-idea-for-fallout-new-vegas-2">Howard told <em>RPS</em> </a>that he thought<em> New Vegas</em> was great and he was open to doing more with Obsidian.</p>

 <p>In 2018, <a href="https://youtu.be/QKn9yiLVlMM?t=2937">a small moment from NoClip’s excellent Bethesda documentary</a> likely helped add more fuel to all this. The doc takes a small detour to talk about <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and categorizes it as a corporate-mandated decision, says there aren’t many <em>New Vegas</em> posters around the Bethesda offices, and seems to imply that the studio was mostly hands-off on the project.</p> <p>But also, in that same year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/18/bethesda-games-interview-todd-howard-pete-hines-elder-scrolls-starfield">while speaking to <em>The Guardian</em></a> about <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and whether Bethesda would ever let another studio make a <em>Fallout</em> game, Howard said this:</p> <blockquote><p>“I wouldn’t say never. [But] now that our company is so big, it’s always better to keep stuff internal…it becomes less likely, but I could never say never. I thought the Obsidian guys did a fabulous job.”</p></blockquote> <p>In 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/nPttE_fvjZM?t=3523">Howard reiterated in an interview with <em>IGN</em></a> that it was unlikely an outside studio would ever get to make <em>Fallout</em> again, but once more praised <em>New Vegas</em> and clarified that the only studio they trusted to make the game was Obsidian.</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ygTFeCWOEZU">Jump forward a bit to 2024</a>. During an appearance on <em>Kinda Funny</em>, Howard was jokingly asked by host Greg Miller about how much he allegedly hates <em>New Vegas</em> and how Bethesda was removing it from the franchise’s canon via the show. Howard rolled his eyes and then said this:</p> <blockquote><p>“First, I’ll say, they did an amazing job with <em>New Vegas</em>. We see some of that, and I’ll say to everybody, that’s a game that we published, right? I will say Feargus, who runs Obsidian, is absolutely one of my favorite people in the video game industry…<em>New Vegas</em> is a very, very important game to us and our fans. We think [Obsidian] did an incredible job.”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/huge-respect-to-the-folks-at-obsidian-todd-howard-invited-obsidian-devs-onto-fallout-season-2s-set-so-they-could-see-new-vegas-in-the-flesh/">In December 2025,</a> ahead of <em>Fallout</em> season two on Amazon Prime, Howard told <em>PC Gamer</em> that he had invited the Obsidian devs onto the New Vegas set to let them see it in person. He added:</p>

 <p>“When we went to do [<em>New Vegas</em>], we were coming off of <em>Fallout 3.</em> We knew we were going to do <em>Skyrim</em>. We know the folks at Obsidian well, love their work, and so we reached out to them and said, ‘Hey, would you like to do this? We see something else coming off of <em>Fallout 3.</em>‘ This is what we asked them to do, right? And they just did an incredible job on <em>New Vegas.</em>”</p> <p>And most recently, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/not-only-does-todd-howard-not-hate-obsidian-it-was-his-only-choice-to-take-up-fallouts-reins-in-the-wake-of-fallout-3/">in January of 2026,</a> Howard reiterated that Obsidian was “the only choice” for <em>New Vegas</em>. It was also revealed that the only mandate Bethesda put on the game was that it needed to include factions.</p> <p>Even after reading through all of this, I imagine there will still be people who will keep believing that Howard and Bethesda despise <em>New Vegas</em> or are jealous of its success.</p>

 <p>The thing is, I get why so many people will keep repeating this rumor. It is a very compelling story. Bethesda works really hard on <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>, spending years and years on each entry, but it’s Obsidian’s scrappy <em>New Vegas,</em> made in just 18 months, that has gone on to be the fan favorite. There is something almost David and Goliath about it. But just like that story, the idea that Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> is a myth.</p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-doesnt-hate-fallout-new-vegas-season-2-canon-rumors-true-2000657238]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Larian Studios, the team behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>and the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><i><span>Divinity</span></i></a><span>, is holding a Reddit AMA right now in which it talks about everything from its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429"><span>highly publicized use of genAI</span></a><span> to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-switch-2-port-reddit-ama-2000658454"><span>likely-dead dream of a Switch 2 port</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. It is also talking about lessons it’s learned in its 30 years, and one thing it took away from </span><i><span>BG3 </span></i><span>is clear: Companions should ease into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-shadowheart-gale-1850771533"><span>being horny</span></a><span> rather than professing their love for you very quickly.</span></p> <p><span>In the AMA, senior writer Kevin VanOrd responded to a question about what Larian would like to improve on, and he gave two encouraging answers: companions having deeper, more complex relationships with each other, and a much slower lead-in to romantic relationships than in previous games.</span></p> <p><span>“Companion relationships,” he wrote. “Firstly, to have more interaction between companions – not just with more and better banter, but to have them develop deeper relationships with each other, just as they do with players. Secondly, to ramp up player friendship and romance more subtly, so relationship building feels natural.”</span></p> <p><span>Putting aside the horny ramp for a second, the distinction VanOrd makes between deeper companion relationships and more banter is an important one. I’ve been replaying </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, and one thing BioWare really cooked with in that game is that your party is very clearly establishing their own relationships and dynamics with each other, regardless of your input and presence. Some of those result in romantic relationships, others solidify platonic ones with shared interests that go beyond the ambient dialogue you’ll hear running through the world.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I just stumbled upon an early cutscene of the detective Neve and the elven archeologist Bellara bonding over their shared love of detective stories, and </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>could have definitely used more moments like that to help dispel the feeling that party members are living on islands and largely separate from each other. Shadowheart and Lae’zel were better about this than most pairings in </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, as their violent rivalry became mutual respect, so Larian’s definitely got it in them.</span></p> <p><span>That horny ramp-up, though; I’m sure anyone who felt like Gale or Halsin were too forward in </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> will be glad to know Larian wants to rectify this in </span><i><span>Divinity</span></i><span>. The studio has since said that characters’ quick confessions of love were initially a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-d-d-companions-relationship-horny-bug-1850801750"><span>glitch in the game’s approval system</span></a><span>, but even after a patch, it hasn’t stopped folks from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-party-gale-wyll-1850729525"><span>associating </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>with its horned-up camp crew</span></a><span>. The RPG’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-sex-scene-romance-intimacy-halsin-gale-1850865892"><span>high-production sex scenes</span></a><span> have solidified it as one of the more mainstream “horny” games on the market, so it’s good to know Larian is cognizant of the criticism and wants to address it in future games.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[15 Things We Just Learned About Divinity]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-rpg-larian-bg3-loot-coop-2000658437</link>
            <guid>1401754</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New information continues to trickle out about Larian Studios’ next RPG thanks to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">January AMA</a> held with some of the development team’s leads on Reddit. The game is in full production and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> maker is exploring timing around when to show off the first snippets of actual gameplay. In the meantime, we have plenty of morsels to chew on from the latest Q&amp;A, including comments on co-op, companion romances, and a possible Switch 2 port. Here’s everything new we just learned <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105">about <em>Divinity</em></a>.</p> <h2>Hand-crafted loot could return</h2> <p>Loot in<em> Divinity: Original Sin 1</em> and <em>2</em> was random, but Larian wants to do something more like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> for<em> Divinity</em>. “The <em>BG3</em> approach of handcrafting every magic item worked well, and it’s something we’ve always wanted to do for&nbsp;<em>DOS2</em>,” head of design Nick Pechenin wrote. “Something we realized when working on randomized loot for <em>DOS1</em> and <em>DOS2</em> is that fully random loot is frequently confusing, so we added more and more rules and premade patterns to make it feel more intentional. In the end randomization did not save us much time.”</p>

 <h2>It’ll be made in the same engine as <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></h2> <p>Larian will continue iterating on its existing Divinity Engine for the next game. It’s not suddenly moving to Unreal like some other RPG studios.</p> <h2>Native keyboard movement controls?</h2> <p>Head of gameplay Artem Titov simply wrote “no.”</p> <h2>Of course <em>Divinity</em> will be co-op</h2> <p>Following in the footsteps of previous games, the next RPG will also be multiplayer at release. “The amount of players playing together will be depending on the final party size,” wrote scripting director Bert Stevens. “But since modding is planned for this project as well, player[s] will be essentially free to extend this. There is no hard limit to the amount of coop players.”</p>

 <h2>The goal with gameplay is to “embrace the chaos”</h2> <p>For players who love doing quests out of order and blazing their own path through a game, <em>Divinity</em> will continue Larian’s reputation for accommodating the weirdest player idiosyncrasies. “The first thing we tend to do when playtesting our own situations is run them out of sequence, break them in every conceivable way, and see how far we can push the boundaries of what’s possible,” wrote writing director Adam Smith. “The greatest joy I get is seeing somebody go so far off the beaten path that they assume we’ll have lost track of them, and then they stumble across something that we put there just for them.”</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em> might have swimming?</h2> <p>One fan asked Larian which new <em>Divinity</em> mechanic it was most proud of and Pechenin gave a cryptic answer. “There was something that bothered me when I explored the starting areas of <em>DOS1</em>, <em>DOS2</em> and<em> BG3</em>,” he wrote. “It stares you right in the face if you think about it. In <em>Divinity</em> I can finally do the thing I wanted to do in every previous game.” Considering all three games start near a beach, some players think he’s talking about finally being able to hop into the water.</p>

 <h2>It’s ditching the magic armor system</h2> <p><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> introduced a new mechanic to the series by which armor for physical and magic damage were separate. That will, thank god, not be returning in <em>Divinity</em>. “There will be ways to protect your characters from harm, but you will not have to wait before you can use your fun skill on enemies,” Pechenin wrote. “We are still cooking a system that makes sure that you have to work harder to stunlock solo bosses with level 1 skills, but it won’t be tied to damage.”</p>

 <h2>What about the tone?</h2> <p>The debut cinematic trailer was extremely grim and R-rated. Will the rest of the game follow in that vein? According to Smith,<em> Divinity</em> definitely aims to be more “grounded” and embrace some “folk horror vibes,” but will also still have plenty of humor, tragedy, and other emotional beats. “I laughed out loud reviewing a dialogue this morning!” he wrote. “I mentioned in the answer to another question that a game this size needs lots of tonal diversity.”</p>

 <h2>How will the camera work in&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>?</h2> <p>“The camera will work very similar as in <em>BG3</em>,” Stevens confirmed. “So a hybrid of top-down and 3rd person camera!”</p> <h2>Will<em> Divinity</em> finally let you look up at the sky?</h2> <p>Probably not. “There is no real engine limitation to allow looking at the sky,” Stevens wrote. “How the camera works is entirely a design choice. Alternative camera angles are always considered. If they benefit the game, we will for sure add it.”</p> <h2><em>Divinity</em> is a standalone story rather than a direct sequel to <em>Original Sin 2</em></h2> <p>While <em>Original Sin 2</em> retconned some of the series’ previous lore, the new game will take place in that world but tell a separate story. “It’s in the same continuity, but it’s a standalone story,” Smith confirmed. “Long-term <em>Divinity</em> fans will find lots of familiar things but it’s never just fanservice – it has to serve the story we’re telling.”</p>

 <h2>Companions will have deeper relationships with each other this time around</h2> <p><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was great at deep relationships between the player and their party, but less so between the individual companions. More interesting relationships between party members is a priority for <em>Divinity</em>. Senior writer Kevin VanOrd wrote that the team wants “to have more interaction between companions – not just with more and better banter, but to have them develop deeper relationships with each other, just as they do with players.”</p> <h2>And be less aggressively horny…</h2> <p>He wrote that the other main goal with the companion writing this time around is “to ramp up player friendship and romance more subtly, so relationship building feels natural.”</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em> on Switch 2 is being considered but not promised</h2> <p>“We love the platform and we will certainly consider Switch 2 for the next <em>Divinity</em> game,” Stevens wrote.</p> <h2>Lizard romance?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylpp1p/">Confirmed</a>.</p>
