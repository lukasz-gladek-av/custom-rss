              <p>There’s a new reason to revisit <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, <em>Euro Truck Simulator</em> 2 gets ported after 13 years, and I don’t need another <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617"><em>Balatro</em>-like in my life,</a> but I might make an exception for fellow dopamine drip machine <em>Raccoin</em>. Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s round-up of gaming news and cultural discourse. Also, ongoing updates on the fate of D.C.’s most infamous sandwich slinger. A 20-person goon squad was sent to his home last Friday <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-goons-sent-swat-team-to-bust-the-dc-hoagie-hurler/">to re-arrest the guy</a>, but murals memorializing the moment <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ianlivingston.bsky.social/post/3lwmpmzwl322h">will be harder to detain</a>.</p> <h2><em>Raccoin</em> is a coin pusher for roguelike deckbuilder freaks</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="RACCOIN: Coin Pusher Roguelike | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy1FcT6sfIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Playstack’s next game is about watching coins fall off a ramp as you use special items and tricks to generate giant, super-satisfying combos. It’s certainly being presented as <em>Balatro</em> for coin-pushers, complete with a nice, quirky arcade cabinet art style. You select different characters with unique advantages and unlock special coins you can deploy to rack up bonuses. There’s a physics simulation element and lots of jingling.</p> <p>The developer is Doraccoon, and this appears to be their first game. If you’ve ever wandered by someone hunched over a coin pusher in the wild with a zombie look in their eyes and shook your head in dismay, well, hey, that could be you when<em> Raccoin</em> launches. There’s no release date yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/">a free playtest on Steam is live starting August 18</a>.</p>

 <h2>Keeping <em>Anthem</em> online forever might have made it a worse game</h2> <p>Ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah recently mused about<em> Anthem</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136">servers shutting down next year</a> in light of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-killing-games-break-switch-2-cart-size-ign-layoffs-pilotwings-music-2000614692">Stop Killing Games movement</a>. Had it been designed to stay online forever, “it would have been an uglier game, probably would have had more latency issues,” he recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>. “It would have been a worse experience second-to-second in order to get something that basically wouldn’t need to ever be sunset.”</p> <p>But he also added that those tradeoffs might be worth it in the long run. “I think maybe it is that we want to be in a world where we’re willing to sacrifice some fidelity, sacrifice some things in order to get it so that games don’t just vanish one day.”</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 2042</em> gets a big surprise update called “<em>Road to&nbsp;<span>Battlefield</span> 6</em>“</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Road to Battlefield 6: Iwo Jima" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Xq0BbFJ0DU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>EA’s last beleaguered multiplayer shooter is being repurposed into a bridge to the future. A new update that goes live today adds a new free pass full of unlockable nods to the franchise’s past as well as new rewards for <em>Battlefield 6</em>. A version of the Iwo Jima map is also returning, alongside other new content. Fans are grudgingly on board. “<span dir="auto" role="text">Okay <em>2042</em>, ill bite one last time,” wrote one YouTube commenter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em> is coming to console</h2> <p>A PlayStation store listing for the hit highway-and-chill series <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroTruck2/comments/1mthopc/ets2_is_coming_to_ps5/">leaked over the weekend</a>. The PS5 version is arriving <a href="https://truck-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2_Version_history">over a decade</a> after the game came out, though regular updates have continued adding new vehicles and fleshing out the sprawling continental road map.</p> <h2>There’s an enhanced version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/shenmue-3-the-kotaku-review-1840175041"><em>Shenmue III</em></a> on the way</h2> <p><em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em> will have more NPCs in the streets, better graphics, menu and gameplay fixes, and a new camera mode inspired by the original two games. It also brings the game to Xbox and Switch 2, with an upgrade path for those who already own it on PC and PS4.</p>

 <h2><em>The Last Of Us</em> <em>Online</em> game director teases new multiplayer project</h2> <p>Vinit Agarwal left Naughty Dog <a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-last-us-online-vinit-agarwal-1851785806">earlier this year</a> to set up a new game studio in Japan. He recently shed more light on what fans can expect from the studio’s new project, whose team also includes fellow <em>Last of Us Online</em> lead Joe Pettinati. “A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer,” he <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">told GameSpark</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/"><em>VGC</em></a>). He said it’s a triple-I multiplayer game that’s still just a few months into production.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087">Pokémon scalpers continue to run amok, including at the world championships</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-jimmy-cat-plush-jimmymeow-plushshop-2000618052">Fans are trying to cancel a <em>Mouthwashing</em> plushie&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-brainrot-grow-a-garden-hellscape-2000618002"><strong>The State Of Louisiana is suing <em>Roblox</em> over accusations it’s a “breeding ground for sexual predators”</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Championship Sunday | 2025 Pokémon World Championships" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKQj7KkKzD0?start=34640&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>See what made the highest level of competitive Pokémon tick at the World Championships finals last night.

              <p><span>This weekend, the 2025 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>Pokémon World Championships</span></a><span> were held in Anaheim. Most of the event was dedicated to the franchise’s multiple competitive scenes across video games, the card game, and fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>fighting scalpers for exclusive merchandise</span></a><span>, but the tournament’s closing ceremony also included some new announcements you might’ve missed if you didn’t stay up late to catch the livestream. If you missed the mini-Pokémon Presents showcase, here’s everything The Pokémon Company announced:</span></p>  <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eternatus Emerges | Pokémon GO" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xN0zU-uMCs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Kicking things off was a quick trailer for </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>. Eternatus, one of the legendary Pokémon from the Galar region, is the centerpiece of Pokémon Go Fest 2025’s Max Finale, taking place on August 23 and 24. Players at Worlds were able to get Eternatus early, as if those of us who couldn’t make it to Anaheim needed more reasons to feel FOMO.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Mega Evolution is coming this fall!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vS2fnu49pw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Next up is </span><i><span>Pokémon TCG Pocket</span></i><span>, which is getting new Mega Evolution cards later this fall. Mega versions of Altaria, Gyarados, and Blaziken will all be featured in the set coming to the mobile app’s new season.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Pokémon Unite</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New Pokémon are on the way! | Pokémon UNITE" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEQXlI_Sfmo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Three new playable characters were announced for MOBA </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>. First up, Sinnoh water starter Emploeon will join the roster on September 19, followed by Dhelmise, who has a grappler kit that lets it latch onto enemies and get in close. Vaporeon will come sometime after, bringing Unite’s Eeveelution count to six. All that’s left are Jolteon and Flareon, then all the current versions of Eevee’s evolution line will have joined the roster.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Trading Card Game</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Worlds | TCG | New Mega Evolution Pokémon ex Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uj-A1J_rf0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Outside of the mobile app, the regular </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TCG is also featuring Mega Evolutions pretty heavily next year. TPC showed off new ex cards for Mega Charizard X, Mega Gaurdivoir, and Mega Lucario, each of which has a really eye-catching manga-inspired art style. Mega Dragonite is also getting its first card, though the one shown wasn’t a full-art one like the others.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Enjoy Pokémon Battles Like Never Before in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Fans were expecting a multiplayer mode in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after Nintendo </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158"><span>let it slip that</span></a><span> the RPG would have some sort of “link play,” but the mode Game Freak announced at Worlds is a bit different from what people have been anticipating. The game will feature a four-player multiplayer mode in which players pit their parties against one another and earn points for each Pokémon they defeat within the three-minute time limit. According to </span><a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/battle-with-trainers"><span>the game’s official website</span></a><span>, these matches can be played casually with friends or in a ranked mode.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Pokémon Champions</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Champions at Worlds 2026!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDOstmYXLVs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>The last video game announcement of the closing ceremony was that </span><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i><span>, the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-champions-legends-z-a-presents-day-stream-1851766818"><span>competitive-focused game for Switch and mobile</span></a><span>, will be the primary game for the Pokémon World Championship tournament in 2026.&nbsp; Mega Evolution will be featured as part of the first set of regulations for ranked battles, so competitors, plan your teams accordingly.</span></p> <h2><b>Pokémon XP</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PokémonXP &amp; Pokémon World Championships | 2026" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Q8Vr4b7wHE?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>The last announcement was about Pokémon World Championships 2026. The tournament is set to take place at the Chase Center in San Francisco next year, but The Pokémon Company is also setting up a new “fan experience” called Pokémon XP in the city during the same weekend, August 28 to 30. Tickets go on sale on September 17. The teaser trailer was light on details, but the official Pokémon website says XP will feature “panels, unique workshops, special guests, exclusive merchandise, and so much more.”</span></p>
