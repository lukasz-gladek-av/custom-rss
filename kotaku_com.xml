              <p><span>Today, </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> is four years old, and that makes me very sad. An announcement shared today from the official </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> account on X was meant to be celebratory, but I found it depressing. How can you feel optimistic about </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> in 2025?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Four years of Infinite memories, Infinite friendships, Infinite fun 🎂</p> <p>Happy birthday, Halo Infinite! 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/7gxwl6ZVhH">pic.twitter.com/7gxwl6ZVhH</a></p> <p>— Halo (@Halo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Halo/status/1998044899262746815?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> is the most recent entry in the iconic Xbox franchise, and it was predictably hyped up before launch. Its open-world campaign offered a unique take on the franchise formula and seemed poised to crack open the </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> universe, with plans for it to be the central hub of new </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>content for years after its launch. But as its release date crept closer, the sixth mainline entry in the Master Chief saga strained under the pressure. A 2020 gameplay reveal </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinites-campaign-finally-re-revealed-and-its-lo-1847927849"><span>unintentionally created a meme factory,</span></a><span> and a month later, </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> was delayed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Halo Infinite </span></i><span>finally launched in December 2021 (though the multiplayer released a few weeks earlier), and did so without split-screen co-op and Forge, the series’ map creation suite. Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) never added the additional story content we were promised—instead, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1kzbpda/the_next_master_chief_novel_halo_edge_of_dawn/"><span>it’ll be neatly tied up in a book releasing next week</span></a><span>. I held out hope that </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span> would eventually become the massive Master Chief universe we were promised, but it never did.</span></p>

 <p><span>Just last month, it was announced that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-no-more-updates-operation-halo-studios-xbox-2000642195"><span>studio would cease development</span></a><span> on the sci-fi shooter, shortly after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, a ground-up remake of the original game’s campaign</span></a><span>, was revealed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though there are, reportedly, other </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> games in development at Halo Studios, the current state of the franchise is a massive bummer. </span><i><span>Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, due out next year, may bring </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> to PS5 for the first time, and it may look damn good, but we all know it’s just a nostalgia retread of a 25-year-old game. It won’t include multiplayer, just the first game’s campaign and a few new missions. It will offer four-person co-op for the first time ever. But aside from </span><i><span>Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, there’s no news on what to expect next from Halo Studios.</span></p>

 <p><span>So we return to </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>, the most recent game in the franchise. Sadly, </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s open-world campaign is not worth a revisit, especially without couch co-op or a continuation of Master Chief’s story (</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/microsoft-studio-343-industries-undergoing-reorganization-of-halo-game-franchise"><span>the story DLC was confirmed canned back in 2023</span></a><span>). </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s multiplayer has that </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> special sauce—it feels great and can be a chaotic blast, but there just aren’t that many people playing anymore. So if you’re like me and only play a handful of modes, you’ll quickly find yourself stuck in a loop: the same few maps, the same few players. You can only get sniped across one of a few Big Team Battle maps by EliteLover6969 so many times before it grows old.</span></p>

 <p><span>Plus, Xbox’s recent refusal to condemn the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><span>White House’s use of </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> imagery</span></a><span> in its spate of racist propaganda further sours the taste in my mouth.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> is the franchise that shifted my gaming world, taking me from a casual gamer playing at her cousin’s house to a young woman buying an Xbox 360 and </span><i><span>Halo 3</span></i><span> on launch day so I could continue the story on my own. I hope it can find its footing once more, but on the fourth anniversary of </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span>, I’m mourning what could have been rather than celebrating what we got.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> the latest main entry in Nintendo’s <em>Metroid</em> franchise, is finally here after nearly a decade of waiting. Now available on Switch and Switch 2,<em> Prime 4</em> might not be the best game in the series, but it offers up plenty of great levels to explore and aliens to shoot. But before you hop into this new adventure, we have some tips to help you save the day.</p> <h2>Make sure you smash plenty of green crystals!</h2> <p>While exploring the Sol Valley desert in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4,</em></a> you’ll spot lots of green crystals. These can be smashed with your motorcycle and collected. The game tells you to do this, and you really, really should. Not only do you get some upgrades when you bring these crystals back to your base camp, but you’ll hopefully not have to grind much later to finish <em>Prime 4</em> if you collect gems now. You need a lot before the game lets you start the final mission, and I didn’t have enough, so I had to drive around for like 30 minutes collecting more. Don’t be like me! Smash those crystals whenever you see them.</p>

 <h2>Change the morph ball jump button ASAP</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000651425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651425"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651425">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For some strange reason (and it was like this in <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> as well)<em>&nbsp;Prime 4</em> includes two different jump buttons when you first boot it up: One for Samus in her standard human form and one for when you are in her Morph Ball form. Thankfully, after digging through some menus, you can change this to one button and I recommend doing that as soon as the game allows. <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021">Here’s a quick, handy guide on how to do that!</a></p>

 <h2>Mash the A button to (possibly) skip cutscenes</h2> <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> includes some fantastic cutscenes. It also contains a lot of filler-y cutscenes that you’ll see over and over again as Samus transitions to different areas. Thankfully, you can skip these. You do have to wait for the game to finish loading before you can skip these, and it doesn’t tell you when that happens. On Switch 2 at least, I found load times to be fast and got into a habit of mashing the A button during transitional cutscenes so I could end them the moment loading wrapped up.</p>

 <h2>Scan stuff and then scan more stuff!</h2> <p>This is a <em>Metroid Prime</em> game, so I probably don’t need to tell most people to scan items and enemies, but in case this is your first rodeo: Scan everything. Often, these scans can reveal clues as to how a door is open or a puzzle completed. Some enemies even contain info on how to defeat them faster.</p>

 <h2>When stuck, try everything</h2> <p><em>Prime 4</em> does a pretty good job of not making its puzzles too obtuse. But there were still moments where I was left scratching my head as to what to do next. When this happened, I would follow a very simple rule: Try everything, starting with the most recent ability I unlocked. Even if it seems silly to use a bomb or missile or charged blast or whatever on that lock or item, give it a shot. If you do this, you’ll likely find the solution in no time.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651426">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Freeze enemies</h2> <p>While you get access to multiple elemental blasts in<em> Prime 4,</em> my favorite ended up being the ice shot, as it freezes most enemies in place for a few seconds, which can help a lot when you get ambushed by tough aliens. It also makes flying enemies fall out of the sky, which can be very useful in some parts of <em>Prime 4</em>. Oh, and make sure you use the ice shot on fire-themed enemies to quickly take them out.</p> <h2>Mark stuff on your map</h2> <p>As you explore the various levels and the desert in <em>Prime 4</em>, you’ll likely encounter doors you can’t open or things you can’t interact with yet until you get a specific ability. These moments aren’t a waste of time, however, as<em> Prime 4</em> lets you mark these areas on your map using a few different icons. This can be very helpful when, hours later, you want to go back to that scout bot or locked door but don’t remember where it was.</p>
