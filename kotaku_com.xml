            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When, earlier this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> kicked off with the reveal of a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-first-five-minutes-of-bubsy-is-all-the-bubsy-we-nee-1749075286"><em>Bubsy</em></a> game, many online, myself included, went “Oh no…” as we shook our collective heads. But despite the last few <em>Bubsy</em> games being bad, it seems this new one,<em> Bubsy 4D</em>, might actually be…good? In fact, it might even be awesome. Really. Seriously.</p> <p>Back in the early ’90s, Bubsy starred in a handful of fairly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubsy#History">well-received 2D platformers</a>. But then in 1996, the <em>Bubsy</em> series made the leap to 3D, and everything went south. People hated <em>Bubsy 3D</em> and to this day, it is still called one of the worst platformers ever made. Then, in the last decade, we started getting new <em>Bubsy</em> games. They were also bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PecXsy5-0yw"><em>Really</em> bad.</a> But now, a few years after Atari bought the franchise, <em>Bubsy 4D</em> is here, and it just might turn things around for the hopping feline.</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is being made by <a href="https://www.fabraz.com/">Fabraz</a>, a renowned indie studio that has made a name for itself developing fun, innovative, and colorful 3D and 2D platformers that feel amazing to play, like <em>Demon Turf</em> and <em>Slime San</em>. And since announcing the game earlier this week at Gamescom, the studio has started releasing gameplay of <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, and it looks wonderful!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because a lot of people were curious: Here's me playing the same Bubsy 4D level without trying speedrun it. <a href="https://t.co/Xcm6mygpS8">pic.twitter.com/Xcm6mygpS8</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958646093031366982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In new gameplay shared from the Gamescom demo, we can see <em>Bubsy 4D</em> in action, and the game looks vibrant and slick. Movement and jumping look snappy, but there’s some weight to Bubsy, so it’s not too floaty. I’m also a fan of<a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958190420598366399"> Bubsy’s personality in the videos released so far, too</a>. Another wild fact about this new <em>Bubsy</em> game: It contains fully voiced, 3D animated cutscenes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun fact, Bubsy 4D has fully voiced cutscenes cus' why not! <a href="https://t.co/DrL6A75f9x">pic.twitter.com/DrL6A75f9x</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958456027675795909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I can’t believe I’m saying this in the year of our lord 2025, but I’m very excited about a <em>Bubsy</em> game. Everything I’ve seen of Fabraz’s<em> Bubsy 4D</em> looks incredible. And people who have played the demo at Gamescom seem positive about how it plays and feels, which is only making me more excited for this sequel. <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958916894548803679">There’s also an outfit that blurs Bubsy’s private parts</a> and is a reference to Sonic. <a href="https://x.com/Fat_Bard/status/1958938923507306765">Even the game’s music sounds great!</a> So yeah, I want to play<em> Bubsy 4D</em> right now. But I can’t. Which makes me very sad. Damn you, Bubsy!</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is set to launch on consoles and PC… eventually. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/">You can wishlist it now on Steam.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Peacemaker Season 2 Officially Removes Zack Snyder’s Justice League From The DCU]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-season-2-justice-league-gang-scene-reshoot-2000619550</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/peacemaker-season-2-officially-removes-zack-snyder%E2%80%99s-justice-league-from-the-dcu.1278486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>John Cena has a brief cameo in this summer’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212"><i><span>Superman</span></i></a><span> as Peacemaker, the foul-mouthed mercenary the wrestler-turned-actor has played since 2021’s </span><i><span>The Suicide Squad</span></i><span>. That movie was part of the old DC Comics shared universe (DCEU), so it seemed odd that Cena’s character would appear in James Gunn’s new take on Superman, considering he was, ostensibly, part of a different multiverse. Well, </span><i><span>Peacemaker</span></i><span>’s second season premiered last night, and through a reshot scene, has plucked the antihero from one universe into another without making a huge stink about it.</span></p> <p><span>In Peacemaker’s first season finale, Cena’s character met up with the Justice League from the previous film universe, including Jason Momoa’s Aquaman and Ezra Miller’s Flash. The rest of the team was mostly obscured in shadows and only seen as silhouettes, but Momoa and Miller’s presence makes it clear they’re likely accompanied by Henry Cavill’s version of Superman, who portrayed the superhero from 2013 to 2023. This ties Peacemaker to the old continuity, which again complicates Cena’s appearance in </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Season two’s premiere episode, “The Ties That Grind,” addresses this with an opening sequence called “Previously in the DCU,” which recaps the previous season with one major change. Rather than calling the Justice League for help as he did in the finale, this section is reshot and redubbed to instead show the Justice Gang featured in </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span> arriving on the scene. Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced reprise their roles as Guy Gardner and Hawkgirl, while silhouettes of Superman, Supergirl, and Mister Terrific are also shown but obscured in shadow, like in the original scene.</span></p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Peacemaker Season 2 Replaces Justice League With Justice Gang!" width="422" height="750" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAoxS56AJw4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>In a roundtable interview with outlets like </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peacemaker-season-2-how-james-gunns-dcu-addresses-that-season-1-justice-league-cameo"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, Gunn said that while fans might have expected a more convoluted multiversal explanation that pulled Peacemaker from one continuity to another, the director said he’d rather go with a simple approach.</span></p> <p><span>“Could I make it so that Peacemaker is the DCEU Peacemaker, even though he’s not really the DCEU Peacemaker, and he walks through that portal, and that’s where the DCEU Peacemaker is?” Gunn said. “I could have, but people are like, ‘How are normies going to understand it?’ And no, the answer is, normies don’t give a shit. Normies don’t care about all this canon stuff so intimately.”</span></p> <p><span>“It doesn’t matter if it’s not completely consistent in the past. So I thought the simple way was really the best, which is just saying, yeah, this world is a little different. We know there’s universes, and this is the universe in which everything was exactly the same as Season 1, except for the Justice League.”</span></p> <p><span>Some fans might be annoyed at the handwavey nature of this change, but it’s probably a good thing </span><i><span>Peacemaker </span></i><span>didn’t have to spend a whole episode throwing its hero through the multiverse to justify him showing up in future projects. Now it can just get back to what it actually wants to do rather than wasting all those precious, costly minutes of runtime, not to mention the precious time of us viewers. New episodes of </span><i><span>Peacemaker </span></i><span>premiere on HBO Max on Thursday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern.</span></p>

              <p>The first thing you think about when you hear the word “Pokémon” is probably bright, colorful cartoon characters. A bright yellow Pikachu and a cuddly blue-and-white Snorlax, merrily playing on green grass under a clear blue sky. Even a fire-breathing Charizard is a cheerful orange and would probably give you a hug. So it’s a wonderful peculiarity of the franchise that various games and spin-offs have received some of the creepiest, spookiest horror movie-like trailers and ads we’ve ever seen. Following yesterday’s deeply creepy trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>we’ve compiled the most unsettling Pokémon commercials from the last few years.</p> <p>You don’t really have to scratch very deep into Pokémon lore to find the weirdness. In fact, given it’s a game series about capturing wild animals and forcing them to fight, so you don’t even have to scratch at all. But take a look at any Pokédex and you’ll quickly <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634">find descriptions that’d have any child concerned about going to sleep at night</a>, and hell, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-top-10-worst-bruxish-mr-rime-1851606325">plenty of the Pokémon themselves are self-contained nightmares</a>. With Ghost Type and Poison Type Pokémon a routine part of the games and anime, there’s always a background element of outright strangeness that underscores so many of these gorgeous games. Which is perhaps what The Pokémon Company is tapping into when it so frequently puts out full-on unsettling, even disturbing promotional material.</p> <p>A lot of these commercials appeared in 2022, ahead of the launch of <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, but there were super-strange “found footage” creations for <em>Pokémon GO</em> as well. And clearly TPCi is still fond of the idea, given the reprisal of the horror-like approach for its latest commercial for&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, which both apes Japanese horror games like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil </em>and&nbsp;also <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ghost-girl-x-y-mega-victreebel-2000619524">hides creepy easter eggs for ghostly legends</a> from <em>Pokémon</em>‘s past. We’re really hoping to see a whole bunch more of these in the future, either in the run-up to <em>Z-A</em>‘s October release, or as the new Gen X Pokémon are finally revealed for the next mainline entry.</p>

 <h2>Zorua doesn’t care that a guy just died</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/official-trailer-asks-what-if-pokemon-legends-arceus-1847891305">So we begin in October 2021</a>, and the build up to <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, with what I still think is the most effectively disturbing effort yet. Completely out of nowhere, the official Pokémon YouTube channel posted the following:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Rare footage of the Hisui region discovered! | Pokémon Legends: Arceus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayJvMf--68Q?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I just cannot celebrate this extraordinary trailer enough. It would have been so easy to go so much less hard, to offer many more clear shots of the snowy landscape, even give us more than a split-second glimpse of those two Snorunt, and then offer some scratchy images of the mysterious Pokémon in question. But someone was brave enough to say “No.” This is full-on VHS artifacting, barely discernible, and as a result so, so much more creepy. And, well, it sure sounds like the guy gets killed at the end.</p> <p>The next day, all was revealed. The <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1451171423607795716">ever-reliable Professor Oak was able to clear up the footage considerably</a>, producing the following:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mysterious footage restored! | Pokémon Legends: Arceus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEb9gbJUUeA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>And it gets better! This could so easily have been a goof, a reveal that actually it was all fine, just made to look spooky because we couldn’t see. In fact, for a while it looks like that’s what we’re getting, with the jolly Snorunt gallivanting in the snow. Perhaps the scream at the end was just him tripping over or something? But no! After Prof. Oak removed the VHS effects layer in Premiere, this second version is somehow more disturbing than the first. Sure, we get the lovely reveal of the brand new Hisuan Zorua and Zoroark, but then the final punch of…who knows what that was?! A giant, terrifying smoke monster, lost from&nbsp;<em>Lost</em>? And he’s definitely still dead. Which makes the cold, uninterested way the Zorua and Zoroark just turn and walk away all the more disturbing.</p> <h2>Ultra Beasts are straight-up threatening humanity</h2> <p>A year later, in August 2022, <em>Pokémon GO</em> is about to add Ultra Beasts to the game for the first time. To accompany these, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR">the official&nbsp;<em>POGO</em> YouTube channel</a> begins uploading TikTok-style 20 second videos that seem part found footage, part fever dream. They’re stunningly well made, and so very effective for—appropriately—showing Pokémon appearing in the real world. The first five were compiled here:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="*CONFIDENTIAL* REPORT: Ultra Beast Sightings" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zr966xaQywg?list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR"></iframe></p> <p>By far the best is the Xurkitree. It’s just so utterly frightening, the way it’s clinging to the outside of the building, the guy’s fear, and the creature’s very obviously harmful intent. But I also absolutely adore the reveal in that final Nihilego clip, when you see it’s not just one inquisitive creature, but some sort of mass invasion. (The Buzzwole one is so poor I kind of hate it for being included.) Then later came <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwFD034UDAc&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=9">so many more</a>, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MO0C8Hhs3M&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=6">this terrified panic</a> as a Guzzlord breaks through a portal above a busy Japanese street. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1rpuYsEot0&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=14">check out the arrival of a massive Celesteela in Australia</a>, causing awe and fear. (And crucially, they’re all better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-niantic-nintendo-pheromosa-tiktok-dtf-1849477754">the weird-ass TikTok ad that was about a guy trying to sleep with a Pheromosa</a>.)</p> <h2>The cute little doggy that plays with you to death</h2> <p>OK, let’s jump forward just one month to October 2022, with Pokémon in full swing revealing more and more new entries in the Gen IX Pokédex. And once again, we have people screaming and disappearing at the end of the clips. It started with a 15-second video called “Ghost-type Pokémon in Paldea?!”</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost-type Pokémon in Paldea?! #PokemonScarletViolet" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTDRBA4sqPw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>That bait-and-switch with the glimpse of the Gengar and the purple bush is *chef’s kiss*, made all the better for the delicious grin on the mean ol’ ghosty’s face when he properly freaks her out. Once again, more was revealed a day later. This time our brave filmographer has returned to the scene at night, initially spooked as a delightful Mimikyu darts across the path, before then being an awful lot braver in the face of the cheeky Gengar. But there’s something else she’s interested in: a strange purple light on the ground. Suddenly, the creature leaps out from the earth! And it’s a gorgeous little doggy with a purple candle on its back. Yay! Nothing can go wrong, and surely no one’s going to die this time.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="[UK] A new Ghost-type Pokémon appeared in Paldea!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SjpZuQmjGg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Nope, she’s dead. We know this because it turned out the Greavard, as described <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Greavard_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">in the Pokédex</a>, “gradually drains the life energy of those close to it.” But in case you thought this was malevolent, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634/15">its <em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>dex entry reads</a>,</p>

 <p>“It is said that a dog Pokémon that died in the wild without ever interacting with a human was reborn as this Pokémon.”</p> <h2>The jar of matcha that just murders a bunch of children</h2> <p>Another year forward, into August 2023, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-poltchageist-dlc-new-1850761666">there’s a surprise new short film</a> added to the official channel to explain the backstory of Sinistea’s new evolutionary form introduced in&nbsp;<em>Scarlet</em> and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s DLC, Poltchageist.</p> <p>We already knew that Sinistea had a fairly messed-up existence. It’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634/8">literally “the soul of someone who died alone” trapped in a cup of tea</a>, and it’ll do you no good to drink it.&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s Pokédex explains,</p> <p>“Sinistea gets into your body when you drink it, and then it steals your vitality from within. It also tastes awful.”</p>

 <p>Yum! So what about the evolved form? Well, gather around children.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Haunting Tale of Poltchageist" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMWrwe9fJJk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I adore how tonally all over the place this is. It’s an old man telling a story to a group of very young children, that’s then immediately about a guy dying miserable and alone, before going on to talk about a Pokémon that both fixes cracks and poisons people and drains the life from their bodies as an act of revenge. That’s a messed-up thing to tell a bunch of children! But then, the storyteller’s chipped mug is restored, just like in the story! Ah, you think, he’s playing a fun prank on the children, giving them a little spooky scare. But no. No, it’s not that. Is it that Poltchageist has poisoned them all, and now is going to kill them? They sure don’t look very well. But then our friendly little cartoon killer swings by the camera, gives us a wink, and we circle in on him, Looney Tunes-style. The end! Utterly extraordinary.</p> <h2>Spinarak delivers an epic jumpscare</h2> <p>And that brings us up-to-date, and to yesterday’s <em>Legends Z-A</em> trailer. Aping games like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, the footage ostensibly created to reveal the existence of a Mega Evolved form of Victreebel contains some splendid scares, including an epic jumpscare from that cutest of beasties, Spinarak.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Given the context of the above examples, it’s definitely a big shame this one ends with a “wakka wakka!” explanation of the situation, denuding it of impact. But that’s not before that splendid little burst of frantic freakery in the middle, and that’s valuable.</p> <p>However, it all took on an even spookier tone when we noticed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ghost-girl-x-y-mega-victreebel-2000619524">the ghost girl staring through the window</a>!</p> <p>Please, Pokémon, keep this sort of stuff coming. We&nbsp;<em>love</em> it. Hopefully there’s something super-spoopy lined up for this October, given that seems to bring out the best in them.</p>
