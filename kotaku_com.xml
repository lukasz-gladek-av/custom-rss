But it has now received a massive 1.0 update, left early access, and made its way to consoles, too. And on top of all that, this very good survival game is now available on Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, complete with crossplay.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196848" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Roguelite Is Giving Hades Meets Dead Cells" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="68" data-playlist="196848,196307,196163" data-current="196848"><div><p>This Roguelite Is Giving Hades Meets Dead Cells</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196848/196848_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196848/196848_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196848/196848_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196848/196848_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22408.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-deep-field-games-indie-survival-fps-1849644843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-deep-field-games-indie-survival-fps-1849644843">First announced in 2022, <em>Abiotic Factor</em></a></span> looks a lot like Valve’s classic ‘90s FPS <em>Half-Life.</em> And it is even set in a similar location: a secret underground research facility filled with nasty interdimensional aliens and deadly military goons. But unlike <em>Half-Life, Abiotic Factor</em> is a survival game like <em>Minecraft </em>or <em>Rust</em>. Here, though, instead of harvesting trees and rocks, you scrounge for pencils and paper, breaking open closets and desks for resources. It’s a very interesting spin on survival, forcing you to build armor out of plastic binders and garbage cans and set up camp in offices and bathrooms. And as you get deeper into the game, you discover alternative dimensions filled with new loot, resources, and dangerous, creepy monsters.</p><p>Here’s the game’s official description courtesy of the Xbox store: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos. Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way.</p><p>Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve been playing <em>Abitoitc Factor</em> on and off for about a year now since it came out, and I’m so excited to check it out on console with my group of friends. And the fact that it’s on both Game Pass and PS Plus Extra makes it super easy for me to convince them to give it a spin. You should try it as well! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/palworld-valheim-minecraft-punch-trees-survival-games-1851193458?_gl=1*use9eu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMyOTk5MjEkbzE4MyRnMSR0MTc1MzMwMDA3NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-valheim-minecraft-punch-trees-survival-games-1851193458?_gl=1*use9eu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMyOTk5MjEkbzE4MyRnMSR0MTc1MzMwMDA3NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">I’ve made it clear on this site that I don’t like all the tree-punching</a></span> and cave-living that most survival games involve, and that’s still true. But <em>Abiotic Factor</em>’s contemporary setting and <em>Half-Life</em> vibes really do make it feel different. </p><p>So even if you’re burned out on punching rocks and trees, give<em> Abiotic Factor </em>a go on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, or PC. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/minecraft-half-life-abiotic-factor-game-pass-ps5-1-0-pc-1851786836]]></content:encoded>

Naturally, poor performance for major titles has led many to wonder when we’ll get a fully fledged successor to the mini PC. While no such thing has been announced or should probably be expected any time soon, the rumor mill is spitting out some interesting fodder for speculation.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: December 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="359" data-playlist="196358,195410,196447" data-current="196358"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: December 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196358/196358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21905.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Valve has been clear that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-a-steam-deck-2-for-at-least-a-couple-of-years-valve-says&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-a-steam-deck-2-for-at-least-a-couple-of-years-valve-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we shouldn’t expect a so-called “Steam Deck 2</a></span>” until it feels there’s enough of a breakthrough in battery-powered processors to warrant a capital-U Upgrade, and in a recent episode of the podcast <em>Moore’s Law Is Dead</em> (ht <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-2-rumored-to-be-in-the-works-and-it-may-arrive-with-a-massive-amd-apu-upgrade&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-2-rumored-to-be-in-the-works-and-it-may-arrive-with-a-massive-amd-apu-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to <em>Tom’s Guide</em></a></span>), host Tom N/A and YouTuber Jimmy Champagne said that sources within Valve have told them that the company is sticking to that plan. In fact, the silicon that seems likely to power such a future device could put it on par with PS6 performance, or whatever the next Xbox is called (I’m hoping for NeXbox, personally).</p><p>The chip at the heart of all this speculation is the AMD “Magnus” APU, itself only rumored to exist for now. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/leaked-amd-magnus-apu-could-power-the-ps6-or-next-xbox-heres-what-weve-heard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/leaked-amd-magnus-apu-could-power-the-ps6-or-next-xbox-heres-what-weve-heard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighted by <em>Tom’s Guide</em> last week</a></span>, various internal code names and AMD leaks point to Magnus being a likely candidate for powering next-generation consoles, which the Steam Deck “2” might be aiming to compete more directly with. </p><p>This is good news for those hoping for future Steam Decks to deliver cutting-edge processing power. The rumored Magnus chip might not arrive for another year or two, so we’ll still have to bide our time with the Steam Deck OLED as Valve’s “flagship” handheld for a while. But when we do get that upgrade, it sure sounds like it’s aiming to wow our eyeballs out of our skulls.</p><h2 id="h794196"><a id=""></a>Should the Steam Deck be bigger, better, faster, soon?</h2><p>Please don’t burn me at the stake for being the somewhat luddite-adjacent witch that I am, but I’m content with what the Steam Deck delivers presently. I do not think we “need” a Steam Deck 2, even if <em>Avowed</em> looks like this:<br></p><figure id="" data-id="583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-recommend-id="image://583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-recommend-id="image://583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Personally, I’ve always rather enjoyed the Steam Deck as a pocket PS4 of sorts. It’s a machine I can use on the go to jump into some titles from the past that aren’t so old as to be something I’d fire up in RetroArch, but aren’t so new that I’m going to be left with 30 minutes worth of battery life after a single play session, either.</p><p>In other words, for now I’m okay with some experiences—<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and the like—not being at their absolute best on the handheld. I think it’s fine for there to be experiences that are better had on a PC or console that doesn’t need to offer a compromised version of the game in order to not devour all its battery life in minutes. Valve, I’ll wait for 2030 for a new Deck. My library is big enough and I’m patient.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2-amd-magnus-apu-ps6-xbox-1851786832]]></content:encoded>
