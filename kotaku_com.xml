              <p>For many people, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994">a steady level of performance</a>–no framerate dips or slowdown–is an important part of any video game. But what if it was <em>the most</em> important part of a game, such that if your performance tanked, you’d die? That’s the elevator pitch for <em>FPS Quest</em>, an upcoming first-person shooter that looks wild.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/yxewel3xAOQ"><em>FPS Quest</em></a> starts off as a fantasy RPG with skeletons and knights in armor. But after getting their ass kicked one too many times, the game’s protagonist installs some mods that them decidedly non-fantasy weapons like a pistol, an assault rifle, and a shotgun. The game within the game wasn’t built to handle these mods, however, so from there, things start to break, and<em> FPS Quest</em> becomes all about playing through a game that is falling apart while also trying to avoid a crash, which will kill you.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3989240/FPS_Quest/">The game’s Steam store page</a> describes what sounds like a roguelike shooter in which you go on different runs through “prebuilt but recombined levels” that get more corrupted and glitchy as you progress. To keep the game from crashing, you can do things like lower the in-game graphics, use in-game mods to remove geometry, and escape out of bounds into unfinished or leftover bits of the game world. It’s a trippy but cool idea for a game that has me very intrigued.</p> <p>One thing the game’s developers make clear on Steam is that <em>FPS Quest</em> doesn’t actually run at a lower framerate, which can cause problems and make people feel sick. Instead, it simulates playing a game at a low FPS. That’s good to know. <em>FPS Quest</em> doesn’t have a release date yet, but I’ve already added it to my wishlist and can’t wait to play.</p>

              <p>Today, MTV is a zombie network that primarily <a href="https://x.com/MTVSchedule/status/1465685976509030404/photo/1">airs episodes of </a><em><a href="https://x.com/MTVSchedule/status/1465685976509030404/photo/1">Ridiculousness</a>&nbsp;</em>and random Paramount-owned comedy films. It’s depressing. But before all that, before <em>The Real World</em> and <em>Road Rules</em>, MTV was a channel that mostly played music videos, and it was cool. So I was happy to hear that someone has created a free MTV simulator website, complete with retro ads.</p> <p>MTV Rewind is a website that tries to recreate the experience of watching the original music channel back in the day. When you first visit the site, it starts playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_music_videos_aired_on_MTV">original MTV broadcast</a>, complete with VJ introductions and the original music videos that were aired on that faithful day back in August 1981. I wasn’t alive back then, but it’s still fun to relive that launch from the comfort of my PC in 2025.</p>

  <p>Beyond recreating the first day, MTV Rewind features different decades you can swap between, built up of playlists featuring thousands of videos, as well as random, old TV ads from back in the day. And I have to admit, there is something special and comforting about returning to an era in which music was delivered to me without me having to create playlists, seek out artists, or hear the stuff that some algorithm decides I want to listen to next. Just a hose of old music videos streamed directly into my ears. Cool shit.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/1q5e7n1/comment/nxzbdgn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">The creator of MTV Rewind says</a> they built this project, which uses YouTube for all the videos, over the course of a week as a “passion project.” They shared on Reddit that they have “a deep nostalgia” for MTV and miss the 24/7 music videos. I’m happy they took the time to make this site. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lot of 1990s music to jam out to while I work.</p>

              <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><em>Stranger Things</em> season five finale</a> ends with a big fight involving the major players of the series, and according to the creators behind the hit Netflix show, how this large fight played out was inspired by <em>Baldur’s Gate 3.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Last week, on New Year’s Eve,<em> Stranger Things</em> wrapped up after nearly a decade with an epic two-hour finale. While some fans weren’t happy with the conclusion and are <a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704">even theorizing that a special bonus episode will be released soon,</a> the last episode of<em> Stranger Things</em> did deliver a big battle featuring Vecna, the Mind Flayer, and many of the characters people have grown to love over the last few years.</p> <p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/">In a new interview with <em>Variety</em></a>, the Duffer brothers, the duo behind the show and its finale, revealed that the big boss fight was inspired by playing<em> Baldur’s Gate 3.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“We were thinking about <em>D&amp;D,</em> and I was playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> [while creating the finale], and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together,” said Matt Duffer. “Everyone had fully realized—either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues—moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> and something like <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">Swen Vincke,</a> the head of the studio behind<em> Baldur’s Gate 3,</em> seemed pleased with this information, <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2008573846526529945">resharing it on Twitter</a> and saying, “That’s pretty cool.”</p> <p>While speaking to <em>Variety</em>, Matt Duffer also added that “lots of video game references were applied to that final battle,” but didn’t confirm anything specific. Also, it sounds like the Duffers are aware of your wild theories that the “true” finale is yet to be revealed and simply replied, “Obviously, that’s not a real thing.”</p>
