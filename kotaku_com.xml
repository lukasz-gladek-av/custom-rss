In those, Albus Dumbledore was played first by Richard Harris and later by Michael Gambon, both of whom have since passed away. A younger version of the character has also been played by Jude Law in the <em>Fantastic Beasts </em>prequels.</p><p>Now Lithgow will take the reins and give the stoic but compassionate magical genius his own spin, he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-show-john-lithgow-dumbledore-casting-confirmed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-show-john-lithgow-dumbledore-casting-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to <em>ScreenRant</em></a></span> this week. “Well, it came as a total surprise to me,” he said in an interview. “I just got the phone call up at the Sundance Film Festival for yet another film, and it was not an easy decision because it’s going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I’m afraid.

I’ll be about 87 years old at the wrap party, but I’ve said yes.”</p><p>HBO’s <em>Harry Potter</em> show hasn’t begun filming yet and isn’t expected to debut until late 2026 at the earliest. Francesca Gardiner, a writer on <em>His Dark Materials </em>and <em>Succession</em>, is signed on as showrunner, and a casting call to scout young actors to play Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and the rest of the students <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgwd7v8r17o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgwd7v8r17o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went out last fall</a></span>.
