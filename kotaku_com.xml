              <p>A <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> review published by long-standing UK gaming news site <em>Videogamer</em> has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-best-reviewed-main-entry-in-over-20-years-2000673626">removed from Metacritic</a> after readers pointed out it was written by a fake AI journalist who doesn’t actually exist. <em>Videogamer</em>‘s human masthead was gutted last week, sources tell <em>Kotaku</em>, and the site has been publishing apparent genAI slop ever since.</p> <p><span><em>Videogamer,</em> purchased BGFG a few years back and recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-escapist-esports-insider-clickout-media-layoffs-2000669743">sold to gambling seo spam agency Clickout</a>, gave <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> a 9/10 in its review this week. But readers pointed out that the writing “reeks [of] AI,” and its author, “experienced iGaming and sports betting analyst” Brian Merrygold, appeared to be a made-up person complete with an AI profile image.</span></p>

 <p><span>The review in question is full of clichés and generalities rather than specifics about the game and how it plays. Here’s an excerpt:</span></p> <blockquote><p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem is not just a victory lap for Capcom’s survival horror dynasty; it is a chainsaw-revving, blood-soaked testament to why we love getting scared stupid.</strong>&nbsp;It is the sort of finale that effectively grabs the franchise by the lapels, shakes it violently, and demands you acknowledge just how far it has come since the tank-control days of 1996. While other series limp toward their conclusions,&nbsp;<strong>RE9</strong>&nbsp;arrives with the confidence of a Tyrant smashing through a brick wall.</p> <p>It happens like clockwork with every major&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem leak, doesn’t it? We worry if the developers can balance the scales. After the southern gothic reinvention of&nbsp;<em>RE7</em>&nbsp;and the action-hero theatrics of the recent remakes, the franchise has been having something of an identity crisis. This game solves it by simply doing both.&nbsp;<strong>It bonds the trauma of Raccoon City with modern design sensibilities</strong>, proving there is plenty of life left in this undead horse. It frames the horror not just as a series of jump scares, but as a legacy that haunts its characters as much as it haunts our backlogs.</p></blockquote> <p><span>It was previously scraped and featured on Metacritic for its review score roundup on launch day. It raises concerns about quality controls for the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/metacritic-co-founder-marc-doyle-lifts-the-veil-on-how-the-site-works">main video game review aggregator</a> that fans consult before buying games and companies mention in their quarterly earnings reports when touting the success of recent releases.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's bleak. I was reading some RE Requiem reviews and found this thing published by videogamer. Can't find anything about the writer, everything about it reeks AI (dead giveaway being the image). Low effort, gargabe.</p> <p>Mind you, this review made its way to Metacritic. <a href="https://t.co/4STN8DjAwe">https://t.co/4STN8DjAwe</a> <a href="https://t.co/awk26P9wSA">pic.twitter.com/awk26P9wSA</a></p> <p>— Andrés (@Andrew_east) <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_east/status/2026919935641895380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“The <em>RE Requiem</em> review and a handful of other Videogamer reviews from 2026 have been removed from Metacritic,” site cofounder Marc Doyle told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email.</p>

 <p><span>As spotted by </span><i><span>Gfinity’s </span></i><span>Andrés Aquino in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/Andrew_east/status/2026919935641895380?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span>, everything about Brian Merrygold’s profile on Videogamer comes off as suspicious. The byline appears to have no prior online history and the profile image url is tiled </span><span> “ChatGPT-Image-Oct-20-2025-11_57_34-AM-300×300.png.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Several other authors on the site have similarly suspicious-looking AI-generated profile pictures that don’t mention they were generated by “ChatGPT” in their file names, suggesting this may have been a slip-up on by Videogamer site management as it pivots the outlet to completely AI-generated junk.&nbsp;</span><span>Other current bylines on the site include </span><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/author/shooter-orson/"><span>Shooter Orson</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/author/steven-danielson/"><span>Steven Danielson</span></a>. Like the <span>Merrygold account, all three had their X profiles created in October 2025.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000674047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674047"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674047">X</figcaption></figure> <p>Sources told <em>Kotaku</em> that Clickout began publishing AI-generated content under the casino and gambling portions of Videogamer around that time last fall, but it wasn’t until the staff was axed last week that AI content started being pushed out into the gaming news, reviews, and features sections as well. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhiki.bsky.social/post/3l7qicbpbza2n">Older human bylines</a> from the site’s 15 year history have been completely wiped out as well and overwritten with fake AI profiles.</p>

 <p><span>While it’s impossible to verify what content is or isn’t generated with AI with complete accuracy, multiple AI-checkers <em>Kotaku</em> used to verify the legitimacy of the </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> review sounded alarm bells. It wasn’t the only recent review to get picked up by Metacritic either. A Recent </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</span></i><span> review, which was published on <em>Videogamer</em> and subsequently featured on Metacritic on February 23, has also been removed from the aggregator’s roundup.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ethan Gach.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nvidia Promises ‘Very Tight’ Graphics Card Supply Won’t Improve Any Time Soon As Prices Spike]]></title>

              <p>GPU prices are out of control and all Nvidia can do is shrug its shoulders and count its billions. <em>IGN</em> continues downsizing after its big acquisition of sites in 2024. And casting has begun for <em>Wolfenstein 3</em>. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Say it with me now: “<a href="https://t.co/pdWIGN2YH7">Not everything is <em>Concord</em></a>.”</p> <h2>Nvidia soars as GPUs slump</h2> <p>“As much as we would love to have more supply, we do believe for a couple of quarters it is going to be very tight,” CEO Jensen Huang said during this week’s earnings call. “If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what that is from a year-over-year growth, but it is still too early for us to know at this time. We will get back to you as soon as we can.”</p>

 <p>While the company continues raking in the cash thanks to the AI boom, sales of gaming GPUs <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2026">actually fell 13 percent last quarter</a> as people look at the price of upgrading their PC and go “hell no.” “We expect supply constraints to be a headwind to gaming in the first quarter of fiscal 2027 and beyond,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said. Yikes.</p> <p>Surely Nvidia is doing everything it can to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-returning-2026-dram-shortage-gpus-expensive-prices-2000656687">increase available supply</a>, right? Right? “If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what this is from a year-over-year growth, but it’s still too early for us to know at this time,” Kress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0saM9rLGj0Y">later said</a>.</p>

 <h2>Fresh games media cuts at<em> IGN</em>-owned <em>Eurogamer</em></h2> <p>As first <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/games-media-set-for-more-layoffs-as-ign-owned-eurogamer-cuts-editorial-staff/">reported by <em>VGC</em></a>, <em>Eurogamer</em> is losing some top editors as well as its entire video team. <em>Kotaku</em> can corroborate that the popular Outside&nbsp;Xbox YouTube channel, which includes the <a href="https://www.oxventure.com/"><em>Oxventure</em> show</a> for live tabletop playthroughs, is part of the cuts.</p>

 <p>The group had just finished multiple sold-out shows as part of its 2026 tour across the UK. It’s unclear if they’ll have the opportunity to buy themselves out and go independent as <em>Digital Foundry</em> did last year or if the entire enterprise will just entirely shut down.</p> <p>Sources told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> that <em>Eurogamer</em>‘s editorial director is part of the downsizing, which comes after other waves of cuts and departures since <a href="https://kotaku.com/ign-john-davison-ziff-davis-layoffs-union-games-media-2000616972"><em>IGN</em> acquired</a> the site as part of the Gamer Network in 2024.</p>

 <h2>Casting is underway for <em>Wolfenstein 3</em></h2> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins"><em>Mp1st</em> reports</a> on details of one of the project’s new characters and its recording schedule, with sessions planned for 2026 and 2027. <em>Kotaku</em> corroborated that the game was in development <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">last month</a>.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> director defends using older version of Unreal Engine for the next sequel</h2> <p>“These represent the current trend in graphics pipelines, and of course, such pipelines are important to us as well,” he <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-is-progressing-very-smoothly-we-ask-director-naoki-hamaguchi-why-the-team-chose-not-to-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/">told <em>Automaton</em></a>. “However, if we had tied our development schedule and milestones too closely to Unreal Engine 5’s roadmap, we would have risked our own progress being stalled if the engine encountered any kind of delay.”</p> <h2>Sony might be backing off its PC push for single-player games</h2> <p>There was speculation on two podcasts this week that games like <em>Wolverine</em> are no longer a priority for porting to PC. That’s in stark contrast to Microsoft’s everything everywhere strategy. “I have an inkling that they’re pulling away from PC,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZsurPI5EY&amp;t=1413s"><em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman</a> said. “Watch the space. But I can’t help, based on some of the decisions and the way things have been going lately, I get the feeling that under the current leadership, that PC has become less important.” <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier echoed a similar sentiment <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-phil-spencer-retired-and-whats-next-for-xbox/id1507834679?i=1000751690666">on <em>Triple Click</em></a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Smiling Friends</em> calls it quits</h2> <p>The breakout Adult Swim animated comedy hit will end with season 3. “To be honest, after Season 3, Zach and I both had the same feeling where we felt pretty burnt out after putting years and years into this, but also pretty accomplished,” co-creator Michael Cusack explained <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DVNI_xlDJ6L/">in a new message</a>. “We came to this feeling where we were like, ‘This can just be it.'”</p> <p>The news comes as a shocker since season 4 and 5 already appeared to be greenlit. <em>Smiling Friends</em> will have two more episodes to release as part of season 3 before saying goodbye.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-steam-pc-new-version-release-bugs-problems-blurry-2000673604">Square Enix replaced the Steam version of<em> Final Fantasy VII</em> with something much worse</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-leon-grace-capcom-ps5-pc-2000673329"><em>Resident Evil 9</em> is a great game that plays it too safe</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/its-not-just-you-everyone-is-getting-xbox-spam-messages-right-now-2000673695">Xbox accidentally spammed people with tons of junk test messages&nbsp;</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
