Every expansion in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has changed how the game plays so much that very few cards from the base Genetic Apex set see use today. Still, some cards have held their ground despite the power creep, and you’ll undoubtedly sow fear into the eyes of your foes by bringing them into battle. Here are five monsters that are well worth bringing into your deck.</p><h2 id="h285539"><a id="1"></a>Rampardos</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Space-Time Smackdown: Dialga</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Rampardos is so strong that you could be tricked into thinking it’s an ex card. Its damage potential is on par with Giratina, and you only need a <em>single energy </em>for it to attack. Additionally, it packs respectable survivability at 150 HP. 50 damage recoil <em>does </em>admittedly sting, but since this only triggers on a KO, Rampardos can still headbutt way above its weight class against bulky opponents.</p><figure id="" data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This monster was already good when it debuted in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion, and the introduction of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Candy</a></span> has only made it better. Nearly every Fighting-type deck is built around this monster as of writing, and it’s easy to see why.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Cards that evolve from fossils are always risky, and Rampardos is no exception. You can’t use a Pokéball to get a fossil in your hand, and it’s vulnerable to a quick KO via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabrina</a></span> if you have nothing else on your bench.

Given the overwhelming prevalence of Supporter cards in the average <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>deck, boosting that 50 damage to 100 damage is remarkably easy. And since it only needs two colorless energy to attack, it can slot into any deck that needs a secondary attacker. Want to pair the overwhelming power of Rampardos with Sivally? You can, and many players do!</p><figure id="" data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On top of all these perks, Silvally is only a Stage-1 evolution too. That is to say, it can get on the field relatively fast and won’t compete with any Rare Candy users. Even its pre-evolutionary form <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/60&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/60" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type: Null</a></span> packs respectable bulk while outputting acceptable damage in the early game.

These two monsters are far from invincible together, especially if your opponent gets their strongest attackers on the front lines early on. But just putting Oricorio on the field will force your opponent to change their playstyle, which can net you wins if they don’t have an established gameplan for dealing with the bird.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Magnezone is the rare Stage-2 monster that does <em>not </em>want to use Rare Candy, so it’s slower to get up and running than other meta-dominant evolutions. Spending an extra turn to evolve might not seem like a big deal, but <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is so fast-paced now that you want to build momentum in your favor as soon as you can. Further, just placing Magneton on the field may compel your opponent to use cards that make you shuffle your deck, potentially tossing Magnezone out of your hand right as you were counting on playing it.</p><hr><h2 id="h285542"><a id="4"></a>Meowscarada</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Shining Revelry</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>One of the best ex-counters in the game so far.

This is fine for picking off basic Pokémon before they can evolve into Stage-2 forms, and two-shotting Pokémon like Oricorio isn’t bad. However, this still leaves room for your opponent to chip away at Meowscarada before finally bringing in an ex Pokémon to blast it away.</p><p>Mewoscarada typically pairs with other grass-type attackers like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decidueye ex</a></span> who can cover the cat’s weaknesses and greatly benefit from its strengths.

Of course, what you’re really bringing the ninja frog along for is its <strong>Water Shuriken </strong>ability. This lets Greninja attack <em>any </em>of your opponent’s Pokémon, even as it sits safely on the bench.

Its base form <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/87&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Froakie</a></span> is mostly a liability until it evolves, and 120 HP after evolution is low enough for most leading damage dealers to one-shot it. Greninja can pick off foes in a pinch in the active slot, but otherwise you’ll want this frog’s big tongue parked on a stacked bench where it’s safe from a surprise Sabrina switch-in.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Let’s break it down.</p><h2 id="h2878"><a id="1"></a>The ex-killer cards are on the loose</h2><p>In the current meta, ex Pokémon have to contend with several cards that exist <em>specifically </em>to defeat them.

Its Grass-typing is also dangerous, as it can make use of type-specific healing cards such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erika</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaf Cape</a></span> to keep it on the field longer.

The safeguard ability nullifies damage from ex Pokémon, which can potentially trap you into an unwinnable state if you aren’t careful. It’s not <em>invincible </em>against ex Pokémon, as Oricorio can still take indirect damage. For example, Darkrai can still inflict chip damage via Nightmare Aura, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/33&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incineroar ex</a></span> can damage Oricorio by using Fire Fang to inflict burn. Still, <strong>considering ex Pokemon can inflict up to 200 damage in a single turn, cutting their maximum potential damage down to 20 is a serious nerf</strong>. Even if Oricorio isn’t <em>meta </em>at any point, its sheer presence in the game means you have to plan a counter for it in the event it shows up.</p><p>Combine all the above factors with the fact that ex Pokémon award two points upon defeat, and you get an environment where these monsters are way riskier to use than before. Decks consisting solely of ex Pokemon can still work, but they now need to be built with the above threats in mind to avoid completely unwinnable matchups.</p><h2 id="h2879"><a id="2"></a>How to incorporate ex Pokémon into your deck</h2><p>In previous expansions, the most prevalent non-ex Pokémon played supporting roles. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaymin</a></span> would stay on the bench to heal, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1a/56&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1a/56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Druddigon</a></span> would take the lead on the front line while you stacked Energy on your heavy hitter. Now, it’s much wiser to pair a strong ex-Pokémon with a capable non-ex attacker. For example, players using <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solgaleo ex</a></span> will typically bring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skarmory</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/27&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiinotic</a></span> to inflict damage in the early game and take out any ex killers that could stop them later. You will find yourself praying for a good starting hand that doesn’t force you to deploy your late-game cards off the bat, but that’s practically unavoidable no matter which deck you run.</p><p>Alternatively, you can run a pure ex-deck as long as you have contingency plans in mind against your toughest matchups. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515">Darkrai ex</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/35&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giratina ex</a></span> are still very strong together despite the shifting meta. Darkrai’s Nightmare Aura ability paired with tools like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poison Barb</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocky Helmet</a></span> can counter Oricorio, and Giratina’s huge burst damage potential can bring down Meowscarada. It’s not a consistently successful strategy, but no deck ever is. You just need a strategy that works at least as often as it doesn’t.</p><h2 id="h2880"><a id="3"></a>In the end, you need luck and skill to win</h2><p>While ex Pokémon have huge obstacles they need to watch out for, many previously reliable Pokémon are also struggling because of how aggressive the game has become. Rare Candy is a huge culprit here: a player can now get a powerful Stage 2 monster on the field as early as turn three or four and begin a sweep that only a perfect hand can counter. Meanwhile, you could face the same deck and get the easiest win of your life just because your opponent’s candies are at the bottom of their deck. Cards like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/P-A/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/P-A/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Card</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mars</a></span> have spiked in popularity strictly to keep strong monsters off the field as much as possible.</p><p>The competitive landscape of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> has seen huge changes with every expansion introduced so far, so all the strategies listed here could become obsolete in a month’s time. However, given the escalation of cards that specifically target ex Pokémon, it’s unlikely we’ll see these otherwise powerful cards become less risky to use in the future. Just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-player-spend-money-1851723336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-player-spend-money-1851723336">do your best with the cards in your collection</a></span>, make sure you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-grind-thanks-battle-trick-1851769030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-grind-thanks-battle-trick-1851769030">say thanks even if you lose</a></span>, and if all else fails, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">maybe you can play the regular tabletop game instead</a></span>.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo now reports that it was even more popular than bad been expected, selling 3.5 million consoles in the first four days.

For instance, we know that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5 sold 4.5 million units</a></span> in total by the end of 2020, which works out to across about seven weeks, and rather importantly included the holidays. (Despite being a launch beset by nightmares, from covid to supply chain disasters, it still pretty much matched sales for the PS4 in 2013.) Even more usefully, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we also know that the PS5 had outsold the PS4's 2.1 million units in its first two weeks</a></span>, although without a specific number. That was described at the time as the “biggest console launch in history,” and given the Switch 2 massively beat that figure in less than a week, it’s safe to say the mantle has been passed on.</p><p>Nintendo stops short of the full boast, but observes this makes the Switch 2 it’s own fastest-selling device. The original Switch was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15449380/nintendo-switch-worldwide-sales-march&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15449380/nintendo-switch-worldwide-sales-march" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Nintendo</a></span> as having sold 2.74 million units in its first month, which it then described as it’s fastest seller, meaning the Switch 2 has absolutely walloped it so far.  (It’s fun to note that the Wii U sold a total of 3.5 million units over its first six months.)</p><p>Of course, initial sales are not a guaranteed predictor of long-term forecasts, but they do tend to bode well. Nintendo has rather modestly set its predicted sales for the year at 15 million, presumably trying to keep investors within reasonable expectations against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">a bemusing market</a></span> that could be flipped upside-down at any point with the latest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump’s mercurial tariff idiocy</a></span>.</p><p>Either way, it’s good times for Nintendo, and a good sign for a gaming industry that is having the shit beaten out of it of late. While the prices <em>aren’t</em> the same around the world, at the U.S.’s $450, that would mean sales of over $1.5 billion in less than a week. Now if only there was a new <em>Super Mario</em> game to play on it.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
