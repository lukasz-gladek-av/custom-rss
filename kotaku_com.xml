              <p>As a third-person shooter with just a single gun in its arsenal that lets you scope in, one almost never sees much of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gorgeous environments and explosive gameplay through first-person view.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>But there’s a way to get a look at post-apocalyptic Italy through the eyes of a Raider: Binoculars. They come with a heavy vignette and some HUD elements to make it feel like you’re using a zoomed scope, but on PC, if you hit F10, not only do you hide the HUD, but the vignetting on the binoculars goes away, leaving you with a suitably grainy image that’s perfect for taking some pretty shots of the game.</p>

 <p>That’s exactly what one IRL photographer, who shares his process on YouTube as Topside Flicks, has done, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">leaving behind weapons</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p562bp/you_guys_liked_the_last_binocular_photos_i_posted/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">brave the wilds of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ violent environments</a> to catch some of the most gorgeous screenshots of the extraction shooter yet. Check out some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/BKyBjT-y-pE">gameplay here</a>:</p>

  <p>The grainy-ness of these shots is quite fitting for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ kitbashed world where Raiders have to make due with what objects they can find to get the job done. I could imagine a photographer in this world hacking together found objects to be able to snap some stills. It really looks the part. Have a gander:</p> <div id="gallery-1"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000650627"> 				© © Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000650625"> 				© © Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>I’m <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-photo-mode-bethesda-screenshot-save-location-1850835812">something of an amateur photographer myself</a>, having studied the craft briefly in college; I also grew up with a family member who made a living picking up the camera. I love a good shot, IRL or otherwise, so I had to learn more about the experience of capturing the beautiful vistas of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ world and freezing in place the sudden and intense bursts of violence the game is known for.</p>

    <p>Topside Flicks, who’s real name is Levi, and I chatted a bit over email. He said that the beauty of the game itself simply demanded he find a way to take shots “I was playing with a friend and I couldn’t stop marvelling at how great this game looked,” he told me. “I’m a photographer by trade so I’m always seeing photo opportunities.”</p> <div id="gallery-2"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000650631"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000650632"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> clearly makes for wonderful capture opportunities. Much of this, I suspect, has to do with the lack of color-grading and filters the game uses, as <a href="https://youtu.be/ST_fD5NL_pg">Embark Studios talked about in episode two</a> of their behind-the-scenes featurettes.</p>

 <p>Aside from the practice range, every map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> is an active digital warzone. I asked Levi how dangerous the photo trips are. “I die plenty of times,” he said, “but the beauty of these runs is that I’m not doing any looting, so if I die, all I lose are binoculars and some defibrillators.”</p> <div id="gallery-3"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-3-2000650633"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-3-2000650634"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>But as you can see from his videos, Levi isn’t afraid to get up close to some intense firefights to grab a perfect shot. Naturally, he’s had many close calls. “I get set on fire quite a lot in my videos,” he said, “the Fireballs are my arch-nemesis when I don’t have a weapon,” he added, referring to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-stella-montis-north-line-patch-refiner-fireball-2000644048">the rolling Arc balls</a> that love to cook players with their flamethrowing ability.</p>

While some images clearly have some post-processing edits, as any good piece of photography does, these are some strong captures, and impressive considering he’s jumping headfirst into violent warzones purely for the sake of the craft, not the loot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Before <a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-warhammer-iii-3-review-pc-kotaku-creative-ass-1848519660"><em>Total War: Warhammer</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-three-kingdoms-the-kotaku-review-1834993637"><em>Total War: Three Kingdoms</em></a>, there was <em>Total War: Medieval</em> and its successor, <em>Total War: Medieval II</em>. It’s been a long wait. Almost two decades, in fact. But the hit strategy series is going back to Europe. Creative Assembly marked the franchise’s 25-year anniversary on Thursday by announcing <em>Total War: Medieval III</em>.</p> <p>The next <em>Total War</em> promises a return to the series roots but also a future-facing evolution. Here’s the press release:</p> <blockquote><p>Now in early pre-production, this next chapter is both a tribute to its legendary predecessors and a bold revolution for the series. Built as the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox, it will empower players to shape realms, rewrite history, and immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before. Combining meticulous historical authenticity with unprecedented player agency, this is more than a sequel, it’s the rebirth of historical&nbsp;<em><span>Total War</span></em>.</p></blockquote> <p>And here’s the live-action teaser:</p>  <p>When’s the game actually coming out? Who knows. It sounds pretty far away, though Creative Assembly is promising a more detailed tease at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards 2025</a> next week. <em>Medieval III</em> will be built in the next iteration of the studio’s proprietary Warcore game development engine, and will also be the first game in the series to come to “PlayStation and Xbox.” Not specifying “PS5” or “Xbox Series X/S” suggests it very likely might be arriving closer to the launch of the PS6 and next-gen Xbox.</p>

 <p>“Please DO NOT mess this one up,” one fan wrote on YouTube. “We have waited 20 years for a new Medieval Total War. Please release a fully functional and fun game.” Another was simply relieved: “<span dir="auto" role="text">I did not expect that this would happen before I die.”</span></p>

 <p>The original <em>Medieval</em> was the third game in the Total War series, and Creative Assembly hasn’t revisited that particular offshoot of its branching strategy franchise since 2006. Here’s how former <em>Kotaku</em> editor Luke Plunkett described <em>Medieval II</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-total-war-games-from-best-to-worst-1535642069">in his ranking of the series</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Perhaps the purest expression of melee battlefield combat the series has seen, its modern replayability is let down by an archaic strategic component. Which is a shame, because this is the last great moddable&nbsp;<em>Total War</em>, and as such is still home to all kinds of wild projects,&nbsp;<a href="https://thebests.kotaku.com/the-best-lord-of-the-rings-video-games-1820380737">including a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;total conversion</a>&nbsp;which would be close to the very top of this list…were it an actual game.</p></blockquote> <p>Hopefully, <em>Medieval III</em> can set a new standard for massive waves of melee units thrashing each other with more streamlined management elements. In the meantime, there’s no shortage of <em>Medieval II</em> mods to toy around with.</p>
