            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Until just a few short weeks ago, the AirPods Pro 2 were Apple’s end-all, be-all wireless earbuds, with thousands of glowing reviews and millions of units sold. Now that the AirPods Pro 3 are officially on the market, the Pro 2 earbuds might have just morphed into something even better — a terrific buying opportunity, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">if this Amazon deal taking 32% off their price is any indication.</a></p>
<p>It’s not like the quality of the AirPods Pro 2 have taken a sudden turn for the worse. They still have the H2 chip at their core to create incredibly efficient noise cancellation, spatial audio with head motion detection, and the world’s first hearing test and FDA-cleared hearing aid features in consumer wireless earbuds. The only thing that’s changed in the couple of months since they were supplanted at the top of the Apple food chain is the price, which just got a lot more friendly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Breakthrough Tech</h2>
<p>The H2 chip was a massive game-changer not just for the AirPods, but for the entire wireless earbud market. It literally doubled the noise cancellation power of the original AirPods Pro, and did so by increasing the number of times it analyzed external sounds to an incredible 48,000 per second. With that kind of noise-cancelling power, you can completely tune out the outside world and enjoy you playlists, podcasts, and audio books — a true luxury when you’re on a long flight or stuck in a crowded environment.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to let enough of the world back in to keep yourself aware of your surroundings by switching the AirPods Pro 2 into adaptive transparency mode, which is a wise personal-safety suggestion when you’re a pedestrian in a heavily trafficked area, or on a run or walk while alone.</p>



<h2>The Perfect Fit</h2>
<p>Another innovative feature of the AirPods Pro 2 is the fit test, accessible in the Bluetooth settings of your iPhone or iPad. By playing different tones to determine the quality of the seal between your ear and the AirPods, you discover which of the four different sizes of silicon tips is the right one for you to enjoy your AirPods Pro 2 to the fullest.</p>
<p>One area where the fit of the AirPods Pro 2 just dramatically improved is your budget, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">thanks to this 32% off Amazon deal that makes the AirPods Pro 2 a truly outstanding buy at just $170.</a> Perhaps we should be thanking the AirPods Pro 3 for dropping in time to make their legendary predecessors one of the better pre-Black Friday tech deals that we’ve seen.</p>

              <p>Everybody loves a surprise, especially one that saves money. Amazon’s limited-time 43%-off deal on the newest model of their Fire TV Stick HD is already a stellar offer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">Smash that button and the Fire TV Stick HD is all yours for a record-low price of just $20&nbsp;— nearly half off its regular $35 price.</a></p>
<p>This is the latest and greatest version of Amazon’s streaming stick, and we can say that with total confidence because we have over 42,000 Amazon reviewers backing us up on it. Their average rating for the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is a spectacular 4.7 stars, with kudos being handed out for the quality, ease of setup, ease of use, and overall value for the price. Assuming most of those reviews were lauding the Fire TV Stick HD’s value for its original $35 price, that value now basically doubles.</p>

<h2>Even the Smart TVs Benefit</h2>
<p>With virtually all new TVs now being manufactured with built-in streaming ability, you might think the streaming stick and other external streaming devices are on their way to the ash heap of history, next to the VCR, the 8-track, and a long list of other once-cutting-edge technology. We’d never bet against progress, but as long as the Fire TV Stick HD has such a clean, intuitive interface and user experience as compared to many of those Smart TVs, it won’t be going anywhere.</p>
<p>Everything about the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is about ease. The installation is totally plug-and-play, just plug it into your TV’s HDMI port and it’s up and running. There’s no external power source since it runs off the power of your TV, and no complicated setup steps of any kind. It’s perfect for first-time streamers or anyone who goes crosseyed when they look at the home screen of their Smart TV.</p>



<h2>More Than Streaming</h2>
<p>The name says TV Stick, but since this is an Amazon device, you know it can do far more. Voice commands for Alexa work for streaming and also for smart home devices like your thermostat, lights, smart camera, and more. The Fire TV Stick HD is also able to play your favorite music streaming services like Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, and others, and its included remote can also control your compatible TV and home theater devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5/?tag=kotaku01-20">The tiny $20 price tag that pops up on the Fire TV Stick HD when you stack Amazon’s 43% off deal</a>&nbsp;is a sensational price for a top-line streaming stick that brings effortless and easy to navigate streaming to your TV, but also to any TV with an HDMI port. What could be more portable than a pocket-sized streaming stick that requires no cords and no external power source? The best sub-$20 streaming device is just a click away at Amazon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-unloads-ideapad-slim-3-i7-1tb-ssd-laptop-stock-now-2200-cheaper-on-amazon-2000639229</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-unloads-ideapad-slim-3-i7-1tb-ssd-laptop-stock-now-2-200-cheaper-on-amazon.1335604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lenovo’s official website rarely offers meaningful discounts, and finding premium laptops marked down more than 20% feels like winning a small lottery. The real clearance action happens on Amazon, where manufacturers quietly offload inventory at prices that make you question if there’s a typo. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/">Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 with an Intel Core i7-13620H processor, 40GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB PCIe SSD has crashed to an all-time low of $799 on Amazon</a>, down from its typical $2,999 price tag. That’s a staggering <strong>$2,200 discount and a massive 73% savings</strong> that transforms a high-end business laptop into something accessible for students.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Hardware at Budget Pricing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-13620H is the 13th generation Intel processor which is a hybrid model that comes with 10 cores: <strong>6 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores</strong>. The processor has the efficiency cores perform simple tasks in the background so that actual tough tasks requiring processing are attended by the performance cores for both speed and smooth functioning when using the CPU. The performance cores operate at a speed of 2.4 GHz, boosting to 4.9 GHz when additional processing is needed for activities such as video processing or calculations involving numerous formulas in a Microsoft Office sheet.</p>
<p>The 16 threads through its 10 cores allow it to run multiple apps at once without causing the system to come to a standstill. Open your Chrome browser with 30 tabs, use your Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Slack, Spotify and other apps running in the background, and still, it will respond better than budget-friendly systems that only come with a dual-core or quad-core processor. The <strong>24MB cache helps it access frequently used resources</strong> without having to wait for the system’s storage for that access.</p>



<p>Memory configuration makes a substantial difference in real-world performance, and <strong>40GB DDR5 RAM puts this laptop in workstation territory</strong>. DDR5 represents the newest memory standard with significantly higher bandwidth than DDR4 and allows faster data transfer between RAM and the processor. This capacity handles memory-intensive workflows like running multiple virtual machines for software development, editing 4K video footage with effects layers, working with large datasets in Excel or data analysis software or keeping dozens of browser tabs active without performance degradation</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD has more than enough storage for operating systems and files, besides offering <strong>read transfers at a rate of 3,500 MB/sec and write transfers at a rate of 3,000 MB/sec</strong> on average for PCIe v3.x speeds. This results in Windows launching in a few seconds, applications launching almost instantly, and the time for file transfers being dramatically faster than hard drives or SATA SSDs.</p>



<p>The <strong>display has a 15.3-inch screen with a resolution of 1920×1200 pixels</strong>. The added vertical resolution (when compared to 1920×1080 Full HD) is beneficial for professionals like programmers or document writers, where every pixel matters. The display employs an IPS display type that boasts excellent viewing angles and color accuracy regardless of the angle, and its 300-nit luminance helps it remain visible in brightly lit environs or near windows.</p>
<p>Connectivity also features contemporary standards, so that Wi-Fi 6 enables faster wireless throughput than its predecessor, Wi-Fi 5. The Bluetooth 5.2 standard takes care of wireless peripherals such as computer mice and headphones for greater range and lower latency. Connect options include requirements for everyday use, such as <strong>two USB-A jacks for connecting legacy accessories, a USB-C port that can provide Power Delivery for faster charging</strong>&nbsp;along with DisplayPort output for computer displays, an HDMI 1.4 output for presentations, a headphone jack, and access through SD-card slots that benefit photographers for camera transfers.</p>
<p>At $799 with a 4.5-star rating from nearly 1,000 buyers, this deal delivers specifications that typically cost $1,500-2,000 even on sale.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-jackery-1500w-portable-power-station-drops-50-off-amazon-preps-you-for-winter-outages-2000639219</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-jackery-1-500w-portable-power-station-drops-50-off-amazon-preps-you-for-winter-outages.1335562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms knock out power without warning and leave homes dark and cold for hours (or even days). Having backup power stops being a luxury and becomes essential when your heating system shuts down, your refrigerator starts warming up and your phones need charging to stay connected with emergency services. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> portable (1500W) power station addresses exactly this scenario with enough capacity to run critical appliances during outages. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/">it’s hit an all-time low of $419 on Amazon, slashed from its regular $839 price</a>. This <strong>50% discount makes serious emergency preparedness accessible</strong> without the commitment and installation costs of whole-home generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Covers the Essentials</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,070Wh energy storage allows for actual use time</strong>&nbsp;and that’s important during emergency situations. This model will support a contemporary refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours, thereby preserving food during a power outage. Use it to heat a room for 4 to 5 hours when set to low output for a space heater, or use it to power LED lights, allowing them to keep shining for several days. The <strong>pure sine wave AC has a 1,500W continuous power</strong> output and comes with 3,000W surges that can handle motor startups for refrigerators or furnace fans.</p>
<p>The emergency charge feature through the Jackery app allows for a <strong>quick recharge to full power in only 1 hour</strong>. Normal portable chargers can only recharge to full power in 6 to 8 hours and gaps exist during multi-day power outage situations. This particular power bank will reach 100% power in 60 minutes only when emergency mode is enabled, although it comes optimized for 1.7-hour recharge for better battery longevity.</p>



<p>The chemistry used in the energy storage system – <strong>LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate) – has a significantly longer lifespa</strong>n than that used in standard lithium-ion batteries that are found inside low-cost energy stations. This type of battery retains more than 70% of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, meaning that it will last for more than 10 years. Standard lithium-ion batteries normally depreciate to 80% after 500 to 1,000 charge cycles.</p>
<p>The port options include both contemporary and traditional devices: The<strong> two USB-C ports support a total output of 100W Power Delivery</strong> for fast charging of laptops, tablets, or smartphones without requiring additional wall chargers. The <strong>USB-A port is for traditional laptops</strong>, and functions at standard rates. The <strong>three AC plug options</strong> allow for the simultaneous use of several appliances, such as a lamp, computer charger, and phone, at the same time. The <strong>DC car port option</strong> supports 12V-powered appliances such as portable coolers or tire pumps.</p>



<p>This time, the <strong>bundle comes with a 16-foot extension cord</strong> that is specifically made for use when connecting solar panels. The placement of the solar panels (sold separately) has to be carried out while exposing them to sunlight and the stations, on the other hand, need to remain either under cover or in vehicles. The weight – 23.8 pounds – is portable and make it simple to relocate from room to room.</p>
<p>With a price tag of $419 and a rating of 4.7 stars from buyers, it is an incredible bargain for a true emergency-power solution that works when it matters.</p>
