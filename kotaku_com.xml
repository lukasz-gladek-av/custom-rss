              <p>Got any big travel plans for 2026? I know when I’m traveling, I become weirdly anxious about all my stuff, afraid I might leave something behind somewhere in a hotel room or backseat of an Uber. That’s why it can be a good idea to slip some Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth trackers into your bags. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6920/">Right now, Amazon has the trackers 36% off. Normally, priced at $30, they’ve now each dropped by $10 to just $20 per tag</a>. If you need several, a four-pack is now going for just $62, which ends up working out to just shy of $16 per SmartTag2.</p>
<p>This set of four Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth trackers comes with two black trackers and two white trackers. If you’re just buying one, the white model is $2 cheaper than the black.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6920/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep Track of All Your Crap</h2>
<p>Most of us already rely on GPS to locate our phones if they go missing. SmartTag2 extends that same peace of mind to items that don’t have built-in tracking. Paired with a Samsung Galaxy phone or tablet, the tracker lets you see the last known location of your belongings directly on a map. That can save time and frustration when something isn’t where you expected.</p>
<p data-start="882" data-end="1254">Physically, the SmartTag2 is small, lightweight, and designed with a built-in loop, so attaching it is simple. Clip one to your keys, slide one into a backpack, or loop one onto luggage. Some people even attach them to bikes, camera bags, or in gym lockers to keep tabs on where things are. Once you get used to having trackers around, it’s hard not to find new uses for them.</p>
<p data-start="1639" data-end="1997">If an item is nearby but out of sight, the Search Nearby feature comes into play. It pulls up a compass-style interface that guides you toward the tag’s location. For situations where visual clues aren’t enough, you can trigger an audible alert on the SmartTag2, making it easier to track down something buried under clothes or tucked between couch cushions.</p>


<h2 data-start="1639" data-end="1997">Enhanced Battery Life</h2>
<p data-start="1999" data-end="2281">Battery life is another strong point. Each SmartTag2 can last up to 500 days on a single battery, with Power Saving mode extending that lifespan even further, up to 40% longer. With that enabled, you won’t need to think about replacements very often. Might be useful when you’re using them on items you don’t check daily.</p>
<p data-start="2283" data-end="2620" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With an IP67 rating, these trackers can handle dust and water exposure without issue. Optional silicone cases add extra protection, better grip, and a carabiner ring for quicker attachment.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/poweras-alternative-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-is-a-no-brainer-at-less-than-half-its-price-2000663633</link>
            <guid>1418470</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With the release of the Switch 2 last year, Nintendo simultaneously refreshed it’s Pro Controller to release alongside the new console. The aptly-named Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller comes with some big upgrades including a better HD Rumble system, the dedicated C-Button for GameChat, and rear GL/GR buttons that can be mapped to any button you choose. It’s a handy controller to add to your rotation, but it doesn’t come cheap. It’s list price is a whopping $89.</p>
<p>You can get a controller with really everything you actually need for less than half that price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/">The PowerA enhanced wireless controller for both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 normally goes for $70, but has come down to just $40 after a 43% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>While the PowerA controller doesn’t have the C-button to launch GameChat directly from your gamepad, I also don’t know many players who would even miss that all too much. What the PowerA controller&nbsp;<em>does</em> have is comfortable ergonomics for long game sessions and wireless connectivity. It’s even got motion controls. What more do you need?</p>
<h2>Advanced Gaming Buttons</h2>
<p>The PowerA controller even has the same two customizable back buttons that Nintendo added to its second generation pro controller. The AGR and AGL buttons can be pulled with your trigger fingers to activate a function of your choice. You can map these buttons to mimic any other button on the controller, making it easy to jump or reload without having to take your thumbs off the sticks. These back buttons can even be programmed on the fly, mid game. No backing out of the game into system settings required.</p>



<h2>Never Stop Playing</h2>
<p>The controller is powered by an internal lithium rechargeable 900mAh battery, so you’re not dealing with double-As like you might with some other third party options. The PowerA controller fully charged could last you up to 30 hours on a single charge. Then when the battery does get low, just plug in the included 10-foot USB-C charging cable so it can recharge while you can keep playing.</p>
<p>The PowerA controller can also be way more fun than the first-party option from Nintendo. Along with the standard black version, PowerA has a wide selection of designs featuring artwork of fan favorite characters. Lots of Mario and friends designs as well as some options from Kirby, Metroid, and Zelda. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/">Most of which are currently marked down to the same $40 price tag as the standard version.</a> That’s $49 cheaper than the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dont-stop-girlypop-is-a-wild-looking-shooter-that-isnt-much-fun-to-play-2000663619</link>
            <guid>1418437</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fps-shooters-2025-borderlands-battlefield-doom-first-person-shooter-2000653497">A good first-person shooter</a> doesn’t need to look hyper-realistic, include actual military weaponry, or feature massive levels. Really, all a shooter needs to nail in order for it be considered damn good in my book is simple: Moving and shooting in it should feel great. That’s it. And sadly, recently released “Y2K arena movement shooter” <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> doesn’t accomplish that, despite a wild and memorable art style and soundtrack.</p> <p><em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> is an indie FPS starring a super soldier of compassion and kindness trying to fight back an alien invasion of corporate-obsessed evil bastards who want to steal and exploit the very love you defend. So you do like any soldier of love and hope would: You grab a wild shotgun that you can freely bedazzle and start blasting fools.</p>

  <p>The FPS is built entirely around moving fast and killing lots of enemies in various arena encounters. Shooting shit is 80 percent of this game, and on paper, that sounds like a great video game to me, a person who loves boomer shooters and most FPS adventures. However, to achieve max speed in <em>GirlyPop,</em> you must repeatedly slam, jump, and dash. And you’ll want to go fast in this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">FPS launching on Steam on January 29</a>, because the faster you move, the more damage you do and the more quickly you heal. The problem is that repeating this bunnyhopping-like maneuver requires pressing three different buttons over and over and over again, and it quickly started to tire my fingers out.</p> <p>Worse, when I was at top speed during fights, I felt out of control and not in a fun way. Instead, it made fights turn into a blur of neon colors and random shapes. Slowing down, while it made combat easier to parse, also made me a sitting target. And you move so slow in this game when you aren’t bunnyhopping around that not speeding through fights and platforming sections is a drag.</p>

 <h2>Bad combat, but good music</h2> <p>And as I ping-ponged around the bizarre low-poly arenas that make up most of <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em>‘s world, I often struggled to spot baddies as their models are often made up of thin shapes roughly collected into something that resembles an enemy. If I had a nickel for each fight that lingered on because a few flying bastards were hiding in the garish textures or low-poly environment around me, I’d have enough money to buy a small soda. When I did find them and shoot, I’d often be unsure if they were even taking damage until they died, making guns feel weak in the process.</p>

 <p>But don’t get me wrong, I enjoy how <em>GirlyPop</em> looks! A lot. The mismash of 2000s-era tech and game visuals with bright pink colors and oddly shaped levels is a standout element of the game. It reminds me of some of the weird mods I’d play back in the day in games like <em>Unreal Tournament </em>and <em>Half-Life.</em> It’s just a shame that <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> sometimes goes too far with how much digital junk and neon it tosses on the screen, such that it can become downright unplayable until the action calms down a tad. A more successful example of a game tapping into this same era of gaming is <a href="https://kotaku.com/quake-2-brazilian-drug-dealer-3-favela-steam-review-fps-boomer-shooter-weird-2000628167">last year’s <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3, </em></a>which isn’t nearly as hard to look at when combat happens.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663627"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663627">©Kwalee / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>At least, throughout all of this, the music slaps. A few of the battle tracks got stuck in my head long after I stopped playing, which is a very good sign that you’ve made some awesome tunes. I just wish the game’s later levels were as rad as the music. Instead, the more I played, the more I started to dislike my time with <em>GirlyPop</em> as areas became messier and harder to navigate, like I was playing someone’s first draft and not a finished level.</p>

 <p><em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> is an example of a shooter that oozes style and has some cool ideas, like using a flip phone to communicate with your handler, a woman who appears in live-action video clips on your phone’s screen. But its visuals get in the way, and its combat is too focused on chaotic speed and screen-obscuring effects. Perhaps I could still enjoy all of this if the guns were satisfying to use and the enemies fun to kill, but more often than not, I wasn’t sure if I was doing well in a fight or if my guns were even hitting anything. So I’m sorry to say I stopped playing <em>GirlyPop</em> before the game ended. But hey, at least I’ll have the music to jam out, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Pushes Its Latest ANC Headphones to a Record Low, the WH-1000XM6 Is Now Priced Below the XM5’s Original Cost]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-pushes-its-latest-anc-headphones-to-a-record-low-the-wh-1000xm6-is-now-priced-below-the-xm5s-original-cost-2000663639</link>
            <guid>1418404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Techies and audiophiles are both notoriously fickle crowds, and they love a good debate about the best this or the best that. But they’re overwhelmingly on the same page when it comes to over-ear noise-cancelling headphone: Sony’s WH-1000XM6 are hands-down the very best you can find on the consumer market. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">That’s very relevant right now, because these otherworldly cans are back down to their holiday pricing at Amazon, with a limited-time deal dropping them to just $398.</a></p>
<p>When the WH-1000XM6 headphones dropped last May, our compadres at Gizmodo called them “damn near perfect,” and they were far from alone in that opinion. Sony had set an extremely steep bar for itself when they announced a successor model to the wildly popular WH-1000XM5 headphones, but they cleared that bar with plenty of room to spare by taking all of the WH-1000XM5’s best features and upgrading them even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Faults Found</h2>
<p>When Sony went back to the drawing board, their opening move was to give the WH-1000XM6 an improved foldable design to make them even better travel companions. The headband was widened for greater comfort, a 10-band EQ was added to the Sony Sound Connect app for a deeper level of customization, and the battery life was boosted to an almost unheard of 30 hours even while the best-in-class active noise cancellation is engaged.</p>
<p>But the real draw to the Sony WH-1000XM6 wireless headphones is, of course, that noise cancellation. To quote the opening words of every KISS concert: <em>“You wanted the best, you got the best.”</em> Sony’s new QN3 processor is joined by 12 upgraded microphones and AI Noise Optimization to create the absolute best Active Noise Cancellation of any set of wireless headphones anywhere. That title was probably held previously by — you guessed it — Sony’s WH-1000XM5. But those had “only” 8 microphones, and its QN1 processor gets absolutely blown out of the water by the QN3, which is fully 7x faster and therefore far more effective in eliminating external sounds.</p>



<h2>You’re In Control</h2>
<p>Toggling between ANC and Ambient Sound, which allows in enough outside noise for you to be aware of your surroundings, is a simple one-button action in the upgraded interface of the WH-1000XM6. Between the buttons built into the cans and the exceptionally robust set of controls that reside in the Sound Connect app, there are more modes and adjustments available to you than you’ll ever use, but better too many than too few.</p>
<p>The word on the street is that Sony won’t be releasing a WH-1000XM7 wireless headphone in 2026, meaning you can feel free to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">grab the WH-1000XM6 for just $398 during this limited-time Amazon deal</a> with full confidence that you’re getting the absolute best noise-cancelling over-ear wireless headphones on the market.</p>

              <p>A team lead at beleaguered Ubisoft has claimed (thanks <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-suspension/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>) that he’s been placed on a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension after he made public remarks criticizing the publisher’s recent return-to-office mandate. David Michaud-Cromp says he was told by bosses that this was because of “an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p> <p>In amongst <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">last week’s shock announcement</a> that Ubisoft was cancelling a number of games (including the&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia:</em> <em>The </em>Sands<em> of Time</em> remake), delaying others, and restructuring itself such that even more studios would be closed, was a demand that all employees return to their local Ubisoft office five days a week. After this new plan was sprung on 15,000 staff at the same time as it was made known to the public, Michaud-Cromp took to his LinkedIn account on January 23 to vent.</p>

 <p><span><span dir="ltr">“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they ‘believe in collaboration,'” wrote the Ubisoft Montreal level design team lead, “but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office… (Spoiler alert: it’s not about efficiency or collaboration).”</span></span></p> <p>Michaud-Cromp is not alone in his criticism of Ubisoft’s declaration that all employees must now return to working full-time in offices. Many Ubisoft staff took to the company’s internal message board to vent their feelings, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">as seen and reported on by&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> last week</a>, not least because Parisian employees in particular had only recently completed negotiations to ensure they could maintain two work-from-home days a week.</p>

 <p>It seems Michaud-Cromp’s initial comments did not go down well with his bosses. He now claims that his remarks have led to being disciplined. “P<span><span dir="ltr">rofessional update,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow.” He says this was “presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy,” alongside the astonishing phrase, “and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.” He concluded, “I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.”</span></span></p>

 <p>Ubisoft’s latest plan to try to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">reverse its rapid decline</a> is a restructuring that will simplify development via the creation of a collection of “creative houses,” which appears to be further consolidation of its many teams around the world, and thus another raft of inevitable job losses. In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">announcement</a> (a pdf) it adds, “To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days.” Why? “This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams.” Um, what? “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p> <p>Staff appeared to receive this with some hefty cynicism, including Michaud-Cromp’s. Another staff member told <em>Kotaku</em> the move was being made “with zero justification, zero documents, zero internal studies proving RTO increases productivity or morale, nothing.”</p>

 <p>Due to covid, when everyone was forced to work from home, it became apparent how flexible work arrangements actually lead to <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/study-shows-working-from-home-has-potential-to-significantly-boost-productivity">improved</a> <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/">productivity</a>, but bosses at many big companies whose roles are perhaps somewhat threatened by this revelation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/16/amazon-in-person-office-policy">have been pushing back</a>.</p> <p>Ubisoft staff are deeply unimpressed by this new announcement and the threat of yet another round of job losses, and <em>Kotaku</em> has seen at least five unions representing Ubisoft workers call for a three-day strike by all employees in February.</p> <p>We have reached out to both Ubisoft and Michaud-Cromp for further comment.</p>
