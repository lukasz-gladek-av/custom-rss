              <p><span>The first on-set photos of Amazon’s live-action </span><i><span>Tomb Raider</span></i><span> series just dropped, and Sophie Turner looks badass.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The pics show Turner sporting tactical gear: black mid-calf boots, grey cargo pants, and a black vest over a ribbed brown long-sleeve shirt. Lara Croft’s iconic dual pistols are strapped to her thighs, and she dons her classic small knapsack in green canvas with brown leather straps. The fit is tied together with a forearm brace, fingerless leather gloves, a belt outfitted with grenades, and, of course, Lara’s signature braid. While the tactical gear isn’t her most famous look, the costume invokes </span><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/laracroft/images/6/68/TR_L_Special_forces_Uniform.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100706191008"><span>various</span></a> <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/laracroft/images/4/44/Commando.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180916150951"><span>in-game</span></a> <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/laracroft/images/4/44/ROTTR_Siberian_Ranger.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20160308105746"><span>outfits</span></a><span>, is practical for the drizzling woodland set, and looks cool as hell (though I would’ve opted for a darker grey on the pants).&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First on-set photos of Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. 🎬<br>Tactical outfit for the Tomb Raider live-action series. <a href="https://t.co/axfVHS5bbj">pic.twitter.com/axfVHS5bbj</a></p> <p>— Core Design (@CoreDesign_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/CoreDesign_com/status/2019762516943937856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Turner can also be seen doing her own stunts, like parachuting across a lake.

 <p><span>She continued, “I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realized that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had, so it has taken me months and months and months to get into good shape.” She’s just like me for real.</span></p> <blockquote data-media-max-width="560"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sophie Turner performs her own parachute stunt on the Lara Croft set! <a href="https://t.co/j8IzQN9Tpn">https://t.co/j8IzQN9Tpn</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ok2gOFTas2">pic.twitter.com/Ok2gOFTas2</a></p> <p>— TMZ (@TMZ) <a href="https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/2019815012726976672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The woodsy set is located in Surrey, according to the </span><em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html"><span>Daily Mail</span></a></em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The series is being produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Crystal Dynamics, with </span><i><span>Fleabag</span></i><span> creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge helming the project.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week’s partner-focused Nintendo Direct did not set the world on fire. In fact, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-games-fallout-elder-scrolls-2000666038">damningly unimpressive</a>. Unless you love Japanese role-playing games, in which case boy, oh boy, even in its first year the Switch 2 is already shaping up to be the console of your dreams. A flood of recent JRPGs and a ton of new ones on the horizon have paved the way for an unprecedented run of turn-based mechanics, epic boss fights, and rewarding grind marathons on Nintendo’s new hardware. If that sounds horrifying, god bless. For all my other sickos out there, hell yeah!</p> <p>A bust for general audiences, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">this week’s Switch 2 showcase</a> was a surprise coup for JRPG lovers. It confirmed a whopping nine games in the genre coming to the portable platform between now and the summer, including some really interesting deep cuts that will make a few niche fanbases extra excited. Here’s the list along with release dates:</p>

 <ul> <li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</strong></em> – March 13</li> <li><em><strong>Tales of Arise – Beyond the Dawn Edition</strong></em> – May 22</li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></em> – June 3</li> <li><strong>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</strong><em> – &nbsp;June 18</em></li> <li><em><strong>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</strong></em> – July 9</li> <li><strong><em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em></strong> – July 10</li> <li><em><strong>Culdcept Begins </strong></em>– July 16</li> <li><em><strong>Another Eden Begins </strong></em>– Summer</li> <li><em><strong>Kyoto Xanadu</strong></em> – Summer</li> </ul> <p>Okay, let’s dig into a few of these. <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</em> is a turn-based spin-off in which you hatch, raise, and ride monsters (“Monsties,” lol) instead of fighting them. It’s got a pretty generous free demo out already. The <em>Adventures of Elliot</em> is an HD-2D <em>Zelda</em>-like from the makers of <em>Octopath Traveler</em>. And <em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> is a streamlined action-RPG in which you travel the skies in an airship doing multiplayer <em>Monster Hunter</em>-like raids with really fun combat. It’s coming to Switch 2 for the first time with cross-play and <em>Endless Ragnarok</em>, a new story DLC fans have been hoping for since launch.</p> <h2><em>Culdcept</em> and more make an unexpected comeback</h2> <p>Now for the deep cuts. <em>Culdcept Begin</em>s is a surprise new entry in the long-running, incredibly obscure and esoteric card-based board game series that began on the Sega Saturn. It’s been almost a decade since the last entry came to 3DS, which despite its flaws and rough edges <a href="https://kotaku.com/culdcept-revolt-proves-once-more-how-great-monopoly-an-1819229743">proved that JRPG Monopoly</a> is still a winning formula (with the right people). <em>Kyoto Xanadu</em> is the latest in a series of action-RPG dungeon crawlers from Nihon Falcom. I’ve never played them but it’s a cult favorite.</p>

 <p>Finally we have <em>Another Eden Begins</em>, a mobile game that players have been waiting almost a decade to get a proper console port for. Why do people care? Well, its script was written by Masato Kato who worked on <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. The theme music is by Yasunori Mitsuda, who made the music for <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. And overall the game plays like an old-school turn-based RPG with time-traveling hijinks and a literal frog knight so, yeah. The mobile version was free-to-play and had microtransactions. Hopefully the new port feels more like a proper paid release. We’ll see.</p>

 <p>That’s a good haul of popular ports and more niche releases, but it’s not coming in a vacuum. This trove of 2026 JRPG riches comes after players got <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> and <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> last fall. Earlier this year, we got&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> and&nbsp;<i>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</i>. Switch players who upgrade to Switch 2 finally got to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, with the sequel coming in just a few months. In the meantime, February has both <em>Ys X: Proud Nordics</em> and <em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em>. And later this year there’s <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</em> and <em>Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</em>.</p> <p>It’s a wild time. Genre fans are eating well. There’s not enough hours in the day to play even half of these games in 2026, and that’s before we find out about the third <em>FFVII</em> remake game and whatever Monolith Soft is cooking up for the <em>Xenoblade</em> series. Nintendo should probably announce a killer first-party blockbuster for Switch 2 soon, but in the meantime it’s already a JRPG lover’s paradise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-big-on-portable-bluetooth-speakers-soundlink-plus-restocks-at-a-record-low-for-another-clearance-push-2000662395</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose SoundLink Plus is a portable wireless speaker that’s designed for both indoor and outdoor use. A compact, rectangular body with a looped carrying strap makes it easy to hang, grab, or slip into a bag when you’re ready to go. It’s built to be rugged, dustproof, and waterproof (IP67), allowing it to handle wet, sandy conditions and random rain showers without interrupting your music. Plus, its battery lasts up to 20 hours, providing solid playtime for your playlists, podcasts, and background music until you need to recharge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/">Go to Amazon and buy the Bose SoundLink Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $199, down from its original price of $269, for a savings of $70 and 26%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful speaker that projects sound beautifully</h2>
<p>The sound produced by the Soundlink Plus is engineered to produce rich bass and clean mids, making your music feel full and robust, not thin. The speaker can produce enough decibels to comfortably fill a room or an outdoor area, making it perfect for both relaxing background listening and concentrated sessions. So, whether you’re playing music, podcasts, or dialogue-driven shows, this speaker will provide enough presence to make them audible.</p>
<p>Portability and durability were key factors in the design of this speaker. The loop allows you to hang it securely or attach it to a strap, while the durable outer shell protects against minor mishaps like drops and knocks. Since the speaker is also dustproof and waterproof, you can place it on a picnic table, a beach towel, a poolside ledge, etc., without worrying about damaging it. You can also use the speaker to charge your mobile device if needed, as it can double as a power bank.</p>



<p>Wireless features extend the capabilities of the SoundLink Plus beyond a single-speaker setup when you want to expand coverage. For example, you can pair two SoundLink Plus speakers together for greater stereo width, or engage Party Mode with other Bose portable speakers to play the same track across multiple locations. Bose’s SimpleSync feature also lets this speaker connect with certain Bose smart soundbars and speakers, which can be convenient when you want to send a movie or playlist to other parts of your home without physically moving speakers.</p>
<p>The Bose SoundLink Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker has an IP67 rating, an estimated 20 hours of battery life, a USB-C charging port, the ability to fine-tune your EQ via the Bose app, and the ability to pair with multiple speakers using multi-speaker modes, all at a reduced price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/">At $199, compared to the regular retail price of $269, this is a great deal for a high-quality portable wireless speaker to use as your primary music source at home or on the go.</a></p>

These images are from the games’ 2024 beta, so ideally, they’ll look more polished when we see them later this month. We can see several varied environments, including an underwater area, a frozen tundra, grassy fields, and a city. Some of them are very clearly from an early stage in development, though, where a lot of the general shapes are laid out but the details and textures haven’t been added yet.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-clears-out-its-power-bank-with-retractable-cable-at-a-record-low-20000mah-165w-2000666200</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything more frustrating than heading out and realizing your phone or laptop is almost out of power, or dying in the middle of something important when you’re on the go? Probably not.</p>
<p>This is where an efficient power bank can come in handy, and now is a great time to pick one up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/">We just spotted the 20,000mAh, 165W Ugreen Nexode power bank going for $70 at Amazon, after a solid 30% discount on its usual $100 price</a>. This offer is open to all shoppers, and the retailer is also offering free delivery on your purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charge Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>This portable, yet mighty charger features a built-in 25.6inch (65cm) retractable USB-C cable that expands when needed and tucks away once you’re done topping your devices up. That means you don’t need to worry about carrying extra wires with this power bank at hand – just toss it in your backpack, and you’re good to go. Additionally, the cable is tested for over 25,000 retractions and 10,000 bends, so it’s going to comfortably support your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p>There are also two additional ports with up to 165W max output, so you can charge a MacBook Pro and an iPhone simultaneously (delivering 100W and 65W respectively). In a setup like this, the power bank can take a 16-inch MacBook Pro from 0 to 43% in just 30 minutes. The informative smart display at the front shares real-time port status and power flow, keeping you in the loop about the charging situation at all times.</p>



<p>The 20,000mAh high capacity is built for demanding days, as it’s capable of supporting all-day business activities without searching for outlets. For reference, that’s enough power to fully power an 11-inch iPad Pro twice, a Galaxy S24 Ultra up to three times, or a 13-inch MacBook Air just over once. Recharging the power bank doesn’t take forever, either, thanks to its 100W max input that juices it back up to full in just under 2 hours. You’ll also appreciate how this thing is equipped with high-rate battery cells that are specifically designed for endurance, and can retain up to 70% health after 1000 full charge cycles. Translation? A longer lifespan, which ensures you won’t really need to replace the power bank anytime soon.</p>
<p>Security is taken just as seriously. Ugreen has packed the Nexode with 13 layers of protection to guard against high-temperature, low-temperature, overvoltage, overcharge, overdischarge, short circuit, and more. All things considered, if you’re looking for a reliable solution that lets you power all your essential devices – from laptops to smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and earbuds – on the go, this Nexode power bank can help. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/">It offers great speeds with a huge battery capacity, and you can now snap it up for just $70 at Amazon</a>. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too.</p>
