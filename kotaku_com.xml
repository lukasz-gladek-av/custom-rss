              <p>Los Angeles’ Anime Expo 2025 describes itself as North America’s “largest celebration of Japanese pop culture.” The 34th such event finished recently, with the four-day spectacular seeing an extraordinary 410,000 people show up, and it even played host to a Sukeban (the Japanse female pro-wrestling league) World Championship Fight. Also, of course, it featured squillions of attendees showing up in some superbly good cosplay. As ever, <em>Kotaku</em> heroes Minerablu were there to capture the very best fits.</p> <p>Given the anime focus, costumes obviously skewed that way, but gaming still got a look-in. Look, it’s not like it’s possible to stop at least&nbsp;<em>one Elden Ring</em> outfit getting into the gallery. (The really shocking thing is that there’s not a single person sporting an outfit from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> in this latest collection!) That does mean we get some superbly original stuff, including the most stunning Derpy from&nbsp;<em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>. I imagine the next few cosplay galleries we post are going to contain a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more characters from that movie as the sewing catches up.</p> <p>So click on for the finest fits from Anime Expo 2025. And check back soon to see a video of the event, too.</p>

              <p><span>Huntr/x may be a fictional K-pop group, but Netflix has managed to capture one part of real-world K-pop stardom in its official </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> merchandise: photocards. These little pieces of cardboard usually depict fans’ favorite K-pop idols in anything from professional headshots to candid photos you might find on their camera roll. While Netflix is only now really hitting the merchandise angle hard after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-derpy-artist-kids-all-ages-animation-2000621394"><span>animated musical’s runaway success</span></a><span>, one thing it planned ahead for was that fans might want photocards of their favorite members. I even got one of the lead singer, Rumi, when I saw the film at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>sing-along showings last month</span></a><span>. Now, the film’s soundtrack CD is out, and each disc comes with one random photocard of one of the members sealed inside. And since fans love to collect things, the random photocard inside the album has got people buying multiple copies, reselling, and trading like they’re prized </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards.</span></p> <p><span>Because the photocard is randomized, the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack is basically a blind box. Huntr/x has three members, so there’s a 33 percent pull rate for each card. So it’s entirely possible you could buy three copies of the album and get the same photocard each time, like this TikTok user did:</span></p>   <p><span>That’s how the dice fall sometimes. All these collection crazes are essentially gambling, and while the odds of getting all three Huntr/x photo cards are better than those in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>TCG pull, you can still end up spending a pretty penny on multiple copies of the album trying to complete the set. This has made unboxings a new trend within the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>community, much like you see in most TCG fandoms.&nbsp;</span></p>

         <p><span>Unfortunately, this also means that we’re starting to see resellers </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/226950263213?_skw=kpop+demon+hunters+cd+photocard&amp;itmmeta=01K459CDHAKAXC06RYPMFCKCVQ&amp;hash=item34d74a31ad:g:nEQAAeSw6INos~Fc&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1e00N5FWhjTc9V9pI53JjABq5WC9KmiL4ZgdVBpZUY8teNZwcWWlaL7vBKUzypUdUm1F1n55tsaNWQlkEr6eMb2qB9PLELWiX%2Beb1wk%2FfK4tvlegg3QrdH%2BDTltwkDUUMFH%2BCXYQ%2BnFikC0lzc5LRm5ETHV%2Bd0sLdohWpqEbMOMKJLOGb9Ttw%2B%2BwlpTWgIxzGq2i3jGzKtQimfQu3U6o8rh24%2Bzp3Guisao6hcJMx0Ioyycy%2BsUEdsaimtBaRcOU5tGmaPnlsjQWEHnBLZ3efAF%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_TYsamhZg"><span>upcharging for opened copies that have a confirmed photocard</span></a><span>.

Even as a pretty big fan of the movie and its fictional girl group, I can’t stomach the thought of spending that much to try and complete the set. Y’all stay safe out there, though.</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is officially the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>most-watched English film in Netflix’s history</span></a><span>, and the company is reportedly in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>early talks about working with Sony Animation on a sequel</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
