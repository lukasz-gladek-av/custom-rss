Allegedly the former <em>Tonight Show</em> host was trying to find his way to a restaurant to order some food.

He told the outlet that while staying at a Hampton Inn outside of Pittsburgh, he tried to take a shortcut to a restaurant down a steep hill instead of walking a “mile and a half down the road.” He lost his footing and rolled down the hill, hitting several rocks on a small dirt path on his way down. As a result of his fall he broke his wrist, lost a fingernail, gave himself a big shiner on his left eye and bruised much of his face. Three hours later, Leno—now wearing an eye patch—did his comedy show as planned, then went to a hospital after arriving back in Los Angeles, he says. </p><p>Jay Leno did in fact fall down a small but steep hill and got injured. That much is true. And if that’s good enough for you, then you can stop reading right now. But I have questions about everything else. </p><h2 id="h52075"><a id=""></a>Questions about Jay Leno’s Fall</h2><p>For starters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inside Edition</em> later reported</a></span> that after his fall, Leno arrived at a restaurant near the hotel called The Boulevard and ordered a chicken parm. The manager of the restaurant told<em> Inside Edition </em>that Leno arrived at the place without a reservation for lunch, ordered the dish with some garlic bread and then left. </p><p>However, The Boulevard is a restaurant located about 750 feet away from the hotel. That’s not <em>too </em>far away, but Leno told <em>Inside Edition</em> he didn’t have a car at the time. (Which is very ironic considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how many cars this dude owns</a></span>.) </p><figure id="" data-id="5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-recommend-id="image://5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-format="png" data-width="848" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Leno’s path to the Boulevard from his hotel.

They suggest that Leno was craving some Buffalo wings and took the dirt path that had been cut into the hill by other people taking that same shortcut, didn’t realize how steep it was, and fell. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And this makes sense because in a different interview with <em>TMZ</em></a></span>, Leno says that someone at the hotel told him that there was a a good place to eat at “the bottom of this hill.” That sounds like someone pointing Leno to the sports bar at the bottom of the small hill, and not the restaurant up the road for some chicken parm.</p><figure id="" data-id="9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-recommend-id="image://9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-format="png" data-width="950" data-height="690" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path from the hotel to the sports bar located at the bottom of the hill.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adding credence to this theory is the fact after his tumble, Leno visited a local CVS and bought an eye patch, as documented by a worker via a selfie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The nearest CVS is just up the road from the sports bar</a></span>. </p><p>And yet, there’s the small problem that nobody at the sports bar remembers Leno entering and ordering anything that day. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local news site <em>Triblive </em>reports</a></span> that the manager on shift that day doesn’t remember Leno showing up, and nobody he asked could recall seeing the comedian eat some wings. </p><p>So that seems to indicate that the manager at The Boulevard was telling the truth and that Leno walked down to the joint, had some chicken parm, and then left short after falling down the hill and hurting himself. But it’s also possible that someone is trying to spin a good story so a major news outlet will highlight the location for some free publicity.</p><h2 id="h52076"><a id=""></a>What (Probably) Happened, Maybe... </h2><p>I’ve tried to piece together the stories and comments from Leno and everyone else, and I think this is what happened. </p><p>Leno was told he could get some food at a place down the hill from the hotel. He walks out, tries to take a shortcut, and falls. Injured, he likely calls someone (or someone is with him and sees it happen) and they grab a car. </p><p>At this point, someone points out that the restaurant is actually down the road and not in the parking lot near the hotel. So they head over to The Boulevard, Leno orders his chicken parm, eats it, and they drive back up that same road to the CVS at the intersection. He gets what he needs, takes a selfie, and then they continue back on East Pittsburgh street and arrive at the theater so he can do his show. </p><p>Or, Leno got mixed up as to when or where he fell and not everyone remembers what happened clearly and he did eat some wings at that sports bar but nobody noticed because, I mean, how big a star is Jay Leno in 2024? And maybe later Leno had chicken parm at that other place for dinner and the manager is confused about the timing. </p><p>Now I’m going to put away my maps and red string and stop thinking about this. Enjoy your Friday and the rest of the weekend. And be careful walking down hills. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anyone with kids who play with Lego <em>definitely</em> does. As a parent you don’t think that you’ll step on all the crap your fledgling spawn will leave all over the place, but what you don’t know prior to having kids is how braindead you’ll be most of the time just from having kids. But there are hundreds, possibly even thousands of unique Lego bricks. Which piece can cause the most damage?</p><p>That’s the question YouTuber Nate Scovill (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/stepping-on-lego-for-science/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/stepping-on-lego-for-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hackaday</em></a></span>) recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxDVEPb-A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxDVEPb-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set out to answer</a></span> using a mix of the scientific method and <em>Mythbusters</em>-inspired excess. Scovill crowdsourced info from Lego enthusiasts on Reddit and Discord to narrow down the most potentially painful pieces he should research and then used increasingly elaborate instruments to test them.</p><p>First, Scovill used a series of carboard squares pressed onto the Lego pieces in question to record their “gradient of damage” and used a constructed, weighted arm slapping down on the cardboard to simulate the weight of a foot press. Pointed flames, wizard hats, and retro plastic trees all did some of the worst damage.</p><div><p>Not content to judge using the cardboard alone, Scovill also decided to make an entire foot out of ballistic gel. This would record the damage in more detail, and also allow pieces to become lodged deep inside the material if the simulated accident went that poorly. So what Lego piece actually ended up being the most danagerous?</p><p>One you’ve probably never heard of.

Back before the company’s engineers and manufacturing processes were as high-tech and refined as they are today, there were some Lego pieces that actually relied on metal to complete the connection. These red wheels, if stepped on hard at just the right angle,  bring more than a little <em>Home Alone</em>-style pain. Scovill remarks that you’d probably want to make sure your tetanus shots were up-to-date if you got nailed by one of them. </p></div><p>Fortunately for most of us, the pain of stepping on Lego can be exorcised with a few colorful expletives. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
