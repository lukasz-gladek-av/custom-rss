            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2006’s <i>Scarface: The World is Yours</i> is back! Well, maybe. It’s complicated. Possibly illegal. See, the <i>Vice City</i>-lookin’ open-world action-adventure game for PS2, Xbox, and Wii recently resurfaced on Steam and the Epic Games Store. That’s (possibly) good news if you like diving into some gaming deep tracks from the early 21st Century. But it’s bad news if you’re the rights holder to this game because you didn’t give anyone permission to do this.</p> <p>Arriving on Steam and EGS, the loose adaptation of the legendary gangster film is back courtesy of a publisher named EC Digital Entertainment, who promises some graphical upgrades to the 2006 game (yes, they’re “AI-assisted”). But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scarface-pc-re-release-unintentionally-pushed-live-early-on-epic-with-steam-to-follow-but-i-may-smell-a-rat">as <i>Rock Paper Shotgun </i>documents</a>, EC Digital Entertainment doesn’t have much of a history. Based in Hong Kong, their website is blocked for whatever reason, and their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ecdeasia/featured">YouTube page</a> is filled with so many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">tumbleweeds</a> it’s giving me <i>Arc Raiders</i> PTSD flashbacks. What’s more, this version of <i>Scarface</i> includes some QoL mods baked in <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823">without permission from its creators</a>, one of whom is clearly stating “the holder of the <i>Scarface </i>license wasn’t willing to re-release the game.” So how did this happen?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This release reportedly ships SilentPatch and Fusion Fix, and none of us were contacted about this in advance (which isn't necessary as per the license, but would be nice).</p> <p>I KNOW that the holder of the Scarface license wasn't willing to re-release the game, so this is suspect. <a href="https://t.co/eDCWkKys4p">https://t.co/eDCWkKys4p</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>We love a mystery.</p> <p>As flummoxed as any of us by this strange news, the creator of <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/">SilentPatch</a> dug in a bit more to <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980979864707719465">find out that the author</a> of one of the included mods was contacted. However, they also found that the “Movie IP rights holder appears to be unaware [of the Steam and EGS listing]” and that the store pages launched prematurely.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's what I found out so far:<br>* TAG (Fusion Fix author) WAS contacted, they were unable to reach me because of a lost Discord friend invite (despite my e-mail being public)<br>* Movie IP rights holder appears to be unaware of this<br>* Store listings were put early in error</p> <p>Oh boy. <a href="https://t.co/1aaYiyOD2A">https://t.co/1aaYiyOD2A</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1980979864707719465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Weird stuff for sure. You can buy the EGS version right now, though the Steam listing still says “coming soon.”</p> <p>As for the game itself, I faintly remember seeing the box art on store shelves back in the 2000s and at the time thought, “Why wouldn’t I just play <i>GTA</i>?” Al Pacino lent his likeness and personally chose his voice replacement for Tony Montana, but a few other actors from the movie did reprise their roles. Critical reception of the game was mostly positive, hovering around 7’s out of 10’s, with the occasional 6 and one 4.5 out of 10 from <i>Official Xbox Magazine</i>. Sequels and a PSP and Xbox 360 version were planned, but later scrapped.</p> <p>I like seeing old games, possible hidden gems, return from eons past. But it sounds like this rerelease of <i>Scarface</i> might be best avoided for now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-dumps-the-1000xm4-at-50-off-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-or-bose-2000638177</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-dumps-the-1000xm4-at-50-off-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-or-bose.1331653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones typically demand $400 or more, and Apple’s AirPods Max is sitting at $549. Sony just quietly <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">dropped the WH-1000XM4 to an all-time low of $198 on Amazon (down from $348)</a>, which makes these legendary headphones <strong>roughly three times cheaper than AirPods Max</strong> and significantly less expensive than current Bose or Sonos models.</p>
<p>Sure, Sony released the newer 1000XM6 but the upgrades are incremental at best, and this model cost more than double what you’ll pay for the XM4 right now. For daily commuting, office work or travel, the 1000XM4 delivers the same core noise-canceling technology that made Sony’s 1000X series the benchmark everyone else tries to match.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the XM4 Still Competes with Newer Models</h2>
<p>Dual noise sensor technology <strong>employs external and internal microphones on each earcup to pick up and eliminate ambient noise</strong> with surprising accuracy. External mics pick up external noise such as airplane engines, traffic, or air-conditioning systems, and internal mics are listening for what actually ends up in your ear and make adjustments on the fly. This dual-pronged attack creates an area of silence that’s truly impressive, eliminating low-rumble growl of engine noise and higher-pitched chatter of nearby conversations. <strong>Noise cancellation of the XM4 stays on par with the XM5 and XM6 in practical application</strong>, where the variance is slight enough most people would only pick up on the difference by direct comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 30 hours with noise cancellation active</strong>&nbsp;which covers multiple cross-country flights or weeks of daily commuting before you need to recharge. Quick charging adds another convenience layer: a 10-minute charge via the included USB-C cable delivers five hours of playback, so even if you forget to charge them overnight, a quick top-up during breakfast gets you through the day. <strong>This battery performance beats AirPods Max</strong>&nbsp;which manage around 20 hours and lack any fast-charging capability.</p>



<p><em>Speak-to-Chat</em> is one of those features where you think it’s just gimmicky until you actually use it every day. The <strong>headphones sense you beginning to speak and instantly mute your music</strong> and lower noise cancellation so you can hear the person on the other end perfectly. Once you’ve finished speaking, music plays again instantly once silence has lasted for some seconds. This comes in super handy for short conversations with baristas, coworkers visiting your desk, or your family questioning you, so you don’t have to physically mute and take off your headphones to have short conversations.</p>



<p>Excellent call quality results <strong>from five integrated microphones and sophisticated audio signal processing</strong> that separates your voice from noise. Those on the receiving end of calls are able to hear you naturally even where the situation is noisy, e.g., on busy roads or windy situations. Beamforming technology in the microphone array zeroes in on your voice and mutes the noise, and this is key where you are working from home or where you take your calls while commuting.</p>
<p>Multipoint connection <strong>allows you to pair the XM4s with two devices at once</strong> so you can be connected to your laptop to get your job done and your phone so you can take calls. Audio seamlessly switches to whatever device actually has content playing, so the phone call cuts your laptop music without you having to switch it by hand. This ends the constant dance of re-pairing your single-connection headphones have to go through every time you switch between devices.</p>
<p>At $198, the <strong>1000XM4 represents roughly 36% of the price you pay for AirPods Max</strong> but provides the same or superior noise cancellation, increased battery life, and additional features.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-cuts-50-off-for-final-clearance-sale-2000638162</link>

              <p>Missing a package delivery because you didn’t hear the doorbell or weren’t sure if someone actually rang feels frustrating, especially when you’ve been waiting days for that shipment. The Ring battery doorbell <em>Plus</em> solves this by giving you real-time alerts, two-way communication with visitors and a full head-to-toe video view of whoever’s standing at your door – all accessible from your phone no matter where you are. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/">just slashed it to an all-time low of $79 (down from $149), making this one of the most affordable ways to add smart home security</a> to your front entrance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Video From Head-to-Toe Really Matters</h2>
<p>The wider-angle view through the Ring <em>Plus</em> doorbell captures visitors from the head down to the heel, rather than cutting them off at chest level, like most standard doorbells. That makes all the difference when delivery personnel deposit packages at your feet and go or when you’ll be able to determine whether someone’s holding something. <strong>HD+ video resolution gives you higher definition than standard HD</strong> so you’ll be better able to distinguish faces, read package labeling, or make out identifying characteristics on cars parked nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Color night vision</strong> eliminates the guesswork of nighttime visitors. Old-time infrared night vision provides you with grayscale video, making it harder to distinguish clothing colors, type of vehicle, or other details useful for identification. Color night vision performs better under ambient light and amplifies what light you have, providing usable color video even where the light gets low.</p>



<p>Motion detection triggers alerts the moment someone enters your field of view of your doorbell camera so you have early notification even before they press the button. You have the ability to block off some of the zones within the camera view, like your neighbor’s window or the busy sidewalk, so you only get alerts of motions you actually are interested in.</p>
<p>The Quick Release Battery Pack makes recharging simple: You remove the battery,<strong> charge indoors through the normal USB cable and click the battery back into place without removing the whole doorbell</strong>. This setup eclipses hardwired doorbells where your current doorbell cabling is poor or doesn’t exist, and eliminates the requirement to call an electrician to install the doorbell. <strong>Recharge time covers several weeks to months</strong>, dependent on the level of use, and some owners have a second battery kept charged so they can switch immediately without downtime.</p>



<p>Installation involves setting up the doorbell to your door frame or wall by using the hardware provided and plugging it into your WiFi through the Ring application. <strong>Installation typically takes 15-30 minutes</strong> or so for the average person, and you won’t require any special equipment aside from the use of a screwdriver.</p>
<p>With two-way audio, you can speak to delivery people, say to visitors you’ll be there in just a minute or deter suspicious individuals without having to open your door. The quality of the speaker and microphone is good enough for average conversation, and the lag between someone speaking and you hearing it is negligible. Your real-time communication makes the doorbell system an intercom system you can use anywhere you have internet access.</p>
<p>At $79, the Ring doorbell <em>Plus</em> is cheaper than most of the bare-bones doorbells available without any smart features whatsoever.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-offloads-its-xbox-controller-2025-edition-now-cheaper-than-buying-one-game-2000638170</link>

              <p>Controllers wear out, drift develops and replacement costs add up quickly when you’re paying $60-70 for a new one. Microsoft’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Xbox wireless controller just dropped to an all-time low of $49 on Amazon (down from $64)</a> and this isn’t just an Xbox accessory anymore. This controller works across Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, Android and iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs and even VR headsets which makes it one of the most compatible gaming controllers available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the 2025 Edition Worth Upgrading To</h2>
<p>The modernized design refines the ergonomics that made Xbox controllers comfortable in the first place with s<strong>culpted surfaces and updated geometry that reduce hand fatigue</strong> during extended gaming sessions. The changes are subtle rather than radical, maintaining the familiar Xbox layout while improving grip points and button placement based on years of user feedback. <strong>Battery life extends up to 40 hours</strong> on a pair of AA batterie, which translates to weeks of gaming for casual players or about a week for heavy users before needing replacements.</p>
<p>The <strong>hybrid D-pad</strong> is an evolution of functionality beyond earlier Xbox controllers: It integrates the precision of an old-school cross-shaped D-pad and the smooth motion of a circular disc, providing you with increased control while playing fighting games, platformers, and menus. Faceted construction gives you tactile feedback so you’ll be able to learn which way you are pressing without glancing down which makes the difference in fast-paced titles where keeping your eyes on the screen and off your thumbs makes all the difference.<strong> Textured grips on the triggers, the bumpers, and the back case enhance control</strong> while you’re handling intense situations where your hands are likely to be sweaty or you are inputting fast movements.</p>



<p>The <strong>Share button is a quality-of-life addition</strong> that simplifies content creation. Instead of memorizing button combinations to capture screenshots or start recording gameplay, you press one dedicated button. The controller communicates with your device to trigger the native capture function, so screenshots save directly to your Xbox, PC, or mobile device’s storage. For streamers or anyone who shares gameplay clips on social media, this one-button approach eliminates fumbling with menus mid-game and reduces the chances of missing the moment you wanted to capture.</p>
<p>Xbox<strong> wireless and Bluetooth dual connectivity</strong> makes this controller fully cross-platform compatible. Xbox Wireless provides the lowest possible latency connectivity to Xbox consoles and Windows PCs along with Xbox Wireless adapter, and Bluetooth takes care of the rest, including smartphones, tablets, Fire TV sticks, and play-capable smart TVs. You can pair the controller to multiple devices and jump between the same without having to re-pair them every time you switch, and this comes in useful should you play your Xbox in the evenings and your PC during break times.</p>



<p>The 3<strong>.5mm headset jack is still compatible</strong> with any wired gaming headset, so you won’t be bothered with the use of USB adapters or wireless dongles whenever you want personal audio. You just plug in your headphones and audio comes through the controller immediately with volume and chat mix controls accessible through your system settings. The dual-role function of the USB-C connector is to not only have direct wired hookups to consoles or computers for zero-lag input and zero-battery concern, but you can also charge replaceable battery packs should you be using the Play and Charge Kit by Microsoft or even third-party alternatives.</p>
<p>Custom button remapping using the Xbox Accessories app allows you to map any button to another action and this is invaluable for accessibility or personal expression. If you don’t like certain button layouts or would like to map controls better suited to the layout of another game, you have the ability to do so without resorting to the in-game options or those that do not exist.</p>
<p>At $49, the controller is l<strong>ess expensive than budget third-party controllers</strong> but provides you with first-party quality and compatibility on a crazy list of hardware.</p>
