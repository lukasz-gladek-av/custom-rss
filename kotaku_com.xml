              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, the next game from <i>The Finals </i>developer Embark Studios, launches on October 30, 2025 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>As a PvPvE extraction shooter, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> sees you setting out to explore and loot the remains of a fallen civilization still under control of a lethal artificial intelligence system known as “Arc.”</p> <p>The game has already been in the hands of players via a few technical tests and the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Still, you might not know much about <i>Arc Raiders</i> or extraction shooters as a genre, and as someone who’s pretty excited about the game, I’d like to do what I can to make it as approachable as possible for potential players. So let’s break down everything you need to know about this game ahead of its release, from how many maps the game provides to the overall flow of your average match.</p>

  <h2>It’s you versus them, and also <i>them</i></h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> is a PvPvE extraction shooter. That means you and a team of up to three are fighting real humans as well as the game’s computer-controlled bots, but your main “goal” is to leave the map alive within a certain time–which in theory you could do without firing a single shot. You can leave via multiple elevators on the map, each of which have a timer on them. You can also find or buy keys to escape hatches that make for an even speedier getaway.</p>

It makes for an intense game in which you need to think a few steps ahead of each action you take, and always keep an escape route in mind should you realize you’ve gotten yourself in over your head.</p>

   <p>Get out alive, and you keep everything you came in with, plus whatever you found. Die, and you’ll lose everything. You do have access to a “safe pocket” in your inventory, however, where you can stash a lone precious item to make it to the other side should you perish.</p>

 <p>As you explore the maps, you’ll find countless places to loot. Abandoned cars, file cabinets and desk drawers from empty offices and facilities, storage containers, and much more.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639951"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639951">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll also have a variety of quests you can take on, some of which ask you to loot specific items, while others ask you to take down some of the game’s bots, or “Arc” as they’re referred to in-universe. Quest progress is maintained even if you die, and you’ll earn XP after each match which can be used to improve your character’s stats, so death is not a total loss.</p>

You can also trade with a variety of NPCs.</p>

 <p>You als0 have a pet rooster named Scrappy who’s always happy to see you after a match, giving you some minor crafting supplies when you return. If you’ve had a bad streak of losses, Scrappy will give you extra crafting materials as a consolation for your repeat losses.</p> <p>Zoom out, and we see the loop of the game: Venture out onto the maps, find what you can, avoid or engage in battles with humans or machines, return home and build better gear for your next run.</p> <h2>A closer look at <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ maps on launch</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> launches with four main maps, each set in a post-apocalyptic Italy with their own unique difficulty levels and points-of-interest. These maps are: Dam Battlegrounds, Buried City, the Spaceport, and the Blue Gate. There’s also a practice range and a mysterious location called “Stella Montis” which we don’t know a whole lot about ahead of release.</p>

 <p>The maps offer up a nice level of variety. Dam Battlegrounds, with its thick swamps and forests, makes for some brutal, <i>Predator</i>-esque battles and chase scenarios.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639952"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639952">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Buried City is a smaller, more urban setting with some excellent sightlines across the tops of its roofs (there are going to be some intense sniper battles here, I can already tell).</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639946"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639946">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Spaceport is another large map. My time on this map during a preview event was cut short due to, well, some very aggressive players. It’s very pretty though!</p>

 <p>Lastly, the Blue Gate is a gorgeous, mountainous map with tons of rolling hills that makes for some excellent battles with other players. It’s easily the toughest map, however, with aggressive Arc presence. There are also some lovely, labyrinthine mazes of steel and concrete under the surface to get lost in.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639947" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639947"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639947">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Dam Battlegrounds is perhaps my favorite at the moment. As someone who prefers stealthy tactics, having bushes and trees to fall back to and hide in works well with my style. But I’d be lying if I said hunting down other players in the mountainous terrain of the Blue Gate didn’t give me a rush.</p> <h2>Which is worse, machines or other players?</h2> <p>The titular “Arc” come in <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/ARC">a variety of forms</a>. With threats ranging from the different drone types who survey the ground below for human threats, to smaller patrolling orbs and little spiders (or “Ticks” as the game calls them) that monitor the insides of abandoned buildings, you’ll have to keep your eyes peeled. And they’re not afraid to just insert themselves into a skirmish with players, so don’t be surprised if you get swarmed by some once they see or hear you trading shots.</p>

   <p>There are also larger threats. The spider-like Leapers can, as the name implies, leap across incredible distances in their pursuit. There’s also the Queen, which often guards precious loot, particularly on the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p>   <p>These machines are resilient and aggressive in their desire to eliminate human threats, and you’ll have to place your shots well to destroy vulnerable parts and take them down.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639950"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639950">© Gif: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Speaking of those human threats, you also have other players to contend with, who pose a challenge equal to their skills with the game and the quality of their gear. Kill a human and a flare launches up into the air, letting just about anyone nearby know that a fight just went down and there’s gear for the taking.</p> <p>Without universal objectives for every player, extraction shooters can make for some truly unexpected encounters with other humans. And admittedly, it can feel a little unfair when someone kills you from an unexpected hiding place.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">I Asked <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">Speaking with <i>Kotaku</i></a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ design director Virgil Watkins said that the game is designed in such a way that “you should always have time to understand and react to what is happening to you.” With a longer time-to-kill (TTK) than most games in the genre, the game is designed to give you time to react. On combat with other players, Watkins said:</p> <blockquote><p>On even footing, the way TTK is balanced, if you’re full health and full shields, and so am I, and you attack me first, there’s a very solid chance that I will probably be able to back away, disengage, and do something to mitigate that situation. We really like when our fights have a lot of back and forth rather than just instantaneous [death].</p></blockquote> <p>Each map is also full of opportunities to hear other players nearby. Players make noticeable sounds not only while walking or running, but also when breaking into loot caches, tripping security cameras and metal detectors in abandoned interiors, scaring birds in the wild who take flight, and attracting attention from Arc. All of these can signal to you that another player is nearby, or give your presence away to someone else.</p>

 <p>This all complicates any approach to stealthily moving through a map. But it also means that you can set up some solid ambush opportunities by keeping your ears open for nearby threats, especially with the generous hiding spots on the game’s maps.</p> <h2>Is <i>Arc Raiders</i> too hardcore?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639896">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve long been <a href="https://kotaku.com/extraction-shooter-dmz-tarkov-cycle-battle-royale-1850287778">a fan of the extraction shooter genre</a>. It brings together a variety of different game systems in a unique way that makes for an unpredictable and irresistible experience. But I get that the genre is not everyone’s cup of tea, especially given how lethal and mean it can be. Losing all of your gear can be a painful setback that isn’t easy to bounce back from. Embark Studios is aware of this and has built <i>Arc Raiders</i> to be a more approachable take on an otherwise hardcore genre.</p>

 <p>“Approachability was a key design tenet,” Watkins told me during our interview. Maintaining quest progress even after defeat, earning crafting supplies from Scrappy, and having multiple ways to extract means that it’s very doable to plan your way to victory at your own pace while also having a solid safety net to fall back on should you lose.</p> <hr> <p>Defeat is a crushing experience in an extraction shooter. But <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">as I’ve said before</a>, those deep lows make for exhilarating highs when you come out alive from a tense battle or manage to get away with a sweet amount of loot.</p> <p>Ahead of release, however, we’ve only gotten a taste of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ maps, its arsenal, and its threats. How the full experience will evolve over time remains to be seen, but based on my time with the game during its technical previews, I’m eager to see what wild, unexpected moments will happen out there in post-apocalyptic Italy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battle-suit-aces-review-impressions-chef-brigade-trinket-2000639931</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-team-behind-one-of-2017%E2%80%99s-most-underrated-games-is-back-with-another-banger.1338640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>2017 was one of the all-time great years for video games, with major tentpole games like </span><i><span>Super Mario Odyssey</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>dominating GOTY conversations. So if you missed out on some of the hidden gems of that year, I wouldn’t blame you. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/battle-chef-brigade-the-kotaku-review-1820617722"><i><span>Battle Chef Brigade</span></i></a><span> is one of those precious games that might have gotten lost in the shuffle, and Trinket Studios’ match-three/brawler/cooking game still holds up in 2025. However, the studio didn’t just try and make lighting strike twice with its latest project that’s out now on PC, PS5, and Switch. </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces </span></i><span>is a much different game than its predecessor, but it’s no less stylish, endearing, and compelling.</span></p> <p><span>I want to rely on some easy lexicon to describe </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span>, but I fear calling it a deckbuilder might give you the wrong impression. The game’s strategic battles are played with a deck of cards, each representing a different member of its mech-piloting crew, but these conflicts are less about getting mired in the mechanical complexities of individual cards than they are solving a puzzle with a randomized set of tools. Each card pulls from a different set of colored energies that replenish each turn to unleash attacks on the opposing team, and they all have different attack patterns on the game’s 5v5 field. So card placement on the board is just as important as your deck composition, and can be the difference between gaining the upper hand in a match or being outplayed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Firepower isn’t enough to win every time, though, and that’s where secondary effects and synergy come into play. Each pilot has additional perks, such as how Felix, the carefree white-haired hottie whom I’ve been lusting after my whole playthrough, is able to unleash a more powerful attack after his teammates destroy a certain number of enemy units. Yan’s mech is able to pierce through enemies, meaning it can fire a beam through an opposing card while also directly hitting their ship, which is similar to attacking your foe’s Life Points directly in a game of </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>. If you can destroy an enemy ship, you automatically win a duel. You don’t need a piercing ability to do it, as leaving any of the five spaces on the field empty leaves you and your enemies vulnerable to a direct attack. So, having units that can attack multiple spaces or really take advantage of an opening is a pretty reliable strategy, but more often than not, your foes will have more cannon fodder to put between your crew and their ship.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639933"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639933">© Trinket Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At first, I didn’t quite see the depth of </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span> until I started playing around in the simulations on my ship that would give me only a few cards and challenge me with something like winning the fight it set up in one turn. These typically required me to take advantage of passive perks in order to set off a chain of attacks that relied on precise positioning and an order of operations to activate. I could read the card descriptions, such as the explanation of Daciana’s passive ability to proc a free attack every time one of her allies destroyed an enemy, but seeing the cards in action is what made the game click for me. These plays are why I’m more inclined to describe </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span> as a turn-based strategy game rather than a deck builder, because you only have a handful of units, and the game doesn’t make you create decks of dozens of cards with a ton of minutiae to memorize. Once you see a lot of these characters playing off each other on the field, those bespoke mechanics naturally weave themselves into your strategies without the game becoming too overwhelming.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the five or so hours I’ve put into </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span> so far, the game has pretty gently eased me into its whole deal, and the simple but satisfying card battles are only one slice of it. Those cards have names and faces, and the crew you’ll recruit into your deck is a big reason the game is so breezy. </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces </span></i><span>stars Heathcliff, the captain of a starcraft called the USS Zephyr. In his spaceflight adventures, he and his crew meet several other mech pilots who are all typically game to join their cause as they investigate ancient cosmic secrets. Recruiting these characters gets you a new card for your deck, but it also puts another misfit on your ship. They chat with you, but also with each other, so there’s a constant sense of camaraderie and community between the group. Thus far, everyone’s pretty likable, and I’m interested to see their relationships grow not only with me as the player, but with each other, as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639932" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639932"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639932">© Trinket Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These relationships are elevated by </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span>’ incredible character art and best-in-class voice acting. The anime-inspired art style looks straight out of classic mech anime like </span><i><span>Gundam </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Evangelion</span></i><span>, though its chipper tone helps differentiate it from the latter. Everyone is hot and wearing a plug suit, so there’s something for everyone here. The game is full of memorable performances from some talented voice acting veterans, and I’ve really enjoyed listening to their interactions between duels, which help give the whole thing an authentic classic anime feel.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Battle Suit Aces </span></i><span>has a lot to offer without ever getting too in the weeds that it becomes overwhelming. Much like </span><i><span>Battle Chef Brigade</span></i><span>, it manages to hit the sweet spot between tactical and approachable without ever veering too far into one or the other. Its skill expression is vast, its characters are easy to love, and it marries both sides of its world in a way that keeps me playing for just one more match. I’m looking forward to seeing where the USS Zephyr’s crew takes me as our journey through space continues.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a> is out today and finally available to play for anyone who didn’t pay for the early access edition. That includes tons of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-october-november-2025-powerwash-sim-2-2000638198">Game Pass subscribers</a> across Xbox Series X/S and PC. There’s just one problem: A sudden Microsoft Azure outage is causing issues as another slice of the internet faces unexpected downtime.</p> <p>“Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services,” the company <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status">announced on Wednesday</a>. “In addition, customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal.” Microsoft is currently blaming a “configuration change error” for the downtime.</p>

 <p>Customers impacted include Xbox and its first-party game studios, who rely on Azure systems to distribute their games digitally across console and PC.</p> <p>“Due to an ongoing Azure service outage, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> may be temporarily unavailable to purchase or install on Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app on PC, and with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass,” developer Obsidian Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/OESupport/status/1983582678306975855">wrote on X</a>. “We’re working with Microsoft to resolve the issue and will update players when we have more information.”</p>

 <p>“The pre-installed game just vanished from my Xbox App today,” replied one fan. “How’s that even possible?” Another user on Steam wrote, “I can’t launch my copy on Game Pass. So it’s not working even if you have it installed. Just says something about not being able to sign you in.” Ahhh, the power of the cloud!</p> <p>This hiccup comes <a href="https://kotaku.com/robox-fortnite-outage-amazon-aws-explained-single-bug-god-of-war-xbox-forza-2000639249">a week after the major AWS outage</a> that briefly brought down major games like <em>Fortnite</em> and<em> Roblox</em>. It seems bad that just three companies are responsible for the modern infrastructure of the internet. Ah, well, nevertheless.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On October 29, 1995, just over 12 million viewers tuned into the newest episode of Fox’s hit animated (and very 2D) comedy, <em>The Simpsons</em>, and were shocked to see Homer become 3D. Pulling this off was incredibly challenging, but the end result is a wonderful time capsule of early computer animation.</p> <p><em>The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror VI</em> is one of the best installments of the show’s annual Halloween special. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-13-best-simpsons-treehouse-of-horror-segments-1850470445">two parts of the episode made our top 13 best <em>Treehouse of Horror</em> segments list</a>. One of those two segments is perhaps the most ambitious and wildest thing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544"><em>The Simpsons</em></a> has ever done. In the segment <em>Homer</em>³<em> (Homer Cubed),</em> we see the famous cartoon father and husband leave his 2D dimension via a portal behind a bookcase and enter a 3D computer-generated landscape. What follows is about four minutes of a 3D, computer-generated Homer exploring an odd world filled with simple objects, random pools of water, and even the library from the game <em>Myst</em>.</p>

  <p>At one point while exploring this bizarre 3D world, Homer says, “Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I’m wasting a fortune just standing here.” And he wasn’t joking. As explained in the fantastic oral history of this segment, <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2018/10/19/the-simpsons-homer-cubed-treehouse-of-horror-vi/">written up by <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> in 2018</a>, it was estimated that the four minutes of 3D animation seen in <em>Treehouse of Horror VI</em> cost “hundreds of thousands of dollars.” However, Fox only paid <span>Pacific Data Images–the CG studio behind the animation–a measly $6,000 for the work.&nbsp;</span>Tim Johnson, the head of PDI’s character animation group, broke the news to the company’s founder, Carl Rosendahl.</p>

 <p>“Here’s the good news: <em>The Simpsons</em> has this amazing script, and we can participate,” said Johnson. “Carl just got up out of his chair and paced the room—he was so excited. I said, ‘Well, here’s the <em>bad</em> news: They don’t have any money to pay for it.’ So Carl sat back down and ran the numbers.”</p>

 <p>Ultimately, the company agreed to do the animation because it was seen as a big opportunity for the company. And it did pay off, in the end. Not long after this episode aired, Dreamworks bought up a big chunk of PDI, and Johnson would end up co-directing <em>Antz</em>. The company even helped on <em>Shrek</em>. PDI was still making CG shorts for Dreamworks up until it shut down in 2015.</p> <p>The end result was something that hadn’t really been seen on TV before, and it blew people’s minds. Today, this kind of thing could be created by a single person with one computer in a few days or hours. But back in October 1995, a month before <em>Toy Story</em> hit theaters, this kind of 3D animation was incredibly rare. And the only reason it happened was because PDI decided to do it basically for free. The end result is something very special. 30 years later, this segment is still great, even if the then-impressive tech has aged a lot since it first aired in the ’90s. Sure, it’s not the scariest or funniest segment in <em>The Simpsons’</em> long history, but it’s one of its most memorable, even three decades later. (<a href="https://ew.com/tv/2018/10/19/the-simpsons-homer-cubed-treehouse-of-horror-vi/">Oh, and you should totally read the full <em>EW</em> history of this segment if you are a Simpsons nerd. So much good stuff in there!</a>)</p>
