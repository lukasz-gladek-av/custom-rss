            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">The Steam Machine</a> marks Valve’s long-awaited return to the console wars. It looks slick and sounds powerful enough to play modern games on decent settings. But Valve is leaving the biggest question of all unanswered: how much will it cost? There’s no official price tag yet, though we do have some early clues that point to the Steam Machine being at least $800 or more.</p>

 <p>Valve probably wants to wait until closer to launch before committing to a price tag for both the 512GB and 2TB models. It wouldn’t want a repeat of what happened to the Nintendo Switch 2 when President Trump <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">torpedoed the <em>Mario</em> maker’s initial pre-order plans</a> by announcing massive tariffs days before they were set to begin. Valve is promising to reveal more information in early 2026. But that doesn’t mean we’re completely in the dark about how much the Steam Machine will cost.</p>

 <p>“Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs,” Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">told <em>The Verge</em></a> when it asked it if would cost more than PS5 Pro. Designer Pierre-Loup Griffais elaborated a bit more. “We intend for it to be positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space, but to be very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts,” he said.</p>

 <p>Based on <em>The Verge</em>‘s napkin math, building a PC from off-the-shelf parts to match the Steam Machine’s specs would start at around $800, but it wouldn’t get you anywhere close to the living room device’s small, compact footprint. That would require spending closer to $1,000, before taking into account things like storage. The PS5 Pro starts at $750 and comes with 2TB of storage, but it’s also benefitting from a massive supply chain operation from a company that’s been mass-manufacturing home consoles for decades.</p>

  <p>Still, it sounds like Valve doesn’t just want the Steam Machine to cater to existing PC gamers who are used to investing $1,500 and beyond in new rigs. Affordability also sounds like a top priority and there’s always the question of how much of the upfront cost of the hardware Valve is willing to eat on its end. A bigger Steam install base ultimately means more people paying Valve a 30-percent commission on every game they buy.</p>

 <p>“But we obviously also wanted to make the device affordable,” Valve engineer Yazan Aldehayyat <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview">told<em> IGN</em></a> “We understand that affordability is really important, so we kept that in mind and made sure that’s a device that’s going to be reachable for a lot of people.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it’s just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible.”</p> <p>Whether Valve can keep the Steam Machine pricing “console-level” will ultimately determine whether it ends up feeling like a pricey PC accessory like the ROG Xbox Ally X or a real competitor in the broader console gaming space. It could also be a bellwether indicating if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">next-gen Xbox and PlayStation 6</a> stay in the realm of $500-$600 or start pushing the barrier to entry even higher.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In a world where video game consoles are largely becoming PCs for your TV, it makes sense that Valve would be jumping back into the console market with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535"><span>a new Steam Machine</span></a><span>. The original Steam Machine launched in 2015 and let you play your PC games on your TV, but the project was short-lived. Valve </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-brief-history-of-steam-machines-1824290873"><span>stopped selling the thing in 2018</span></a><span>, but hasn’t stopped trying to bring PC gaming and the SteamOS to new formats. Just take a look at the Steam Deck. Now, the Steam Machine is back with a new model for a new era. Will the public be more receptive this time around?</span></p>

 <p><span>We don’t have a price or release date for the new Steam Machine just yet beyond a 2026 window, and the cost will likely color how folks react to the device overall. We do know that the cube-like computer is around six times more powerful than the Steam Deck is. The six-inch tall box has a sleek, lowkey design that the PlayStation 5’s Seto-Kaiba-ass popped collar could learn from, and its controller has traditional analog sticks on top of the signature trackpad that made the original’s controller an oddity. It also doubles as a full-blown PC you can install non-gaming apps on. If Valve makes it a reasonable price, I could see it popping off, especially with the libraries of many consoles being nearly indistinguishable from that of the PC these days. A PC you play on your TV could easily become a viable alternative to buying a PlayStation or Xbox down the line.</span></p>

 <p><span>When the new Steam Machine launches, Valve’s digital storefront will be adding a new indicator for games that perform optimally on the device, similar to the Steam Deck verification games go through now. </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-machine-hands-on-first-impressions?utm_source=threads,twitter"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> says that the Steam Machine is about as powerful as a last-generation PC, which means some modern games may have some performance struggles, but their experience with the device was an overall positive one.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Valve says it intends for the Steam Machine to be able to play all current games at 4K with FSR upscaling, but there are going to be plenty of games – especially ones running on Unreal Engine 5 – where you’ll have to lower settings to get it running at a smooth frame rate,” Jacqueline Thomas writes. “Ultimately, I’ll have to get it in the lab to benchmark it to see exactly what it’ll be capable of, but I have little doubt this PC will be running most things – it’s just that the quality settings are definitely going to vary.”</span></p>

 <p><span>For now, the device is giving people a lot to speculate about, from the impact it could have on the console market to what kind of faceplates they can slap on the side of the thing to just how much it’s actually going to cost.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Valve just casually dropping a complete game changer for the console space with their own home console, the Steam Machine.</p> <p>This is going to be a gigantic shake-up for Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox.

It could have a console, handheld, and VR headset leading the pack in multiple markets. PlayStation and Xbox are trying to carve out their space in those niches, but it would be kind of wild if Valve became the industry’s most notable triple threat.</span></p>
