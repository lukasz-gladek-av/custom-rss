Geralt, exhausted and ornery from his latest fallout with the sorcerer Yennifer, embarks on a little side-quest with the bard Dandelion to try to prevent all-out war between land dwellers and Merpeople. Lots of grunting, grim quips, and bloody fights ensue.</p><p>I’m still not sold on the animation style, and hopefully there are more twists than meet the eye in the full movie, but any chance to watch Doug Cockle, Geralt’s voice actor from the video game trilogy, reprise his role is welcome. The actor is also set to return in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322">some form for <em>The Witcher 4</em></a></span>, but that sequel, possibly still years away, will focus primarily on his mentee, Ciri. </p><p><em>Sirens of The Deep</em> is set in the middle of season 1 of Netflix’s live-action <em>Witcher</em> series. That show wrapped season three in 2023 and has been MIA ever since.

Since it launched, the game has received numerous updates  improving the mode, introducing new features, and adding new songs. And now Epic has added what might be the best feature yet.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/virtual-artist-hatsune-miku-beams-into-fortnite-festival-season-7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/virtual-artist-hatsune-miku-beams-into-fortnite-festival-season-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On January 13, Epic Games released Season 7</a></span> of <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. The new season is headlined by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/yPuI4l0jK7s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/yPuI4l0jK7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hatsune Miku</a></span> and includes music from the digital pop star as well as items based on her design. But this season also added local multiplayer. Yes, you can  finally invite your friends over and (sort of) recreate the magic of <em>Rock Band</em> in <em>Fortnite </em>via 4 player same screen co-op.</p><p>Even better,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-festival-season-3-guitar-controller-support-pc-1851429714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-festival-season-3-guitar-controller-support-pc-1851429714"> back in Season 3</a></span>, Epic added plastic guitar support for <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. So you might be able to pull out that old Xbox or PlayStation guitar from the closet and hook it up and jam together with players using controllers.</p><p>Now there are some restrictions on <em>Festival </em>local play. A small one is that this co-op mode is only available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.  The bigger restriction is that each player needs to have an Epic Games account and be signed into the console and <em>Fortnite</em>. Epic specifically says you can’t use guest accounts on either console. That’s annoying, but to get around this you could just create a few free Epic Game accounts and tie them to some free PSN or Xbox accounts. Then, when people come over to jam, just log each controller into those dummy accounts before playing.</p><p> Sadly, <em>Fortnite </em>has yet to add plastic drum support or the ability to use a microphone, so it ain’t quite a full <em>Rock Band</em> replacement yet. But hey, we’re getting there!</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Still, the man who helped bring WWE <em>Backlash</em> to his home country of Puerto Rico, has more on his wrestling bucket list. “I want to do it one more time. I want to put my life at risk in the ring. I felt like I didn’t risk it enough in the ring, and I want to do it. “”</p><p>Him claiming to not risk his life enough is either objectively wrong or a frightening admission of his disregard for his body. Damian Priest suplexed him off two equipment boxes through a table at <em>Backlash</em>, he jumped off the top rope onto two men at the <em>Royal Rumble</em>, and got chokeslammed through an announcer table. I’m not sure what else his mother would need to see to fear for her son’s life. </p><p>He’s currently enjoying his sixth album <em>Debí Tirar Más Fotos</em> reaching #2 on the Billboard 200 charts. But, if he had it his way, music would take a backseat to throwing his body around in wrestling matches. “Sometimes, I say, “I’m going to quit everything and just do wrestling full time.” I feel like in wrestling, I just go sporadically as a celebrity. I’m going to go full time and be a heel. That’s what I’d love.”</p><p>While a full-time wrestling career may be a far away dream, him returning to wrestling is probably inevitable.
