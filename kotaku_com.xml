            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> Chapter 7 introduced a Kim Kardashian skin into the battle royale’s shop as part of its Icon series, and though the media mogul and long-time law student wouldn’t be my first choice, she’s apparently everyone else’s (</span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-kim-k-most-popular-skin-landslide/"><span>h/t TheGamer</span></a><span>). According to recent stats from the independently operated site </span><a href="http://fortnite.gg/"><span>Fortnite.GG</span></a><span>, which scrapes publicly available information from the game and presents it in easy-to-read graphs, the “Iconic Kim Kardashian” skin, which first hit </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s shop on December 13, is the most popular skin of the season, with around 5 percent of players using it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For reference, the second-most used skin in Chapter 7 is Backlash, a sought-after, in-universe cosmetic that some players believe offers an in-game advantage because it can somewhat camouflage itself in certain areas on the map. Then there’s Cat Holloway, another in-universe character, followed by Chani, Zendaya’s character from the </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span> series. There are only four other skins in the top 15 that aren’t original </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> creations: Catwoman, rapper Playboi Carti, Lara Croft, and The Bride from </span><i><span>Kill Bill</span></i><span>. According to Fortnite GG, Kim Kardashian ranks 70th in all-time </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> cosmetic usage, and she’s only been available for a week and a half.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Kim Kardashian bundle, which is available in-store until December 28, is currently on sale for 3,000 V-Bucks (which is around $19). The bundle includes the Iconic Kim Kardashian skin (a black, latex-style catsuit reminiscent of one of her SKIMS styles); a regular Kim Kardashian skin (a removable fur coat, crop-top, and pants), two backpacks, two pickaxes, two emotes, and a glider.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though I find some of her items to be painfully boring, this is one of the better </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> skins I’ve seen for a major celebrity in terms of its recreation of Kardashian’s likeness (likely because she is particularly precious with her image) and its variety, which we’ll get to in a sec.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2025 was a big year for Dill Bits. <a href="https://t.co/JqZ3LWna8S">pic.twitter.com/JqZ3LWna8S</a></p> <p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/2002725861011947999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>A </span><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2002725861011947999/photo/1"><span>December 21 post on the official </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> X account</span></a><span> showing some 2025 highlights suggests these numbers are fairly accurate: the graphic shows that there were 37.5 million games played with Kim Kardashian (and 6.7 million games played with full squads of Sabrina Carpenters).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Kim Kardashian has a massive reach in the world of pop culture—her TV show, </span><i><span>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</span></i><span>, regularly pulls in millions of viewers, and she has over 350 million followers on Instagram, putting her in the top ten most-followed accounts on the social media app (she’s got more than </span><span>Beyoncé</span><span>).&nbsp; But I think her popularity as a </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> skin isn’t </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> because she’s a shrewd businesswoman who has cleverly tied her pop culture image into several successful brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>First, the Kim Kardashian Icon skin is incredibly customizable, more so than most skins in the game. Like Kardashian herself, many of the items in her bundle are basic. The crop top outfit is pedestrian, the makeup brush pick axe is expected (and she doesn’t even have a makeup brand anymore), and the private jet glider is whatever. But her Iconic catsuit skin has </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> many variations that you’re getting a ton of value for the cost. It can be a tank top, a mock neck, a turtle neck, or strapless. You can choose from seven different colors, some of which look more metallic or latex-y than others. You can put gloves on her or remove them. She can wear sunglasses or not. And her hair can be up in a messy bun, or down and either blonde or brunette.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s this customization, coupled with </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s vibrant community of girls and gays, that makes Kardashian’s skin so popular. Now the crew can drop in as a whole squad of varied Kims and mine the skin for its rich meme potential. I’ve seen dozens of clips of Kim K players </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@royaljkr/video/7583534305326959894"><span>hunting down a Chun-Li,</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fasher_off/video/7583810227443666198"><span>dancing in a circle with Peely</span></a><span>, or using the pocketbook pickaxe to</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@user1235787271/video/7583773343791336759"><span> recreate an iconic </span><i><span>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</span></i><span> clip.</span></a><span> Sabrina Carpenter’s skin was popular for similar reasons: it had several style options and, when coupled with her TikTok-friendly music and emotes, offered a steady stream of clip fodder.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And of course, there’s the gooner element. </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> players used to love the aforementioned Chun-Li skin because of her ample ass, and now they’ve got Kim Kardashian’s behind to ogle while playing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you want to get </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s Kim Kardashian skin, it’s available until December 28.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking for a new portable speaker that’s great for taking anywhere you go? The Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is a great choice. Like all Marshall speakers, the Stanmore III has that classic Marshall look and feel that goes well with a bookshelf, desk, or media center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/">You can find the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker on Amazon for $299, previously priced at $400.</a> That’s $101 off and a 25% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable speaker fit for a rock star</h2>
<p>The Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker provides a high-quality, full-sounding output of music. This comes from the combination of two types of speakers (tweeters &amp; woofers) working together to provide clean and defined highs, as well as deep, rich lows. So no matter what you’re listening to, the audio feels very balanced and fun to listen to. The woven-grille fabric cover on the front protects the speakers from dirt and minor bumps. And its tribute to rock history makes it a fun addition to any collection.</p>
<p>Connecting your mobile device to the speaker via Bluetooth is extremely easy and fast. Once connected, there are no cords to mess with, and you’ll be able to control your playlists from anywhere in the room. Since this speaker allows multiple connections at one time, you can easily switch between users without having to disconnect and reconnect each time. This makes it perfect for parties or gatherings, where many guests want to play their own music.</p>



<p>Those that prefer a hands-on approach can easily adjust the volume, bass and treble with the controls on top of the speaker. Adjusting these settings takes only a few quick turns, allowing you to boost the bass for a workout playlist or add some extra treble for clear vocals.</p>
<p>When designing the Stanmore III, Marshall focused on using high-quality components and making sure they felt sturdy and long-lasting, but not too heavy. They designed the speaker to stay in place on a shelf or table, and it won’t slip around when playing music. In addition to feeling durable, the speaker withstands typical usage without showing a lot of wear.</p>
<p>All in all, the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is a cool looking, easy-to-use and a very powerful speaker that offers a ton of value at its price point. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6553/">As the price of the Marshall Stanmore III Bluetooth Home Speaker is currently on sale for $299 on Amazon, which is down from $400</a>, it is a good option if you are looking for good sound and classic style without breaking the bank. For $299, the Marshall Stanmore III is great for performance that feels worth every penny.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-ugreen-6-in-1-steam-deck-dock-at-almost-nothing-works-with-rog-xbox-ally-macbook-and-more-2000655062</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you have a Steam Deck, one of its most underrated features is the option to use it with your TV. You can do just that with the the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock. In fact, it has several ways to expand the functionality of your Steam Deck with additional ports and connectivity options for using controllers, monitors, and adding additional storage. And it’s on sale right now, in addition to all those things.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">You can find the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock on Amazon for $29.97 (which is a savings of $16.03 and 35% off) compared to the standard price of $46</a>. So now’s the best time to get one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable Steam Deck dock that unlocks additional features</h2>
<p>This dock has some useful features, like an Ethernet port to let you connect via cable to a wired internet network for better stability. It also includes a USB-C port that allows you to pass through power to your Steam Deck while you use the rest of the ports.</p>
<p>It also includes two USB-A ports that you can use to hook up controllers, external hard drives, flash drives, and more. So you could use this to plug in a controller you already own or a keyboard and mouse for a more PC-like experience.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s an HDMI port so you can connect your Steam Deck to a monitor or large-screen TV for a better viewing experience. Since the dock can send a clean signal, you should be able to see your games clearly on your TV or monitor, and since you can easily switch back and forth between handheld mode and docking mode with the dock, you can easily transition from handheld gaming to a TV or computer experience.</p>



<p>Setting up this dock is relatively easy and straightforward. Once you connect the dock to your Steam Deck and any devices you wish to use, you are good to go. There is no need to download any software to set it up or configure anything complicated. In addition, since it is very compact, it doesn’t take up a lot of space on your desk or entertainment system, and since it has a simple design, it will fit right in next to your gaming gear.</p>
<p>I would say that the build quality of the UGREEN dock is well-suited for the price point. The connectors are securely attached to the dock, so when you insert your cables they won’t come loose. Additionally, the dock itself is very light weight, making it easy to take with you wherever you may go.</p>
<p>If you plan to frequently switch between handheld and docked gaming modes, then I think the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock is a useful and affordable addition to your gaming rig. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">For just $29.97 on Amazon, the dock is an affordable way to add more connectivity options to your Steam Deck, and provide yourself with a more flexible gaming experience.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dreamcast-web-browsing-is-dead-over-25-years-later-thanks-to-google-2000655137</link>
            <guid>1390222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Surely Google could afford to let Dreamcast users keep checking the weather on their 27-year-old consoles? Why are games still launching without difficulty settings, only to add them in later when enough people don’t play at launch? And what new sex jokes will<em> Fortnite</em> stumble into in 2026? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of smaller gaming news and culture.</p> <p>We are officially in the end-of-year holiday stretch and I can’t decide which of the 10 games I started and didn’t finish this year to go back to during the winter break lull. I just keep picking up new games instead. I just started <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-21/-kingdoms-of-the-dump-is-a-charming-role-playing-game-made-by-two-janitors"><em>Kingdoms of the Dump</em></a> and it’s proving to be a lovely-looking comfort food old-school JRPG. What have you picked up so far during the winter 2025 Steam sale?</p> <h2>RIP PlanetWeb</h2> <p>Dreamcast players can no longer browse the World Wide Web. Its groundbreaking PlanetWeb browser capability has been killed by Google decades after it launched, according to <em><a href="https://x.com/dclivenet/status/2000321889970078120">Dreamcast Live</a></em>. “Sad news guys. After over 25 years of support, Google has finally discontinued support for Dreamcast web browsers,” the account posted over the weekend.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000655158" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655158"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655158">Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>It shared a screenshot of an error telling the user to update their browser “to a recent version.” “<span>And for your information </span>Google<span>, I am on the latest web browser! PlanetWeb 3.0, yo!” <em>Dreamcast Live </em>replied. Sega was at the forefront of bringing the internet to game consoles, beginning in 1990 with Sega Meganet for the Genesis and continuing through to the launch of the Dreamcast in 1998 and the eventual release of <em>Phantasy Star Online</em>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><em>Chronos: The New Dawn</em> is getting an easier mode</h2> <p>The immersive survival horror action game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2BVRu26Fug">has a new update</a> coming in early 2026. It’ll add Temporal Diver Mode, an easier difficulty option that will hopefully let more people experience one of this year’s bigger releases that didn’t get a ton of attention at launch (it launched a day after <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>).</p> <h2><em>Fortnite</em> accidentally gets too horny again</h2> <p>A new accolades trailer for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 7 seemed harmless enough. It included censored posts from random internet users saying things like “Fuck the Dark Voyager” and “Like a fucking fever dream.” But as <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-chapter-7-trailer-deleted/"><em>TheGamer</em> points out</a>, the issue was with what the trailer didn’t censor: the user name of someone who goes by Jonesy Frotting. Frotting is slang for a particular type of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=frotting">dick-on-dick foreplay</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE DELETED THE AD 💀 <a href="https://t.co/l7PchA10kO">pic.twitter.com/l7PchA10kO</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/2002833641656013040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I guess it ended up being too risqué for Epic once people pointed it out. The trailer has since been removed from YouTube. This isn’t the first time this year that<em> Fortnite</em> had to backtrack on sexual innuendo. It posted and deleted the phrase “mother of rose toys” when Doja Cat had ostensibly taken over the<em> Fortnite</em> social accounts <a href="https://kotaku.com/doja-cat-fortnite-sex-toy-deleted-skin-halloween-2025-2000633338">back in October</a>.</p> <h2>Limited Run Games has reached a $2.7 million settlement over data surveillance</h2> <p>The money will go to customers whose data the boutique physical game publisher <a href="https://www.limitedrungamessettlement.com/">allegedly mishandled</a>. At issue is whether Limited Run Games “disclosed its subscribers’ personally identifiable information (“PII”) to Meta Platforms, Inc. and/or other third parties, without consent and in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).” The company admits no wrong-doing but a fraction of the money will be paid out to everyone who submits a claim.</p> <h2><em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em> just got a free new mode</h2> <p>The rhythm games have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlGp0s25Pm8">a boss rush now</a>. It’s actually probably the ideal way for fans to re-experience the game. It’s currently $10 off on PSN and Steam.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dev-explains-why-its-ditching-game-key-cards-thanks-to-nintendo-2000654878">A developer accidentally lets slip that Nintendo might have a new solution for game key cards</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868">Palmer Luckey’s new Game Boy sucks</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-christmas-songs-ever-top-15-santa-2000654678"><em>Kotaku</em>‘s definitive list of the best Christmas songs</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Amazon Echo Dot Max is the latest addition to Amazon’s line of Alexa-enabled smart home hubs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">Currently, you can snag it for 20% off in a limited-time deal. Originally priced at $100, you can now grab it for just $80, saving you $20.</a></p>
<p>This does all of what we’ve come to expect with an Amazon smart speaker. Despite its small size, the Echo Dot Max delivers impressive sound quality, providing rich bass and clear audio. It features a front-facing speaker that produces high-quality sound, capable of filling a room with music, podcasts, or audiobooks. You’ll enjoy crisp, clear vocals, making it perfect for listening to your favorite tunes or catching up on your latest audiobook. The Echo Dot Max provides three times the bass versus 2022-release Echo Dot.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Introducing Alexa+</h2>
<p>The real addition that comes with the new Echo Dot Max is its support for Alexa+. All of the tech companies now have their own proprietary AI assistants like Google’s Gemini to Anthropic’s Claude. It only makes sense that Amazon would bump up the Alexa branding to cover its LLM too. Alexa+ is designed to provide a more natural and conversational Alexa, way more capable than the Alexa we’ve all come to know since Amazon launched it more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>If you get yourself this new Echo Dot Max, you’ll get early access to Alexa+.</p>
<p>The Echo Dot Max supports lossless HD audio from services like Amazon Music HD, ensuring an enhanced listening experience. In addition to Amazon Music, it also works with a variety of streaming platforms such as Apple Music, Spotify, and SiriusXM, offering you plenty of options for your entertainment needs. You can adjust the volume with the physical controls on top or, for hands-free convenience, simply ask Alexa to set the audio to your preferred level.</p>



<p>As a smart home hub, the Echo Dot Max allows you to control a range of smart devices in your home. Whether it’s adjusting the brightness or changing the color of your smart lightbulbs, or managing your smart TV with built-in streaming apps, the Echo Dot Max serves as the central control point for all these connected devices. You can use voice commands like “Alexa, play the latest episode of Pluribus” or “Alexa, dim the lights” for effortless control of your home.</p>
<p>The Echo Dot is available in three stylish colors: graphite, glacier white, and amethyst. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">With the current 20% discount, you can grab it for just $80, down from its original price of $100.</a></p>

<h2>A smartwatch that can help you tackle each day</h2>
