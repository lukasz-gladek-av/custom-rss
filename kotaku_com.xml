            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-clears-out-its-color-floor-lamp-now-cheaper-than-a-budget-lamp-on-amazon-2000641217</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-clears-out-its-color-floor-lamp-now-cheaper-than-a-budget-lamp-on-amazon.1343911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s just something magical about how the right lighting can completely turn a room around – turn a cold corner into a cozy reading nook or make your living space seem like it’s pulled from a design magazine. Good lighting doesn’t just brighten things up: it sets the mood, creates atmosphere and, honestly, just makes you want to spend more time in your own home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Usually $99, Amazon has slashed the price of the Govee RGBIC floor lamp to just $69</a>, which happens to be an all-time low for this <strong>#1 bestselling floor lamp</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Make Your Home Smarter</h2>
<p>The Govee floor lamp packs some seriously impressive tech into its sleek black design: W<strong>ith 1000 lumens of brightness</strong>, this lamp delivers enough light to properly illuminate a bedroom or living room without needing multiple fixtures. That’s <strong>roughly equivalent to a 75-watt incandescent bulb</strong> but with infinitely more flexibility. The RGBIC technology is where things get interesting: unlike basic RGB lamps that display one color at a time, <strong>RGBIC allows multiple colors to appear simultaneously across different sections of the lamp</strong>.</p>
<p>The lamp is integrated perfectly with Alexa for complete voice control. Forgot to turn off the lamp while getting into bed? Just ask Alexa to do that. Want to dim the lights for movie night without getting up from the couch? Voice commands, of course! The Govee Home app <strong>gives you access to more than 16 million color combinations</strong> which sounds kind of excessive until you realize just how regularly you’ll actually adjust the settings to suit different occasions. Dinner party? Warm amber tones.</p>



<p>Another feature that makes this more than just a simple lamp is the music sync: It <strong>pulses in real time to whatever you’re listening to</strong>, changing colors to go with the beat. Throw on some upbeat music, and it’s an instant dance party. This works via the app’s microphone detection, so nothing too complicated in terms of setup-just turn on music sync mode and let it do its thing. It’s great for entertaining small groups or just adding an element of fun to your solo dance sessions.</p>
<p>Attention should also be turned to the design itself: This is a<strong> corner lamp which means it’s specifically shaped to tuck into those awkward spaces</strong> that most furniture can’t fill properly. The tall and slender profile takes up very little floor space while maximizing vertical lighting coverage. <strong>About 62 inches tall</strong>, it reaches high enough to cast light across an entire room rather than just illuminating a small radius around its base.</p>



<p>Setup takes minutes, not hours: Plug it in, download the Govee Home app, connect it to your WiFi and you’re ready to start customizing. The app contains dozens of <strong>preset scenes</strong> designed by Govee’s team—things like “Ocean,” “Sunset,” and “Aurora”—so you don’t have to spend time creating custom scenes if you’d rather just pick something that works. But if you do want to get creative,<strong> DIY mode lets you tap into specific colors</strong> for different segments of the lamp and save your creations for later use.</p>
<p>At $69, you’re getting smart home integration, music reactivity, millions of color options, and enough brightness to actually function as primary lighting – all for $30 less than usual.</p>

              <p>Star Wars fans, it’s a great time to bring some important pieces of the galaxy far, far away into your own space. LEGO introduced its 25th Anniversary Star Wars collection to celebrate some of the most iconic ships in the saga, and if you’ve ever wanted your very own Millennium Falcon model, now is a great time to grab one at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">of LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon to $67, which is 20% off its regular $84 price</a>. It’s part of the brand’s special anniversary lineup, and the level of detail here is impressive. Such exclusive sets don’t really stay on sale for long, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Your Own Starship Collection</h2>
<p>This collectible build-and-display model lets you build a mid-scale brick recreation of one of the most iconic ships, and comes with 921 pieces in total. It hits that sweet spot; not too massive, but not so simple that you’re done before you’ve even settled in. LEGO packs it with details like the cockpit, satellite dish, and dual cannons. Even better, there’s a buildable stand to place the ship on. It includes a nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars brick. You can even position the Falcon at a dynamic angle for a more realistic, mid-flight look.</p>



<p>The set also fits nicely into the Starship collection by LEGO, so you can always add more ships down the line if you’re planning to build out a full display. Putting it together won’t be too complicated, as it comes with a handy instruction book that takes you step by step through the entire build. The instruction book is quite detailed on its own, but if you need extra help, you can also use the LEGO Builder app.</p>
<p>Once completed, the Millennium Falcon measures just over 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide. Place it on your bookshelf or your desk – it’s sure to impress anyone who sees it.</p>
<p>Just note that there’s no telling how long the discount will last, so it’s best to get your orders in soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/14-essential-tips-for-getting-started-in-arc-raiders.1343779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> came out last week and folks have been pouring into the servers–in some cases overwhelming them. And as players immerse themselves in the PvPvE extraction shooter, it’s developing a reputation as a well-made game that poses a number of interesting and unpredictable challenges as you fight to stay alive, hoard piles of resources, and craft your way to loadout supremacy.</p> <p>There’s no way around it: <i>Arc Raiders</i> expects a serious investment of your time and a willingness to suffer some pretty humiliating and often random losses that will set you back in your efforts to accumulate good weaponry and gear.</p> <p>Having spent about 50 hours in the game myself, I’ve found it to be one of the best online shooters I’ve ever played, and I’ve also learned a thing or two about surviving out there amidst hostile robots and sinister players looking to get the better of me. My runs have mostly been solo, but much of what I’ve learned still applies to rolling out with a group.</p>

 <p>So here are 14 of the best tips I can give to those getting started in <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p> <h2>You can trade Free Loadout Augments for Looting Augments</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641193">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This tip is a two-parter: First, don’t sleep on the <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Free_Loadout_Augment">Free Loadout</a>. When choosing to go out on a run, you can either build a loadout from the gear you’ve collected and crafted, or choose the Free loadout which always includes one main weapon, ammo for it, some bandages, a shield recharger, and any number of other utility items or grenades. It’s a handy way to get back out there without risking your good stuff.</p>

 <p>These items are free, so the only thing you really lose on a failed run with these is your time (and maybe a fragment of your sanity). But if you do manage to extract with them, hey, that’s free gear you didn’t have to craft (and you can always break it down for parts).</p>

 <p>But perhaps the most important thing about the Free Loadout Augment is <b>you can trade a Free Augment for a </b><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Looting_Mk._1"><b>Looting Mk. 1 Augment</b></a><b> from Lance in the Traders tab.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>This has become my default approach to any run that ended in failure: Go back out with a Free Loadout, return home with it and trade it for a Loot one and either go out and get more loot <i>or</i> recycle the Looting augment I just purchased if I already have enough or have better Augments to use.</p>

 <p>Free Loadouts are an efficient way to keep the crafting supplies flowing.</p> <h2>You can roll after a fall to cancel out fall damage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641192">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For a relatively realistic game, <i>Arc Raiders </i>is generous with how long you can sprint and how far you can fall before you take damage. But missing a jump or taking a fall can hurt and isn’t ideal when you’re fleeing a pursuit from an enemy player or Arc. Turns out, <b>hitting dodge right when your feet touch the ground will let you roll to cancel out the damage from falling</b>.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Sickest, Silliest, and Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>The timing is tricky but there is a skill in the Mobility tree that can make this easier. Also, it seems like some heights are too far to recover from–so don’t expect to leap off the tower in Spaceport and roll your way out of damage. You can, as of now anyway, manage to use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ompomw/has_anyone_survived_a_tower_freefall_like_this/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">an exploit to grab onto a ledge to cancel out such a fall</a>–and falls from far lesser heights.</p>

 <h2>Rubber parts are pretty important</h2> <p>In my 50 hours of playing <i>Arc Raiders</i> (mostly on solo runs), one particular crafting part has remained perpetually low in stock: <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rubber_Parts">Rubber Parts</a>.</p> <p>I suspect part of this is due to just how often Rubber Parts are used. For example, to upgrade, build, and repair many guns and gun parts, you’ll either need both <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Metal_Parts">Metal</a> and Rubber Parts or you’ll need to <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Mechanical_Components">craft Mechanical Components</a>, which requires Metal and Rubber.</p> <p>Rubber Parts can be salvaged or recycled from a number of different sources (Scrappy will also give you some after every run). But you can also find them in Mechanical, Industrial, or Technological loot sources. You can spot ideal locations with the matching icon (a gear for Mechanical, building for Industrial, and circuit board for Technological) by looking at the map both before you go out for a run and while you’re on the map.</p>

 <p>I heartily recommend going on several runs to stock up on Rubber Parts.</p> <h2>The Practice Range is essential</h2> <p>While you’ll play through the briefest of tutorials when you first start <i>Arc Raiders</i>, in my experience, it’s not enough to get a feel for the movement of your character and the behavior of its various guns, especially as you mod them with various attachments.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641196"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641196">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Going out on a run with a weapon you’ve never used before isn’t wise and will likely get you killed. Enter the practice range, which lets you go into a small map (with a few secrets of its own tucked away) to practice your parkour skills and try out different guns. You can literally swap out various gun attachments in real time to get a sense of what they do. For example, I’ve learned that I greatly prefer the Muzzle Break attachment over the Compensator by trying it out in the safety of the Practice Range.</p>

 <p>There are also two achievements you can earn by going to the practice range and using four different guns, so there’s that.</p> <h2>For mouse and keyboard users: Rebind your dodge roll</h2> <p>Rolling out of the way of incoming fire from players or Arc is essential to surviving in <i>Arc Raiders</i> and, in my experience, the default binding of Left Alt for rolling isn’t ideal. This is a function that you need to be able to access quickly under pressure while maintaining your hold on WASD.</p> <p>I’ve chosen to break out my keyboard that has a split spacebar for backspace and forward space side-by-side for this reason. I mapped dodge to backspace and set left space as jump and I’m digging it so far.</p> <p>But if you have a normal keyboard, I recommend mapping sprint to caps lock (toggle, if you wish), and freeing up your shift key to roll. Mapping your dodge roll to a mouse button is also a good move. Whatever mapping you decide on, though, just make sure you can accentuate WASD while rolling without too many weird, cramp-prone finger movements. Thank me after you’ve survived getting swarmed by Hornets.</p>

 <p>Also, Embark Studios, why are there not double or triple bindings in this game? Come on!</p> <h2>The birds will give you away (as well as other noisy things)</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has phenomenal sound design–easily some of the best I’ve ever heard in a video game. But it’s not just an audio treat. You likely already know that running around, rummaging through stuff, and cracking open various caches is <b>loud</b> (you can invest in skills to make your activities quieter though). On top of that, various buildings are outfitted with security cameras and metal detectors that set off alarms. Watch out for these while also keeping your ears open for other people tripping them.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">I Asked <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>But also beware of <i>the birds.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ design director <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">Virgil Watkins mentioned these feathered loudmouths</a> in our discussion about the fairness of various hiding places in the maps, and it’s clear they can easily give you away even while you’re slowly walking through forests and other natural habitats. But like all the other sound traps, you can use this to your advantage. Listen and look for flocks of birds taking spontaneous flight near you. It usually means someone is nearby.</p>

 <h2>You can ask people to follow you</h2> <p>There are two emote wheels in <i>Arc Raiders</i>; one lets you ping a variety of locations with information such as “I heard something here,” “avoid that,” or, a very useful one, “group up over there.” By default, these emotes are only heard by your squad, but you can toggle on the fly to make it heard to all Raiders.</p> <p>The “group up” emote seems to have a secret second mode. If you look down at the ground and select it, your character will say “Follow me” or “Group up on me.” This is very useful if you want to take the lead with some randos, or even those in your party.</p>

 <h2>Recycling is tricky</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641183"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641183">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> lets you break down various items in two ways: Salvaging and Recycling. Salvaging is done while you’re out in the field, while Recycling is done in your inventory when you’re out of a game. Recycling will always net you more resources than Salvaging, so unless you need to Salvage to get a specific item or you need to clear up space in your bag while out in the field, try to wait until you extract before you start breaking things down.</p> <p>However, the language used for some objects is a little vague. Take <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Toaster">Toasters</a>, for instance. You’ll find these objects scattered around the world and you can break them down into Plastic Parts and Wires if you recycle them. The description reads “Can be recycled into crafting materials.” That might make you think that the only thing a Toaster is good for is being immediately recycled.</p>

 <p>But hold your horses. Many objects with descriptions that read “Can be recycled into crafting materials” can also be used in upgrading your various workshops. Toasters, for example, are needed to upgrade your Refiner.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641184">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I recommend tracking resources for your workshop upgrades. Once you construct a new workshop, tab over to “Level Up” and click on the tracking button. This will label any instance of the items required with an eye symbol so you’ll know it’s needed and, thus, you’ll be less likely to accidentally break it down.</p> <h2>Full bag? GTFO</h2> <p>At most, you’ll be given about 30 minutes to do your thing on a map. Sometimes you’ll spawn with less time than that. And I’ve learned in my 50 hours that time needlessly spent in the game can be seriously costly. I’ve had full bags of loot, only to get intrigued by a specific location that ends up leading to a Clusterfuck™ that gets me murdered, seeing me lose all the stuff I’d found.</p> <p>Even the most basic of parts, such as Metal Parts and those Rubber Parts I told you about, are essential to keep in stock. So while you might have a bag full of stuff that doesn’t feel valuable, it all adds up to something you’re looking to craft or sell for credits. But you can’t do any of that if you died and lost it all.</p>

 <p>A full bag, regardless of how much time is left, means it’s time to leave–and extracting can be a whole quest full of dangers and surprises in and of itself. A good loadout is built on a path made up of small victories.</p> <h2>Planning a route is essential</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641182"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641182">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I realized this essential tactic pretty late in my time with <i>Arc Raiders</i>. At one point I dropped into a map with an inconvenient loadout and was about to extract, but I realized that this was actually a great opportunity to scope out the path to an objective I had a quest for.</p> <p>So I took the opportunity to do some reconnaissance, observing the various paths I could take if I was better equipped, and what threats were likely to happen. And wouldn’t you know it, I came across one of the death-delivering Sentinel turrets along the way. I was pretty glad in that moment to not be carrying a ton of things I’d rather not lose to an unexpected threat.</p> <p>Enemy AI is rather spontaneous in this game. They don’t show up in the same place on every run and their behavior (which in some instances was <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">developed using machine learning</a>) is very unpredictable and disturbingly smart.</p>

 <p>So if you’ve got an important quest or have a key to a particularly good loot spot, spend a run just examining potential routes and escape plans. Grab a Free Loadout to do this so an unpredictable death isn’t as costly.</p> <h2>Dam Battlegrounds is spicy</h2> <p>This next tip might evolve over time, but in my experience, Dam Battlegrounds, which is the first map you gain access to, is more prone to bouts of PvP. I suspect part of this is because the map is home to the newest folks coming into the game and just getting their bearings and experiencing the flow of its PvPvE action.</p> <p>Other maps unlock after you’ve made enough progress doing things on Dam Battlegrounds, and that’s where a lot of folks are out trying to loot for good shit or are just questing after investing some time into the game, and thus their loadout; they’re probably less likely to risk that progress.</p> <p>So just have your radar up for shenanigans every time you head out to Dam Battlegrounds. People are antsy over there.</p>

 <h2>People are nicer than you think</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641180"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641180">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This tip can result in your death. Hate to say it, but in a PvPvE game, unless someone is in your party, they can pose a potential risk to you. But! I’m finding that folks in <i>Arc Raiders</i> are a bit nicer than I experienced during the Server Slam, especially on maps other than Dam Battlegrounds.</p> <p>When going into a building, while I don’t do it every time, when I suspect someone’s around, I will usually use the emote wheel to shout out a “Hello” followed by a “Don’t Shoot!” I have been surprised just how often randos will reply with a “Don’t Shoot,” often followed by a holstering of their weapon.</p> <p>This kind of dynamic is part of the unique, prisoner’s-dilemma social game at work in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Holstering a gun seems to have become a universal way to signal you’re not going to shoot someone, so return the gesture if you see someone putting their gun away.</p> <p>Or betray them. I dunno. Be a bad person. You’ll get what’s coming to you eventually if you turn evil.</p> <h2>Go nuts with gadgets</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641179">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Maybe the inner-<i>Siege</i> fanatic in me is at work here, but once I realized I can craft items to seal doors, erect barricades, and set up traps, oh, how I realized what a devastating saboteur I can be in this game.</p> <p>I’ve sealed up entire rooms while I loot, hunkered down in some buildings to hunt Arc through windows, usually while running solo, covering my ass with traps and gadgets. Some gadgets are harmless, like <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Noisemaker">the Noisemaker</a>. Others range from nonlethal, like the <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Jolt_Mine">Jolt Mine</a>, to lethal, like <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Explosive_Mine">the Explosive Mine</a>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, with <i>Arc Raiders</i> less than a week old, I haven’t seen many people use gadgets to booby-trap areas. I’ve also surprised many a wandering Raider with a well-placed trap or two. Folks are less likely to sneak up on you if you’ve established a perimeter of fun toys for them to encounter.</p> <h2>Snitches can be your best friend (especially while running solo)</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641178"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641178">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Snitch">Snitches</a> are often a pain, as they’ll summon Arc to your location if they spot you. But they can be <i>your</i> pain to inflict on others. Lately I’ve gotten into the habit of keeping my eyes peeled for one, even if they’re at a great distance. Typically, shooting at one will draw them over to you.</p> <p>This is a great way to lose pursuant enemy Raiders. Call over a Snitch by getting its attention and it will either summon Wasps or Hornets, which will target you as well as your unfriendly Raider enemies, or just prove a helpful distraction by giving your foes another problem besides you. This can help you make a clean getaway or prove a helpful distraction that lets you fall back and help Arc kill your enemies.</p> <hr> <p>As <i>Arc Raiders</i> matures, I’m sure I’ll find more helpful things to share. For now, however, these tips should help you break down what is arguably a very complex and hardcore game. Mastery over its various systems and unpredictable gameplay is well worth the experience and the struggles of failure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s some unexpected but much-appreciated news: <a href="https://kotaku.com/there-was-nearly-a-sequel-to-space-jam-about-skateboard-1831528293#:~:text=This%20fateful%20meeting,in%20%24230%20million.">Brendan Fraser</a> and Rachel Weisz are reportedly in talks to star in a new <em>Mummy</em> film from Radio Silence, the team behind<em> Ready or Not</em>, <em>Scream</em> (2022), and 2023’s<em> Scream VI.</em> And it could be a direct sequel to the second film.</p> <p>On November 4, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/new-mummy-movie-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-1236418031/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported</a> that it had heard from sources that Fraser and Weisz are currently in talks with Universal to return to the franchise that started back in 1999 with the blockbuster action-adventure movie <em>The Mummy, </em>an action-oriented remake of the studio’s original 1930s horror movie. &nbsp;The outlet reports that Radio Silence is producing and directing the movie. The duo, made up of filmmakers Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, found success with 2019’s <em>Ready Or Not</em> and helped revitalize the <em>Scream</em> franchise in 2022.&nbsp; Sean Daniel, who helped produce the OG <em>Mummy</em> movies, is also on board.</p>

 <p>Details on the new movie are still under wraps (get it?), but a source told<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em> that the yet-to-be-confirmed new <em>Mummy</em> movie isn’t a reboot, but instead a sequel that would possibly “disregard” the events of the third film, which hit theaters in 2008, moved the franchise into China, and controversially recast Weisz’s character. The outlet reports that David Coggeshall is behind the new <em>Mummy’s</em> screenplay.</p>

  <p>After 1999’s fantastic <em>Mummy</em>, Universal followed it up with two sequels. The equally fun sequel arrived in 2001 and was also a box office hit. <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor">But the franchise stalled before returning seven years later</a> and flopping with critics, though that film still brought in over $400 million.</p> <p>In 2017, Universal rebooted<em> The Mummy</em> with Tom Cruise as part of the studio’s<em> Dark Universe</em> project. While it earned about the same as the third <em>Mummy</em> movie, it cost significantly more and was attached to a failed cinematic universe that never took off. So it makes sense that Universal, wanting to cash in on this oddly reliable franchise, is looking to bring back the two charismatic stars who launched the whole thing in 1999. Let’s just hope it all works out and we get one more fun mummy-filled adventure with Fraser and Weisz.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It has been two years since the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-invasion-pve-release-date-story-missions-1850720767"><span>first and only </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>story missions launched</span></a><span>, and I still yearn for the conclusion we won’t be getting. Blizzard has </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-22/blizzard-entertainment-makes-big-changes-as-overwatch-2-struggles"><span>reportedly canceled the campaign</span></a><span> that was once a pillar of the sequel’s pitch, which isn’t too surprising considering the apparent development struggles that the team had while </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720"><span>getting it off the ground</span></a><span>. Despite this, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> has a story that has been largely in limbo for years, with most of the shooter’s external media focusing on new characters and looking as far away from the main conflict as it can. Well, Blizzard may have just wrapped it all up kind of unceremoniously, at least, as far as the titular organization’s conflict with the Omnic radicals of Null Sector is concerned.</span></p> <p><span>In an almost six-minute audio drama, Commander Vivian Chase, aka Sojourn, addresses the public. Null Sector, the Omnic resistance group that rose up in the initial campaign, has apparently retreated following a “final battle” with Overwatch in Buenos Aires. Sojourn answers a handful of questions at a press conference, name-drops some </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>characters like the shield-wielding Brigitte and the Omnic tank Orisa’s creator Efi, and says that things are chill, for now. The Overwatch organization will continue to serve the public, however, implying that some new threat may be lurking in the future. Other pieces of </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>media have hinted at more antagonistic forces beyond Null Sector and the chaos-inciting Talon organization that characters like Doomfist and Reaper belong to, so this might just be Blizzard clearing the series’ plate to focus on something new. I’ll say, though, that if this is the end of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s Null Sector storyline and we got it in an audio drama that tells us about a sick battle that happened off-screen, that’s a real bummer.</span></p>  <p><span>The audio drama ends with a screen that says “The story continues in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>,” likely a reference to the new Lore section that’s being added to the game in its midseason update. I’ll hold sweeping judgments until we get a better look at what Blizzard is doing to get the game’s story back on track. For now, I’ll just hope that this is a sign of more story content to come, and that Blizzard can salvage its universe as more than just a stage for crossover events.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-tactics-modders-are-making-sure-the-remaster-gets-the-bonus-content-it-deserves.1343746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Before <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> brought the strategy RPG classic to modern platforms, there was the <em>War of the Lions</em> remaster for the PlayStation Portable. That version had a ton of bonus features, from extra job classes and characters to additional cutscenes and even a multiplayer mode. Unfortunately, all of that bonus content was cut from the current remaster, but dedicated fans are painstakingly trying to add it back in with mods.</p> <p>That’s good news for players on PC who can take advantage of all the work that’s already been done and find fresh reasons to keep playing. The 2007 <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196">version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a>, which is also the one available on iOS and Android, added a lot. There were guest characters Balthier from <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> and Luso from <em>Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</em>, as well as&nbsp;Dark Knight and Onion Knight job classes that let generic recruits rival the power of named companions. There was also a wireless multiplayer mode that let players team up or compete for treasure.</p>

 <p>The multiplayer mode might require deeper tinkering to bring it to <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>, but there are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/33">already mods</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/34">adding the rest</a>. In fact, fans like NexusMods user <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/users/1594389">DanaCrysalis</a> have already gone and added other tweaks and bonus features as well, including the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/26">Red and Blue Mage</a> job classes from the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> spin-off. Qualify-of-life fixes, meanwhile, include a way to stop all of the monsters in your party, including Chocobos, from endlessly <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles">filling up your roster with eggs</a>. There’s even a mod adding <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/36">extra-difficult random encounters</a> to the map.</p>

 <p>If you’re playing on console, however, there’s no way to take advantage of any of this. Why didn’t Square Enix simply restore all of this cut bonus content itself? “We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in <em>War of the Lions</em>,” director&nbsp;Kazutoyo Maehiro <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-had-to-be-brute-forc-1851784636">explained prior to launch</a>. “However, the original version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>&nbsp;is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.”</p>

 <p>In fact, there were apparently even discussions about adding more new content early on in development. The game’s original writer and director, Yasumi Matsuno, recently wrote on X that he has thought about branching out beyond the confines of the original story, like allowing players of the <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> version to recruit characters like Miluda and Izlude. That ended up not being the right fit for the game’s budget and scope, which among other things required essentially rebuilding the game’s lost code base from scratch. “I think that if we were to do that, we should just make a new game,” he said.</p> <p>Obviously, Square Enix should do exactly that, but for now a vibrant modding scene will have to suffice.</p>
