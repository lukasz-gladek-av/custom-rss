              <p>Organized workstations don’t just look better, they make you more productive too. If you use a bunch of devices to get your busy work and play days (multiple monitors, laptop, keyboard, mouse, external storage), you need something that ties the entire setup together with a single unit. A docking station does that job well, and if you’ve been on the lookout for one, we just spotted a great deal to pick a highly-rated option for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Thanks to Black Friday, Amazon is offering the 14-in-1 160W Anker Prime docking station for $161.</a> That’s after a nice 40% discount on the retail price of $270. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in 90 days, which means it didn’t even go this low during the October Prime Day. It’s selling out fast, though, so it’s best to snap it up as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports to Connect and Charge</h2>
<p>The dock gets you 14 ports in total. The front panel offers you two USB-C (10Gbps), two USB-C (100W Max), one USB-A (10Gbps), one USB-A (12W Max), and one 3.5mm audio jack. On the back, there’s an Ethernet (1Gbps), three USB-A (480Mbps), one HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), one USB-C upstream port, and an LED indicator. The three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max are capable of juicing your essentials up with 160W of total output. It’s great to power your laptop as you work without looking for another outlet, and even quickly top your smartphone or headphones up. Four charging ports mean you can charge multiple devices at the same time. The station even makes custom power allocation possible with its dedicated app, so you can always prioritize important devices. Need to head out for a meeting in a few minutes? Prioritize your laptop while still keeping your AirPods topped up.</p>
<p>Support for bigger workstations comes from the dual HDMI ports that let you stream or mirror across two additional displays at the same time, but only on Windows. You’ll get up to 2K@60Hz on a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 machine. Those using macOS will only be able to mirror their main display. It’s not ideal, but can come in handy when you need to share your screen with others. Otherwise, compatibility is impressive. The station works nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. It’s not made for Linux, though.</p>



<p>You will always be kept in the loop with the smart display, which shows total wattage and interface status, plus gives visuals and overheat alerts when needed. And finally, despite all the power, the docking station remains portable and lightweight; enough to carry around easily with you on the go. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’ll be able to create an efficient workstation anywhere you want. Overheating won’t be a concern either, thanks to the built-in airflow system, paired with ActiveSheild temperature monitoring. The latter monitors the temperature of the docking station 3,000,000 times per day, and instantly notifies you if something feels off.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been wanting to make your workstation cleaner, Anker Prime does a great job at that. You’ll still be able to use all your devices, just in a more efficient, smartly-managed way.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/"> It’s now down to $161, so you’re saving a nice $109 on it right now. Grab the deal fast before it expires for good, or the stock runs out.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[WD 14TB External Hard Drive Restocks at $0.01 per GB, Proving Margin Isn’t the Plan for Storage Deals This Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-takes-23-off-the-massive-20tb-wd-external-hard-drive-but-not-for-long-2000646687</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything more annoying than the dreaded “low storage” warning that forces you to delete your old stuff just to save something new?</p>
<p>It’s more common than you think, but you don’t have to deal with the issue. Adding an external hard drive can give you both the space and peace of mind you need. There are plenty of options out there across all sizes and ranges. Capacities start from 16GB and go all the way up to multi-terabyte options, which are ideal for gamers and creatives. If you are looking to store an unusually large number of files and content, we’ve found a deal that lets you do that without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5989/">Amazon is currently being generous with a 39% discount on the 14TB external hard drive by WD.</a> It normally retails for $280, but you can bag it for $170 today if you act fast. This drive is massive enough to take care of all your storage needs for years to come, so $270 is a solid price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5989/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage, Impressive Compatibility</h2>
<p>You’re getting a mind-boggling 14TB of storage here. That’s enough to throw in a huge number of high-resolution photos, thousands of videos, hundreds of movies, all your favorite games (both new and old), multiple backups, and still have a lot of space left for your future downloads. You can use it to store literally everything you own, and offload a good chunk of files that you don’t need on a regular basis to free some space on your main device.</p>
<p>It’s ideal for whoever wants to never run out of storage. Work professionals can use it to house their presentations, years’ worth of documents, and spreadsheets that never seem to end. If you’re a creative, you can store all your old and new projects, no matter how insanely large they are. Similarly, gamers will be able to keep all their favorite titles close, plus keep adding new releases as they come out, without a second storage-related thought.</p>
<p>Transferring data will be quick, too, with USB 3.2 Gen support. Of course, speeds won’t match that of SSDs, but it’s still fast enough for large backups and heavy files. The drive works with Windows 10 plus macOS, but Apple users will need to reformat it to proceed. You get compatibility with the latest USB 3.2 devices and backward compatibility with USB 3.0 devices as well, meaning it’ll play nice with pretty much anything, even if it’s older laptops or consoles. The plug-and-play setup helps you get started in no time without any complicated installation procedures.</p>



<p>Despite all the capacity and power it offers, it’s quite lightweight and easy to carry around. It looks like a mini PC, and doesn’t take a lot of desk space. When working remotely, you can just toss it in your laptop bag and get going.</p>
<p>All in all, this hard drive by Western Digital is designed to take care of all your current and upcoming storage needs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5989/">The 14TB capacity is truly massive, while the plug-and-play setup makes getting started fairly straightforward. It’s now down to just $170, but won’t be for long. Get it before the price shoots back up.</a></p>
<p>If 14TB is a bit too much for you, there are other capacities available, too. Almost all options are discounted, so you can pick what you need without paying the full price.</p>
<p>Prime members will also enjoy free shipping with their purchase. That said, if you’ve been wanting to subscribe, now is a good time to do it. You will enjoy perks like free shipping with exclusive discounts, which can help you save even more during the main Black Friday and Cyber Monday event.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-leverages-amazon-to-clear-supersonic-nural-stock-premium-hair-dryer-hits-all-time-low-2000648096</link>
            <guid>1366555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson has established itself as the definitive innovator in air management technology and it revolutionized everything from vacuum cleaners to air purifiers through engineering approaches that competitors struggle to replicate. Their <strong>hair dryer line applies this same obsessive attention to airflow physics</strong> and creates tools that fundamentally differ from traditional blow dryers in both function and results.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6000/">At $399, down from $549</a>, the Supersonic Nural represents Dyson’s<strong> most advanced hair drying technology</strong> available at a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. The package includes <strong>multiple styling attachments</strong> and <strong>premium presentation packaging</strong> that justifies both personal use and gift-giving applications during the holiday season.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intelligent Heat Control That Protects Hair Health</h2>
<p>The Nural designation references advanced sensor technology that <strong>measures air temperature 40 times per second</strong>, adjusting heating elements to maintain optimal temperature ranges that prevent heat damage. Traditional hair dryers blast constant high heat that dries hair quickly but causes cumulative damage through protein denaturation and moisture loss that leaves hair brittle and prone to breakage.</p>
<p>The intelligent regulation keeps effectiveness while preserving hair structure, and creates the paradox where faster drying causes less damage than slower methods. The system learns your drying patterns and adjusts automatically and reduces heat when you pause or change angles and ramping up when resuming active drying. This adaptive intelligence transforms the dryer from passive tool into active partner that protects hair health during every use.</p>



<p>The <strong>digital motor V9 spins at 110,000 RPM while weighing just 27 grams</strong> through miniaturization that defies conventional motor engineering. This extreme rotation speed generates the high-velocity airflow that enables fast drying without excessive heat and fundamentally changes the drying equation. The motor positions in the handle rather than the head and creates unprecedented balance that reduces wrist strain during extended styling sessions. Professional stylists and home users both appreciate how the weight distribution enables precise control without arm fatigue that plagues top-heavy conventional dryers.</p>
<p>Air multiplier technology<strong> amplifies the motor’s airflow by 3x through aerodynamic engineering</strong> borrowed from jet engine development, creating focused high-velocity streams that penetrate through hair to the scalp. This concentrated airflow dries from roots to tips efficiently rather than just moving surface moisture around, reducing total drying time substantially. <strong>Thick, long hair that requires 20-30 minutes with conventional dryers often completes in 10-15 minutes</strong>.</p>



<p>The included styling attachments address various hair types and desired outcomes through engineered airflow patterns rather than just changing nozzle shapes: The smoothing nozzle creates a wide, flat airflow perfect for straightening while drying, the styling concentrator provides precision for detailed work and the diffuser distributes air evenly for enhancing natural curls without frizz. The magnetic attachment system enables instant swapping without fumbling with clips or threads, maintaining workflow during styling routines.</p>
<p><strong>Negative ion generation reduces static electricity</strong> that creates flyaway hair and frizz and produces smoother results that require less finishing product. The ions work at the molecular level by neutralizing positive charges that develop during drying, creating hair that lays naturally rather than repelling itself. This chemistry creates visibly different results compared to non-ionic dryers and reduces the styling product dependence that many users accept as necessary for polished appearance.</p>
<p>The<strong> premium packaging and presentation elevate the Supersonic Nural beyond typical appliances into gift-worthy territory</strong> appropriate for milestone occasions. The included storage case protects the dryer and attachments during travel while maintaining organization at home. The build quality through materials selection and assembly precision creates an appliance that feels substantial and durable rather than disposable.</p>
<p>At $399, the Dyson Supersonic Nural is going for 27% below retail this Black Friday. Dyson’s hair dryer represents the company’s air management expertise applied to personal care with results that justify premium pricing through tangible performance and health benefits.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung Is Cleaning House on Curved Gaming Monitors, 32″ Odyssey Now Costs the Same as the Discounted 27″ for Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-cleaning-house-on-curved-gaming-monitors-for-black-friday-save-39-2000647717</link>
            <guid>1366552</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s Black Friday blowout sale has spread into their top-level gaming monitor section, with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/">39% Amazon steal of a deal on the 32-inch Odyssey G55C Series QHD 1000R curved gaming monitor</a>. Ultra-low 1ms motion blur, 165Hz of speed, and dazzling QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 on a high-quality curved screen will make your gaming setup more immersive and realistic for just $200.</p>
<p>This Black Friday deal brings the 27-inch and 32-inch Odyssey G55C Series monitors to the same $200, but the 39%-off deal on the larger model beats the 33%-off deal on the smaller version. Just $200 for a large curved monitor with QHD resolution that has 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD is a steal, particularly considering how much razor-sharp detail it brings to your gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play Longer, Play Better</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G55C’s huge, sharp screen will make it hard to tear yourself away from your gaming grind, but that’s ok — you can put it into Eye Saver Mode to minimize blue light and reduce eye strain, and it has far less screen flicker, so there’s less irritation and tiring for your eyes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, feel free to take a nice long immersive gaming dive into the Odyssey G55C, and bring the fastest and most detailed console or PC games you can find. The greasy-fast 165Hz refresh rate keeps up with shooters, eSports, role-players, racers, and any other kind of game. The 1ms response time mean minimal blur, and you getting the jump on the rest of the field in the battle royal game.</p>
<p>AMD Radeon FreeSync is built into the Samsung Odyssey G55C, quietly ensuring the monitor and graphics card keep their refresh rates in perfect sync. That’s how the G55C virtually eliminates image tearing and keeps evey the fastest games looking ultra smooth.</p>



<h2>The Curve Has Verve</h2>
<p>Curved monitors have exploded in popularity with gamers in recent years for the added realism they bring to games. The curved monitor brings the action into your peripheral vision with outstanding detail and great speed, so when you get lost in the game, you&nbsp;<em>really</em> get lost in the game.</p>
<p>What sucks you in is the combination of the flawlessly smooth action and peerless color performance, with millions of colors all popping, and deep blacks and bright whites providing outstanding contrast to go with the pixel density and create a superior overall picture. If you’re usig the Odyssey G55C with a PC, it’s an outstanding everyday monitor in addition to being a top-level gaming monitor.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G55C 32-inch curved monitor was already an Amazon’s Choice before this Black Friday sale, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/">now that it’s 39% off to drop the price by over $100 to just $200</a>, it’s one of the best Black Friday gaming deals so far.</p>

              <p>Happy Thanksgaming, <em>Kotaku</em> readers! It’s especially happy because, while all the full-time staff are off worshiping a giant effigy of a turkey (I’ve yet to quite figure out what Thanksgiving is), I’m taking advantage of their all-consuming distraction to post as many unknown indie games as I can onto the front page of this popular gaming site. Take <em>that</em>, capitalism!</p> <p>So please dive into this extraordinary list of upcoming or recently released indie games that you almost certainly won’t have heard of before. There’s definitely going to be&nbsp;<em>something</em> that’s in your field of interest, if not a dozen, and the very best thing you can do for yourself and the developers is slap them straight onto your wishlist. The more interest the games receive, the better opportunities come the creators’ way.</p>

 <p>This list is compiled from the hundreds of emails I’ve received <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3m6ffpsw7os2r">after putting out an appeal to indie devs</a> earlier this week, which I then select at random (with a common sense filter for quality), and then include below. Unless I say so I’ve not played the games mentioned, so I’m not here vouching for their quality. I’m with you all, looking through the intriguing, amazing creativity that’s out there, and doing my best to celebrate it as loudly as possible. (If you like that sort of thing, by the way, do feel free to support my other unknown indies project,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/buriedtreasure"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a>!)</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858950/Steel_Century_Groove/">Steel Century Groove</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Sloth Gloss Games<br> Release Date: Jan 28, 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858950/Steel_Century_Groove/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I think we can all agree after watching the trailer above that mecha games should&nbsp;<em>always</em> have been about dancing and nothing else. Oh my goodness, what a joyfully silly thing, watching giant robots have dance battles.&nbsp;<em>Steel Century Groove</em> is a rhythm-RPG, featuring both the mecha dance-offs and a bunch of betwixt-battle friendship making and RPG story. There’s a demo now, and the whole game comes out in January.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842190/Die_or_Die/">Die or Die</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Ao Norte<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842190/Die_or_Die/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Well that doesn’t seem like the best option. Until you realize one of those “Die”s is dice. This is a top-down twin-stick shooter, inspired by <em>Nuclear Throne</em>, where slain enemies and treasures give you dice, used to roll for new abilities and powers, or to gamble against “Bummers” that make the game harder. There’s a demo on Steam to give you a better idea.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Xenopurge</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Traptics<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Released just last week,&nbsp;<em>Xenopurge</em> is an auto-battler, but looks unlike any I’ve seen before. Rather than directly controlling some dude in the middle of a battlefield, here you’re indirectly issuing orders from a remote command center, making plans and setting routes on the fly. It sounds like if the original&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six</em> were a 2D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>clone, and that’s won me over immediately. Already installing.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824720/Descent_Of_Lunaris/">Descent of Lunaris</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Unison Games<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824720/Descent_Of_Lunaris/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Oh my gosh, this went so quickly onto my wishlist. The mindset of a classic-style dungeon blobber, but with modern aesthetics and a super-weird Giger-punk vibe. Inspired by&nbsp;<em>Wizardry</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, and it’s all set on the moon. Absolutely thrilled to see if this one comes together.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3742720/Sobakistan_The_Land_of_Dogs/">Sobakistan: The Land of Dogs</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Terletski Games<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3742720/Sobakistan_The_Land_of_Dogs/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Why this isn’t called&nbsp;<em>Sobarkistan</em> is upsetting me too much to think about, so let’s distract ourselves by focusing on how this is a parody of a nation emerging from isolated totalitarianism, in which you play through a branching narrative with puzzles, stealth and a bunch of different endings to find. It’s by the creators of the comic on which it’s based, and I am all in for its distinct pixel style.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920290/Barkour/">Barkour</a></h2>  <p>Developer: VARSAV GAme Studios<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920290/Barkour/">Store Page</a></p> <p>See, that’s the correct way to name a dog-based game!&nbsp;<em>Barkour</em> is all about being a super-hi-tech dog, in a third-person action game about being a little woofy spy. The trailer looks completely charming, with a lot of stealth, hacking and swinging from rafters, all as a handsome doggo. There’s a demo on its Steam page.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3492830/Gunlocked_2/">Gunlocked 2</a></h2>  <p>Developer: FromLefcourt<br> Release Date: Out now (Early Access)<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3492830/Gunlocked_2/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I missed the original&nbsp;<em>Gunlocked</em> in 2022, but I’m very interested to go back and take a look now. It and its new sequel are Amiga-style vertical scrolling shoot ’em ups—think&nbsp;<em>Cyberdyne</em> or <em>Xenon</em>—but with a far more involved ship-building element. Employing more modern roguelite elements, it’s all about customization and careful movement through bullet-hell action. This sequel came out in August this year in Early Access, and is due a big update in the next couple of weeks.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2974540/Night_Machine/">Night Machine</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Cooler Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2974540/Night_Machine/">Store Page</a></p> <p>That pesky moon of ours turns out to contain a vast alien factory, revealed after our closest neighbor cracked in half. In <em>Night Machine</em> you pilot a craft to the center of the moon-machine with the goal of destroying it, except everything about your ship is controlled via cards. And yes, there’s a deckbuilder for&nbsp;<em>everything</em> now, but this does sound enormously intriguing.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406690/Puzzle_Spy_International/">Puzzle Spy International</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Travel-Friendly Cake<br> Release Date: Q1 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406690/Puzzle_Spy_International/">Store Page</a></p> <p>The trailer for&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Spy International</em> gives me vibes of both&nbsp;<em>Professor Layton</em> and&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Golden Idol</em>, although perhaps without the latter’s intense difficulty. This is about traveling around the the world to catch some naughty diamond thieves, while solving puzzles involving rearranging words and pictures on the screen, and chatting with the locals. The game’s out early next year, but there’s already a demo to check out.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891370/Pieced_Together/">Pieced Together</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Glowfrog Games<br> Release Date: Q1 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891370/Pieced_Together/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Talking of rearranging words and pictures on the screen (I swear to god, I pick these at random, and am&nbsp;<em>far</em> too lazy to curate them into some clever order),&nbsp;<em>Pieced Together&nbsp;</em>is a scrapbooking game that explores the nature of friendship as we age. It looks like a warm hug in gaming form, and there’s already a demo on Steam if you wanna see.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719850/Super_Spelling_Ducks/">Super Spelling Ducks</a></h2>  <p>Developer: SKYLE Games Ltd<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719850/Super_Spelling_Ducks/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I love a word game, but for some reason most of them seem to be ad-riddled mobile games. So hooray for&nbsp;<em>Super Spelling Ducks</em>, a particularly mad-looking game about using a duck to push lettered blocks around a grid, spelling out words to make them explode. Being a little rogueish, each run at the game involves putting together a different collection of upgrades and abilities, and it all looks pleasingly chaotic. Oh, and it will have co-op too!</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3637630/Camp_Keepalive_Endless_Summer/">Camp Keepalive</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Porch Weather Games<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3637630/Camp_Keepalive_Endless_Summer/">Store Page</a></p> <p>We don’t have summer camps here in the UK, but what I’ve come to understand about them is that they are all absolutely overrun by axe murderers and killer clowns. That seems to be further proved by&nbsp;<em>Camp Keepalive</em>, a turn-based strategy in which you control a group of counselors trying to keep the camp’s residents alive despite the monsters and monstrous people stalking the woods. There game came out earlier this year, but hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078120/Reality_Drift/">Reality Drift</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Arganoid Industries<br> Release Date: Q3 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078120/Reality_Drift/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Well this looks stunningly bizarre. A driving game in which you seem to gain astonishing speeds, but all decided by which lanes you pick as you go. It was the location choices of “Space,” “Cat Land,” or “Hell” that convinced me. There’s even somehow deckbuilding in this too, in a game that looks more tactical than reflex-based. Despite still being a fair way off, there’s already a demo.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241070/The_Amateur_Deity_Society/">The Amateur Deity Society</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Robert Carlson<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241070/The_Amateur_Deity_Society/">Store Page</a></p> <p>This combination of a point-and-click interface but an interactive fiction delivery has absolutely fascinated me. It’s all about being a member of the high school computer club which is attempting to program a world-simulator, but everything goes too…well? This came out last year but seems to have completely fallen under the radar. I’m installing it as I write, because I want to know more.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://computerjames.itch.io/stealth-cw">Stealth Crossword</a></h2>  <p>Developer: ComputerJames<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://computerjames.itch.io/stealth-cw">Store Page</a></p> <p>As a massive fan of crosswords, both cryptic and <em>New York Times</em>y, I’m always hopeful for innovative approaches to the genre in games, and generally disappointed. But&nbsp;<em>oh my goodness</em>, I am so very here for&nbsp;<em>Stealth Crossword</em>. It’s literally that! You play as the letters needed to finish the clues on grids laid out in clandestine locations, sneaking past the other alphabetical guards to enter the correct cell! There’s a levels where you have to hack a computer (as a sentient letter, naturally), to find out the clues, then knock out a guard to push their unconscious forms into the correct place in the grid! Oh I’m in love. The whole thing is only 10 minutes long (but make sure to play again and get caught), incredibly silly, and brilliantly smart. And it’s free! And it’s out now! This deserves to be developed into a full-length game.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4136640/Mimic_Meadows/">Mimic Meadows</a></h2>  <p>Developer: sourencho<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4136640/Mimic_Meadows/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I was absolutely <em>convinced&nbsp;</em>I’d played <em>Mimic Meadows&nbsp;</em>before, and that it had been&nbsp;<em>brilliant</em>, and I’ve finally figured it out. It’s an expanded version of an absolutely stunning puzzle game from 2022 called&nbsp;<em>Mimic</em>, which <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2022/01/mimic/">I reviewed here</a>, where after saying how clever it is lamented, “There’s definitely a sense that it stops just as it hits its stride. Pursued further, you can see this becoming a&nbsp;<em>Baba Is You</em>, and I would be just delighted to see that happen.” My wishes are coming true! In the game, you play as a little red blob who can change into different animals by moving through tiles in a certain pattern. Doing so lets you enter terrain specific to that beast, but you’ll need to figure out routes that let you make those specific shapes. It was&nbsp;<em>great</em>, and I’m thrilled to learn it’s becoming a full game. (The video above is of the original version).</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126810/Memorys_Reach/">Memory’s Reach</a></h2>  <p>Developer:<br> Release Date:<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126810/Memorys_Reach/">Store Page</a></p> <p>“A first-person puzzle-adventure metroidvania” is a heck of a way to catch my eye. Then take a look at the <em>gorgeous</em> trailer above to be even more convinced. It’s all about unpicking the tragedy that led to the end of an alien civilization, by solving puzzles and gaining new abilities that let you reach further. And there’s no combat! There’s already a demo, despite no release date announced as yet.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639950/Star_Spark/">Star Spark</a></h2>  <p>Developer: JoyFlow Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639950/Star_Spark/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Surely this can’t be the first time someone’s had the sense to combine a&nbsp;<em>Slay The Spire</em>-style roguelite progression with old-school NES-like turn-based combat?&nbsp;<em>Surely</em>? But I’ve never seen it until now, in the excellent-looking&nbsp;<em>Star Spark</em>. And I want to be playing it already! The sprite art, the feisty animations, and the pumped up music are all on point.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3162890/Project_Lexa/">Project Lexa</a></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000648102" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000648102"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000648102">© Ward Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Developer: Ward Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3162890/Project_Lexa/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I love the idea of language-deciphering games, but then something like the incredible&nbsp;<em>Heaven’s Vault</em> comes along and it’s far too hard for me.&nbsp;<em>Project Lexa</em> looks like it could be my happy place, however. You play as a communications specialist, marooned on an alien planet and required to translate the glyphs of a vanished colony. It all looks delightful, with its cartoon art and 2D exploration. I cannot wait.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210060/Skyfarm/">Skyfarm</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Plaid Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210060/Skyfarm/">Store Page</a></p> <p>A post-apocalyptic gardening sim is quite the prospect, but&nbsp;<em>Skyfarm</em> is a game about hopefulness. Only the taller rooftops remain safe in the cities after the floods, and you are to be charged with converting a roof garden into a farm to grow food for your community. It looks incredibly positive, positively educational, and also seems to be celebrating the possibilities of joy found in moments of solitude.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="661">Whether you primarily find yourself watching TV in you living room, bedroom, basement, or even a home theater, it might be time to upgrade your audio setup. While a great picture is important, it’s the sound that can really boost your viewing experience from good to exceptional. A high-quality sound system makes all the difference, and the good news is you don’t need to spend a fortune to achieve cinematic audio in your home. Historically, Black Friday has been a great time to find discounts on home theater upgrades, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">and right now, Sony is offering a 2.0-channel soundbar at a 39% discount. Normally priced at $160, this soundbar is currently available for just $98.</a></p>
<p data-start="703" data-end="1161">Folks underestimate the importance of good audio, even though it makes up 50% of the TV viewing experience. Even with the best picture quality, if the sound is coming from your TV’s built-in speakers, it won’t have the same impact. A soundbar is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to upgrade your home audio system, especially if you’re on a budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1163" data-end="1542">This particular 2.0-channel soundbar from Sony is equipped with a built-in tweeter and delivers deep, powerful bass for rich, immersive sound. Its slim design makes it perfect for smaller spaces, such as city apartments or just any room with limited space. You can easily place it on top of your TV stand, or if you prefer, mount it on the wall to save space and maintain a clean, sleek look.</p>
<p data-start="1577" data-end="2206">If you’ve ever been frustrated by the way audio is mixed in modern content, you’re not alone. A lot of us find ourselves constantly adjusting the volume to keep up. Action sequences will be blasting with loud sounds, only for the dialogue to come through as a faint whisper. With this Sony soundbar, you can forget about those volume battles. It features a voice enhancement mode specifically designed to amplify speech, ensuring that dialogue remains clear and easy to hear, without also having the background sounds make your house shake. You’ll be able to enjoy your content without reaching for the remote every few minutes to adjust the volume.</p>


<h2 data-start="2208" data-end="2249">Easy Connectivity and Immersive Sound</h2>
<p data-start="2251" data-end="2742">Setting up the soundbar is a breeze. It connects to your TV via HDMI ARC, allowing for simple and reliable integration with your existing setup. Once connected, you’ll be treated to immersive sound thanks to Sony’s S-Force Pro Front Surround technology. This technology simulates a multi-channel surround sound experience, providing cinema-quality audio no matter where you’re sitting in the room.</p>
<p data-start="2744" data-end="3026">The soundbar isn’t just for movies and TV shows. You can connect your phone or other devices via USB or Bluetooth, allowing you to stream your favorite music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more directly through the soundbar.</p>
<p data-start="3057" data-end="3524">Say goodbye to the poor-quality audio that comes with your TV’s built-in speakers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony 2.0-channel soundbar is a great option for upgrading your home entertainment setup and right now it’s priced at just $98, down from its original price of $160.</a></p>
