              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642">Where is <em>Judas</em></a>? That’s the question <em>BioShock </em>creator Ken Levine keeps getting asked. On Wednesday he took to the PlayStation Blog to tell players he still doesn’t have an answer. “While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that,” he writes, though he does offer some other details.</p> <p>His new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">“lo-fi” dev log</a> explains that<em> Judas</em> has no set villain. NPCs called the “Big 3” will share secrets with you, give you quests, and talk shit about the others. Depending on who you engage with and how, one of characters will be elevated into the game’s main antagonist, unlocking additional powers with which to hamper your journey in the process.</p> <p>“In <em>Judas</em>, you’re going to get to know these characters intimately,” Levine writes. “We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you’ve got to decide who you trust and who you don’t.”</p>

 <figure><figcaption>Credit: Ghost Story Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Ghost Story Games, the studio making <em>Judas</em>, also revealed the game’s key art. It includes the Big 3, killer robots, and ’80s iconography like floppy disks, cassette tapes, and an Atari-esque game stick. Levine confirmed the game recently held a closed playtest and will likely feature over 100 speaking roles by the time it’s complete. He also teased that the key art is intended as more than just an homage to the work of movie poster artist Drew Struzan. “Let’s just say there’s some stuff in this game that we’re not going to talk about right now, but everything here is relevant,” Levine writes.</p> <p>Despite its already lengthy development cycle, with early elements teased as far back as 2015 and a reveal trailer at The Game Awards 2022, <em>Judas</em> seems unlikely to be launching anytime soon. I’d peg it for a fall 2026 release at the earliest, though spring 2027 seems like a better bet. “As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it,” Levine writes.</p> <p>The director’s infamously <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-ken-levines-ghost-story-studio-is-nowhere-near-1848297126">difficult production style and the high turnover</a> at his current studio probably haven’t helped. Can <em>Judas</em> live up to all of the procedural narrative ambition Levine is promising? Will it still manage to come out before <em>BioShock 4</em>? We still have way more questions than answers.</p>

              <p>The next batch of PlayStation Plus freebies is arriving next week and it’s a darn good haul of games, including the beloved indie blockbuster <em>Stardew Valley.</em></p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/">On August 27</a>, as is usual around the end of the month, Sony announced what next month’s free PS Plus games will be. These games are available to all tiers of PS Plus subscribers and will be available to grab and download starting September 2.&nbsp; All of these games can be played on PS5 or PS4.&nbsp; Here’s the full list:</p> <ul> <li><em>Psychonauts 2</em> – PS4</li> <li><em>Stardew Valley</em> – PS4</li> <li><em>Viewfinder</em> – PS4, PS5</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-present-and-future-of-stardew-valley-1766238624">The star of the show is likely to be <em>Stardew Valley</em>,</a> which appears to have never been given away as a PlayStation Plus game before. That seems wild to me! But hey, if you have not yet played this wildly popular cozy pixel-art life sim that features RPG combat, farming, and more, now is the perfect time to give it a shot. Personally, I’m more excited that more people will get a chance to play <a href="https://kotaku.com/psychonauts-2-the-kotaku-review-1847533536"><em>Psychonauts 2</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/psychonauts-2-the-kotaku-review-1847533536">, a fantastic 3D platformer</a> from Double Fine that I enjoyed a lot back in 2021. I highly recommend you set some time aside to play it. Finally, there’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/viewfinder-puzzle-game-pc-ps5-impressions-sad-owl-1850649178"><em>Viewfinder</em></a>, a neat first-person puzzle game with an interesting mechanic involving taking pictures and stepping into them. If you like <em>Portal</em> or other similar puzzle games, check this one out, too!</p> <p>Oh, and don’t wait around too much longer to grab last month’s collection of PlayStation Plus free games. <em>Lies of P, Day Z, </em>and <em>My Hero One’s Justice 2</em> won’t be free after September 1, so add them to your game library before then if you want to play any of them in the future. Also, keep in mind that you can only play these PS Plus games if you have an active PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium membership.</p>
