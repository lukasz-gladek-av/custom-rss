              <p><span>No Games For Genocide, a collective of video game workers and union organizers, just announced a pledge to boycott Xbox. It calls on journalists, developers, streamers, and consumers to participate in the Palestinian-led BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) movement against Microsoft, which it’s accused of being complicit in Israeli war crimes. The tech giant recently cut off cloud services to an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud"><span>used them for mass surveillance of Palestinians</span></a><span>, but continues supplying them to the rest of the military.</span></p> <p><span>After years of acquisitions, Microsoft has become a gaming industry monolith, and avoiding it entirely may prove difficult for many, especially considering how dire the industry’s job crisis has been over the last few years. But </span><a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/"><span>No Games For Genocide</span></a><span> believes that the more people who take part in their movement’s proposed collective actions, the better chance the tech giant will take notice.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The games industry in particular is at the intersection of entertainment and tech, and there are a lot of material links—when we’re looking at the tech aspect of hardware and software—there are a lot of connections between the games industry and the genocide that Israel is committing against the Palestinian people,” Sara Khan, a content creator, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/gameassist"><span>cofounder of Game Assist</span></a><span>, and one of No Games For Genocide’s organizers, told me over a video call. “A few of us really wanted to organize around that, and organize people within the industry to say ‘we don’t want these ties’ and find a way to move past them.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and IWGB Game Workers Union founder, Austin Kelmore, worked with other industry members to organize No Games For Genocide and determine where to focus its attention. The IWGB recently unionized Disco Elysium maker ZA/UM and has been fighting Rockstar Games over the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-union-rockstar-court-legal-developers-2000643478"><span>firing of 34 </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> developers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Sort of serendipitously, the </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft"><span>Palestinian-led BDS movement</span></a><span> announced earlier this year that Xbox was going to be one of their new consumer targets,” Khan explained.” It made sense for it to be a priority campaign for us.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/app.bsky.feed.post/3m6zcsllmoc2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreielby3tqjwmmgrdbdifrubaewzhyln7onkchbyj6t7wx4skskvbtm"> <p lang="en">SIGN OUR BOYCOTT XBOX PLEDGE: We are asking gamers, game workers, streamers &amp; journalists to join us in boycotting &amp; divesting from Xbox, to force Microsoft to end its complicity in the genocide of Palestinians.</p> <p>We’ve provided concrete actions everyone can take. Sign here: nogamesforgenocide.com</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn?ref_src=embed">No Games For Genocide (@nogamesforgenocide.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/post/3m6zcsllmoc2k?ref_src=embed">2025-12-02T16:00:16.473Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>No Games For Genocide has been working with the BDS National Committee to organize its campaign, which doesn’t just include signing the pledge, but offers a variety of other ways people can participate. </span></p>

 <p><span>It argues that consumers should avoid purchasing Microsoft or Xbox products, streamers shouldn’t play Xbox-published games on stream (or accept sponsorships from any Xbox game studio), journalists should “halt all coverage of Xbox-published games,” and developers should “demand [their] publisher not publish [their] game on the Xbox and Microsoft Stores,” among other things.</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and their fellow organizers know these are some pretty tall orders. “People understandably are facing hurdles and have to consider the potential risks to their job security, their livelihood, which is completely understandable,” they said. “This is definitely more long-term work. How do we build that collective power? How do we make sure we’re protecting people’s jobs and accounting for that risk? […] As individuals, these things are scary; the risks that they carry are very real, so it’s important for us to build that collective power.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps with that risk in mind, many of the pledge’s signatories (which include the investigative YouTube channel People Make Games and worker-owned game studio Soft, Not Weak) are at the consumer level. “That’s immediately more accessible to folks,” Khan explained. “Hopefully, over time, we’d love to be able to get more studios or media outlets in a position to commit to the pledge.”</span></p> <p><span>The term “collective power” comes up a lot; the notion that organizing behind a common goal can create cover and/or protection for individuals who want to publicly take a political position that may result in retaliation. Khan likened it to union organizing and how workers feel empowered to stand up for fair wages and labor protections together as a unit: “How can we build towards you being in a position—not just you as an individual in your workplace, but hopefully multiple individuals, perhaps the entire workplace—to get you into a position where this would be doable? […] There is only so much we can do as individuals. There’s so much more we can do as a collective.”</span></p> <p><span>But didn’t Israel and Palestine just agree on a ceasefire? And what about the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">September 2025 “update” from Microsoft</a> that confirmed the company “ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel Ministry of Defense?” When asked, Khan pointed back to the</span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians"><span> official BDS statement</span></a><span> after </span><span>Microsoft announced it was terminating Israel’s access to AI and Azure cloud tech</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><span>Microsoft remains a key technological pillar in Israel’s apartheid regime and its genocide in Gaza,” the BDS news post read. “It continues to equip the Israeli military, government, and prisons with the technology used to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Khan also emphasized that Microsoft and other video game companies are complicit in the genocide and imperialism taking place in the global south, and that No Games For Genocide’s goal is to help the industry rethink its role in these systems. (In 2023, a</span><a href="https://google.com/search?q=future+class+kotkau&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1119US1119&amp;oq=future+class+kotkau&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgkIBRAhGAoYoAEyBggGECEYCtIBCDQ1OTVqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span> petition created by the Game Awards Future Class calling on The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Gaza</span></a><span> was reportedly ignored.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The violence that Palestinian people have been experiencing is, plain and simple, settler colonial violence,” Khan said. “It’s an occupation, not just apartheid and not just genocide…so a ceasefire is not enough. We have to question the very existence of a settler colonial state, and we have to ask: What does decolonization look like for the Palestinian people?”</span></p> <p><span>No Games For Genocide’s long-term goals are aligned with BDS: “We keep mounting up the pressure until we see Microsoft divesting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Kotaku has reached out to Xbox for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreigh-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launch-time-patch-notes-2000650150</link>
            <guid>1371958</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreig</em>n’s first paid DLC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>The Forsaken Hollow</em></a>, is finally here. If it does it’s job, the new mini-expansion will bring fans back and give them new reasons to obsess over the surprisingly excellent multiplayer roguelike.</p> <p>I’ve cleared my schedule and shamed my friends into joining me for whatever fresh surprises from FromSoftware await us. Here’s everything you need to know about the new content, including what’s in it, when it goes live, and the accompanying patch notes.</p>

 <h2 id="what-time-does-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-launch-in-your-time-zone">What time does <em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</em> go live?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official release schedule of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> The Forsaken Hollows is now available.</p> <p>Learn how to access the content of The Forsaken Hollows here: <a href="https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1">https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1</a> <a href="https://t.co/RJafPEq0dV">pic.twitter.com/RJafPEq0dV</a></p> <p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1995858043746275502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is the part that sucks. The global release times are staggered and consoles get the short end of the stick. <em>The Forsaken Hollow</em> launches December 3 at 6:00 p.m. ET on PC and December 4 at 12:00 a.m. ET. If you’re on Xbox Series X/S, you can pull the time zone trick to get in early, but it seems like everyone on PlayStation 5 and PS4 are out of luck.</p>

 <p>I’m still holding out some small ray of hope that the DLC will magically unlock around 9:00 p.m. ET like most of <em>Nightreign</em>‘s free updates and weekly content rotations. That doesn’t seem to be the care this time around, however.</p>

 <h2>How do you access <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>?</h2> <p>Just because you bought the $15 DLC doesn’t mean the content will automatically be active in your version of <em>Nightreign</em>. To actually access the two additional Nightfarer characters you’ll need to have first defeated Tricephalos, the game’s three-headed wolf Nightlord. After that, head to the Roundtable Hold, talk to the Iron Menial, and get the message from the Small Jar Merchant to unlock the new Scholar and Undertaker classes.</p>

 <p>What about the new Shifting Earth event? To access that and the new Balancers boss fight, you’ll need to have completed the above steps and defeated a second Nightlord. With those conditions met you’ll head to a chapel that appears behind the Small Jar Merchant where you can activate the&nbsp;cataclysmic Shifting Earth event ‘The Great Hollows.’</p>

 <h2>What’s <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC adding to <em>Nightreign</em>?</h2> <p>There’s the Scholar, a new support class whose Character Skill is called Analyze and lets him debuff enemies by keeping them within a scoped view. His passive skill is Bagcraft which lets him hold more items. His Ultimate Art is called Communion and it links enemies so damaging one damages them all, while also doing the same for allies letting them share heals.</p>

 <p>Then there’s Undertaker, a more aggressive melee class whose Character Skill is called Trance and gives her free stamina and bonus speed. Her Ultimate Art is Loathsome Hex which unleashes a flurry of attacks at whatever’s targeted. Her passive, Confluence, briefly gives her another free Ultimate Art any time an ally uses theirs.</p> <p><em>The&nbsp;Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC also adds the aforementioned Great Hollows Shifting Earth event, which isn’t just a repurposed section of the existing map but an entirely new area players will have to fly to with its own points of interest, ruins, and underground mazes. In addition to the new Balancers Nightlord, the DLC is bringing poison swamps to Limveld, fresh field bosses, and also entirely new weapons.</p> <p>Most importantly, it should feel hard. “Whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they’ll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played <em>Nightreign</em>, where there’s still a bit that they’re trying to figure out,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-map-swamp-field-bosses-2000649718">director Junya Ishizaki promised</a>. “[<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> is] definitely a little bit harder, but it’s not ridiculous or anything like that, but that’s still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge.”</p> <h2>A new patch with no Nightfarer balance changes</h2> <p>Finally, the DLC arrives alongside the latest free update which is already live. It includes some small quality-of-life tweaks and a bunch of bug fixes, including for Raider’s Retaliate skill where it wouldn’t work properly and an ongoing issue where some Sites of Grace or Churches wouldn’t activate. Notably, however, there are no actual buffs or nerfs to the existing cast of characters. Maybe FromSoftware wants to see how Scholar and Undertaker compare before decided to rescale them.</p> <p>Here are the full patch notes for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-103"><em>Nightreign</em> version 1.03</a>:</p> <blockquote> <h2>New features</h2> <ul> <li>Added support for The Forsaken Hollows. <ul> <li>If you own the DLC The Forsaken Hollows, it will be displayed in the lower right corner of the title screen.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a display of the currently equipped relics in the Character Selection menu. <ul> <li>You can check the effects of equipped relics by toggling the display.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a feature to set names when registering Relics presets in the Relic Rites menu.</li> <li>Set names can be changed in the All Presets section.</li> <li>The order of presets for each character can now be changed in the All Presets section of the Relic Rites menu. <ul> <li>In the Relic Rites menu, you can change the order of presets (but not the order of the character themselves) in the All Relics section.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added Deep Large Scenic Flatstone to the Collector Signboard shop.</li> <li>The map’s layer display can now be toggled in the Results menu.</li> <li>The relics equipped by each player can now be displayed in the Results menu. <ul> <li>Relics can only be displayed for sessions played in version 1.02 or later.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Players with a Personal Objective that requires defeating a specific target while Reliving a Remembrance can now embark on Expeditions with players whose Personal Objective does not require defeating a specific target. <ul> <li>Personal Objectives that do not require destroying the target will only appear for one player per Expedition.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The flask count will now be highlighted in the following situations:</li> <li>When the flask count is at the maximum capacity,</li> <li>When an enemy-induced effect that influences the flask is triggered.</li> <li>The vertical position of the compass’ rune icon will now be displayed if the runes dropped upon death are significantly above or below the player character.</li> <li>You can now highlight specific events that occur on a map layer that is on a different level from the character’s location in the map menu.</li> <li>Adjusted the Dormant Power selection screen so that the HP gauge and other UI elements remain visible while the screen is displayed.</li> <li>Adjusted the weapon lineup in Limveld’s shops.</li> <li>Added Fire Pots to the shop inventory inside the Spirit Shetler.</li> <li>The target-lock on enemies that are behind when the tombstone summoned by Raider’s Ultimate Art appears no longer gets released.</li> </ul> <h2>Balance Adjustments</h2> <p>In general, the trigger conditions of Relic effects that trigger with low HP, equipment passive effects, and special effects have been broadened.</p> <h3>Changes to Passive Effects and Special Effects</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Added new Passive Effects:</strong> <ul> <li>Improved Melee Attack Power</li> <li>Improved Dash Attacks</li> <li>Improved Rolling Attacks</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Attack Power when Two-Handing.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Attack Up when Wielding Two Armaments.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Chain Attack Finishers.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Charge Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Jump Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Skill Attack Power.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Passive Effect Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Talisman Blue-Feathered Branchsword.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Changes to Relic Effects</h3> <ul> <li>Increased the effect of Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Initial Standard Attack.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Critical Hits.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved XXX Damage (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Attack Power with 3+ XX Equipped (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> </ul> <h3>Other Changes</h3> <ul> <li>Reduced the FP consumption and increased the power of the Wrath of Gold Incantation.</li> </ul> <h2>Bug Fixes &amp;

              <p><span>Every now and then, I remember when </span><i><span>BioShock </span></i><span>lead Ken Levine </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-making-porn-with-my-characters-bioshock-creator-p-1442945516"><span>asked fans to stop sending him porn of Elizabeth from </span><i><span>BioShock Infinite</span></i></a> <span>because it felt like seeing NSFW pictures of a daughter. Smut artists have only gotten bolder in the years since, because they’re sending this art directly to creators on various social media platforms. While some are down for it, Briana White, who voices </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-does-aerith-die-live-sephiroth-1851287690"><span>Aerith</span></a><span> in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>trilogy</span></a><span>, is not.</span></p> <p><span>White responded to a video on </span><a href="https://x.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1995571225926795588"><span>X</span></a><span> of Rei Ami, one of the vocalists from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> (and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><span>unabashed </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>fan</span></a><span>), talking about how much smut she’d been exposed to of the titular demon-hunting trio. The voice of Zoey said it can be shocking but admitted to seeking some of it out herself.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>White responded, saying she doesn’t want people to “normalize” tagging actors in pornographic art of their characters, and that those who do this have “forgotten the meaning of the word ‘inappropriate’.”</span></p> <p><span>“It’s really a shame when [voice actors] want to interact with the people who love the characters on social media, but just a few creeps ruin it for everyone,” White wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“It is a matter of consent,” she continued elsewhere in the thread. “And it can be almost impossible to know what exactly is acceptable or not to an individual just from knowing their social media persona.”</span></p> <p><span>I love smut as much as the next guy, but sending porn to actors unprompted is just harassment. It’s gotta be especially tough when these folks want to be part of the community and get face time with fans, but are met with this weirdo behavior.

              <p>McDonald’s released its new holiday meal, and there’s some good (and tasty) news for fans of the fast-food chain’s French fries. Thanks to the Grinch, McShaker fries are finally going to be available in the United States</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/the-grinch-meal-coming-to-mcdonalds.html">McDonald’s new limited-time-only Grinch Meal became available around the country</a>. The Christmas-themed meal, which comes with a pair of limited-time festive holiday socks, is packaged in special bags featuring the Grinch and contains a medium drink, 10 McNuggets or a Big Mac, and some Dill Pickle “Grinch Salt” McShaker Fries. It’s that last item that has some fast-food lovers excited.</p> <p><a href="https://mcdonalds.fandom.com/wiki/Shake_Shake_Fries">McShaker Fries appear to be a US version of Shake Shake Fries,</a> a concept that has been around for many, many years in places like Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan. The fries have also popped up for limited runs in Canada, the United Kingdom, as well as India. Shake Shake Fries come packaged with a seasoning packet and a bag. You dump the fries and seasoning into the bag, close the top, and, well, as the name implies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Hj_6TvmsEwI">shake it a few times</a> to cover the fries in tasty dust. The concept has never made its way to the United States until now.</p>

 <p>Early reactions to the Grinch’s dill pickle McShaker Fries are pretty positive, with people hoping McDonald’s keeps the concept around past Christmas and maybe even expands on it with some of the flavors found in other parts of the world. Personally, I’m not a pickle guy at all, so these fries sound awful, but I’m excited to see Shake Shake Fries brought over to the US, even if it is part of a Grinch-themed bundle.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as you are already here and reading about limited-time fast-food meals, <a href="https://news.bk.com/blog-posts/burger-king-r-invites-guests-to-dive-into-a-sea-of-flavor-with-all-new-spongebob-tm-movie-menu">Burger King announced a new <em>SpongeBob</em> movie menu</a>. This menu includes a slice of pie and a real Krabby Patty. It also comes in some delightful-looking SpongeBob-themed packaging that will no doubt be sold for $50 or more on eBay by the end of this week.</p>

              <p>If you’ve ever worn glasses, then you know this feeling well: Pop on your lenses and, bam, the world is in HD. That’s not a bad way to describe the difference between <i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> running on the original Switch vs. the new Switch 2.</p> <p>Having shipped on both consoles, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> is a <i>prime</i> opportunity to get a sense of the clear technical differences between Nintendo’s newest console and its last-gen hardware. Sure, we know the Switch 2 is powerful, flexing its GPU muscles with <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> and some <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">excellent ports of demanding open-world Ubisoft games</a>. But <i>Metroid</i> is a first-party exclusive, so it’s a great opportunity to see the differences when <i>just</i> Nintendo’s hardware is the target.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">Ubisoft’s Becoming The King Of Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p>The result? The Switch 2 damn sure renders a pretty picture for our gal Samus’ latest adventure. That said, the OG Switch, while it has a softer image, still looks and runs well enough. The load times though…yeesh. <a href="https://youtu.be/mMc1oik78Vc">This comparison video</a> from ElAnalistaDeBits shows the differences in motion:</p>

  <h2>Switch 2 has a crisper image, and performance mode looks slick</h2> <p>Switch 2 on both quality and performance modes shows a clear advantage when it comes to a higher resolution and clearer images. The performance mode is a touch softer, but you’re trading a bit of fidelity for 120 frames per second. And if you don’t think a framerate that high is worth it, as a former skeptic of anything higher than 60 FPS being worthwhile, I must tell you that you’re wrong.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650159"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650159">© Screenshot: Nintendo / ElAnalistaDeBits / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Switch 1 ain’t nothin’ to sneeze at…but you’re gonna wanna grab a coffee while it loads</h2> <p>If you’re like me and all you have laying around is an original Switch, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> doesn’t look too terrible. And it runs at 60 FPS, which is swell. But perhaps the worst part of running the game on a classic Switch is you’ll be waiting a long time for it to load. The comparison video above shows a loading sequence that only takes the Switch 2 a mere 24 seconds, while the OG console loads in at over a minute and four seconds. Reminds me of playing <i>The Witcher 3</i> on PS4 (still had a great time! But man did I do a lotta waiting).</p>

 <h2>If you’re looking for an excuse to upgrade, <i>Metroid</i> might just be it</h2> <p>Sometimes ya gotta make due with the hardware you have. But if you’ve got some cash burning a hole in your pocket and you’re ready to step into Nintendo’s next generation, and you love <i>Metroid</i>, it seems like the Switch 2 version might make the upgrade worth it. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond"><i>Nintendo Life</i> puts it in their review of <i>Beyond</i></a>, once you see the “next-gen” version in motion, it’s hard to go back:</p> <blockquote><p>Playing this on Switch 1 when docked feels fine enough, but that crispness, that pop, that ludicrously intricate, high-contrast detail, it’s just a bit fuzzy and pixelly by comparison. I personally feel it’s almost the direct antithesis to <i>Pokémon Legends Z-A</i>, which actually felt as though the art style was more cohesive on the weaker platform. Textures have taken an understandable hit, and models that are further away can look quite smeary, but overall the game still looks good. I just can’t help but compare it unfavourably to Switch 2.</p></blockquote> <p>Again, given that the original console runs the game at 60 frames per second, I’d wager the experience of playing the game will still feel good enough, even if it’s a little soft compared to what the latest hardware can deliver. But what are upgrades for if we’re not getting prettier pixels? If you do snag&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em> for the OG Switch and end up acquiring a Switch 2 down the line, you can also upgrade the Switch 1 version to the prettier Switch 2 version for an extra 10 bucks.</p>

              <p>We’ve been banging the drum for deals on reliable, large-capacity portable HDDs for a long time now. Honestly, going without one is really like doing a high-wire act without a net, because having only the one copy of your most sensitive and essential files that lives on your laptop or desktop leaves you one mishap away from losing them forever.</p>
<p>Cyber Week’s one of the best opportunities to get protection for your irreplaceable data, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">one of the best deals still on the board is this one at Amazon on the 5TB version of the WD My Passport external hard drive, which is just $121</a>. That’s a 16% drop from the regular $145, and it’s a stellar price for an external drive with this sort of capacity and reliability from a trusted brand like Western Digital — in fact, it’s the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch portable hard drive. Be sure to click the black model of this palm-sized drive — inexplicably, the blue and red ones are still running at full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ransomware Protection</h2>
<p>External HDDs tend to be fairly static devices, aside from shrinking in physical size and growing in capacity. Beyond that, the features have remained mostly the same. Except now, WD has added software to the My Passport HDD that includes robust protection against the ever-growing and constantly evolving threat of ransomware.</p>
<p>A virus or malware can get into not only your laptop or desktop but also into its peripheral devices, including your portable hard drive. Once there it can install ransomware, which locks you out of your files until you pay a ransom to the hacker. The Acronis True Image for Western Digital software preloaded on the My Passport HDD not only helps you schedule automatic backups, it helps protect your entire system from ransomware, and also allows you to password-protect and give your files 256-bit AES encryption.</p>



<h2>Smaller and Faster</h2>
<p>The WD My Passport HDD comes preformatted for Windows, but can easily be reformatted for use with Macs without losing any of its protective features. WD’s given it a slimming-down from its previous models too – this streamlined version of the My Passport is just 3.21 by 4.33 inches, and exceedingly slim, so you can fit up to 5TB of your most essential files in your pocket to take with you anywhere, and its footprint at your desktop or work station is virtually nil.</p>
<p>It connects via USB-A 3.0, but it’s also compatible with USB-A 2.0 devices, and the 5Gbps data transfer speed allows you to move files to or from your PC or Mac laptop or desktop computers quickly and easily. It can be set up for automatic backups, and is also drag-and-drop ready from the time you connect it.</p>
<p>Those digital photos and videos on your computer need protection in the form of a large-capacity, fast, ultra-reliable backup drive that fits in your pocket and comes with advanced protection. So do your financial records and other sensitive personal information. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">The WD My Passport 5TB portable external hard drive — the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch drive — checks all those boxes, and it’s a great Cyber Week find at just $121 at Amazon.</a></p>
