            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick seems pretty happy with this year’s <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</em> In a new interview, he said the relatively short and linear semi-open-world action game proves that a lot of players will buy games that are focused, not super bloated, and offer a good story. And boy howdy, as someone who loves a nice weekend single-player game, I’m very happy to hear that.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true#:~:text=The%20other%20big,the%20perfect%20result.%E2%80%9D">In a recent interview with T<em>he Game Business</em> newsletter</a>, Zelnick talked about some of the successes Take-Two has had over the past few months. It turns out <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em> isn’t selling as well as expected, which the CEO blames on PC issues and says he expects it to do well in the long term. On the flipside, <em>Mafia: The Old Country,</em> a different game published earlier this year by 2K (a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two), actually <em>beat</em> internal sales expectations. According to Zelnick, it proves that people want well-made, narrative-driven single-player games.</p>

 <p>“What we suspected was confirmed,” Zelnick told the outlet. “Which is just…if you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.”</p>  <h2>Remember when everything wasn’t a live-service thing?</h2> <p>Released in August and developed by Hangar 13,<em> The Old Country</em> is smaller than past <em>Mafia</em> titles, only takes about 11 hours to complete, has no online components, and launched at a reduced price of $50. It’s also the kind of game we don’t really get anymore from AAA publishers like 2K: <a href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions">a big-budget, solo-only, linear action game</a> that lacks a lot of replay value or in-game purchases. Back in the PS2 and even Xbox 360 eras of gaming, this was pretty standard stuff. Not so much anymore.</p>

 <p>However, as Zelnick points out, there is definitely a demand for these types of games. I think a lot of people don’t have the time to dedicate to the latest big online hit, nor can they invest 200 hours into some giant open-world RPG. But a 10- to 12-hour action-adventure game with some great cutscenes, good writing, and no bullshit? Yeah, that’s appealing to a lot of people, myself included.</p> <p>Hopefully<em>, Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s success can be used as a blueprint for Take-Two, and the publisher can greenlight similarly sized projects at its various studios. And we can play those games while we wait for Take-Two’s juggernaut, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6,</em> to finally release one day. Eventually</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> city may not be the most detailed video game world, but like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus,</span></i><span> some of the game’s most delightful subtleties are in how the monsters living in its world behave. Throughout </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, you’ll find Pokémon residing in and out of its designated Wild Zones, and while some of them just kinda spawn into the space, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has a handful of ‘mons that feel more intentional in their placement. Trubbish, the literal trash bag Pokémon, can be found in alleys and around other areas where trash is discarded. A lot of the time, when you see one of these smelly little dudes lounging around, nearby humans are complaining about how they smell bad and they want them gone. So when you do actually get around to catching one of these poison-type Pokémon, an adorable but sad interaction occurs.</span></p> <p><span>If you find a Trubbish hanging out around a bunch of garbage and lift a Poké Ball like you’re going to catch it, the little trash bag smiles and does a little dance, as if it’s excited that someone is finally picking it after spending most of its life being shooed away from the general public. It would almost make me want to catch one and add it to my team if it weren’t so ugly and smelly.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Trubbish lives a hard life in the city. There’s even a whole side quest in which a restaurant asks you to get rid of a group of the sentient garbage bags because their foul odor is bothering the customers. But they are simply little guys who want to be loved like any other Pokémon. It’s sad as hell that these stinky critters are so used to being mistreated that even the slightest hint that they might be accepted makes them dance a little jig.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Hopefully, there will be more of these cute, unscripted interactions in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a><span> DLC adds a plethora of new monsters to the game when it launches on December 10.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-holding-the-line-against-a-500-switch-2-unless-there-are-more-tariffs.1347184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2’s controversial price tag didn’t stop it from becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-nintendo-10-million-mario-kart-world-2000641025">the fastest-selling console at launch ever</a>. Will it stay $450 or break the $500 barrier due to tariffs and inflation? In what should come as some small relief, Nintendo recently signaled that fans don’t have to worry about a price hike in the near future.</p> <p>“We believe that we’ll be able to maintain the current level of profitability for hardware for the time being unless there are significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected events,” Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told investors <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf">in a recent Q&amp;A</a>. “While we are aware that the costs of various materials are rising, we also anticipate some areas where cost reduction may be achieved for Nintendo Switch 2 through ongoing mass production efforts.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “Therefore, currently we do not expect the recent rise in material costs to greatly impact profitability. We will continue our efforts to maintain the same level of profitability as we currently have.”</p> <p>Good news, right?</p> <p>While fans flooded Nintendo livestream chats with demands that the company lower its prices, $450 ended up being <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-preorder-mk9-1851755723">squarely in the middle</a> of what experts had predicted. It was higher than the aggressively low end of $400 and under the worst-case scenario of $500. Some analysts also suspected that the price tag included a cushion to absorb some of the blow from Trump’s tariffs on countries where the console is manufactured, like Vietnam.</p>

 <p>As a result, while the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and even the original Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">all received unprecedented price hikes</a> earlier this year, the Switch 2 has remained consistent at its launch price. The other bit of good news is that Nintendo actually manufactured enough stock to make sure just about everyone who wanted one could get one. That’s meant zero haggling with scalpers on reseller sites like eBay and Facebook Marketplace, a refreshing change from the early days of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S back during the pandemic.</p> <p>But I also wouldn’t expect the Switch 2 to come down in price until…well, probably ever. We never saw the original Switch get a price drop, and this one is selling even better. Nintendo has said it’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-donkey-kong-2000641323">happy to keep manufacturing that earlier console,</a> too, as long as it keeps selling, which it continues to do.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fans-are-racing-to-decode-the-latest-mass-effect-5-tease.1347142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During the best of times, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-n7-day-armor-location-1851692131"><span>N7 Day</span></a><span> is BioWare’s annual </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>celebration. Sometimes the studio teases what’s to come in its science fiction universe with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958"><span>concept art or cinematic trailers</span></a><span>, but this year sounds like it’s going to be a bit quieter. If you’ve been paying attention to all the turmoil </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>at the studio in recent years</span></a><span>, that’s probably not surprising, but BioWare is assuring fans that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>is still in development and is the studio’s primary focus.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/"><span>post on the studio’s blog</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>executive producer Mike Gamble addressed fans, more or less telling them the team doesn’t have much to show this November 7. I guess that’s what happens sometimes when you make an official community day; even when you’re not in a place to show something off, you’ve gotta say something publicly.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Like you, we’ve heard the rumors lately,” Gamble writes. “You’ve made it clear you care deeply about what’s next. So let’s start by setting the record straight: the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show. Until then, thank you for your patience because y’all are thirsty for news and I see you looking for secret meaning in my tweets (okay, sometimes they have secret meaning).”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, despite Gamble’s suggestion that the team may not have much to show off for some time, there might be some more substantial teases coming. The blog post has a bunch of random italicized letters that, when isolated, spell “url krogan.” Krogan are one of the alien species in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>universe, but it’s unclear at this point what this might be teasing. No doubt fans will be working to piece things together as the day goes on.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond the next game, Gamble does confirm something significant about another </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>project: the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-tv-show-movie-amazon-live-action-fallout-1851692186"><span>Amazon TV adaptation</span></a><span>. After rumors and speculation circulated on the internet that the show might be a retread of the original trilogy’s story, Gamble confirmed that it won’t be, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-show-amazon-casting-characters-shepard-2000626536"><span>and thank god for that</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game,” Gamble writes. “The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>development may be ongoing, but BioWare’s pivot into a one-game studio after EA made drastic cuts to the company’s staff means that </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>is likely in limbo. </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>ended with a cliffhanger </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436"><span>in its post-credits scene</span></a><span>, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>much of the talent behind that series has been scattered</span></a><span> across other EA studios or left the company entirely.</span></p> <p><strong>Update, 11/7/25, 1:10 p.m.:&nbsp;</strong>Fans have found what appear to be two hidden YouTube links in the HTML of the post. One of them is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kv0voPC9LRk">an old&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 3&nbsp;</em>trailer for the game’s multiplayer mode</a>, the other is <a href="https://t.co/ZEqpCskPFV">a private video</a>. What could it mean? Some are speculating this could mean the <em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&nbsp;</em>remaster collection may finally get&nbsp;<em>ME3</em>‘s cooperative multiplayer mode that was absent from the 2021 package, but that’s just speculation at this point.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like there’s a hidden secret in this N7 DAY 2025 blog…</p> <p>Two YouTube links? Interesting… 👀<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MassEffect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MassEffect</a> <a href="https://t.co/4mtqtx9Oda">pic.twitter.com/4mtqtx9Oda</a></p> <p>— We are Mass Effect (@WeAreMassEffect) <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreMassEffect/status/1986836561757929705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><strong>Update, 11/7/25, 1:36 p.m.:&nbsp;</strong>BioWare has posted a url on its social feeds, but has redacted part of it. The url is “https://www.masseffect[dot]com/[ERROR A20N7S12],” so it seems like something is being posted on the official&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect </em>site today, but we still don’t know what yet. Fans are trying to see if there’s any meaning in the error message, and if anyone comes up with anything we’ll be sure to update this story.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">TRANSMISSION INTERCEPTED // https://www.masseffect[dot]com/[ERROR A20N7S12] <a href="https://t.co/qLuHYlj8Ia">https://t.co/qLuHYlj8Ia</a></p> <p>— Mass Effect (@masseffect) <a href="https://twitter.com/masseffect/status/1986863846288760851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
