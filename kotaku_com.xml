When you finally get your hands on the new game, you’ll be destroying everything at 60FPS, and that’s because Nintendo believed it was necessary for this latest Donkey Kong adventure. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196698" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 15, Nintendo posted a lengthy and interesting three-part interview</a></span> with <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>’s lead developers. Topics discussed in the interview include redesigning Donkey Kong, figuring out the game’s tone and mood, and more. But one part that caught my attention is when Daisuke Watanabe, the game’s art director, and Wataru Tanaka, another director on <em>Bananza</em>, discussed voxel technology and the Switch 2 hardware. </p><p>The entire discussion around voxel tech, which allows the ground and terrain in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-direct-diddy-1851784735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-direct-diddy-1851784735"><em>Bananza</em></a></span><em> </em>to deform and break apart dynamically, is surprisingly deep and worth reading. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/#:~:text=Tanaka%3A%20From,the%20game%20possible.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/#:~:text=Tanaka%3A%20From,the%20game%20possible." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The key moment came at the end</a></span>, when Tanaka explained that after experimenting with pushing voxel tech on the OG Switch, they discovered it wasn’t powerful enough to let them go as wild as they wanted. So the game hopped over to Switch 2 and suddenly was running at a smooth 60FPS. </p><p>“With the move to Switch 2, we gained not only more memory but also greater processing capacity,” said Tanaka. “That gave us the freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas we’d previously abandoned because they were too demanding. When we got down to trying it, we discovered that not only could it handle the heavy processing requirements, but it also ran at 60 FPS. Things we’d given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible.” </p><p>Watanabe further added that with <em>Bananza </em>running at 60FPS, smashing up the world became a lot more “satisfying” and was a big improvement over 30FPS. </p><p>“The physics of smashing involve lots of things all happening at once,” explained Watanabe. “Donkey Kong throws a punch, the terrain and objects break apart, and visual effects show debris flying outward. All of that is packed into a single moment. At 30 fps, we couldn’t fully capture everything that happens in that instant. But at 60 fps, we saw that sense of destruction coming through much more clearly.” </p><p>Watanabe added: “Not only did Switch 2 enable the game to run well, it unlocked the game’s full potential – no, it made the game possible.”<br></p><p>As a self-described video game tech snob who values high framerates, I’m very, very happy that the team behind <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>decided to focus so much on nailing 60FPS. Now, I just have to wait until July 17 to play the <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> team’s next big 3D platformer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303]]></content:encoded>

Pikachu here will cost you a whopping $525, making it hugely more costly than those even-bigger plushies you can find on the Pokémon Center. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10192-101/pikachu-poke-plush-26-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10192-101/pikachu-poke-plush-26-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu over there</a></span> is 27" tall, and will “only” set you back $200. And you can cuddle <em>him</em>.</p><p>However, damn, the statue looks really good. It’s a fantastic pose, and unlike the squishy teddies, doesn’t look like a Pikachu that’s gone through a washing machine. As ridiculous as terms like “life-size” and “lifelike” are about a plastic (well, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://help.sideshow.com/article/163-a-list-of-materials-used-in-sideshow-items&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://help.sideshow.com/article/163-a-list-of-materials-used-in-sideshow-items" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polystone</a></span>”) model of a fictional cartoon character, it’s really lifelike! I don’t even care much for Pikachu and I’m wishing I were a rich man who could afford to spend the month’s mortgage on a fun toy.</p><p>Pikachu represents the first of a new range of licensed collectibles the company will be making in conjunction with Pokémon. It can be pre-ordered now, although isn’t expected to ship until at least the end of this year, presumably because they’ll be making them to order.</p><figure id="" data-id="30c1008295c990694e7bb1a85573615a" data-recommend-id="image://30c1008295c990694e7bb1a85573615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Charizard and a Pikachu statue next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Charizard and a Pikachu statue next to each other." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sideshow / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30c1008295c990694e7bb1a85573615a" data-recommend-id="image://30c1008295c990694e7bb1a85573615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Charizard and a Pikachu statue next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up from the range will be Charizard, which tragically <em>won’t</em> be life-size. I checked <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charizard_(Pok%C3%A9mon)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charizard_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Bulbapedia</a></span> and apparently canonically, the ‘Zard measures over five-and-a-half feet. Imagine having <em>that</em> in your living room. Instead, an early glimpse suggests the figure will measure about the same height as Pikachu, although given its fiery base taking half the height, it’s depicted considerably smaller than ol’ electric cheeks. It’ll still be a very impressive piece of completely needless nonsense to own, but unlikely to scare away unruly children.</p><p>Charizard isn’t open for pre-orders yet, so this is looking like a measured roll-out, perhaps even a careful testing of the market. Sideshow makes its money selling premium figures, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/marvel-venom-hot-toys-912829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/marvel-venom-hot-toys-912829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this astonishing one-sixth scale Venom</a></span> for an eye-watering $460 (although it is over 20 inches tall), so this is their stock-in-trade. But might Pokémon skew a little young for its audience? It’ll be interesting to see.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-statue-figure-life-size-sideshow-1851786279]]></content:encoded>

There was a time when video games were all about gruesomely murdering people, watching as the viscera was torn from their dismembered limbs, hearing that sloppy, wet slap as a severed leg flopped messily to the ground. But now it’s all factories and conveyor belts, with careful industrious management and not a writhing stream of entrails to be found. And we let <em>children</em> play these games?</p><p>To give you an idea of how popular this reasonably new genre has become (yes, yes, such games have appeared since the dawn of the hobby, but not as part of a thriving genre), the Automation Fest includes 259 games, primarily from the last ten years. And that’s a lot of games to look through if you don’t know where to start. Fortunately, like the well-oiled, overly elaborate machine we are, we <em>do</em> know where to begin digging through the stockpiles, and which games you should—I dunno—place on the conveyor belt to your wishlist? Is that something? (<em>Well, it’s</em> something<em>—Ed</em>)</p><h2 id="h318848"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/300570/Infinifactory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/300570/Infinifactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinifactory</a></span></h2><p>It would be foolish to attribute the current success of automation games to one specific developer, not least because no game appears in a vacuum, instead influenced by the decades of development that came before it. But that aside, I’m going to entirely attribute the current success of automation games to one specific developer: Zachtronics.</p><p>Founded by Zach Barth, Zachtronics first created <em>Infiniminer—</em>a game which influenced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>—and then blew up puzzle gaming with 2011's <em>SpaceChem</em>. But in 2015, the studio released <em>Infinifactory</em>, combining ideas from both, and in doing so, instantly made automation gaming A Big Thing. Rather than simply being a factory sim where you build these intricate assembly lines to solve challenges, <em>Infinifactory</em> also had a batshit storyline of alien abduction and being forced to manufacture suspicious equipment likely to be used for nefarious purposes.</p><p>Now 10 years old, it feels like the granddaddy of this whole festival, discounted to half price for the week.</p><p>Rather than bloat the rest of these selections with other games from Zachtronics, which could very reasonably just have the entire list to itself, I’ll just note that nearly all the studio’s classics are discounted this week. There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Opus Magnum</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SpaceChem</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shenzhen I/O</em></a></span> and many others at half off. The studio’s last game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Last Call BBS</em></a></span>, isn’t discounted, but you can pick it up as part of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2925/The_Zachtronics_Puzzle_Pack/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2925/The_Zachtronics_Puzzle_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zachtronics Puzzle Pack</a></span> which contains all the games, currently 39 percent off.</p><h2 id="h318849"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satisfactory</a></span></h2><p>At the other end of the timeline sits <em>Satisfactory</em>, 2024's smash hit evolution of the genre, where your assembly line constructions also take place on an alien planet, but this time in an open world that you’re free to explore, and even featuring combat. But, of course, the primary focus is on making a factory, which here can be ridiculously tall, complicated, and...exploitative of local nature?</p><p>First-person is obviously not the normal way such construction-driven games are played, but <em>Satisfactory</em> has absolutely nailed it. (And before we move on, can we just sit back and give a small round of applause for the title? Perfect puns are too easily glossed over, and this deserves its props. Until you’re Googling for it, and then...) This is a factory-building game with jump pads and vehicles and angry fauna.</p><p>It’s pretty hard to overstate the popularity of Coffee Stain Studios’ game (yes, the same people who made <em>Goat Simulator</em>!). This has received an eye-watering 237,000 reviews on Steam, and over 96 percent of them are positive. That’s just extraordinary. And nearly a year after release, it’s still seeing 25,000 or more people playing simultaneously every day. And for good reason. This week you can pick it up for 30 percent off.</p><h2 id="h318850"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Factorio</a></span></h2><p>And here, bridging between the two ends of the genre’s long road, is <em>Factorio</em>, 2020's mega-hit automation game. The 2D, top-down factory-making sim feels a lot like a precursor to <em>Satisfactory</em>, with its free building, predatory local fauna, and enormous world. (Well, this one’s infinite, while Coffee Stain’s is a slightly smaller 30km².) </p><p>Do not be fooled by the late-90s style of the graphics; this is a thoroughly modern game of ludicrous complexity, where you mine your resources, research your tech, and automate your production lines, all while—yup—exploiting the local ecology. As such, you’ll also need to defend your factories from external forces. Oh, and credit where it’s due: this game went to Kickstarter in 2013, two years before <em>Infinifactory</em> appeared.</p><p><em>Factorio</em> has been wildly successful, selling millions of copies, and developers Wube Software are still releasing updates as recently as...today! Wube has also committed to never putting the game on sale, which—honestly—good for them! That means it’s always $35, whether you buy it during this fest or next week, but 96 percent of 217,000 people reckon that’s a good deal.</p><h2 id="h318851"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275490/Kaizen_A_Factory_Story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275490/Kaizen_A_Factory_Story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaizen: A Factory Story</a></span></h2><p>And let’s complete the loop. While it’s only been out for a few hours, it’s fairly safe to say that short of a very surprising twist, <em>Kaizen: A Factory Story</em> is about to be the next big automation game. Why? Because this is developed by Coincidence, which is Zachtronics in a new hat.</p><p>Funnily enough, Zachtronics was closed in 2022 because Zach Barth thought the studio had become stuck making factory-based puzzle games, and wanted himself and his studio mates to be set free to develop other things. Three years  and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870750/Add_Astra/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870750/Add_Astra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one math-based puzzle game</a></span> later, it seems that other things weren’t perhaps as attractive as they looked, because Barth and chums are back with a brand new automation-based puzzler. Whoops!</p><p>While <em>Kaizen</em> only has a handful of reviews so far, all have been very positive. This time, you’re running a Japanese assembly line around the turn of the 1990s, working out how to arrange machinery and processes to best create a range of products. And its story explores the time period in what I’ve read are surprisingly emotional ways.</p><h2 id="h318852"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2072840/Word_Factori/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2072840/Word_Factori/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Word Factori</a></span></h2><p>A little more off the beaten path is <em>Word Factori</em>, a puzzle game in which you must create words but only after having invented recipes for the alphabet.</p><p>What begins as a rather cute game about combining letter parts through various machine parts to build new ones, starting with only the letter i and building from there, very quickly becomes the most astonishingly intricate and brain-hurting challenge. It looks so friendly and welcoming, but when you’re trying to optimize your production lines for the more efficient creation of tricksy words, you’ll realize its real depths.</p><p>Spelling the word “CAT” has never been so difficult.</p><hr><p>Obviously there are <em>so</em> many other games worth checking out in the selection, and we’ve barely scraped the surface of even the best-known examples here. If you’re looking to get into automated gaming, these are an excellent way to start, but make sure to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/automation&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dig through the full list</a></span> for any treasures that may perfectly match your mood.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-automation-fest-factory-games-satisfactory-1851786275]]></content:encoded>
