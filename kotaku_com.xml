Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC.”</p><p>While there’s no new release date for the console versions (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/march-2025-game-release-calendar-mlb-show-assassin-1851767497&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/march-2025-game-release-calendar-mlb-show-assassin-1851767497">PC comes out March 6</a></span>), players on those platforms will get some free rewards for the inconvenience. All would-be PS5 and Xbox players will get all in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience points, and more that they would have earned during season 1 if they’d played at launch. No grinding involved! Those who pre-ordered the game on those platforms, meanwhile, will get an extra $10 in in-game currency when the game goes live there. Hopefully the game’s not dead by that point. </p><p>If you’re sitting here asking yourself what the hell is <em>FragPunk</em>, well, it’s a very colorful, very pretty-looking multiplayer PvP FPS <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786">announced back at Microsoft’s summer showcase last year</a></span>. Players collect cards that change how they play every round. “Cards can amplify your jump height, reverse the roles of attackers and defenders, engulf your bullets in flame or turn them into chain lightning, and even may resurrect you and your team,” reads the Steam page description. </p><p>It sounds neat, but also looks very much like “another one of those.” Weirdly, this potential also-ran is another NetEase game, which means that in addition to going up against an already crowded multiplayer field consisting of everything from <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to <em>Valorant</em> and <em>The Finals</em>, <em>FragPunk</em> is also going up against NetEase’s own <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, another free-to-play hero shooter that’s just three months old. Maybe <em>FragPunk</em> was the Chinese publisher’s backup plan if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> didn’t hit. </p><p>But it did, so hopefully <em>FragPunk</em> can still find some room to breathe at launch, at least so it can survive long enough for console players to give it a shot while its potential community is still thriving. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s all good, but a bit of wood and steel won’t suffice for long. You need to upgrade your weapons and armor in <em>Avowed</em> if you wish to go toe-to-toe with some of Eora’s fearsome beasts.

This can be done at the glowing Adra stones scattered about the game world, usually within a circle of dirt. Once you place your Camp, there’s a Workbench off to one side that looks more like a small storage tent, complete with a few crates and a small table, where you can spend resources to upgrade the level and stats of most weapons and armor pieces in the game. These levels are:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Common (Green)</strong></li><li><strong>Fine (Blue)</strong></li><li><strong>Exceptional (Purple)</strong></li><li><strong>Superb (Red)</strong></li><li><strong>Legendary (Yellow)</strong></li></ul><figure id="" data-id="54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-recommend-id="image://54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-recommend-id="image://54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You click on the weapon in the list, and if it’s lit up white, it means it can be upgraded. In the middle of the screen, you’ll see its stats right now and the stats it’ll reach if you upgrade. Select it, agree to upgrade, and ta-da, it’s now more powerful!</p><p>There’s a catch, however. You can’t upgrade any old weapon you pick up off the ground and expect to walk away with a legendary or unique piece. It doesn’t quite work that way. For all common weapons and armor pieces, the max level is Superb Quality +3, which increases most of the item’s stats by a significant amount. In some cases, you’ll receive an item with over +100 additional damage, so it’s still good! However, if you find a unique weapon, you can upgrade it to Legendary. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-how-to-find-adra-upgrade-equipment-rpg-1851767566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-how-to-find-adra-upgrade-equipment-rpg-1851767566">You’ll require Adra</a></span>, which you can acquire via gold chests, Strangled Adra, and Merchants.</p><figure id="" data-id="2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-recommend-id="image://2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-recommend-id="image://2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h4340"><a id=""></a><strong>How to get upgrade materials</strong></h2><p>You have a few options regarding acquiring the necessary upgrade materials in Avowed to keep you fighting toe-to-toe with any of the game’s enemies.
