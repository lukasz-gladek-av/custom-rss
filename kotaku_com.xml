After establishing the <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like a Dragon</em> series as one of the best action-RPG sandboxes around, he had the chance to start up a new team to work on a new franchise. Fans have been excited to see what his crew is cooking up. But things might not be going according to plan. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,195896,195859" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-studio-toshihiro-nagoshi-beat-takeshi-sega-netea-1848538573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-studio-toshihiro-nagoshi-beat-takeshi-sega-netea-1848538573">Nagoshi’s next game</a></span>, an open world action drama that sounds very much in the vein of the beloved <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like a Dragon</em> series he pioneered, entered full production last year. A studio of about 80 people were reportedly working on it, and he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Famitsu</em></a></span> in the fall that he was currently in the process of trying to decide which content to cut to keep the project on-track, arguing that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-dragon-game-length-toshihiro-nagoshi-sega-1851694986&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-dragon-game-length-toshihiro-nagoshi-sega-1851694986">modern developers keep making their games too big</a></span>. </p><p>Now, however, NetEase is reportedly pulling back from a bunch of gaming investments it made in recent years, including in Japan, where it courted veteran names like Nagoshi as well as Goichi “Suda51” Suda to work on new projects. “NetEase-funded Japanese creators — Nagoshi among them — have been given time to wrap up ongoing projects,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/openai-bans-accounts-appearing-to-work-on-a-surveillance-tool?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/openai-bans-accounts-appearing-to-work-on-a-surveillance-tool?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a></span>. “The message from headquarters in Hangzhou has been that there’ll be no additional funding or time, the people said.”</p><p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, this strategy  shift means that NetEase isn’t planning to spend on marketing or promotion for the games greenlit in Japan, a price tag that can often equate for 30-50 percent or more of a game’s entire production budget. Reading between the lines, the suggestion is that even if Nagoshi’s next game does make it out the door, it won’t get the red carpet rollout fans would hope for, or a new IP might be needed in order to have a chance of standing out in an ever more crowded field. </p><p>NetEase  acquired Grasshopper Manufacture, the studio behind cult-hits <em>Let It Die</em> and <em>No More Heroes</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netease-games-acquires-goichi-sudas-grasshopper-manufac-1847914966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netease-games-acquires-goichi-sudas-grasshopper-manufac-1847914966">back in 2021 as well</a></span>. Director Suda teased a bunch of upcoming games the following year. “I want to do a project focusing on the younger Grasshopper staff, and have them create games in their own new game style,” he said at the time. “First I’d like to start with that...And then see if we can make it to a second and third title. I really want to do it properly and make it work.” Unfortunately, those plans now sound like they could be short-lived. </p><p>This new retreat is reportedly part of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/openai-bans-accounts-appearing-to-work-on-a-surveillance-tool?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/openai-bans-accounts-appearing-to-work-on-a-surveillance-tool?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pattern of “volatility”</a></span> at the Chinese gaming publisher.
