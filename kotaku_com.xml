            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrated gaming auteur Hideo Kojima is making waves once again with statements about artificial intelligence. This time, sporting a bit of a new look in a recent interview, Kojima has said he sees AI as a boon that can help cut out what he describes as “tedious” tasks, helping developers to lower costs and produce games faster.</p> <p>In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/">interview with <i>Wired Japan</i></a> (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-gives-his-verdict-on-use-of-ai-in-gaming-3269428/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>), Kojima described “a future where [he stays] one step ahead; creating together with AI,” referring to the tech as “a friend.” Kojima presents an optimistic perspective on how the tech can be used, not necessarily to lead the creative projects, but rather to assist with mundane tasks to “boost efficiency.”</p>

 <p>It’s not the first time Kojima has opined on AI in the industry. Previously <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-ai-important-3d-ps6-portable-space-marine-last-of-us-2000621087">he described AI</a> as potentially as significant a development for games as the shift from 2D to 3D. He also recently suggested that AI will likely be used to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/hideo-kojima-remakes-sequels-ai/">generate remakes and sequels</a>. Though the most recent statements on the potential friendliness of AI are rather optimistic, Kojima’s own creative output might have something to say about that. AI and advanced technology has often been a focal point of Kojima’s creative works, though they’ve typically played an antagonistic role in his fictional worlds.</p>

 <h2>Kojima’s previous games were far from optimistic about AI</h2> <p>Kojima’s statements are disappointing for those of us concerned about the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/federal-judge-rules-copyrighted-books-are-fair-use-ai-training-rcna214766">thorny issues of copyright</a> in the context of artificial intelligence systems, the desire to <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-real-work-ai">replace human labor </a>wholesale, and the inexcusable energy consumption that’s literally setting us back in our efforts to <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">lessen the impact of climate change</a>. But they also ring dissonantly with the game developer’s own artistic output, namely <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> and <i>4</i>, which speculate not just on the dangers of artificial intelligence, but how the messiness of human history, hierarchies, and internet behavior could use (and lose control of) such highly advanced tech.</p>

  <p>Unravelling <i>MGS2</i> and other <i>MGS</i> games is messy business; like Kojima’s recent works, they’re long, dense games. But the modern embrace of AI, which is already being used to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-team-keeps-posting-ai-portraits-of-him-and-we-keep-clicking">efficiently produce propaganda</a> and which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/30/peter-thiel-palantir-threat-to-americans">folks who do not have humanity’s best interests in mind</a> are strongly encouraging, sounds a hell of a lot like what we were being warned about while the digital Colonel Campbell lost his artificial mind in <i>MGS2</i>.</p> <p>As <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-vocabulary-for-speaking-about-the-future/">Cory Doctorow once said</a>, science fiction “is a literature that tells you how to prevent the bad tomorrows.” And while I appreciate Kojima’s optimism, I don’t think just seeing this tech “as a friend” is going to solve the ills of the bad <i>today</i>, much less the bad tomorrow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-is-getting-a-sequel-1833479366">Nearly six years ago</a>, we learned that 2004’s clunky cult classic<em> RPG Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> was going to get a big ol’ sequel. Now, flash forward to October 2025, and <em>Bloodlines 2</em> is nearly here after <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-writer-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-1844776074">a rocky development cycle</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-past-2021-1846333086"> that saw one studio replaced</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">with another and multiple delays</a>. So is the game worth the 20-year wait and all the delays? Well, it depends who you ask.</p> <p>On October 17, three days ahead of <em>Bloodlines 2′</em>s launch on consoles and PC, reviews for the upcoming Chinese Room-developed action adventure RPG went live across multiple outlets. And critics are all over the place with this one. I’ve read a few reviews that make it sound like one of 2025’s worst games, other reviews that call it fine, and even a few that make it clear the reviewer truly enjoyed their time in the digital streets of rain-soaked and vampire-infested Seattle.</p>

  <p>Some critics praised the game’s atmosphere, storytelling, writing, and side characters, while others found a lot of that stuff to be disappointing. Others enjoyed <em>Bloodlines 2’s</em> combat and stealth, while some seem like they would rather eat glass than play anymore. The one thing nearly every review agrees on is that this isn’t really a sequel to <em>Bloodlines</em>. Instead, to many, it’s a linear, action-focused spin-off set in a bland open world with bad side quests and some neat ideas.</p> <p>While some might find such a wide array of critical reviews disappointing or annoying, I love it. These are the kinds of games that can often surprise you, though not always in a good way. Either way, I’m going to try and check out <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> when it launches on October 21 on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>  <h2><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review/">PC Gamer</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Bloodlines 2</em> is good, sometimes even great, and it absolutely sated my appetite for a blood-fuelled undead yarn. But it is a sequel in name only, and it never really enthusiastically embraces being an RPG. Given its predecessor’s cult status, and the source material, that’s bound to be a disappointment for some. – Fraser Brown</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Eurogamer</a></h2> <blockquote><p>This is an action RPG with barely any character development (or even customisation) in it. You have four abilities you can use, tied to the clan you belong to, and you will unlock all of them within a couple of hours of play. And that’s it – you won’t get any more powerful after that. Powers don’t evolve or change. You can, if you like, unlock powers from other clans, but this won’t increase your overall power or offer more abilities to use in combat. It only offers variation and the potential to mix which four abilities you use, which might lead to finding a new combination you prefer, but it didn’t for me. I ended up using more or less my default abilities for the entirety of the 25-hour game. This, coupled with there being no loot or equipment in the game, makes character development feel thin to the point of nonexistent. – Robert Purchase</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">IGN</a></h2> <blockquote><p>Where it falls down the most, unfortunately, is as an RPG. You are playing as an elder vampire, so it’s not exactly a typical zero-to-hero story. But just to give a representative example, the damage your melee attacks do at the very beginning is exactly the same as it will be in the final boss fight. You awaken new powers called Disciplines, like being able to turn invisible or smooch an enemy to turn them to your side, but you’ll get all of them for your chosen clan within the first eight hours or so, after which point anything else is mostly a sidegrade. You can upgrade your health track by finding hidden symbols painted in blood across Seattle, but overall there isn’t much of a sense of power progression throughout most of the campaign. -Leana Hafer</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review-3265905/">Dexerto</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Bloodlines 2</em> isn’t the typical RPG many were expecting. It tells a great political story, taking you on a grown-up adventure where every choice you make affects the narrative, and it’s wonderfully complex. The city that The Chinese Room has built has a great atmosphere, and it’s populated by lovable (and hateable) characters. However, it could do so much more to live up to its name by taking great elements from the TTRPG to make you really feel like a vampire. As an adventure game, <em>Bloodlines 2</em> shines, but those missing features suck the life out of it as an RPG, for better and for worse. – Jessica Filby</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review/">Gamesradar</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is the definition of a crying shame. Clumsy writing and flat, repetitive world design expose a handful of good ideas that never take root, while its poor technical quality and unstable performance will render it unplayable for some. The result is a half-baked, blunt-toothed action-mystery hybrid that disappoints at almost every turn, struggling to leave even the ghost of a good impression. – Jasmine Gould-Wilson</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review-aged-but-still-a-fine-wine/1900-6418425/">GameSpot&nbsp;</a></h2> <blockquote><p>Fortunately, I think the wait (and the absolute&nbsp;chaos of development) was mostly worth it. Though I wouldn’t call <em>Bloodlines 2</em> a great game, per se, I had a great time playing it. For better or worse, it retains a lot of <em>Bloodlines’</em>&nbsp;DNA, blending action, stealth, and mystery to create a mature and enthralling, choice-driven RPG. Though not as nitty-gritty or system-heavy as its predecessor, it still largely feels the same to play. I swear, I experienced deja vu as I crouched through warehouses and nervously spoke with characters seemingly eager to sink their teeth into me if I said the wrong thing to them. However, it&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>carries with it some jank and technical issues that make it feel like an early aughts title. -Jessica Cogswell</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/review">PCGamesN</a></h2> <blockquote><p>It seems The Chinese Room has taken all of <em>Bloodlines</em>‘ bad bits – chiefly janky combat and performance woes – and somehow magnified them.<em> Bloodlines 2</em> is neither a satisfying sequel nor a strong enough RPG experience to make the splash that the franchise sorely needs. If you’re a long-time <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> fan, you might just find enough to enjoy <em>Bloodlines 2</em>. I myself loved meeting its characters and lurking in the more hand-crafted sections of Seattle. But if you were hoping for a game that comes close to recapturing the magic of Troika’s classic, you won’t find it here. – Lauren Bergin</p></blockquote>

              <p>I’ve been using HP laptops for years now, and one reason I haven’t looked elsewhere during upgrades is that I enjoy the balance these offer between performance, reliability, and ease of use. The EliteBook lineup is especially a great option for work professionals, students, and casual users looking for a no-nonsense machine that doesn’t give up on you when things get challenging.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4506/">On a normal day, you can expect to pay a premium for these, but right now, the HP EliteBook 6 G1i is available for $1,119 on Amazon</a>. That’s a massive 63% off, but it’s a limited-time offer. Snag it before the price goes back to an unapproachable $3,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4506/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Visuals, Comfortable Keyboard</h2>
<p>The overall design is quite minimal, and the device itself is easy to carry around. You’re getting a 16-inch FHD+ anti-glare display that makes both streaming and browsing easy on the eyes. Expect lifelike, vibrant visuals in all lighting conditions. And since it actively reduces blue light, you won’t be left with tired eyes and blurred vision after a long day of work. The full-size keyboard is also quite comfortable to work on, and is even spill-resistant. A few accidental splashes won’t really hurt.</p>
<p>This model runs on a 12-core Intel Core Ultra 7 255U processor that’s built to keep up with even those busiest, most chaotic days. Speeds hit up to 5.2 GHz with Turbo Boost, making it great for enterprise users. The processor is paired with a massive 32GB of DDR5 RAM for better multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe SSD that ensures fast boot times and offers plenty of space for all your data. Whether you’re looking to store tons of media files, your favorite movies, or resource-heavy applications, it’s all possible.</p>



<p>For video calls, there’s a 5MP IR camera that makes you look your best, and Poly Studio tuned speakers with AI noise reduction to reduce background distractions. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections, alongside a whole bunch of useful ports like two Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI 2.1, RJ-45 Ethernet, and two USB-A ports. The system runs on Windows 11 Pro, which means you will have instant access to a suite of productivity and security features built right in.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this HP EliteBook. We highly recommend it for anyone looking to upgrade their everyday machine without going over budget.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/horizon-movie-date-sony-tencent-lawsuit-last-us-2000636587</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-big-legal-feud-over-a-horizon-zero-dawn-rip-off-gets-even-messier.1327816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony’s <em>Horizon</em> legal battle against Tencent could get very messy, very quickly if a court doesn’t grant it an injunction. Also, a former <em>Call of Duty</em> director is worried about the franchise’s future under Microsoft. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Have you been watching the latest season of <em>Slow Horses</em> on Apple TV? The British spy thriller is by far one of the best shows on streaming and I can’t believe I never see anyone talking about it. It’s what I wish <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> had been like. I hope Apple keeps giving Gary Oldman absurd bags of cash to fart and scowl in front of the camera.</p>

 <h2>Sony was in talks with Tencent about a potential <em>Last of Us</em> spin-off</h2> <p>That’s the latest revelation from <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">an ongoing court battle</a> between the two companies over IP theft, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-the-last-of-us-game-sony-horizon-rejected/"><em>The Game Post</em> reports</a>. Why didn’t it come to pass? Apparently Tencent was just using the possibility to lure Sony into meetings so it could continually pitch the PS5 maker on <em>Light of Motiram</em>, aka “Project Z,” the <em>Horizon</em>-inspired game&nbsp;that’s at the center of the lawsuit instead.</p>

 <p>“I recall [a] slide [that] featured a female character with costume design resembling <em>Horizon</em>’s mix of tribal clothing and metal armor, and a robot/animal hybrid resembling a <em>Horizon</em> robotic animal,” Olivier Courtemanche, head of mobile for PlayStation, said in court filings. “Now that I have reviewed the promotional materials released for <em>Light of Motiram</em>, I believe that these images contained assets from the <em>Light of Motiram</em> game. I was confused by the slide given that we had rejected a potential <em>Horizon</em> collaboration and thought we were there to discuss&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, among other opportunities.”</p>

 <h2>The <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> movie is planned for 2027</h2> <p>According to the <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/">latest lawsuit filings</a>, the movie has a script and is in search of a director, with hopes of filming next year. “We are in development for a film based on <em>Horizon</em> in partnership with Columbia Pictures,” PlayStation entertainment production head Asad Qizilbash said in a filing. “We already have a working script and are actively searching for a director, with the goal of shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027. The live-action film follows the recent collaborations between Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions on the 2022 film <em>Uncharted</em> and the 2023 film <em>Gran Turismo</em>.”</p>

 <h2>Sony wants a preliminary injunction to halt Tencent’s <em>Light of Motiram</em> development efforts</h2> <p>Okay, so why is Sony telling a court about the <em>Horizon</em> movie? Because it would seemingly come out the same year as <em>Light of Motiram</em>, which is also scheduled to launch in 2027. Sony <a href="https://gamesfray.com/breaking-sony-asks-judge-corley-for-preliminary-injunction-against-tencents-upcoming-light-of-motiram-in-november-or-december/">wants a judge</a> to stop the Chinese conglomerate from moving ahead with this alleged <em>Horizon</em> rip-off even before the court case is settled.</p>

 <p data-cy="paragraph">“The copying was so egregious that numerous journalists and <em>Horizon</em> fans called <em>Light of Motiram</em> ‘a major <em>Horizon</em> rip off,’ ‘an obvious knock off,’ a ‘copycat’ with a main character that ‘resembles Aloy to a tee,’ and ‘extremely similar to <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>‘,” Sony wrote in recent filings, <em><a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post</a></em> reports.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The great irony of this case? It’s being overseen by Judge Corley, the same judge who ruled in Microsoft’s favor back in 2023 during the infamous <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-call-duty-deal-ftc-1850581517">FTC trial over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, which Sony desperately sought to prevent.</p>

 <h2 data-cy="paragraph">A former<em> Call of Duty</em> director is worried about the franchise under Microsoft</h2> <p>Glen Schofield was previously creative director at Sledgehammer Games. He says<em> Call of Duty</em> was better when he was there and he’s not sure Microsoft will make it any better.</p> <p>“I worry about it immensely, I really do,” he <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-call-of-duty-director-says-hes-immensely-worried-about-the-future-of-the-series-under-xbox/">told <em>VGC</em></a> in a recent interview. “Because what’s happening <em>to Gears of War</em>, where’s <em>Halo</em>…you know what I mean? And you look at EA, you look at these big companies, and I’m like where’s the <em>Strike</em> games? Where’s this game? And there’s so many that just fall by the wayside.”</p> <p>“Unfortunately, once you’re assimilated by one of these companies, I think you take on some of their traits,” he added. “The other thing is, I don’t know, but I would imagine that the <em>Call of Duty</em> bonus system is out, and now you have theirs, and people are going to go ‘that isn’t that.'”</p> <h2 data-cy="paragraph"><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s latest major balancing patch did not arrive this week as planned</h2> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Quick update that our Day 30 Update, which includes balance adjustments, performance and stability improvements, and some new quality-of-life features, will be hitting early next week!” the developers <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1978859303982485815">announced on Thursday</a>, when the loot shooter gets its usual weekly update.

              <p>We all have our own sets of small inconveniences that make us irrationally angry. Mine is spotty internet, especially when its my own home. Occasionally when I’m in the bathroom, my router will just decide all by itself to cut its range in half, and then I’m left there caught in loop or refreshing before I give up and resort to reading the back of a shampoo bottle like it’s the dark ages. Stop this from happening in your home. Upgrade to a Wi-Fi mesh network to achieve total coverage around every corner. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4837/">Amazon has the TP-Link Deco S4 mesh Wi-Fi system on sale right now.
