              <p>What would <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> be like if your fights with people and creatures played out like matches in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>? That’s the thought experiment at the center of <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-streamer-blurbs-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-voice-mod-1851443327">streamer Blurbs</a>‘ latest mod for the Rockstar open-world game. There’s lots of punching, lots of blood, and some downright nuts fatalities.</p> <p>Blurbs has transformed mod-making into a communal activity by having fans contribute ideas and constructing and testing them in real time as viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmhOVmdlUEJCc3RCVDZkLUhBTF9IMkI0MWhEZ3xBQ3Jtc0trVmQ1WjdyS3JDZjJ3VFBoVXh0Y2VUZ09OYWdKY2tBRUhzTS1aRVMzcUJOUGhHZFRPNWRjUXB5a0pHTFNDTDdBQWYzWTdSc2I2ekxIT3p1YmJEYkJKLVdrRFkxcG1wVUptVURnQmVuMjRrNUdSTVRDYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fblurbs">watch on Twitch</a>.&nbsp; Last time it was a <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> mod that shows you <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070">the dying memories</a> of all the NPCs you murder. Now, for <em>Red Dead Mortal Kombat</em>, he starts with a basic mechanic where any time you punch someone, the camera flips to a side-by-side view like a fighting game and builds from there.</p>

  <p>Blurbs even went ahead and added rudimentary animations, sound effects, and cheat codes that need to be entered for fatalities. In one, Arthur Morgan lets out a tuberculosis-filled cough that makes the opponent explode in a geyser of blood. In another, the loser is pushed out in front of a runaway train that obliterates them.</p>

 <p>But the mod doesn’t just allow Arthur to fight people. In the video above showing off the mod, Blurbs also has Arthur go head-to-head with an alligator, a deer, and a grizzly bear. That last one does not go well for him.</p> <p>He’s currently taking requests for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> mods.&nbsp;“My whole mission is overproducing really dumb ideas that no one else would ever think to make,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On October 15, the devs behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> announced that the game’s most popular mode, Conquest, would be tweaked in a big way that would potentially lead to shorter matches. This change was nearly universally hated by the online <em>Battlefield</em> community, and now, just 48 hours later, EA is reversing course as it continues to promise tweaks and fixes for the recently released online FPS.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042"><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched last week to massive sales and high player numbers</a>, making it already one of the most successful entries in the long-running milsim series. But, as with any popular online video game these days, a lot of players online have spent nearly every day since launch offering feedback, complaining, or pointing out problems that need to be fixed. And EA is working on a lot of this, with fixes incoming for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/">overly bright maps</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-devs-are-trying-to-find-the-balance-between-zoomers-and-battledads-following-movement-nerfs-were-looking-at-adjustments-for-sure-to-find-a-good-in-between/">tweaks to movement</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-ghost-bullets-update-hotfix-network-bloom-2000635677">and more</a>. But among these many recent changes, one caught players on Reddit and social media off guard. For some reason, EA and Battlefield Studios lowered the ticket count for all levels when playing <em>BF6</em>‘s flagship mode, Conquest. And oh boy, were people mad about this change.</p>

 <p>For those not familiar with Conquest in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>BF6</em></a>, the mode is all about capturing various points on large maps and holding them. The more you hold, the slower your ticket count ticks down. And any time a player dies and respawns, a ticket is also removed from that team. The side that hits 0 first loses. Before October 15, every map in <em>BF6</em> featured 1000 tickets for both sides. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">But then that was tweaked</a>, with different, lower starting ticket values depending on which map you were playing. EA claimed this was because battles were going on too long and timing out, so the idea was that lower ticket counts would lead to more matches ending because a team hit 0 and not because the timer ran out.</p>

 <p>This tweak angered many online as it seemed like something nobody was asking for. Likewise, many players, myself included, have played for many days now and have never seen a match end due to the timer running out. Other players were also mad because for them, <em>Battlefield’s</em> Conquest mode has always been about long matches that go back and forth for upwards of 20 minutes. As many pointed out online in thousands of messages and posts, if you want shorter matches, there are plenty of modes in <em>BF6</em> that offer that experience. Lowering the ticket count ultimately felt like a solution for a problem that didn’t exist, and EA seemingly agrees because it’s already reversed course on the controversial change.</p>

 <p>On October 17, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944">the official <em>Battlefield</em> social media account on Twitter posted</a> that the devs had “heard your feedback” and the studio was reverting the change.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45 minute timed rounds.</p> <p>Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm this…</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We’ve heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45-minute timed rounds,” posted the official account. “Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm, this change may lead to longer match durations. We’ll continue monitoring player feedback and gameplay data to ensure the pacing and overall flow of matches feel right.”</p>

 <p>It’s very odd to me that EA seems so concerned about long matches in Conquest, as that’s always been how the mode works, something other players pointed out in the comments below. I think the best way to solve this problem is to just add a “Fast Conquest” mode that has fewer tickets and is all about keeping matches short. Players who really prefer that version of Conquest can go enjoy it, and everyone else can grind away in 40-minute matches that go back and forth.</p> <p>In fact, I’d love to see EA do some official playlists that feature 2000-ticket matches, as sometimes I just want to spend an hour fighting in Operation Firestorm, you know? At least for now, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s most iconic mode is back to normal, and just in time for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">some big XP changes that should make it easier to unlock new gear</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-holding-its-own-against-a-top-pc-gaming-handheld-feels-like-a-small-miracle.1328167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the last couple of days I’ve seen some people using the Switch 2 <a href="https://x.com/Omnipotentgam0r/status/1978596002836734372">as a cudgel</a> with which to knock down <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">the new ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. And admittedly, comparisons of games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running on both certainly don’t look nearly as stark as the price difference between the two handhelds. However, I don’t see that as a loss for the new premium PC gaming handheld so much as a win for Nintendo’s latest console.</p> <p>I’ve been going back and replaying a fair bit of CD Projekt Red’s 2020 open-world RPG on both machines and frequently find myself straining to feel a significant difference. I run through the streets of the <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion’s Dog Town on the Xbox Ally X using AMD’s recommended settings and the in-game graphics on high while in the performance power mode. I get 40-50fps, the lighting looks decent, and the textures are just detailed and clean enough to not draw my eye, letting me stay immersed in the world and action.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636661"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636661"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Ally X (left) and Switch 2 (right)</figcaption></figure> <p>Then I move over to Switch 2 thanks to the (occasionally finnicky) cloudsave syncing feature. While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will run around 40fps in performance mode on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld, I don’t find the extra smoothness that worth it. Instead, I prefer the extra layer of clarity and visual vibrancy from the quality graphics mode. The action is still smooth. The world feels much the same. Pretty soon I can barely remember what looked different with the game running on the Xbox Ally X, let alone worry about going back to the more powerful hardware.</p>

 <p>I’ve spent more than a few minutes scrutinizing a handful of screenshots of the game running on both devices and man, it takes some effort to start spotting the differences.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000636659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636659"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636659">CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000636660" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636660"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636660">CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Can you tell which is which? Stare long enough and you’ll start to see some bits of the second image that look a little less distinct, especially the farther you go into the background. The shadows and lighting aren’t as smoothly mixed in the second one either. After a few moments of intently searching it for imperfection, you might, like me, come away thinking it just looks a bit more&nbsp;<em>brittle</em> overall. The second image is indeed from the Switch 2 running the game in handheld mode. Does it look $550 worse? Not even close.</p>

 <p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> also seems to hold up pretty well in certain comparisons. There’s less detail. The framerate is worse. But it’s not necessarily <em>that</em> much less detail, or<em> that</em> much worse of a framerate.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">More comparisons of ROG Ally X vs Switch 2,for Star Wars Outlaws and Hogwarts legacy. Switch 2 again for the most part obliterating the ROG in image fidelity.<br>Switch 2 is also rumored to be getting an upgrade for its DLSS tech soon,so it’ll get even better<a href="https://t.co/cL3iRC5hOb">https://t.co/cL3iRC5hOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/PXIfyeidOb">https://t.co/PXIfyeidOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/mnGEstkn5A">pic.twitter.com/mnGEstkn5A</a></p> <p>— 💫Sonicpulsar💫 (@sonicpulsar) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicpulsar/status/1978717824341119479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s weird to see Nintendo hardware holding its own rather than fighting for its life against more powerful alternatives. For now, at least, the Switch 2 feels more than just “good enough.”</p>

 <p>Now comparing the Switch 2 to the Xbox Ally X isn’t completely apples-to-apples. The Asus-made, Xbox-branded handheld has a slightly smaller screen, it runs Windows, and it plays tons more games that weren’t painstakingly optimized for it like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was for the Switch 2. The fact that a five-year-old game doesn’t look lightyears better on the one doesn’t completely disqualify it.</p>

 <p>The new Ally X also affords a prospective user all sorts of options and perks that the Switch 2 doesn’t, not least of all a pair of ergonomic grips and thumbsticks that actually feel great to hold and use right out of the box. There are also plenty of moments when it does look distinctly superior, in addition to having access to a vast library of PC games that might never come to Nintendo’s platform.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636663" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636663"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636663"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Xbox Ally X.</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000636662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636662"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Switch 2 (handheld performance mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>But the match-up does suggest a promising future for the Switch 2. We’ll have to see how the the finished port of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> runs on it when it arrives early next year, but what I tested back in August felt similarly impressive. <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> might also shape up nicely. And given its success with<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I’m expecting the recently leaked port of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 to be impressive as well.</p> <p>Look, this is only the first year of the Switch 2’s life. We could be in a situation come 2027 where most new blockbusters still have to skip Nintendo’s platform, or rely on ports that are so compromised they can’t be confidently recommended to anyone but the most desperate Switch 2 owner with nowhere else to play.</p> <p>That’s certainly how it felt with games like<em> The Witcher 3</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds</em> on the original Switch. Those were fascinating experiments that reminded you how limited and dated the Switch hardware ultimately still was, at least for anyone working with it who wasn’t Nintendo. I hope we get a few good years on the Switch 2 before it arrives at a similar fate.</p>
