If 1TB isn’t enough for you, the 2TB SSD dropped 32% from $177 to just $120 — saving $57. Still not enough? Alright, alright. Well you can boost your storage space up to 4TB. This highest capacity model of the Samsung 990 EVO Plus is discounted 27% from $328 to only $240. That’s a savings of $88. Game file sizes just continue going up and up so you can set yourself up for a long while with four full terabytes.</p>

<p>Now you should note that this SSD does not include a heatsink built-in. You know, the tiny metal casing that’s designed to dissipate heat from the unit.

              <p>If you haven’t ever used a curved monitor, it may feel like it’s just a gimmick. As an curved display gamer myself, I can assure you it’s so much more. When sitting at the right angle and distance, the curvature really sucks you in. Prices have been coming down over the pas few years too so they’re really not too much to add to your gaming desk. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3840/">The Alienware 34 curved gaming monitor right now is 20% off too. It’s listed on Amazon at $400, but with the discount, it comes down to just $320.</a> That’s an extra $80 you get to keep in your bank account.</p>

<h2>Designed for Gamers</h2>
<p>The Alienware monitor measures in at a massive 34 inches. It’s ultra-wide and comes in at a curvature of 1500R. This better reflects the way we perceive our surroundings through our eyes. Our environment isn’t just in front of us, it’s all around us. As overused as the term has becomes, a curved display like this one really does allow your gaming to feel more immersive.</p>
<p>The display is working with a QHD resolution of 1440p and maximum refresh rate of 180 Hz. You can expect smooth and clear responsive gameplay with a low response time of 1ms. AMD FreeSync Premium and VESA Adaptive Sync help improve performance and eliminate screen tearing while you game.</p>
<p>I think we all know at this point staring at a bright screen for hours on end isn’t exactly&nbsp;<em>good</em> for you. If you like to marathon gaming session, the Alienware curved display comes with hardware-based tools in its dedicated console to limit blue light. This can help reduce eyestrain during those long hours of play or work while still preserving a wide depth of color.</p>



<p>Breaking down the various ports and slots, along the read you’ll find two HDMI ports along with one DisplayPort. This will let you connect multiple sources to your Alienware monitor at once. You can use it primarily for your gaming PC but also choose to hook up a console like your Nintendo Switch 2. Just hop between input instead of having to disconnect and rearrange anything on your desk. The display also has two USB-A ports. The display makes cable management simple in its stand design.</p>
<p>Speaking of the stand, it’s fully adjustable. Raise and lower it or tilt the screen toward you with ease. The footprint base is small to save space on your desk despite the massive size of the screen itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3840/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Alienware 34 curved gaming monitor for just $320.</a></p>

              <p>A faster router means faster online gaming — that’s simple. But what would you call the effect that <strong>the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router</strong> will have on your gaming when it opens up the data floodgates with three bands delivering 19Gbps and the Wi-Fi 7 top speed of 320MHz, all driven by a quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM for ultimate capacity and strength of connections? You’ll have to come up with your own superlatives after you <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3839/">head to Amazon and grab this elite-level gaming router for just $370 — a limited-time 38% price drop from its regular $600.</a></p>
<p>What do all of those features translate to? Wi-Fi 7 is nearly 5x faster than even Wi-Fi 6E, and the main 6Hz band has double the width of a 5Hz band and thus allows double the speed — think of the speeds you can reach on an 8-lane highway as opposed to a 4-lane road. (Although we would never, ever advocate that you try something so illegal.) And the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router is compatible with EasyMesh routers and range extenders, so its incredible speed and capacity are equally accessible throughout your home.</p>

<h2>Ultimate Lag Killer</h2>
<p>Latency, for the uninitiated, is what drags your online speed into the gutter, causing your game to lag and stutter and tear. Anyone who’s ever been in the middle of a FPS or other intense action game where speed and reaction time are critical and suddenly been frozen just long enough to get killed off is all too familiar with latency. The TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router is one of the best lag eradicators around, with 4x lower latency than even a fast Wi-Fi 6/6E router.</p>
<p>As if that’s not enough to ensure a blistering-fast, nearly flawless connection for games, the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router can automatically detect and optimize gaming streams and give them a boost with QoS (Quality of Service). There is also a dedicated Gaming Port at the rear of the router to give you the option of hardwiring for absolute max performance, and an accelerated search for game servers to find the shortest, fastest path.</p>



<h2>Future-Proofed</h2>
<p>There’s always a natural reluctance to go big on the “latest and greatest” tech device, because they evolve at such speed that there will be a new “latest and greatest” before you know it. But the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router has included two 10Gbps WAN ports for that faster-than-fiber connection. There’s nothing on the horizon that’s going to outgun the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router for a long time.</p>
<p>If you’re still slugging it out with a slow router and practically crushing your controller with your bare hands out of frustration when your game freezes or glitches right in the middle of an intense battle, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3839/">this Amazon limited-time deal dropping the price of the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router to just $370 is tailor-made for you.</a> Years of the fastest possible no-lag gaming connection is just a click away.</p>
