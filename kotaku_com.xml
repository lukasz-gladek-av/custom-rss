              <p>Not a fan of bulky, tower desktops but still want something powerful enough to handle everyday work and play with ease? The Acemagician M1 mini PC does all that and more, and you can now grab it without paying the full price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4898/">The retailer has slashed 35% off this compact powerhouse, bringing the price down to just $299</a>. That’s a solid deal for a model this packed, but it won’t be around for long. Get your orders in before the price shoots back up, or the stock ends for good.</p>

<h2>No-Fuss Build, But No Compromises on Performance</h2>
<p>The size is small, but don’t let it fool you. You’re getting an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with speeds up to 4.7GHz. It features Hyper-Threading technology, so using creative, resource-intensive applications and running multiple programs at once won’t be an issue. Expect around 8–11% better CPU performance and up to 50% improved GPU performance compared to the previous-gen Ryzen 7 5800H.</p>
<p>For memory, there’s a nice 16GB of DDR5 RAM. It’s enough to keep the PC running smoothly during most everyday tasks, but you also have the option to expand it up to 64GB if your needs grow. Storage comes in the form of a 512GB PCIe SSD, offering ultra-fast load times and sufficient capacity for all your essentials. Keeping all your favorite movies and important documents in a single place won’t ever be a problem. Need more room? Add a 2.5-inch SSD and expand storage up to 4TB.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’ve got five USB 3.2 ports, plus a USB-C Gen 2 port that supports 10Gbps transfer speeds, PD charging, and 4K display output via DP1.4. There’s also a 2.5G RJ45 Ethernet port for blazing fast wired connections, alongside Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for when you want to keep things wireless. In total, you can add up to three 4K displays simultaneously using the HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C outputs. Graphics are handled by AMD Radeon 680M Graphics, so you can expect exceptional 4K visuals across all screens, whether you’re working or playing a game.</p>
<p>In short, this is an excellent option for anyone looking for solid power in a compact build. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4898/">You’re getting a powerful processor paired with impressive RAM and storage</a>. Even better, your purchase will come with a 12-month assurance for some extra peace of mind. Grab it for less while the offer is live.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-friends-advent-calendar-is-the-only-one-left-now-selling-42-off-on-amazon-2000637620</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO released its 2025 Advent calendars just a few weeks ago, and they’re already vanishing from Amazon’s shelves at an alarming rate. The<strong> Lego City calendar is completely sold out</strong>, <strong>Minecraft has disappeared</strong>&nbsp;and most other themes have either limited stock or inflated prices. Surprisingly, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/">Lego Friends Advent Calendar remains available and has dropped to an all-time low of $20, down from its original $34 price</a>. For parents trying to stretch holiday budgets while keeping the magic alive through December, this is one of those deals that won’t last long once word gets out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Advent calendars solve a specific parenting challenge every December: Kids need something to channel their excitement during those long weeks leading up to Christmas, and a daily surprise keeps them engaged without the sugar overload of chocolate-filled alternatives. This<strong>&nbsp;set delivers 237 pieces spread across 24 doors, giving children aged six and up</strong> a new building project each morning.</p>
<h2>What’s Different This Year About The Calendar?</h2>
<p>LEGO recently rebranded the Friends theme with greater emphasis on varied storytelling and everyday situations that children are more likely to connect with. This 2025 calendar shows that transition with a holiday sleepover theme that seems more down to earth than releases from earlier years. The package <strong>contains five mini-dolls: Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo</strong>&nbsp;who come with sleeping mats that complete a whole indoor campout setup. The choice of characters reflects varied personality types and interests so that children may enter the narrative on several different levels.</p>



<p>The animal companions add another layer of play value: <strong>Two dogs, a guinea pig, a gecko, and a cat</strong> come with their own accessories like food stations, water dispensers, scratching posts and pet beds. Each animal’s accessories are scaled to match the mini-doll world so kids can actually integrate them into ongoing play scenarios beyond December.</p>



<p>The day-by-day builds range from tiny accessories in early December to larger interactive pieces as we build up to Christmas. Early dates may open with wrapped gift boxes or a table lamp, while later dates open up the fireplace with flame elements, a working sled with space for a minidoll, and a life-sized LEGO reindeer figure. The karaoke machine features a microphone piece that is compatible with a minidoll’s hand, and the hot chocolate stand includes mugs proportionate to the figures.</p>
<p>The scene-building potential extends well past December 25th. The sofa seats two minidolls comfortably, the Christmas tree comes with decorative elements that can be rearranged, and the hobbyhorse has a spring mechanism built into its base. These aren’t single-use holiday decorations. They <strong>become permanent additions to any existing LEGO Friends collection, compatible with playsets like the Heartlake City buildings</strong> and vehicles sold separately.</p>
<p>At $20, this calendar is cheaper than several single LEGO Friends expansion packs while offering more variety. The retail price of $34 already offered good value compared to purchasing single blind bags or accessory packs over the course of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  The director says ‘nearly half’ of the merch bearing his autograph on the internet is fake
                </p><div>
              
              <p><span>Selling autographed merchandise has become so lucrative that celebrities and athletes are told </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-very-important-reason-celebrities-wont-use-blue-pens-for-autographs_uk_658059cee4b08e9b410b51f7"><span>not to sign anything with blue ink</span></a><span> because it’s believed that this makes their John Hancock easier to scan and forge. It’s true that if you don’t actually see someone sign something in front of you, it’s pretty difficult to verify if a signature is legitimate, so it’s good to be cautious when buying signed merchandise from a third party. Luckily some public figures, like </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>director Yoko Taro, are willing to call out phonies peddling fake autographs for profit.</span></p>

 <p><span>A </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fan on X sent Taro a screenshot of a now-deleted auction of an autographed </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>soundtrack CD that the director had seemingly signed. At a glance, you wouldn’t know that it was forged. It even has a little sketch of Emil, a character from the </span><i><span>Nier</span></i><span> series whose mask Taro wears during public appearances and that he often includes in his signatures. However, Taro himself replied that “nearly half” of the items for sale that are ostensibly bearing his signature are forged, including the one the fan had originally sent. After Taro put it on blast, the original auction listing was taken down.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine. I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.<br>（◎血◎） <a href="https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo">https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1980304441493582021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Taro says he includes “small, unknown features” in his signature to identify forgeries. A fan posted an image of Taro’s real signature as seen at a Square Enix event, and the differences are subtle but noticeable upon comparison. The R is longer, and the Y is kind of squiggly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">heres a real signature to compare everyone from the square enix cafe <a href="https://t.co/Heahqg06bI">pic.twitter.com/Heahqg06bI</a></p> <p>— la reina (rena) 🌽🐓🐟💀🐅😊 (@ashykitten_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashykitten_/status/1980400732768817636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Well, that’s another scammer’s day ruined, at least. Hopefully, now that </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fans have been made aware of this, they won’t buy any fake Yoko Taro autographs. It’s also possible that forgeries get better now that those looking to make a quick buck know what to look for. So be careful out there, y’all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Normally, this is where I’d talk about what Taro is working on right now, but we don’t really know, actually. I just finished a replay of </span><i><span>Nier: Automata, </span></i><span>and as much as I know people want more of those games, I’m pretty content with where it all ended. Hopefully Square Enix is considering giving </span><i><span>Nier Reincarnation </span></i><span>the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-demo-hands-on-impressions-jrpg-2000622687"><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>treatment</span></a><span> to bring it to consoles, given that the gacha game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><span>no longer playable</span></a><span> but contains a lot of major story revelations. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever dreamed of owning a piece of the Star Wars universe without needing a hangar bay or hyperdrive fuel, this might be your moment: The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary edition) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has just dropped to an all-time low of $67 on Amazon, down from its usual $84 price tag</a>. For fans who’ve spent decades watching Han Solo’s legendary <em>“hunk of junk”</em> outrun Imperial Star Destroyers, this mid-scale collectible brings that iconic vessel right into your living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another Lego set that’s going to end up collecting dust in a closet: The <strong>921-piece build provides adult fans with something more</strong>: a moment to quit staring at a screen and immerse themselves in a trance-like building experience that requires several intense hours to complete. The set depicts the Millennium Falcon as it was seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with all of the details that made it so iconic in its debut.</p>
<h2>Unique LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is part of LEGO’s starship collection which is a special line of <strong>mid-scale models designed exclusively for display purposes rather than play</strong>. The completed model stands 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide so it’s massive enough to draw attention on a bookshelf or desk without dominating your available space. The stand that comes with it does more than simply support the ship upright. It’s designed to angle the Falcon dynamically so that it looks as if it’s banked hard on a turn while it makes a daring escape.</p>



<p>The build process itself rewards patience and attention to detail. With 921 pieces, <strong>you’re looking at roughly 4-6 hours of construction time</strong> depending on your experience level. Each section reveals new layers of complexity as you work from the interior framework outward to the iconic hull plating. The cockpit section alone requires careful placement of transparent pieces to recreate those viewport windows, while the external paneling uses clever techniques to achieve the ship’s famously asymmetrical profile. The rotating satellite dish connects through a simple but satisfying mechanism that lets you adjust its position after completion.</p>
<p>This price drop represents genuine value for collectors: The set typically hovers around $84, and previous sales rarely dipped below $75. At $67, you’re getting a premium adult-focused building experience for roughly the cost of a standard mid-range LEGO set. The <strong>4.9-star rating across more than 1,800 reviews</strong> speaks to consistent quality.</p>

              <p>If you’re going to play games on your desktop PC, any old monitor won’t do. Sure, it would be nice to have a massive OLED ultra-wide curved display, but that’s not really necessary either. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4896/">Samsung has an excellent low budget gaming monitor that’s usually in the couple hundred dollar range, but happens to be on sale right now for as much as 45% off.</a> We’re in a bit of a deals drought between the Amazon Prime Big Deals Days and next month’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, so this is a pretty darn good savings for this time of year.</p>

That discount knocks off an even $100, taking the price down from $280 to just $180.</p>

That might be because you’re screen is making your suffer through some bad input lag.</p>
<p>AMD Radeon FreeSync support helps keep your GPU and monitor’s refresh rate synchronized. This means less change of screen tearing and a better experience overall both when gaming or when watching a show or movie. You can connect to the monitor over your chose of DisplayPort or HDMI.</p>



<p>Boost the black levels to see all the hidden details lurking in the shadows with the Black Equalizer. This can give you can edge for levels where the lights are out or to make spooky scary games a little less spooky scary.</p>

Eye Saver Mode reduces the monitor’s blue light levels which can help relax your eyes. making those longer sessions a bit more comfortable. The stand is tilt adjustable as well so you can have the screen perfectly positioned for your optimal viewing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A video showing a fan assaulting <a href="https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2000637226&amp;action=edit">cosplay livestreamer Emily “Emiru” Schunk at TwitchCon 2025</a> made every online content creator’s worst nightmare go viral. It’s created a new crisis of confidence in Twitch as streamers worry about how seriously the Amazon-owned platform is taking their safety and security. Comments from Twitch’s CEO did little to dispel those concerns.</p> <p>“The safety of our creators is our top priority,” Dan Clancy told Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602">in an interview</a> the day after the incident took place. “The challenge we face is a challenge in today’s society. It’s not limited to Twitch, it extends throughout our society.”</p>

 <p>The executive waxed philosophical about community moderation before talking specifically about what happened with Emiru.&nbsp;“I do think that when you’re livestreaming, in many ways, since you control your community and you can ban people, you can make it so that those people that you don’t want engaging with you and participating with you, aren’t there.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I asked Twitch CEO Dan Clancy about <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emiru</a> getting assaulted at Twitchcon and whether creators can trust the platform to keep them safe. Full interview will be out on my YouTube channel/podcast feed on Wednesday <a href="https://t.co/wTH13vhjBH">pic.twitter.com/wTH13vhjBH</a></p> <p>— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Now, what happened yesterday, obviously, was something that we care deeply about securing this environment. We’re looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi. She’s a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there’s always more work to be done, because that’s the world we live in now.</p></blockquote> <p>But the actions of “leaders in the industry” is not how Emiru has been describing Twitch’s response to the assault at its most recent event. In a video published the same day as the Clancy interview took place, she accused Twitch of lying about its response, claiming the platform’s initial desire was to just ban the alleged suspect for 30 days instead of for life. Emiru also claimed that no one from Twitch security immediately came to her aid or apprehended the suspect to escort him from the show.</p>

 <p>“Like if you watch the clip, the security guard who pushes the guy away is my security,” Emiru said. “The woman who pulls me to the back, my manager. If you’re a small streamer and you don’t have those resources or someone in your line’s not filming, what the fuck do you do? No one would have known.”</p> <p>The incident has led to renewed warnings about Twitch personalities attending in-person events and even, in some cases, calls for new ownership of Twitch.</p>
