I don’t mean in terms of the games it’s showing, I’m talking about the actual showmanship. Keighley’s stage show has been pretty paint-by-numbers without a lot of good bits and showmanship. That changed when he read a snarky letter from someone who wanted to show off a new game. As he recited the monologue, rough stick drawings appeared on the stage’s screen, eventually adorning the stage with <em>Deadpool</em> logos and crude drawings. The thought of a new game starring the Merc with a Mouth got my attention...until it was revealed to be a VR game.</p><p>Folks, I’m in Los Angeles right now for the Summer Game Fest event, and after spending so much less time in cars while living in New York City, I’ve gained a newfound disdain for things that give me motion sickness. I can’t get anywhere without becoming nauseous in the backseat of an Uber. This has plagued me every time I have tried a VR game over the past decade, and that means these games are a non-starter for me. So I guess y’all have fun with <em>Deadpool VR</em>. Maybe I’ll watch a Let’s Play. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One cool thing is that Deadpool is voiced by <em>How I Met Your Mother </em>star Neil Patrick Harris this time around.

Maybe he was too expensive. </p><p><em>Deadpool VR </em>is coming to Meta Quest 3/3S later this year and is an exclusive for the headset at the moment. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it come to PlayStation VR down the line, though.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
