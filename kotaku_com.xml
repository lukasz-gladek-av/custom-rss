              <p>It’s been a fittingly chaotic launch week for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The cacophony of player feedback ranges from praise for the best new entry in the loot shooter series since <em>Borderlands 2</em> to very loud and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">angry complaints about bugs, crashes, and performance stutters on PC</a>. Even the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions have some weird issues. Gearbox Entertainment now says a second patch to address PC performance is on the way as it also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">investigates problems on console</a>.</p> <p>Not one to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">calmly monitor feedback</a> from atop his 2K Games-funded Ivory Tower, studio CEO Randy Pitchford has been arguing almost nonstop with fans since the game released about whether their gripes about how it runs are legitimate or not. Wit<em>h Borderlands 4</em> sitting at at a mixed rating on Steam with just 65 percent positive reviews, the veteran poster has been handling criticism in classic <em>Borderlands</em> fashion.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Randy is now doing personal tech support for Twitter users and recommending 4x frame gen for a 5080 and telling them to turn off fog which is literally not an option in the game <a href="https://t.co/WzRMiDO8Pt">pic.twitter.com/WzRMiDO8Pt</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Here’s an abridged recap of the post-launch Pitchford timeline:</p> <ul> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650">Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985">Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013">If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">Fun facts: Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">I have personally helped users go from 30FPS to 90FPS+</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">The game is pretty damn optimal</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">Please get a refund from Steam if you aren’t happy with it.</a>”&nbsp;– September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Would you like help tuning with your personal specification?</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Turn down or off the volumetric fog</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968388123534180815">Oops. You are correct: the bottom setting for fog is ‘low’ not “off</a>” – September 17</li> </ul> <p>Reactions to this approach have been mixed. “At what point do the crashouts stop making sense?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ni56df/randy_pitchford_code_your_own_engine_and_show_us/">asked</a> one player. Another claiming to be a game industry veteran who was definitely not Pitchford writing under an alias <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1n4ljjl/in_which_i_a_game_industry_veteran_give_sincere/">applauded</a>:” “Randy Pitchford cares. He manically, catastrophically, awkwardly, SINCERELY cares.” I would simply add that <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">this drama is as much a part of <em>Borderlands</em></a> at this point as the bandit psycho masks, terrible Claptrap puns, and glowing ammo hidden in toilets.</p>

 <h2>A second patch to fix <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC is on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shroud's game crashed on Borderlands 4 and cost them all those legendaries RIP😅 <a href="https://t.co/we3m1onoZp">pic.twitter.com/we3m1onoZp</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1968064528052314348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>To help set the record straight or at least cut through the noise a bit, Gearbox released <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1968451501803651131">an official statement</a> last night clarifying the team’s ongoing priorities as we approach <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s one-week anniversary. Here are the priorities following an emergency update over the weekend to try to improve optimization on PC:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming this Thursday. <strong>This is our top priority. </strong></li> <li>A Field of View [FOV] slider option for consoles is in testing right now and more information is coming very soon on that. Some console players have reported concerns with performance and we’re investigating those with planned updates coming.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The studio also released additional Shift codes for gold keys, including a Break Free Pack, to sweeten the deal with more bonus loot. At least one research firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false">has suggested</a> <em>Borderlands 4</em> has already sold over 2 million copies in its first couple of&nbsp; days. Official player stats from Gearbox indicate 764,733,586 total items looted and 4,563,416 deaths by grenade as well as a quarter of all attempted boss fights being failed. I’m sure at least some of them will blame it on not being able to play <em>Borderlands 4</em> at 120fps in 4K.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-mario-kart-preview-shadow-2000620065"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>, the latest entry in the blue blur’s kart racing spin-off series, has a core conceit that Sonic, his friends, and his enemies are racing through portals to other tracks, and they might not always be in their own universe when they reach the other side. I’ve been enjoying my time with </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>a whole lot, but I’ve only been playing as my favorite boy, Shadow the Hedgehog, and even after I unlock crossover characters like Hatsune Miku, SpongeBob SquarePants, and </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s Joker, I still won’t stray far from the hedgehog I showed up for. Though I haven’t gotten to put much time into online play during the review period, I played a fair bit of it during the beta and had a blast with its fast-paced but strategic racing. I just wish </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> wasn’t also the latest example of corporate IP consolidation, when </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>’s signature, stylish flair more than carries it past the finish line.</span></p> <p><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has certainly exacerbated my crossover fatigue, but even though it has become the quintessential example of a video game dumping every IP its owners can afford into one big pot of sludge, my distaste for the act of tossing a bunch of unrelated characters and references into one game definitely predates Epic’s battle royale. I was annoyed when the fighting game </span><i><span>Injustice 2 </span></i><span>incorporated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles while concept art for the warlock Constantine was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/INJUSTICE/comments/kyevbw/official_injustice_2_concept_art_for_constantine/"><span>gathering dust on a NetherRealm Studios server</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale </span></i><span>was packed with playable ads for upcoming games in its line-up, while major players in PlayStation history were nowhere to be seen. That’s really all the influx of crossovers is these days: ads; cynical reminders that the things we like aren’t so divided as they once were. Where once we might occasionally see Freddy and Jason fight or Timmy Turner and Jimmy Neutron trade lives, now we get a lot of cosmetics that are low-effort references to other worlds, all thrown together without rhyme or reason and almost always featuring nods to other IPs that you can also go spend money on.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000626585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626585"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626585">© Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i><span> is stuffed with guest characters and crossover tracks, and it doesn’t escape my notice that almost every crossover here involves either a Sega or Paramount property. Unlike the core </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters, these racers don’t have voice actors to spout any pre-race rival banter or make any sorts of exclamations when they do sick tricks or get pummeled by a competing racer’s rocket-powered boxing glove. In other words, these crossover characters are mostly just props placed in karts or on hoverboards to remind you that there are games or television shows you could be consuming other than the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>game you’re currently playing.</span></p>

 <p><span>The shame of all these efforts to remind people that other games exist is that when you cut through all the distraction, you find that </span><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </span></i><span>is an absolutely delightful and deep kart racer that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-trailer-mario-kart-world-nintendo-sega-rivarlry-2000626017"><span>outpaces some of its contemporaries</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>is at its best when it’s leaning into its own legacy, rather than gesturing at others. Its pre-race rival exchanges when you’re playing single-player modes and are pitted against a skilled, intelligent PC racer have some of the best one-on-one interactions much of its large roster has ever had in the series’ long history. Meanwhile, its race tracks pull from decades of </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>games past, and feel like a grand tour through different eras of the franchise with some banger tunes to accompany them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Part of me got a bit sentimental racing around as Shadow and seeing several homages to him specifically, such as tracks based on Radical Highway, his iconic first level from </span><i><span>Sonic Adventure 2</span></i><span>, and one based on his version of the White Space from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><i><span>Shadow Generations</span></i></a><span>. It’s like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851"><span>Year of Shadow</span></a><span> never ended. Riding my sick, decked-out hoverboard on these stages was an absolute joy, until I saw motherfucking Hatsune Miku or Joker pull up next to me. Thus far, none of </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ announced DLC characters are from </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>games, TV, or movies, and as I see characters like Pac-Man and Steve coming down the pipeline, I’m left wondering where some more niche </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters are, like Infinite from </span><i><span>Sonic Forces </span></i><span>or, to really swing for the fences, someone like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-human-characters-tom-maddy-agent-stone-1851745037"><span>Agent Stone from the live-action movies</span></a><span>. Do you know how cool it would be to have one of the best characters to come out of those movies show up in a multiverse game? There’s already so much fan art of him in the games’ style, Sega. Skip the Ninja Turtles and get Lee Majdoub in the booth.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000626586" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626586"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626586">© Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to spend this entire write-up dunking on the crossover nonsense because when I get past that, </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> is a truly exhilarating, challenging, and complex racer that deserves a lot of credit for its systems. Though it is a bit faster than, and not as weighty as, something like </span><i><span>Mario Kart</span></i><span>, its Gadget mechanic, which lets you customize your vehicles with different perks, is a real game-changer. My go-to kit is one that gives me a Monster Truck item at the start of the race, so I can crush half the racers under a giant wheel, then another perk that gives me a boost every time I collide with an enemy, meaning that no one can knock me off the track and into the abyss; instead, if they try, they just end up slingshotting me forward as I leave them in the dust. Choice is at the heart of </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ racing systems, whether you’re choosing between a kart and a hoverboard or tweaking your gadgets to personalize your playstyle.</span></p> <p><span>Those ideas are what elevate </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>to one of </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>’s best spin-offs in recent memory. The game is best when it’s focusing on being an extremely fun </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racer, rather than a billboard for other games and TV shows. </span></p>
