That hasn’t been DMCA’d. Yet.</p><p><em>Bloodborne</em> has languished for a decade now with no meaningful official upgrades on PS4 Pro, PS5, or PS5 Pro. It never got a remaster or even a PC port. Fans have waiting patiently for a sequel to the FromSoftware action game, but not even a whiff of one has ever materialized. Ex-PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356">recently speculated</a></span> that Sony is waiting until original director Hidetaka Miyazaki is ready to continue the spin-off series, and the timing has just never worked out. </p><p>But then Sony does things like this. Why randomly hit a 60FPS mod  that only works on hacked last-gen consoles with a takedown request? Why wait almost four years to do it? Does this suggest Sony might actually have something <em>Bloodborne</em>-related in the works, like a PS5 upgrade that boosts the resolution and framerate on regular modern consoles? Or was Sony somehow just never aware of the project before and only got around to enforcing its copyright just now?</p><p>A chance meeting  looks both funnier and more ominous now in light of the current circumstances: MacDonald tweeted last year that he had just met Yoshida for the first time. “[I] said to him ‘I make mods for PlayStation games’ and he said ‘oh!’” he wrote. “And I said ‘I made the 60fps mod for bloodborne’ and he laughed so hard. Beautiful to meet him, such a wonderful person.” Did Yoshida narc? Or is this another mystery that will drive <em>Bloodborne </em>fans deeper down their conspiratorial rabbit holes? </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developed by Nixxes Software, which has collaborated on tons of other Sony ports that didn’t have day-one issues, Insomniac Games’ open-world comic book game appears to be giving even players with powerful gaming rigs trouble unless they drastically dial down the settings. </p><p>“After my excitement to swing through New York City, I ran into significant technical problems with <em>Spider-Man 2</em> on my RTX 4090,” one Steam player wrote. “Despite having a high-end GPU and running the latest NVIDIA drivers (566.36), the game frequently crashes with graphics controller errors.”</p><p> Another was similarly flummoxed. “Hold off on buying until they get a couple of stabilization patches out because holy hell,” they wrote. “To say this is ‘rough’ is an understatement. Lighting doesn’t load in some cutscenes, those same scenes run at seconds-per-frame, audio desync issues up the wazoo, freezing, stuttering, and just about every other performance issue I can think of.”</p><figure id="" data-id="b8d2db4a418363e1419ef45261163fab" data-recommend-id="image://b8d2db4a418363e1419ef45261163fab" data-format="png" data-width="1599" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam users review Spider-Man 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lots of players report requesting refunds from Steam until a patch or two can sort out the trouble. Others have spent so much time trying to optimize settings to stop the game from crashing that they’ve exceeded the refund limit. “I can’t even refund this now because I’ve spent more time trying to optimize this game than actually playing it,” one wrote. “Worst birthday gift ever.”</p><p>Of course, not everyone’s having a bad time with Spider-Man 2 on PC. There plenty of players who aren’t reporting any major issues as they take on Kraven The Hunter and Venom. Only about half of the reviews are positive at the moment, however, so that’s potentially a 50/50 chance of whether prospective buyers are in for a good time or not. </p><p>This isn’t the first Sony port to get heavily criticized  at launch. <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> came to PC in even rougher shape. Updates subsequently solved most of the problems, and it currently has a 94 percent rating among recent reviewers. But it raised questions around why Sony would release the game if things were in such poor shape. Then again, we’ve seen lots of big blockbusters struggle day-one on PC as developers perform triage on unique issues isolated to certain PC gaming setups that couldn’t be tested during production. </p><p>We’ll see how long it takes <em>Spider-Man 2</em> to get sorted out. It’s one of 2023's best games and something that no doubt has the potential to look even better on PC than it did when it first came to PS5.  <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
