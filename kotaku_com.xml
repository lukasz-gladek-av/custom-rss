<h2>The perfect controller for hardcore Xbox players</h2>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller contains adjustable-tension thumbsticks. These allow you to adjust the tension to either loose or tight, based on what feels best for you. Shorter hair-trigger locks allow less travel, reducing the time it takes for actions to register. The wraparound rubberized grip covers the back and sides of the controller, providing additional grip during longer gaming sessions.</p>
<p>You can create up to three custom profiles and switch between them with a single button. Button remapping in the Xbox Accessories app lets you place actions wherever it makes sense for your gaming experience and save each profile for future use.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include connecting to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles via Xbox Wireless, Bluetooth, or the included USB-C cable. Once connected to one of these console types, you can pair your controller with their Windows PC, Android smartphone, or iOS device to enable gameplay and/or other compatible services. You can also use the included 3.5mm stereo headset jack to connect a wired headset to the controller instead of using an available headset port on their system.</p>



<p>When you buy the controller, you’ll get all the necessary accessories to get started using the upgraded controls right away. Included with the controller are the USB-C cable, a D-pad, two standard thumbsticks, and a thumbstick adjustment tool used to adjust the tension system of the thumbsticks. Additional optional parts to further customize the controller are also available for purchase.</p>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller combines improved comfort, additional control options, and greater flexibility in how many devices it can connect to, offering users an upgrade. You can expect up to 40 hours of battery life from the controller, reducing the need to recharge it during extended gaming sessions. When taking into account the adjustable hardware, custom profiles, compatibility with multiple devices, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">and the sale price of $110 versus the regular retail price of $150, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller is a great way to enhance your gaming experience while continuing to utilize the same systems you have been using.</a></p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="585">A dependable portable Bluetooth speaker is one of those essentials you don’t realize you need until the moment music is missing. Whether you’re hosting friends in your living room, hanging out in the backyard, spending a day at the beach, or heading off on a weekend camping trip, good sound can completely define the mood. Phone speakers sitting in red cups simply don’t cut it, and that’s where a powerful option like the JBL Boombox 4 earns its place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/">Right now, it’s even more appealing thanks to its first big price drop that brings it down to $450 — an 18% discount and its lowest prices to date.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="734" data-end="777">Big, Powerful Sound That Fills Any Space</h2>
<p data-start="587" data-end="1128">The JBL Boombox 4 is built to make a statement, both visually and sonically. Weighing in at about 13 pounds and stretching nearly 20 inches wide, it’s unapologetically large. That size translates directly into sound performance. This speaker delivers room-filling volume with deep, punchy bass that small portable speakers simply can’t match. From blasting music outdoors to filling a large indoor space at a house party, the JBL&nbsp; Boombox 4 creates an immersive, high-energy atmosphere.</p>
<p data-start="1130" data-end="1626">Despite its size, JBL designed the Boombox 4 with portability in mind. A sturdy integrated handle makes it easy to carry from place to place, so moving the party from indoors to outdoors is effortless. It’s also built to handle the elements. With an IP68 waterproof and dustproof rating, the speaker can survive splashes, rain, sand, and poolside accidents without skipping a beat. Durability like that means you can just sit back and enjoy the music instead of worrying about protecting your gear.</p>


<h2 data-start="1805" data-end="1850">All-Day Listening</h2>
<p data-start="1628" data-end="2130">Battery life is another standout. On a full charge, the JBL Boombox 4 can deliver up to 28 hours of continuous playback. That’s more than enough to last through an all-day event and well into the night. If you need even more time, JBL’s Playtime Boost mode can extend listening by up to an additional six hours, bringing it to a maximum of 34 hours of playtime. There’s also a built-in power bank, allowing you to charge your phone or other devices directly from the speaker—super useful when outlets are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2576" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Bluetooth connectivity keeps things simple, letting you stream music from phones, tablets, laptops, or TVs. With Auracast support, you can even link multiple compatible speakers together for synchronized audio throughout a larger space.</p>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2576" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/">The JBL Boombox 4 comes in your choice of three colors.</a> There’s the standard black, a stylish blue, and “Squad” which is a camo pattern. All three options are on sale for the same discounted price of just $450.</p>
