<p>Exploring <i>Monster Hunter Wilds</i> can feel pretty on-rails at first. It’s hard not to spend your time traveling directly from objective to objective when you have the convenient option of letting your Seikret automatically run towards the monster you’re hunting or any known resources. Although it’s easy to assume that various maps of the game are barren, each one has a fair selection of hidden areas.</p> <p>Some of these secret areas are easily missed pop-up camps for you to fast travel to or <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094">rest in</a>, while others are caves that are only accessible if you crawl or swim. Either way, these locations are surrounded by good loot to farm and incredible views to enjoy.</p> <h2><span id="windward-plains%e2%80%99-area-three-platform"></span>Windward Plains’ Area Three Platform<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616330"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616330">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’re told early on that some places will only be accessible with your Seikret. You can find a great example of this early on in the Windward Plains. Located right above the Area Three South Pop-up Camp is a spot with Mining Outcrops, Fulgurite Shards, and the very rare Nightflower Pollen-granting Ephemeral Blossom. The quickest way here is to fast travel to the campsite and then ride your Seikret next to its food trough behind the tent. Jump off the mount and your hunter will climb up the ledge.</p>

 <h2><span id="windward-plain%e2%80%99s-best-mining-outcrop-farm"></span>Windward Plain’s Best Mining Outcrop Farm<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616331"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616331">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This next spot requires you to leave your Seikret behind. Located near the entrance to Rey Dau’s nest in Area 17 is a Mining Outcrop. Directly next to it is a small opening that your hunter can crawl under. On the other side are three ascending platforms accessible by climbing long sets of vines or using multiple Wedge Beetles. All together, you’ll be able to gather from four to eight additional Mining Outcrops.</p> <h2><span id="scarlet-forest%e2%80%99s-area-six-camp"></span>Scarlet Forest’s Area Six Camp<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616332" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616332"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616332">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the best missable spots in the Scarlet Forest is the Area Six Flowering Rocks Pop-up Camp. Situated between Areas Two and Three, it’s only accessible by going through some tree roots on the south side of Area Six. Aside from being a safe camp in a convenient part of the map, there is also a nice fishing area with Glass Algae to gather and potentially two Ancient Wyvern Coins to find.</p> <h2><span id="scarlet-forest%e2%80%99s-underwater-area"></span>Scarlet Forest’s Underwater Area<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616335" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616335"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616335">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Every video game should have hidden caves behind waterfalls. Finding the <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-giant-downy-crake-location-item-1851784123">Grand Hub’s Gigacrake</a> is a fun secret in itself, but the Scarlet Forest takes it even further with two waterfall caves. What is arguably the coolest lies just north of the Area 12 Northeast camp. If you’ve already encountered Lagiacrus after Title Update Two, you want to go towards the monster’s nest in the unlocked Area 19.</p>

 <p>This spot doesn’t seem like much besides an aesthetically pleasing fishing spot at first glance. The trick is approaching the end of the mound and pressing Circle/B to dive into the water. Your hunter’s swimming path is on rails, but you can use your Slinger to gather numerous Weathered Treasures and Glass Algae. Even more Weathered Treasures await you in the small stone structure at the end.</p> <h2><span id="oilwell-basin%e2%80%99s-crimson-rivulet-camp"></span>Oilwell Basin’s Crimson Rivulet Camp<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616336" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616336"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616336">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I rode past this location many times before I discovered its existence in the Oilwell Basin. When traveling to Area 16 from Area 12, there is a small path on the right side with a steep drop. At the bottom of this trail is the Area 12: Crimson Rivulet Pop-up Camp. On top of being situated in a convenient location, it’s also near a relaxing pool of water where you can fish.</p>

 <h2><span id="iceshard-cliffs%e2%80%99-watchtower"></span>Iceshard Cliffs’ Watchtower<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616337" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616337"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616337">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Your Seikret is a must for this one. Connecting Areas Seven and Eight is a slope between two ledges. Climbing in from the former’s direction, ride your Seikret left to find a small gap next to an Adamant Seed pick-up. Jumping across and climbing up the vines leads to the Area Seven Watchtower Pop-up Camp.</p> <p>There are a couple of Mining Outcrops and occasionally a crab holding an Ancient Wyvern Coin, but the real joy is the view to the left. You can see all across the Forbidden Lands from up here.</p>

 <h2><span id="iceshard-cliff%e2%80%99s-sinkhole"></span>Iceshard Cliff’s Sinkhole<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616338"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616338">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Within the hallway between Areas Eight and 16 is a small hole in the wall. Inside is a massive sinkhole leading down to the Area 18 Sinkhole camp. Not only is this a safe camp in a great spot, but there is a nice variety of gatherables here and in the tiny cave right behind the camp.</p> <h2><span id="ruins-of-wyveria%e2%80%99s-secluded-ruins"></span>Ruins of Wyveria’s Secluded Ruins<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616339"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616339">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Ruins of Wyveria can feel like the tiniest map due to its vertical orientation, which makes Area Six feel ostensibly large in comparison. There are three campsites in this area, however, the most interesting is on the north side near two Vespoids. Along the wall will be a thin stretch of vines leading up to a pipe. On the other side is the Secluded Ruins Pop-up Camp and a lovely view of the Lost Path of Wyveria that connects to the Iceshard Cliffs.</p> <h2><span id="ruins-of-wyveria%e2%80%99s-gap-in-rubble"></span>Ruins of Wyveria’s Gap in Rubble<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616340" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616340"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616340">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It wouldn’t feel right if there wasn’t another random hole in the wall. You can find just that on the West side of Area Eight, literally next to the number “8” when viewing the map. This hole leads to the appropriately named Gap in Rubble Campsite where you can find some Blackened Fossils and a handy fishing spot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Forza Motorsport’s</em> social media account seems dead. <em>Castle Crashers</em> is getting new DLC. And <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta is a smash hit that seems to indicate EA’s choice to recreate <em>Battlefield 3</em> was a smart one. Plus an ugly Atari 2600 and some cool <em>Kotaku</em> stories you might have missed. Yes, folks, it’s time once again for Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, trailers, and cool shit.</p> <h2><strong>The <em>Battlefield 6</em> Open Beta Is A Massive Hit On Steam</strong></h2> <p>I knew there was a lot of excitement for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, which is launching this October on Xbox, PS5, and PC, but I didn’t realize just how many people were apparently ready for a new, grounded <em>BF</em> game. Turns out a lot of people want to play this new installment in EA’s military sim shooter series. On Steam alone, the open beta has already hit over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">330,000 concurrent players</a>. And this is despite <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953403767107264869?">numerous server issues and long queues</a>. Also, keep in mind that this session of the “open” beta isn’t actually open. You need an early access code to join in right now. I imagine <em>Battlefield</em> devs (and EA as a whole) are very excited about the high numbers. We’ll see how much higher the player count goes later this week when the beta goes truly open.</p> <h2><strong><em>Castle Crashers</em>‘ First New DLC In A Decade Is Out Now</strong></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Castle Crashers: Painter Boss Paradise DLC Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OYpEUMQhz8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>2008’s <em>Castle Crashers</em> is getting some new DLC today. <a href="https://kotaku.com/castle-crashers-first-dlc-in-12-years-lets-you-make-you-1851606535">As previously announced,</a> the beloved cartoon brawler from the XBLA days is getting a big upgrade via the Painter Boss Paradise DLC. This $4 expansion is available now on Steam and adds a new world map, a new official character named Paint Junior, some quality-of-life changes, and the ability to create your own playable characters, too.</p>

 <h2><strong>What’s Up With The<em> Forza Motorsport</em> Twitter Account?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>So here’s something odd. The official <em>Forza Motorsport</em> Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1943342994662310309">hasn’t tweeted anything since July 10.</a> This is strange, as <em>Forza Motorsport</em> is a live-service game that, in theory, is frequently being updated with new content and events. You’d think Xbox or Turn 10 would want to keep people updated on the game’s status or at least tweet something here and there to remind people that the game is alive and still active. <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1953142509238198413?t=Z_WE72dEIAGv86xMmehTBA&amp;s=19">But as pointed out by Destin Legarie,</a> it seems the account has gone dormant. What does that mean in the wake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">layoffs at Turn 10 and Xbox</a>? Probably nothing good.</p> <h2><strong>A very yellow Atari 2600 is now available for pre-order</strong></h2> <p>A new, version of the Atari 2600+ (a modern spin on the retro console that can play the old carts) is now available for pre-order. But it doesn’t feature the console’s iconic faux wood veneer.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-2600-pac-man-edition-console-wireless-joystick-bandai-namco-game-preorders/1100-6533716/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"> Instead, it is painted a bright, obnoxious yellow in honor of </a><em>Pac-Man.</em> This special edition of the console arrives in October and will cost you $170. It does come with a wireless controller and two different versions of <em>Pac-Man.</em> First is a new game, <em>Pac-Man 7800</em>, which is a fresh port of the classic arcade game. The other included cart is the 2600 version of <em>Pac-Man</em>, which might be the worst way to play the game in 2025. Yay? Anyway, if you want a really ugly Atari 2600+, you can pre-order this now.</p> <h2>Park building sickos should check out this <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> trailer</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Shaping Your Parks | Feature Focus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6PYojm22uV0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The first two <em>Jurassic World Evolution</em> games had totally serviceable terrain modification tools and options. But the upcoming <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> is going to the next level, letting you build waterfalls and even use cliffs and valleys to contain your various dinos. This trailer has me so excited to spend many, many hours digging holes and placing individual trees in my digital parks. I’m going to lose a large chunk of my life to this game, and I’m so fucking excited.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043">We’ve learned a lot about <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s multiplayer since its reveal last week</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043">Nintendo of America at one point in time wanted to give Pikachu big boobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">Take a look behind the scenes of a massive AAA video game reveal</a></li> </ul>
