            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Kazuma Kaneko, the legendary “Demon Designer” and art director behind the </span><i><span>Shin Megami Tensei </span></i><span>series, every mainline </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>game and, most recently,</span><i><span> Metaphor: ReFantazio</span></i><span>, has just revealed his new card game with AI-generated card art, </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span>. Like with the earlier game </span><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span>, Kaneko isn’t just involved in aspects like game concept and character design but actually appears in-game, or at least an AI recreation of him does.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Coming from mobile game developer Colopl, it’s set to land on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on April 23, and it’ll cost you $24.99. Or roughly $640, if you want to shell out for the special “Shinma Artist Box” edition.</span></p> <p><span>This reveal was made alongside the announcement that Colopl’s previous free-to-play partnership with Kaneko, </span><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span>, will be coming to a close on April 22 (a day before the release of </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span>). This was all announced during a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzuen_-vCa8"><span>livestreamed event</span></a><span> on Colopl’s official YouTube last night.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span> allowed players to create their own AI artwork cards through the use of its “AI Kaneko” mechanic. The in-game Kazuma Kaneko would analyze players’ playstyles and gift them AI-generated cards, based on a library of Kaneko’s work. </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span> won’t feature the same mechanic, but will instead port 3,600 of the developer’s favourite AI Kaneko-produced cards over to the new version of the game.</span></p> <p><span>We know this because a Colopl representative reached out to </span><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/kazuma-kanekos-tsukuyomi-announced-for-switch"><i><span>Gematsu</span></i></a> <span>to clarify: “The Switch version takes a curated amount of those AI generated cards from the previous game and includes them in the new game. The Switch version does not include the generative AI model to create new cards beyond the cards that the team has put into the Switch version.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Worse still, as noted by </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shin-megami-tensei-artist-kazuma-kanekos-free-to-play-ai-card-game-to-end-services-and-immediately-resurrect-as-full-price-nintendo-switch-exclusive/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>, the official </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span> website states that the “game uses generative AI in the creation of images, videos, and music.” The same statement says that the devs will “strive to prevent unauthorised use and rights infringement,” but it’s still confirmation that generative AI tools are being used in almost every facet of this game’s development.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Fixes Cosmetics A Month After AI Slop Allegations]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-fixes-cosmetics-a-month-after-ai-slop-allegations-2000664576</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back in December, <em>Battlefield 6</em> came under fire for releasing cosmetics that appeared to be made at least partly with generative AI. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167">As<em> Kotaku</em> reported at the time</a>, EA was aware of the issue and trying to investigate the cause throughout the winter break. Were players right to freak out? EA isn’t saying. The closest we’re getting to an answer is a new patch that changes some of the in-game items accused of being slop.</p> <p>“Updated the Objective Ace and Winter Warning cosmetics to better align with <em>Battlefield</em>’s visual identity,” reads one of the changelog notes for Friday’s <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2017266697183412713">1.1.3.6 <em>Battlefield 6</em> update</a>. The company doesn’t go into any further detail about what was changed and why, but players immediately connected it back to last month’s Christmas week controversy.</p>

 <p>The original backlash came when players noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pt4ihv/multi_billion_dollar_company_ea_selling_ai/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167">an M4A1 emblem</a> from the winter cosmetic pack that EA was selling had two barrels. That sparked an investigation of other recent additions to the game for anything that looked vaguely off, including a bear that seemed to have extra claws. Some fans also criticized EA in early January for the Objective Ace operator mask that looked very similar to that worn by <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s Ghost.</p> <p>How could such a glaring rip-off make it into the game? Once again, some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pzqhui/this_is_litteraly_a_cod_ghosts_mask/">blamed the use of genAI</a>. <em>Kotaku</em> reported last month that one of the potential issues had to do with the sheer volume of content promised for <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s launch and beyond. Without proper resources and quality checks, junk could make it into the game in any number of ways. <em>Call of Duty</em> has had its own challenges with genAI garbage <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">slipping through as well</a>.</p>

 <p>Despite EA CEO Andrew Wilson’s embrace of emerging AI technology to fundamentally reshape the company, EA VP Rebecka Coutaz, who oversees DICE and the other teams making&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">told the BBC</a> last year that no genAI would make it into the final game. She didn’t promise, however, that it wasn’t being used at all during the development process. EA is currently set to be <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">sold to Saudi Arabia</a> and a group of other investors sometime this summer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hitman-mission-mindseye-build-rocket-io-interactive-2000664566</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span> was one of last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-worst-games-of-2025-according-to-metacritic-mindseye-fire-emblem-glover-2000653114"><span>worst-reviewed games</span></a><span>. It was published by IO Interactive and was supposed to get a special </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span> crossover mission. According to a new report from </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/"><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i></a><span>, that’s no longer happening and developer Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive have decided to bail on the failed joint venture.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What this means for the future of </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, once pitched as the first building block in an ambitious open-world metaverse </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everywhere-mindseye-ex-gta-devs-fortnite-dreams-roblox-1850258651"><span>called </span><i><span>Everywhere</span></i></a><span>, is currently unclear. But apparently the </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span> mission, the shooter’s highest-profile bit of upcoming content, is canceled.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>The most surprising part of </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>’s</span><span> report is that Build a Rocket Boy was apparently the one pushing to end the ill-fated partnership, a decision influenced by the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><span>ex-</span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> producer-led studio</span></a><span>’s&nbsp; “desire to bring its publishing in-house and gain more control over its future.”</span></p> <p><span>IOI Interactive and Build A Rocket Boy announced the deal that would see the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>maker publish <em>MindsEye</em>,</span><span>&nbsp;the first third-party game distributed through IOI Interactive’s IO Partners program, back in October 2024. The </span><i><span>Hitman </span></i><span>mission was announced onstage at Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest 2025, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-worst-game-2025-update-hitman-crossover-delay-1851787011"><span>later delayed</span></a><span> amid layoffs and Build a Rocket Boy’s rush to clean up</span><i><span> MindsEye</span></i><span>’s messy launch.</span></p>

 <p><span>IOI Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak commented on the debacle during an interview with </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> last September. “Well, that was definitely tough, right?” he said at the time. “It was a tough reception. It wasn’t what they hoped for, and also what we didn’t hope for at IOI Partners. They’re working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they’re working on. So hopefully they’ll succeed with that in the future.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps the only people who will truly be distraught at this news are the streamers and content creators who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-update-twitch-sponsored-streamer-2000661013"><span>still being paid to promote </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i></a><span>. At least we’ll know for sure IOI Interactive had been the one bankrolling the sponsored content should the “#MindsEyePartner”-tagged streams suddenly come to an end in the near future.</span></p>
