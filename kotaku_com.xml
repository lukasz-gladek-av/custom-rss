So with <em>Mario Kart World </em>kicking off the Switch 2’s launch this month, why not see if we can end a few more by trying to rank these games from worst to best?</p><p>The series has evolved over the years, from a simple racer based on the Mushroom Kingdom to a motorized <em>Smash Bros.,</em> drawing in racers and tracks from across the Nintendo universe. And as it’s got older it’s got bigger, going from a mere karting game to something that let us drive quads, bikes, hovercars and even two-seat mobile weapons platforms, and now to a full open world.</p><p>As is often the case with Pecking Orders, the idea here isn’t <em>really </em>to rank these games from worst to best, because even the ones down the bottom of the list are still loads of fun. It’s to pit these classics against one another, to not just see which one comes out on top, but <em>why</em>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-super-circuit-yoshi-bowser-mario-peach-luigi-1850155523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-super-circuit-yoshi-bowser-mario-peach-luigi-1850155523"><em>Mario Kart</em> Fans Aghast To Learn About Secret Points That Tilt The Scales</a></span></p><p>Note that we’ve excluded the arcade games on two grounds: one, that loads of us (and you) haven’t played them, and two, because so much of their content, from tracks to sound effects, is recycled content from mainline games (in a more literal way than newer console games including older tracks).</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-recommend-id="image://xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-recommend-id="image://xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We’ve got to start somewhere, and this is easiest place. Concessions had to be made to make the game work on mobile in an <em>economic</em> sense, we get that. You can’t release a phone game in the last decade without tying it to some kind of bizarre money-making scheme.</p><p>But the game itself could have been so much better. Emulation of classic Nintendo games is at the point where many people could play <em>Double Dash</em> on their phones if they wanted to, so to offer up such a compromised version of the series as an official release is a crushing disappointment.</p><p>By the standards of 2019 mobile game releases, it’s fine? But by the standards set by the rest of this series, <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> is a comfortable last-place finish, no red shell required.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-recommend-id="image://wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-recommend-id="image://wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s many people’s least favourite (at least proper) <em>Mario Kart</em> game because it’s both so old and there’s so little to recommend it. The original has the purity of its vision and nostalgia to play on, while later games are just, well, better. <em>Super Circuit</em>, caught between the original’s pioneering release and releasing long after the series’ 3D debut, is trapped and a little lost, at least when we’re looking back on the series as a whole from our contemporary vantage point.</p><p>Know what’s really cool about it though? The original’s visuals haven’t aged that great, but <em>Super Circuit’s</em> cheery pixel art is one of the Game Boy Advance’s most underrated achievements. Everything is just so damn colourful and cute and pretty in the same way so many first-party SNES and GBA platformers were, only here it’s moving real real fast as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-recommend-id="image://h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-format="jpg" data-width="2050" data-height="1153" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-recommend-id="image://h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-format="jpg" data-width="2050" data-height="1153" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This game was so damn popular! It sold <em>37 million </em>copies! And you’d think, from the size of it to the funky motion controls, that it’d be higher up on this list. But again, like <em>Super Circuit</em>, <em>Wii </em>gets a little lost in the passage of time, as there’s very little reason to play this when <em>Mario Kart 7</em>, and then <em>8</em>, came along and did everything it did but so much better.</p><p>Not helping it here is that, despite the game being perfectly positioned to cash in on the Wii’s motion control hype with its iconic plastic steering wheel, the game’s motion controls—the one defining feature of the game that anyone remembers—were actually straight garbage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-recommend-id="image://xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-recommend-id="image://xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In many ways the most limited mainline <em>Mario Kart</em> game, this could have been down the bottom of this list after all these years, as subsequent games have some along and slowly improved and built upon the foundations it laid.</p><p>But man, there’s still so much to love, and respect. While its lack of 3D terrain is a little jarring in this post-Nintendo 64 world, the slippery, slidey cornering might still be the best in the series, from its exaggerated reach to the way the entire camera is wrenched around to accommodate it.</p><p>It’s not the fastest, smartest of even the most fun <em>Mario Kart</em> game, not by a long stretch, but it’s somehow still the most kart-y game of the lot. And being the instigator of the entire series, in many ways the purest expression of the original vision, it felt wrong putting it any lower.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-recommend-id="image://fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-recommend-id="image://fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is going to start harsh for a game that’s a lot of people’s sentimental fave, but time has not been kind to this game. Where once it was a pioneer of 3D multiplayer gaming, now it just looks like shit and has a surprisingly high number of empty, boring tracks. </p><p>As we’re going to find as we get further into this list, though, even the weakest <em>Mario Kart</em> games (by 21st century standards, anyway) can often be saved by moments of inspirational course design, and while like I’ve just said many of <em>Mario Kart 64's</em> are a snooze fest, when it shines—like Toad’s Turnpike—it <em>shines</em>. </p><p>Also, this is the game that introduced the blue shell. We weren’t sure whether to praise or punish the game for that, so in very un-blue shell fashion it ends up dropping it in the middle of the pack.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-recommend-id="image://it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-format="jpg" data-width="917" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-recommend-id="image://it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-format="jpg" data-width="917" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a pattern emerging here, born of the series taking relatively few major advances over the years: this is yet another entry that was ridiculously popular, and another where there isn’t much reason to play it today, coming as it did between everyone’s childhood favourites and the more expansive offerings on the Wii U and Switch.</p><p>But can we just take a step back and appreciate its online play? This was a DS game, from 2005, made by Nintendo, and to play it online was both a breeze and an absolute joy.<br></p><p><em>Mario Kart DS</em> was the first game in the series to open us up to a whole world, quite literally, of <em>Mario Kart</em> in a way that not even some more recent home console titles have managed.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-recommend-id="image://mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-recommend-id="image://mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Can we just start this one by saying that more <em>Mario Karts</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-vr-looks-nuts-1796865368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-vr-looks-nuts-1796865368">outside of VR experiences</a></span>) need first-person racing? This game had it, and it sucks that more don’t!</p><p>Anyway, <em>Mario Kart 7</em> had a lot more to offer than just that gimmick. <em>Mario Kart 7 </em>made some big innovations for a handheld game, most importantly in the way players were now able to drastically customise their cars, and also how you could drive underwater.</p><p>The game is often criticised for leaning a little heavily on the rest of the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula (as if every game barring <em>64</em> hasn’t done the same thing), but that was always a little unfair, coming as it did on a handheld system whose primary innovation—3D visuals—could never really be taken advantage of in a way that could have fundamentally changed the <em>Mario Kart experience</em>.</p><p>Indeed, for a game that at the time felt a little derivative, its introductions ultimately paved the way for a lot of the stuff that <em>Mario Kart 8</em>—which you’ll note we haven’t got to yet—does so well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-recommend-id="image://bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="999" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-recommend-id="image://bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="999" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Wait, what? Yes, you’re reading this right. <em>Double Dash</em>, baby. The first fully-3D <em>Mario Kart</em> game. It’s up here for two reasons.</p><p>Firstly, the two-player thing was great, and it’s a shame it hasn’t returned (outside of an arcade cameo) since, even as a secondary mode. Having one player concentrate on driving while the other handled the timing and direction of weapons might not have been ideal in every multiplayer circumstance, but when it did—whether your partner was less skilled than you or just wasted—it was glorious.</p><p>And secondly, as you’d expect from a game coming out on the GameCube, <em>Double Dash’s</em> course design is some of the wackiest—and thus best—of the series. From Baby Park through to DK Mountain, it’s not until you cycle through some of these tracks again in later <em>Mario Karts</em> that you realise so many of the absolute classics are from this one release.</p><p>But its GameCube-ness extends beyond just the course design (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D3DC6664BCC050F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D3DC6664BCC050F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and its killer soundtrack!</a></span>). This is just so much <em>fun</em>, one of the shining examples of the weirdness prevalent in Nintendo games throughout the GameCube’s lifespan, where it was able to build on its cutesy past and polish it into a mirror-like sheen, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-dlc-is-so-gross-1616697911&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-dlc-is-so-gross-1616697911">wasn’t yet having to run commercial tie-ins for Mercedes DLC</a></span>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-recommend-id="image://0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-recommend-id="image://0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The latest entry in Mario’s kart-racing jamboree is a rollicking good time, and also a somewhat frustrating one. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the best the actual driving and control has ever felt, and all the new maneuvers Nintendo has added this time around make it the most expressive and freeing in the series. But as the game gets bigger, with more players and entire modes that feel like they are meant to showcase the multi-track-spanning open world at the expense of more condensed races on bespoke tracks, playing the game requires you to get past some growing pains. It’s more experimental than it might seem at a glance, and for that, it deserves its flowers for injecting some really cool ideas into a 30-year-old franchise.</p><p>With 24-player races that let you ride on just about any surface you can reasonably get your wheels on, <em>World </em>is the most chaotic <em>Mario Kart </em>has ever been. This means there are plenty of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907">incredible plays and happy accidents</a></span>, but also a fair share of upsets that make the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-shortcut-lakitu-free-roam-unlock-1851784321&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-shortcut-lakitu-free-roam-unlock-1851784321">feel lopsided and unfair</a></span>. There are so many players on the track at once that you can spend several minutes of a race doing alright, just driving along your designated path, then suddenly face an onslaught of item-based attacks that will send you back a dozen places in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This all then needs to be weighed against the new inclusion of a vast, open world, around which you can freely drive, finding bonus items, mini-missions, hidden secrets, and so many coins. It’s the biggest shake-up the <em>Mario Kart </em>series<em> </em>has seen in decades, but time will tell if it sticks as a favorite racing game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-recommend-id="image://pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-recommend-id="image://pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Can you believe <em>Mario Kart 8</em> came out nearly a decade ago? That’s a mighty long and uninterrupted reign for a <em>Mario Kar</em>t game when you look at the release timeframe of so many of the games before this, but really, Nintendo hasn’t had to replace it, and might not need to for a while yet. An upgraded version on the Switch and some DLC has been enough to keep this one of the finest ever games, <em>Mario Kart</em> or otherwise. </p><p>And now, with all the sudden updates that have added a whopping 48 additional retro and unseen courses, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-4-dlc-birdo-yoshi-s-island-1850091298&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-4-dlc-birdo-yoshi-s-island-1850091298">alongside new characters like Birdo</a></span> (and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-five-new-characters-drivers-switch-nintendo-1850205794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-five-new-characters-drivers-switch-nintendo-1850205794">five more mysterious additions to come</a></span>), the undying game has further cemented its spot as the number one <em>Mario Kart </em>ever. </p><p>Everything we’ve discussed previously on this list, from characters to courses, is done better here than anywhere else. It’s innovations are rare, but its perfections are everywhere, particularly in its course design, which features truly breathtaking moments as gravity is inverted, whole sections of track disappear and coins are turned into rupees.</p><p>Quite simply, if you want to play <em>Mario Kart</em>, online or solo, with traditional characters or newer introductions, classic tracks or modern masterpieces, this is the game to play.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As such, it makes for a good time to see which pulls from the long-awaited return of Team Rocket are fetching the big bucks, and how much you’re going to need to fork out if you want to add a specific special art to your collection.</p><p>All year long, <em>Pokémon TCG</em> has been plagued by issues of availability, and the accompanying misery of resellers wreaking havoc on the market. Destined Rivals is certainly no exception, and for once it’s not just because of people wanting to turn a profit at the expense of the real players: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">this is a <em>damned</em> good set of Pokémon cards</a></span>, adding a huge amount of new fun to the live game, as well as being a set packed with stunning art, and most excitingly of all, better pull-rates.</p><p>When it comes to prices, I’m also pleased to report that things aren’t nearly as crazy as I’d expected. Now, for the sake of my own ego, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">I did correctly call which would be the biggest cards</a></span>, but I’m  happy to say I got the pricing trends wrong. I’m not sure if that’s because of the better pull rates (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Destined-Rivals-Pull-Rates/43ba832e-44c9-45a4-ae2e-594df2defdda/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Destined-Rivals-Pull-Rates/43ba832e-44c9-45a4-ae2e-594df2defdda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they appear to be almost identical</a></span> to those of Journey Together, itself a big improvement since the removal of Ace Specs, but with twice as many cards in this newer set, there’s so much more variety to enjoy), or if perhaps at last the whole global fuss is finally calming down, but either way it’s great news for the hobby. So sorry, if you <em>did </em>pull a Cynthia’s Garchomp, you’re not quite as rich as you might have expected. Although not too sorry, since the numbers here are still double what we’d have seen a year ago.</p><p>I should note on prices, while the individual cards themselves aren’t going <em>quite</em> as mad, the sealed packs themselves still are. Right now, a booster box of 36 packs is selling for $250, over a hundred bucks over its RRP, while Elite Trainer Boxes are also 50 percent higher than they should be at $87. If you’re chasing particular cards, <em>please</em> don’t spend that—it’s far smarter just to pay for the specific card you’re after.</p><p>So, that all said, here are the highest-priced cards in Destined Rivals. All prices are accurate at the time of writing, but likely to change very quickly:</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-recommend-id="image://2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-recommend-id="image://2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So, you know what, this one gives me a bit of hope. Prices of <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards are so often determined by two factors: the rarity, and whether there’s a pretty girl. But here, Ethan’s Typhlosion is <em>not</em> a super-rare card. There are very many cards in this set that are vastly more difficult to find, that are fetching far lower prices than the <strong>$42</strong> this is going for at the time of writing.</p><p>And why? Because it looks so fricking cool! The average price for Illustration Rares in this set is about ten bucks, and a lot of them look fantastic, but damn, this card is incredible. This feels like the sort of card that’s going to gain a lot more value over the next few years, as numbers thin out and people start to reflect on what a stunner it truly is.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-recommend-id="image://270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-recommend-id="image://270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ethan’s having a good showing in the top ten, and he’ll be back yet.

Misty, in the fiction, is 10 years old.

You’ll usually see these cards get a crazy price on day one, as silly people pay massively over the odds for a card that’ll cost half as much in a week. But in the case of this card alone, its current price is higher than where it began, and that’s <em>after</em> it took a dip. This means that unlike most of the prices here that are now levelling out, this one could still be climbing. The fluctuation hasn’t exactly been significant—it only dipped to $195—but breaking the pattern remains of note, and we could be about to see this climb much higher. At grade 10, it’s currently dancing around the $1,000 mark.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-recommend-id="image://7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-recommend-id="image://7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So yes,  predictably it’s the the extra-rare Mewtwo that comes out on top. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">But like I said before release</a></span>...it’s ugly, right?

This is currently selling for an average of <strong>$378</strong>, and you can find it for a lot higher. On launch it went for $450, before plummeting to $320 in its first week.

It’s a pricey pile of cards, but it could have been a lot worse. And, vitally importantly, you do not need to be spending anything close to this to play these cards in your deck. Everything is available in a regular version, usually for cents, and even the Mewtwo will only cost you about $6.</p><p>Next up is the big finish for Scarlet &amp; Violet in the TCG, with the first ever international split set of Black Bolt and White Flare on July 18. It’s going to be <em>ridiculous</em>, with literally hundreds of full-art cards spread across the two sets, and no booster boxes to be able to buy them in. Urgh.

The player hosting the session can’t perform it themselves but they can still pick up the duplicates their friends make for them. You’ll want to do this trick in a safe area like the site of grace right before the Nightlord fight where players have endless time to strategize.

But this trick can be a great way to share the wealth around if only one person managed to pick up a powerful weapon with the right affinity for the Nightlord’s weakness. It’s also an easy way to stack certain secondary gear bonuses, like increased damage negation and improved ranged attacks. It’s not necessarily going to break the game but it’s a neat little thing players can try if they’re struggling against a particular boss. </p><p>Some players have been experimenting with this item duplication glitch since <em>Nightreign</em> launched weeks ago, so it’ll be interesting to see when FromSoftware actually patches it out. It’s in many ways antithetical to the entire ethos of the game, though anyone who’s been hitting their head against Libra for hours at night might not mind using any extra advantage they can find.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What will Nintendo show off that couldn’t have just as easily been a random morning trailer drop? We’ll see. <em>Bananza </em>is Donkey Kong’s first 3D sandbox adventure in decades and features a new deformation mechanic where he can destroy the levels around him <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>-style.

And whether Link’s first truly open-world game is calling to you for the first time, or you’re a returning veteran looking to re-explore Hyrule once again (with improved visuals and performance)there’s a substantial amount of content here. If you want to put a number to things, though, that’s going to be a bit complicated. Read on to understand why.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196578" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h93249"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>?</h2><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is an enormous game teeming with things to do around every corner of its vast open world. As such, the amount of time spent exploring this version of Hyrule will vary from person to person based on how much of the game’s optional content they wish to see. But that variation may be significantly more extreme than you’d expect.</p><p>With a playthrough focused solely on beating the main campaign, <strong>players can expect to see the credits roll after 25-35 hours</strong>. And while there’s no right or wrong way to play the game, skipping so much of what it has to offer leaves a lot of wonderful experiences on the table.</p><p>Many players may find they want to engage with a significant portion of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>’s optional content, such as completing most side-quests, finishing every shrine, and exploring unique areas within the open world. Doing so can <strong>stretch the game’s length to a staggering 150-200 hours</strong>. Yeah, it’s a lot. But there’s more.</p><p>If you want to complete literally everything in <strong><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, you can reach beyond 300 hours of total playtime</strong>. This is obviously a task best reserved for the franchise’s most dedicated fans, as it requires an immense amount of work. But for those looking to truly absorb every morsel of <em>Zelda </em>goodness, there are months of fun to be had here.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is available now for Nintendo Switch. A Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for the game is also available at an additional cost, providing upgraded visuals and performance.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
