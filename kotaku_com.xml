Still, it is fun to walk into a room and shoot 20 random thugs with a big pistol. So that’s something. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472"><em>Unfinished Business</em></a></span><em> </em>opens in a really depressing way. Set after the events of the last game, it kicks off with an attack on the police station—which served as one of your central hubs in <em>Rogue City—</em>that leaves many of the NPCs from that game dead. A few of the main characters from the movies, like Officer Lewis, survive, point RoboCop in the direction of a big tower filled with mercenaries who were likely responsible, and then don’t show up again for hours and hours. It’s like<em> Unfinished Business</em> wants to remind players of the more varied world and characters of the last game before it dumps you into the boring corridors of OmniTower. </p><p>Once in OmniTower, <em>Unfinished Business</em> tasks you with reaching the upper levels of the massive structure. But between RoboCop and his goal are hundreds of bots and mercs ready to kill the shiny hero. While<em> Rogue City</em> featured plenty of first-person combat,<em> Unfinished Business</em> features loads more. This is  mostly an action game, whereas the last one could be charitably described as a low-budget spin on a Bethesda game.</p><p>Thankfully, gunning down creeps and saving hostages is still a blast in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. And a few new weapons, along with the ability to use the environment to take down baddies—like shoving someone down a garbage chute—help spice things up. But I really hope you liked the shooty-shooty bits from <em>Rogue City</em> because <em>Unfinished Business</em> is mostly that. </p><p>In <em>Rogue City</em>, I fell in love with a little slice of Old Detroit as I patrolled it, completed side missions, met various characters, and helped protect them. That’s all gone in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. There are still side quests and characters to meet, but most of them are left behind between levels as you keep moving up. Instead of a small slice of urban decay that you can grow to love, <em>Unfinished Business</em> gives you oh so many grey corridors and rooms. Thanks? </p><p>All the RPG systems from<em> Rogue City</em> are back in <em>Unfinished Business,</em> which does help add more to this game and keep it from being just a straight-up linear shooter, but compared to what came before, it’s disappointing. A few moments where you get to play as a pre-RoboCop Alex Murphy are neat, but don’t add much to the experience. </p><p>Hopefully, the devs behind <em>Unfinished Business</em> and <em>Rogue City </em>have a proper sequel in the works that brings back the open-world RPG formula that made that last game so charming and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-expansion-review-1851786534]]></content:encoded>

You probably hear the name SonicFox and immediately think of the professional fighting game player, but might not recognize their real name, Dominique McLean. The practice is probably good for brand awareness, as a lot of esports players have digital handles on social media, but it also means that a lot of players will just go by whatever they want. That includes a <em>PUBG Mobile </em>player from India named Subhash Bediya, who, up until this month, was using the handle “Hitler” as a member of a team called “Aryan.” Today, July 17, the player put out a public apology and changed his handle to “Henry.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Bediya posted a message on his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DMNNOBKvBX2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMNNOBKvBX2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram account</a></span> confirming the name change and saying he used the handle “without fully considering the weight and historical pain” associated with the name of the leader of Nazi Germany.

This time around, unlike in the previous films, humans aren’t hopping into the digital world, but instead, programs and elements from “The Grid” are being manifested into reality. It’s a strange concept, but this new official trailer has sold me on it, at least aesthetically. Seeing Recognizers and Light Cycles in the real world is striking. </p><p>Here’s the new trailer from Disney: </p><p>Everything is going great in this trailer until we reach the 40-second mark, when we’re reminded that Jared Leto is the film’s star. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://airmail.news/issues/2025-6-7/the-cult-of-leto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://airmail.news/issues/2025-6-7/the-cult-of-leto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earlier this year, at least nine women accused</a></span> the actor and musician of sexual misconduct.

It’s a soccer game (or football for you Europeans)currently in early access.

You still need to shoot, pass the ball at the right opportunity, and navigate complex plays. It’s not always easy, so let’s go over some essentials to improve your game.</p><h2 id="h589"><a id="1"></a>Actually go through those tutorials!</h2><figure id="" data-id="ed725046b4444d0fe762840129896519" data-recommend-id="image://ed725046b4444d0fe762840129896519" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows tutorial options for Rematch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows tutorial options for Rematch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed725046b4444d0fe762840129896519" data-recommend-id="image://ed725046b4444d0fe762840129896519" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows tutorial options for Rematch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I know that lots of players love to ignore tutorials in video games or blow them off, but they’re a crucial part of mastering the mechanics in <em>Rematch</em>. The game has no lock-on feature at all, which means you’ll have to be incredibly precise when passing to teammates or trying to score a goal. Tutorials are a great place to get the hang of that.</p><p>The practice menu has an extensive gallery of tutorials and workshops with categories ranging from movement, defense, passing, scoring, and goalkeeping. After every kick off in <em>Rematch</em>, you’ll switch up positions, and you could potentially be made the goalie, so don’t neglect these tutorials and keep your skills sharp.</p><hr><h2 id="h590"><a id="2"></a>Experiment with camera and field-of-view settings</h2><figure id="" data-id="da993498590cc2d527c0e295b69de07f" data-recommend-id="image://da993498590cc2d527c0e295b69de07f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows camera settings for Rematch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows camera settings for Rematch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da993498590cc2d527c0e295b69de07f" data-recommend-id="image://da993498590cc2d527c0e295b69de07f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows camera settings for Rematch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll want to minimize your blind spots. There are no indicators that an opponent is nearby like in an action game like <em>God of War</em>. In <em>Rematch, s</em>patial awareness is essential, so it can be advantageous to maximize the amount of the field you can see.</p><p>Go into the settings and crank up the Camera FOV setting all the way to 90. This sets the camera as far back as possible and lets you see teammates and opponents alike easier. You can also adjust the camera motion sensitivity so that you can keep track of the ball as it travels across the field. Feel free to make it as slow or fast as you want.</p><hr><h2 id="h591"><a id="3"></a>Take advantage of the walls</h2><figure id="" data-id="5107fd3c53d8130057f5200688e0a228" data-recommend-id="image://5107fd3c53d8130057f5200688e0a228" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player lines up a shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player lines up a shot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5107fd3c53d8130057f5200688e0a228" data-recommend-id="image://5107fd3c53d8130057f5200688e0a228" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player lines up a shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Rematch</em>, if you kick the ball away from the field, it’ll bounce off and land back into the field, keeping it in play at all times. You should use this to your advantage. An opponent is closing in on you? Shoot the ball towards the wall and use your burst run to catch up to it. After all, there are no out-of-bounds. You can kick it all the way across the field and hope that your teammate catches up to it.</p><p>There’s even a trick utilizing the walls to score goals. Since the wall encompasses the entire field, that includes the goal. You can kick the ball above the goal and have it bounce off the wall behind it. Since most goalies are expecting a direct strike, they’ll dive in the direction you think you’re kicking. However, since the ball is going above the goal and landing right in front of it again, goalies can easily get disoriented and wonder where the ball went. Use this window of opportunity to launch a follow-up kick and score a goal. Sure, it’s a bit of an underhanded tactic, but use whatever you have to to win, right?</p><hr><h2 id="h592"><a id="4"></a>Manage your stamina</h2><figure id="" data-id="6dcad9daa443f1d1d1703cc7ad2d1d54" data-recommend-id="image://6dcad9daa443f1d1d1703cc7ad2d1d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plalyer stands on a soccer field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plalyer stands on a soccer field." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6dcad9daa443f1d1d1703cc7ad2d1d54" data-recommend-id="image://6dcad9daa443f1d1d1703cc7ad2d1d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plalyer stands on a soccer field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>No, this isn’t a <em>Dark Souls</em> game, but you’ll have to manage your stamina almost as if it were one. You have a meter at the bottom of the screen that’ll deplete whenever you run. However, it won’t drain if you just jog, so make sure to juggle between running and jogging to make full use of your stamina. If your stamina hits zero, you’ll be stuck moving at a slower pace until it recovers.</p><p>You can also perform slide tackles, which can really mess up opponents by taking the ball out of their control, but it uses up a heft bit of stamina. It also takes a bit to recover from the ground after slide tackling, so don’t go spamming it everywhere you go. If you fumble a slide tackle, you can be left behind the action and take precious seconds to get back into the fray.</p><p>You’ll also notice that there’s a much smaller, separate bar that’s right next to your stamina bar. That’s your burst speed bar, which gives you a temporary speed boost. Picking the most opportune time to use it can mean the difference between catching a ball and your opponent doing so.</p><hr><p><em>Rematch</em> is available now for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rematch-tutorials-stamina-barrier-walls-camera-fov-1851786518]]></content:encoded>

The only way to fight music is with a setlist of your own, and that’s the entire deck-building premise: making music with your own instruments.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4bf0dde8acc2eaece87ee9cf3e02d91" data-recommend-id="image://d4bf0dde8acc2eaece87ee9cf3e02d91" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fretless boss battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Fretless boss battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ritual Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4bf0dde8acc2eaece87ee9cf3e02d91" data-recommend-id="image://d4bf0dde8acc2eaece87ee9cf3e02d91" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fretless boss battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rob can wield one of four instruments: an acoustic guitar, a bass, a synthesizer, and an eight-string electric. Each axe has a different set of “riffs” that make up a deck, and while you can customize your loadout, each has a bespoke, core mechanic that makes every instrument demonstrably different. The bass has a “slap” meter that, if strategically raised, will power up certain attacks to devastating effect. The synthesizer, which quickly became my favorite of the bunch, utilizes “status FX” and exploits them to multiply damage to such a high output that if I placed the right cards down in the right order, I could wipe out powerful bosses in a turn or two. The eight-string is perhaps the most challenging but rewarding instrument to wield, with its push-and-pull playstyle sapping your own health in exchange for destructive attacks, eventually culminating in summoning a powerful ally who can turn the tide of battle.</p><p>Each instrument requires a different strategy, and an intimate knowledge of the way different cards interact with each other to use them effectively. There’s a surprising amount of minutiae to each deck, and every attack you use, spell you cast, and status FX you inflict has a timed rhythm element that, if you manage to land it, will increase their effectiveness. After playing games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span>, which also had timing woven into its turn-based battles but whose dodge and parry windows were often poorly communicated, it was refreshing to have something like <em>Fretless</em>, which ties its blocking and power-boosting mechanics to the actual rhythm of the music being composed in each battle. After I’d spent hours fighting with the synthesizer, its riffs were baked into my muscle memory, allowing me to compose a symphony of whoop-ass with my eyes closed.</p><p>The rhythm elements are only part of optimizing a deck. Each turn, you use up to three cards with different (or repeating) effects, and each funnels into an instrument’s playstyle. The synthesizer has cards that inflict status FX, then damaging cards that increase their output if an enemy is afflicted by specific ailments. Choosing what order to use the cards in so you can chain their effects together is the core of its deck-building. Each turn, you draw new cards and have to work with the ones you’ve got on hand, and figuring out how to min-max whatever you’re stuck with can be the difference between a wasted turn and a strategic sweep. You start <em>Fretless </em>with the acoustic guitar and its damage-dealing and shield-building cards lull you into a false sense of simplicity, only for every subsequent instrument to experiment with the game’s deep mechanics in ways that I was constantly surprised by.</p><p>All of this would be nothing without <em>Fretless</em>’ excellent, eclectic soundtrack. Rob’s arsenal determines the battle music for most of its fights, but bosses bring their own sound into the ring. <em>Fretless</em>’ music spans so many genres, from the electric beats of the synthesizer to the distorted heavy metal of the eight-string. But when people aren’t slinging music notes at one another, it dips into chill, nostalgic ambiance evocative of the retro RPGs that clearly inspired its aesthetic. <em>Fretless </em>could have fallen back on crowd-pleasing licensed music, but instead it carves out multiple aural identities, each of which is etched into the world and the battles waged within it. I don’t want to downplay the depth of its card-battling systems, but as a retired musician, I find <em>Fretless</em> to be at its best when it’s leaning into a clear love of music and building its world around a shared understanding of the language of composition.</p><figure id="" data-id="1fdae701f910563da419762dee24aab2" data-recommend-id="image://1fdae701f910563da419762dee24aab2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fretless rhythm section mini-game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Fretless rhythm section mini-game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ritual Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1fdae701f910563da419762dee24aab2" data-recommend-id="image://1fdae701f910563da419762dee24aab2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fretless rhythm section mini-game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Fretless</em> is full of what are essentially worldbuilding puns based on its musical theme. It plays with old RPG tropes by giving them a musical twist. The inns at which you heal yourself are adorned with a big sign showing a quarter rest…because you rest there, you know? Its equipment loadouts are mods to your instruments like pedals, pickups, and strings. It’s like everyone and everything in its world lives and breathes musicality, and it’s such a consistent, cute throughline that it stirred a love of musical creation in me that I sometimes feel like I’ve lost. I always have music playing in my ears. I work with a 200+ person musical group in New York City every week. However, after I moved away from being a professional musician to write about video games for a living a decade ago, the compositions I once spun in my head like breathing became background noise in my everyday life. I’ll find a new song or artist I resonate with, one of my faves will put out a new album, or I’ll go to a live show and remember all my musical inclinations like I’m putting on an old glove. <em>Fretless</em> gave me that same feeling, all to the tune of a well-crafted deck builder. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fretless-wrath-riffson-deck-builder-music-rpg-review-1851786514]]></content:encoded>
