              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has a lot in common with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6.</em> Fans have been waiting on it for years. Each new crumb of information is quickly devoured. Competitors are <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">scrambling out of the way</a>. And after years of fermenting hype, the most wishlisted game on Steam now has to deliver something bigger than the all consuming cultural distortion field surrounding it. No small task. I’ve now played 15 minutes of the final demo and I still could not tell you which way it’s going to go. That’s because everything that can make a Metroidvania Soulslike like <em>Silksong</em> truly pop is precisely what Team Cherry is keeping most under wraps.</p> <p>I played the Gamescom 2025 build of <em>Silksong</em> on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld during a PAX West-adjacent event at Microsoft and it felt like eating a Dunkin Donuts Munchkin: easy, sweet, and over way too soon. That’s by design. Team Cherry <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">said in a recent interview</a> that the game took seven years to make because of all of the new areas, characters, and secrets it wanted to pack into the <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel. And it also clearly didn’t want to ruin any of those things by actually talking about them before the game’s September 4 release date on PC and console, or by showing them off ahead of time in demo.</p> <p>The only portion of<em> Silksong</em> that anyone has played so far takes place near the beginning of the game. Hornet, the new protagonist, awakes in an underground glen full of bright moss and easy enemies. A short platforming section introduces players to the familiar <em>Bloodborne</em>-inspired combat (you need to deal damage to get health back) and the game’s exploration which has you exhausting dead-ends until you find the path forward. It wraps with a simple mini-boss fight that’s intent on scaring any newcomers away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000621699" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621699"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621699">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second section takes you to smoldering caverns with more deadly enemies to navigate. Ensembles of flying, fire-ball spitting wizards and knights with big shields make you work to survive and gesture toward the ambient, elevated threat-level that fills each path you choose to go down with just the right amount of tension.</p> <p>This is all classic <em>Hollow Knight</em> so far. The only thing that really sets<em> Silksong</em> apart in the demo is Hornet. The character’s a bit faster, has a down diagonal attack to speed up aerial recoveries, and can heal more quickly but only after more energy is gathered from dealing damage. It’s a different, more aggressive flow than the original game which could take on an even more distinct identity once players start unlocking their full arsenals.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> really cost $20?</h2> <p>All of which is to say that while there were certainly no red flags in my brief hands-on time with <em>Silksong</em>, it’s impossible to know from the 15-minute demo whether Silksong can deliver on what fans have been hoping for over the last eight years. It’s slick and prettier than the original, but what will ultimately matter is the cleverness of its secrets, exploration, and later-game boss fights. One other bit of potential good news ahead of the game’s launch next week is that it might not be very expensive either.</p> <p><em>Hollow Knight</em> launched for just $15 back in 2017. You can currently buy it on PC for just half that price leading up to the sequel’s release (act now and you&nbsp;<em>might</em> be able to beat it in time). <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">A leak yesterday</a> on the GameStop website suggested <em>Silksong</em> will be $20, only $5 more than its predecessor at a time when Team Cherry easily could have charged $30 or more. The store listing has since been taken down and might have just been a speculative placeholder.</p> <p>All eyes will be on Steam for when the actual price drops. So far Team Cherry hasn’t actually confirmed how much it will cost. Like almost everything else about the game, the small indie team is keeping that close to the vest. Not that it will matter. Just like the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">lack of reviews ahead of launch</a>, <em>Silksong</em> doesn’t have to play by conventional rules. It’s in a league of its own. In less than a week we’ll finally know if it truly belongs there.</p>

              <p>Carrying around multiple chargers can be such a pain – your bag ends up heavy and overflowing with cables. Wouldn’t it be nice to have just one charger that handles all your devices at once? That’s exactly where this Baseus 100W USB-C charger block comes in: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">it’s on Amazon for only $29, down from $49, which is a solid 40% off</a> – definitely a steal at this all-time low price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports</h2>
<p>This small charger is a monster with three ports: <strong>two USB-C and one USB-A</strong>. That means you can charge your phone, tablet and even laptop all at once without having to switch back and forth between several different plugs. And don’t worry about it being slow: <strong>it delivers up to 100 watts in total power</strong> which is more than enough to fast-charge something like a MacBook Pro or any other laptop while still keeping your phone and tablet topped up. It’s got this smart PPS technology that adjusts the power depending on what you’re charging so your devices don’t get too much juice and stay safe.</p>
<p>What I totally adore is the way the plug folds: When you’re all done charging, <strong>you just fold it up and it’s really tiny</strong>. It fits perfectly into your bag or even a large pocket, no bulky charger bricks weighing you down. And it’s durable, so you don’t have to worry about destroying it after a few recharges. It’s compatible with so many of the most popular devices, like the new iPhone 16, Galaxy S54, iPad, and so forth, so that you don’t have to be carrying a separate charger for every gadget.</p>



<p>Even when it’s charging three devices at a time, this charger keeps up with the speed: <strong>The USB-C ports split that 100W among themselves in a way that each device gets enough current to charge in a rush</strong>, and the USB-A port also provides fast charging so the old devices get a speed boost without being left behind.</p>
<p>Safety features are also spot on. It’s got inbuilt safeguards to <strong>protect your belongings from overheating, short circuits, or overcharging</strong>. So don’t worry about leaving your devices plugged in overnight. It’s also energy efficient, meaning less wasted power and smaller dent on your electricity bill.</p>
<p>Get it at this sale price while it lasts, and be on your way to quicker and simpler charging of all your electronics wherever you are.</p>
