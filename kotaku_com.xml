Whether it’s losing HP every turn with Poison or going apeshit from Berserk, you’ll always need to be aware of what types of status effects can disrupt battles in this exciting role-playing romp. We’ll dive into all these status effects in this guide, so bounce on down below to check it out.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,196001,195273" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h491544"><a id="1"></a>All status effects in <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em></h2><h2 id="h491545"><a id=""></a></h2><p>Here are the status effects you’ll encounter while playing <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em>. </p><p><strong>Berserk</strong>: This status effect raises a character’s Physical Attack by a whopping 50 percent, but you lose control of them for a while, which means they’ll attack at random. <em>You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Blind</strong>: This status effect reduces the accuracy of a character’s physical attacks. You can’t hit what you can’t target, you know. <em>Silver Glasses make you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: This status effect removes your ability to control a character temporarily. During this time, they may heal enemies or attack your other characters. <em>Rebuff Locket makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Confusion</strong>: This status effect removes your ability to control a character temporarily. While under the effect, the character may randomly attack enemies and allies. <em>Peace Ring makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Death</strong>: This status effect kills a character outright. Ouch. <em>The Safety Ring makes you immune to this status.</em></p><p><strong>Doom</strong>: This status effect places a counter above a character’s head. When it reaches 0, that character will die. Sucks to be them!</p><p><strong>Dread</strong>: This status effect makes it impossible to use Brave or Default. How dreadful. <em>You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Love</strong>: This status effect causes a character to fall in love with another ally. Because of this, they will receive all of the same damage and status effects of the ally they’re in love with, as well as copy the ally’s moves. </p><p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: This status effect causes a character to be unable to use any actions for a few turns. <em>The Earthing Rod makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Poison</strong>: This status effect causes a character to take damage on each turn. Come on, you knew this one already. <em>The Star Pendant makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga and Poisona. </em></p><p><strong>Silence</strong>: This status effect makes it so that a character is unable to use magic. <em>The White Cape makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: This status effect puts a character to sleep, rendering them incapable of using any actions for a few turns. How cozy! <em>Clothespin makes you immune to this status. You can cure it with Esuna/Esunaga.</em></p><p><strong>Status Down</strong>: This status effect reduces one of your character’s stats temporarily. <em>You can recover from this with Despell.</em></p><p><strong>Stop</strong>: This status effect renders a character unable to move, opening them up to attacks. <em>Despell will knock this out.</em></p><hr><h2 id="h491546"><a id="2"></a>How long does it take for status effects to go away?</h2><p>Good news: Some of these status effects have a chance to go away on their own on the next turn. The chance of these debuffs vanishing increases, though not at the same rate for each status. Here are the following chances of recovering from certain statuses on your own (by “turn”, we mean <em>your character’s </em>turn, not just any turn:</p><p><strong>Charm</strong>: Charm follows the same pattern as Confuse for auto-recovery. </p><p><strong>Confuse</strong>: You have a 20-percent chance to recover from Confuse on your next turn. This increases by 10-percent for the next two turns, followed by a 60-percent chance. After six turns, Confuse will go away on its own. </p><p><strong>Dread: </strong>Starts at a 25-percent chance on the next turn, followed by a 25-percent chance of an automatic recovery with each passing turn.</p><p><strong>Paralysis: </strong>20-percent chance for recovery, followed by a 5-percent increase on the following turn and a 25-percent chance for each subsequent turn thereafter. </p><p><strong>Sleep:</strong> 25-percent chance for recovery on next turn. Adds an additional 25 percent chance with each proceeding turn. </p><p><strong>Stop:</strong> Starting with a 20-percent chance of recovery, the next turn sees your recovery chance increase by five-percent, then a 25-percent increase with each passing turn of yours.</p><hr><p>Now that you know what status effects to expect in <em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</em>, you’ll be far more prepared for battle. The game is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, so go save the world!  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-status-paralysis-sleep-1851785720]]></content:encoded>

The five-day count is a result of the movie opening a few days earlier in the week to capitalize on July 4th. And yes, that $91 million is impressive, but it’s still less than  the last three films earned during their opening weekends. </p><p>Overseas, <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> has been even more successful, bringing in $171 million during the film’s first five days in theaters.

However, this time around, the film has a brand new cast of characters, is set in a new location, and includes some new, mutated dinosaur hybrid monsters. After the events of the last <em>Jurassic World</em> trilogy, dinosaurs have mostly died out and are now only found on islands around the equator. A team of mercenaries and a stranded family land on one particular island that has giant dinos, where the plan is to grab their blood to create a powerful new medicine. But things don’t go as planned, and people get eaten. </p><p>The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, but fans seem to love it. Do they love it enough to help <em>Rebirth </em>hit a billion? Not sure. All of the previous <em>Jurassic World</em> movies hit a billion dollars by the end of their runs. We’ll have to wait and see if <em>Rebirth </em>matches that, but for now, it’s looking pretty likely. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-box-office-scarlett-johansson-1851785708]]></content:encoded>

It seemed to have fizzled out in early 2025, but thanks to some YouTube drama the campaign has come back to life with over a million fans voicing their support. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,196299,195410" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The resurgence began with a new video from Accursed Farms two weeks ago titled, “The end of Stop Killing Games.” In it, Scott laid out why he thought the initiative has run out of steam and was failing, laying no small part of the blame at the feet of fellow YouTuber Jason “Thor” Hall, a former Blizzard developer more commonly known by his indie studio pseudonym Pirate Software. Scott accused Hall of leveraging the latter’s big viewership to misinterpret and spread falsehoods about the “Stop Killing Games” initiative, in part by casting it as naïve and unworkable in the modern gaming landscape where always-online and server-centric releases are flopping all the time. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/comments/1emf1cr/thor_piratesoftware_posts_a_response_to_the_stop/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/comments/1emf1cr/thor_piratesoftware_posts_a_response_to_the_stop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It wasn’t the first time</a></span> Scott and Hall went into a tit-for-tat post-and-response spree on YouTube, but it may have been the most beneficial for the “Stop Killing Games” movement. Scott’s video, which elicited <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Scary_Triangle/status/1937355553447043233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Scary_Triangle/status/1937355553447043233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fresh round of debate from Hall</a></span>, netted over 750,000 views. More importantly, other big names started chiming in. Content personality Charles “Critikal” White Jr. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted about the topic in a June 24 video</a></span> that hit over 2 million views, with the entire exchange becoming ripe for YouTube’s algorithm-fueled drama industrial complex. <br></p><p>This has all helped funnel tons of signatures into the various “Stop Killing Games” petitions floating around online, the biggest of which is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Stop Destroying Videogames” European Citizens’ Initiative</a></span> which now has over 1.23 million people listed in support, and aims to “prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher.” </p><p>The hope is that more publishers will build offline modes into their games—something <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-offline-mode-deathstroke-season-4-1851715898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-offline-mode-deathstroke-season-4-1851715898"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> recently did</a></span>—or provide the tools for fan communities to support games post-shutdown, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/01/11/duelyst-open-source-counterplay-games-source-code&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/01/11/duelyst-open-source-counterplay-games-source-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as done by the makers of <em>Duelyst</em></a></span>. At the very least, the goal is to prevent companies from taking away games that people already bought by revoking licenses. The stakes of the fight, including for game preservation in general, are currently on full display with <em>Anthem</em>, the troubled but unique <em>Iron Man</em>-inspired loot shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618">that EA is now sunsetting in January 2026</a></span>. Unless something changes, no one will be able to play it ever again following that server shutdown. </p><p>The re-energized “Stop Killing Games” campaign has even elicited a full rebuttal by the European game industry lobbying group Video Games Europe, which represents all the biggest companies from Microsoft and Epic Games to Roblox and Warner Bros. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The five-page response argues</a></span> that preservation protections would, among other things,  place burdensome limits on game makers, lead to even more costs as game budgets are skyrocketing, and even create issues for player safety and privacy. </p><p> “As rightsholders and economic entities, video games companies must remain free to decide when an online game is no longer commercially viable and to end continued server support for that game. Imposing a legal obligation to continue server support indefinitely, or to develop online video games in a specific technical manner that will allow permanent use, will raise the costs and risks of developing such games,” the lobbying group claims. It also states that companies are already committed to “serious professional efforts to preserve video games.”</p><p>It lists companies investing in their own video game collections as one such effort, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://embracergamesarchive.com/about/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://embracergamesarchive.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linking to Embracer’s private archive</a></span>. What could be more reassuring than leaving the fate of preservation in the hands of one of the most ill-fated, acquisition-fueled gaming conglomerates in the industry?</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/stop-killing-games-accursed-farms-piratesoftware-eu-1851785707]]></content:encoded>
