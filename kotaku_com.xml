              <p>We’re now a full week out from Black Friday, but it looks like someone forgot to tell Sony. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Pro on sale for $101 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This latest model of the console has recently been priced as high as $750, but for the holiday season, you can grab the system of just $649.</a></p>
<h2>The PS5 Has No Games</h2>
<p data-start="136" data-end="775">Alrighty, we all love to go online and make jokes. The recurring meme around the PS5 is that the system “has no games.” It’s become a tired bit at this point. When you step back from the jokes and actually look at what the console has to offer several years into its lifespan, the idea that the PS5 is starving for content just doesn’t hold up. While it would have been nice to have a more exclusives, the current library is anything but empty.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The PS5 Has Tons of Games</h2>
<p data-start="777" data-end="1567">A standout title of this generation is Ghost of Yōtei. This visually striking and mechanically tight action game that showcases the PS5’s graphical and performance capabilities better than anything in its wake. Then there’s Returnal, a fast-paced third-person shooter with roguelike elements that blends frenetic combat with an eerie atmosphere reminiscent of classic Metroid titles. It’s challenging, stylish, and moody. Gotta love it. And of course, Astro Bot marks a triumphant return to the 3D mascot platformer, a genre we’ve been missing for far too long. This game is a charming, heartfelt celebration of PlayStation’s history, packed with creativity from start to finish. The game’s quality and infectious fun earned it the title of 2024’s <em data-start="1508" data-end="1526">Game of the Year</em> at The Game Awards—well-deserved.</p>


<p data-start="1569" data-end="2375">If you happened to skip the PlayStation 4 generation entirely, the PS5 becomes an even more enticing system. You’ll find a treasure trove of beloved titles waiting to be experienced for the first time, with some receiving enhancements specifically for Sony’s latest console. Games like The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II continue to dominate discussions about storytelling in video games. The first entry is widely regarded as one of the strongest narratives the medium has ever produced, while the second remains divisive—but passionately defended by many fans who appreciate its bold thematic choices. Regardless of where you ultimately land, both games offer emotionally charged journeys through a post-apocalyptic world that became iconic enough to inspire a major HBO adaptation. Worth checking out at the very least.</p>
<p data-start="2377" data-end="2801">For players who want access to a large back catalog without purchasing every title individually, PlayStation Plus Premium is an excellent gateway. The subscription grants access to hundreds of games spanning multiple PlayStation generations. You can dive into acclaimed modern titles like Control, Kingdom Hearts III, and Final Fantasy VII Remake, as well as older classics that shaped the platform’s legacy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-clip-5-takes-another-price-drop-after-black-friday-to-clear-out-its-bluetooth-speaker-inventory-2000650863</link>

              <p>If you missed snapping up a powerful speaker with bold sound from a known brand during Black Friday, Amazon is offering another chance to save big.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">We just spotted the ultra-portable JBL Clip 5 going for $57 at Amazon, after the retailer slashed 29% off its usual (and already affordable) $80 price tag.</a> This deal applies to the classic black model. If you’re looking for something with a bit more personality, several other options are going for less, too. The stunning red and the beautiful blue, for instance, are sitting at $60, after a sweet $10 discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy a three-month free trial of Amazon Music with your purchase, which is going to make vibing and jamming a lot more fun. The only catch is that the deal is selling out fast. If you’ve been after a reliable, lightweight speaker, now is the time to act before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to Carry Around</h2>
<p>This portable speaker features a compact frame and includes a fully integrated carabiner with a much wider opening. Slip your fingers through to carry it around, hook it to your backpack, or just toss it in your purse and get going. Since it’s quite lightweight, it doesn’t add unnecessary bulk, either.</p>
<p>Of course, small size doesn’t mean average performance; this speaker punches well above its weight. There’s a powerful driver and passive radiator for bigger, louder JBL Pro Sound with deep, rich bass that brings all your favorite tunes to life. It’s great for energy-filled songs, plus catching up on podcasts on the go. You can even pair it with your laptop or phone while streaming shows for a room-filling, immersive audio experience. Installing the JBL app takes the experience even further by letting you choose between audio options, tweak sound settings, install the latest updates, and more. The speaker is quite strong on its own, but you can always pair two of these with Auracast for an even bigger setup. Planning to host a fun gathering this New Year’s? Ask a friend to bring theirs and enjoy your own mini concert right there in your backyard.</p>



<p>The party goes all night with Clip 5’s strong battery that offers up to 12 hours of playtime on a single. Running low, but don’t want to stop the music? Hit the Playtime Boost to add up to three more hours to your playtime. Translation? Non-stop fun all night (and the next day) long. You can take out on your off-road adventures without a worry. Speaking of off-road adventures, the speaker is made to handle all weather and environmental conditions. This exceptional durability comes from its IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating. A few water splashes by the pool or a couple of drops in the sand at the beach won’t hurt the functionality.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been after a power speaker in a portable design that doesn’t put a dent in your wallet, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">the JBL Clip 5 is a great option to consider. Amazon is offering it for just $58 today, making the upgrade much more affordable</a>. You’ll also get 90 days free of Amazon Music with your purchase, which gets you instant access to thousands of ad-free songs, ad-free podcasts, offline downloads, and more. It even offers one free audiobook from Audible’s large catalog every month. After the free trial, your subscription will continue at $11 per month ($10 for Prime members), if you choose to keep it.</p>

            <guid>1374367</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is your Christmas tree missing a little bling? It’s time to add some smart lighting to brighten it up. Govee makes some of our favorite solutions out there, and we just spotted its smart RGBIC Christmas tree lights going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/">On a regular day, these lights would run you around $140, but the retailer just slashed the price by 36%, offering them for just $90 right now</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen them drop to in a long while. It was also originally a Black Friday discount, which managed to survive the main event. You’ll enjoy free delivery on your purchase, which ultimately brings the total down even further. Snap it up quickly, though. Christmas is just around the corner, and we’re expecting these lights to be a popular pick, so both the discount and the stock could run out soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>The box includes 24 string lights, with a total of 480 LED beads. Each line is 6.6ft long and features 20 LEDs, making it great for most trees from 6.5ft to 8ft. There’s an 11.5ft power line attached, which allows you to place the lights anywhere without feeling limited. Installation couldn’t be simpler. The lights come with everything you need to put these up, including mounting rings, bar support, cable ties, and U-shaped straps.</p>
<p>Once up, the upgraded LED design, paired with the densely arranged beads, makes for a much smoother, uniform lighting effect. You can choose from 16 million color options (you read that right), plus over 60 versatile preset modes that have something appropriate for every occasion. If you already have a vision in mind, go DIY using the dedicated app, picking your own colors and styles. You can overlap layers, draw a sketch on the app to get specific patterns on the lights, edit patterns, or share your ideas with the AI bot to create unique effects. Don’t have the time for all of that? The preset modes make it easy to choose one within seconds. The Christmas lighting show, for instance, is bright and offers a nice mix of holiday-appropriate colors. Similarly, the “New Year’s” mode is a bit more vibrant, while the “Winter Warm” option brings cozy energy into your space.</p>



<p>The timer section in the app lets you create specific schedules for your lights. There’s a Sleep option to dim them, and a Wake Up to turn them on gradually. What’s more, the lights can also turn on when you clap your hands. Turn it into a game and see who can light them all up in the shortest time!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about these smart lights that can be used for multiple events. You can pick from a range of colors and preset modes, which means you’re no longer stuck with the basic yellow lighting. Maybe go for something bright during the day, and switch to warmer tones at night; the possibilities are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/"> Amazon is now letting you grab them for just $90, after taking a whopping 36% off their retail price.</a> Make sure you act fast to grab them, because we’re not expecting the discount or the stock to last long. That said, there are plenty of other lighting solutions by Govee going for less, as well. Now is a great time to stock up on everything you’ve had your eyes on, before the prices shoot back up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fans Think Mario Kart World Might Get A Big Donkey Kong DLC Any Day Now]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-dlc-donkey-kong-bananza-game-awards-2000650892</link>
            <guid>1374361</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been six months since <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> launched alongside the Switch 2. There have been some notable patches during that time but no big content updates. Could the game’s first paid DLC be right around the corner? Here’s why some fans think so and why it will feature tie-ins to <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>.</p> <p>Before we go on, here’s a spoiler warning for those who haven’t finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> yet.</p>  <p>So, Nintendo Today news app <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong">dataminers</a> recently discovered an interesting entry for December 15 (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/im-convinced-nintendo-might-be-gearing-up-for-a-mario-kart-world-dlc-announcement-as-it-prepares-to-spotlight-a-donkey-kong-bananza-character-its-been-refusing-to-publicly-acknowledge-since-launch/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). It’s an animation featuring <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/File:NT_Day_15_DK.mp4">King K. Rool</a>. He’s a familiar enough Nintendo character at this point, even making it into <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, but the post is also clearly a nod to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza,</em> in which the reptile serves as <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-ending-final-boss-odyssey-1851787178">the surprise final boss</a>. While King K. Rool has been in <em>Smash Bros.</em>, he’s never been in a <em>Mario Kart</em> before.</p>

 <p>What makes this theory extra convincing is that <em>Mario Kart World</em> and<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> already share <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/">credits for two voice actors</a>: Yuu Hayashi (Void Kong) and Tsuguo Mogami (King K. Rool). Those two characters are obviously in<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. They are not in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Yet. Hmmm.</p>

 <p>Adding fuel to the speculation is a lot of other circumstantial stuff, like the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards</a>, where Nintendo has often announced big DLCs in the past, is right around the corner, and the base version of<em> Mario Kart World</em> is surprisingly light on costumes and music for <em>Donkey Kong</em>. With Nintendo making such a big push behind the big ape—a big launch year exclusive for the Switch 2, <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">a rumored movie spin-off</a>, and a remaster of an old Wii game—it wouldn’t be shocking to see the first big Mario Kart World expansion be DK-themed.</p>

 <p>Diddy Kong, for example, has been in and out of the series <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-mario-kart-games-worst-to-best-1842892038">since <em>Double Das</em>h</a>. He didn’t launch with <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> but was later added in the Booster Pass Course DLCs. Funky Kong, too. I would expect them and more to get added <em>eventually</em>. Now, whether that’s this month or farther down the road is a different question. December totally makes sense for <em>Mario Kart World</em> DLC, but Nintendo doesn’t always do something just because it makes sense.</p> <p>And if we read into every little Nintendo Today news app drop like this, well, fans would be expecting all sorts of wild announcements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splitgate 2 Launched, Flopped, Unlaunched, Relaunched, And Renamed All In The Same Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-arena-shooter-beta-1047-games-2000650903</link>
            <guid>1374316</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Splitgate 2</i>, the “what-if-<i>Halo</i>-but-also-<i>Portal</i>” shooter, had <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742">a rocky launch</a> this year following a controversial Summer Game Fest appearance and aggressive monetization practices. But the game is hoping to open a new chapter with players after it went <i>back</i> into beta status in July 2025, after launching just a month prior. It’s marking that new chapter with a name change. The game will now be known as <i>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</i>. A promotional video describes it as being rebuilt “from the ground up.”</p> <p>He’s changed, babe. For real this time.</p> <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/hrcUZ_F7vX8">a video posted</a> to the official <i>Splitgate</i> YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-returning-to-beta-splitgate-2-is-coming-back-with-a-new-name">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), 1047 Games’ design director Josh Watson describes the game as a tribute to classic arena shooters such as <i>Unreal</i>, <i>Quake</i>, and of course, <i>Halo</i>. To that end, <i>Splitgate </i>has ejected factions and unique abilities to hopefully lock into that old-school arena style gameplay, just with fancy portals. The full experience is expected to launch for free on December 17, 2025. Check out the gameplay <a href="https://youtu.be/hrcUZ_F7vX8">here</a>:</p>

   <p><i>Splitgate</i> managed to really step in it this summer after director Ian Proulx took to the Summer Game Fest stage in 2025 to deliver <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">an obtuse rant about the state of modern shooters</a>, all while sporting a “Make FPS Great Again” hat. As if that wasn’t enough, <i>Splitgate 2</i> featured many uncomfortable trappings of modern shooters: aggressive microtransactions and costly cosmetic bundles. And for a game that promised to return to a classic style of shooter gameplay, the inclusion of a battle royale mode was odd.</p>

 <p>As such, the release of the sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-preview-impressions-1851624294">didn’t go over well with fans</a>. In response, 1047 Games pulled its shooter back into an indefinite beta status to rework the experience five months ago. Whether it will be enough to smooth things over with folks remains to be seen.</p> <p><i>Splitgate</i> impressed early on in 2019 with its fusion of classic arena shooter gameplay with portal shenanigans. They could be prone to gimmicky plays, but tossing portals into the mess of traditional arena-shooter action often proved to be a nice change of pace. Let’s see if its second emergence from beta and the new name will be enough for the sequel to make waves again.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roku-goes-into-clearance-mode-on-streambar-and-subwoofer-bundle-at-record-low-while-amazon-fire-tv-soundbar-returns-to-full-price-2000650673</link>
            <guid>1374313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="138" data-end="634">Still got a “dumb” TV lacking all the smart features we’ve seen become a standard over the last decade? No need to upgrade just yet if it’s still working fine. Maybe just need to bring it into the modern age with the help of a Roku. They’re budget-friendly and simple to set up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/">And conveniently enough, Amazon is currently offering the Roku 4K HDR Streambar SE and Wireless Bass Bundle at a 35% discount.</a> It’s usually listed at $230, but for a short period you can grab it for only $150—meaning you keep an extra $80 in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="636" data-end="1261">Whether you’re trying to start streaming on a non-smart TV or you’re just not a fan of your smart TV’s clunky interface (looking at you, LG), plugging a Roku into one of your free HDMI ports is can make for a better experience. You’ll be able to access all the apps you rely on to stay caught up with new releases. Every Roku streaming device includes Bluetooth support and works with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, letting it smoothly integrate into your broader smart home setup. Its remote also features a built-in voice assistant, making it simple to search for whatever content you’re looking for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1263" data-end="1704">And speaking of the remote, it’s rechargeable, so you no longer need to stock AAAs. The backlit buttons make it easy to navigate in dim lighting without the usual fumbling around. Of course, you can also just say “Hey Roku” and control everything via voice commands instead. If the remote ever goes missing, Roku even provides a lost-remote finder. Though, it’s probably slipped somewhere between your couch cushions. Maybe just check there.</p>
<p data-start="1706" data-end="2210">The home screen is completely customizable, allowing you to keep your preferred streaming apps front and center. An interesting bonus—Roku actually has its own original programming. Alongside the apps you already subscribe to like Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, and Max, you can switch over to enjoy Roku’s free original series such as <em>Dinner Budget Showdown</em>, <em>Celebrity Family Food Battle</em>, <em>Martha Cooks</em>, and <em>Emeril Cooks</em>. I promise, there’s more than only cooking shows. I just have food on the mind.</p>


<h2>Better Sound</h2>
<p>This holiday season bundle isn’t the standard Roku streamer. This is a multimedia player and speaker in one. This Roku soundbar sits under your TV so you can enjoy upgraded sound with all your shows and movies. The soundbar—or Streambar, rather—is both your sound output and the source of the Roku interface itself. It just needs to plug into your TV over HDMI and you’re set.</p>
<p>The bundle is also throwing in the Roku Wireless Bass. This can kick your already great sound up a notch by bringing a subwoofer into the mix.</p>
<p>Go grab some snacks and let everyone know that the next movie night will be happening in your living room—<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/">thanks to the Roku Streambar SE and Wireless Bass bundle, now available for just $150</a>. I’d recommend putting that $70 you’re saving toward a popcorn machine.</p>

              <p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was an actor that everyone would immediately recognize, but perhaps many would struggle to name. Known best for his portrayal of Shang Tsung in 1995’s ridiculous <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie, and then for voicing the character in the games since 2013, Tagawa had multiple other defining roles across an extraordinary career. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a> he died on December 4, following complications from a stroke.</p> <p>It’s hard to think of a more iconic role than Shang Tsung, the evil sorcerer in Paul W.S. Anderson’s hokey and adored 1995 adaptation of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> video game series, as well as 2013’s web series <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy</em>&nbsp;(then once more in 2015’s <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Mortal_Kombat_X:_Generations_(lost_production_material_for_unreleased_web_series_based_on_game_franchise;_2015)">abandoned promotional web series, <em>Mortal Kombat X: Generations</em></a>). But Tagawa had broad range, known more recently for his leading role as the noble and conflicted Nobusuke Tagomi in Amazon’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, as well as roles as diverse as Krull in Tim Burton’s <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, Hiroki Watanabe in&nbsp;<em>Lost in Space</em>, and multiple guest roles on a number of popular TV series. He also displayed a splendid lack of brand loyalty when he appeared in 2010’s atrocious movie version of <em>Tekken</em>! (As well as its straight-to-video sequel.)</p>

 <p>Tagawa was also a voice actor, portraying Valco in <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, The Swordmaker in Netflix’s animation <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>, and Alrich Wren in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Rebels</em>, among many others. He was a contributor to video game voice roles, too, again most notably reprising his role as Shang Tsung in various <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, including&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> and its various DLCs. The actor is also heard in <em>World of Warcraft: Legion</em>, and 2003’s <em>Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu</em> as the eponymous criminal. Oh, and rather brilliantly, he appeared in the extraordinary mess of 1997’s FMV game <em>Soldier Boyz</em>, a game that claimed to be co-directed by Darren Aronofsky, given the footage was lifted from an HBO TV show.</p> <p>The Toyko-born actor trained in martial arts as a child, before studying karate at university. His first movie appearance was Bernardo Bertolucci’s Oscar-winning <em>The Last Emperor </em>in 1987, before going on to appear in 150 other roles. Tagawa died on Thursday morning, surrounded by his family, aged 75. RIP.</p>
