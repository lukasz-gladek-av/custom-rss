              <p><span>As rumors </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-dlc-zerrikania-expansion-rumor-2000658222"><span>continue to swirl</span></a><span> about the possibility of a new mystery DLC for </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span>, modders have </span><span>beaten CD Projekt RED to the punch with a new fan-made Ciri story quest. It’s even set in the same region as </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>: the mountainous kingdom of Kovir and Poviss. “We got </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> before</span><i><span> The Witcher 4,” </span></i><span>as one Nexus Mods user puts it.</span></p> <p>As fans wait for news of CD Projekt Red’s next open-world RPG, <span>modder Alexander Fandera-Maslov was able to finish the unofficial </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> tie-in project called </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11831?tab=description"><i><span>Dawn over Kovir</span></i></a> (via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-extra-dlc-chat-lingers-the-witcher-3-gets-a-witcher-4-inspired-quest-mod-designed-to-give-you-a-taste-of-ciris-adventures-in-kovir"><em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em></a>). The <span>mod was “inspired by </span><i><span>The Witcher 4’s</span></i><span> Cinematic Reveal Trailer” and thus puts players into the shoes of Geralt’s surrogate daughter as she embarks on her own world-weary monster-hunting journey.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>According to Fandera, the mod will take roughly “between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours to complete,” and tasks players with a new custom-made quest in the mountainous Northern kingdom full of mines. </span><i><span>Dawn over Kovir</span></i><span> doesn’t feature English voice acting, but English subtitles are available. Fandera says that an upcoming 1.0 update “will refine animations and gameplay components, and add voice acting.” Hopefully it doesn’t use generative AI to make that happen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It could be a nice distraction to tide fans over until CD Projekt Red releases something new in the world of <em>The Witcher</em>. </span><span>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski claimed on January 7 via </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a> <span>that he is “100 percent certain CDPR will release significant new content this year” in order to close the gap in its current sales incentive program. Speculation based on those claims and other alleged leads have suggested that a DLC, if it ends up existing, could serve as a sort of bridge between the events of the last game and </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p>That game doesn’t sound set to come out for <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310">another year or two at the earliest</a>. Meanwhile, CD Projekt Red is currently working on bringing mods to the console versions of<em> The Witcher 3</em>. Even if the alleged mystery DLC doesn’t turn out to be real, players will still be able to give <em>Dawn over Kovir</em> a try for themselves on console soon enough.</p>
