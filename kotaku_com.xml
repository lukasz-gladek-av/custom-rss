              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-last-us-god-war-horizon-ghost-1851784665"><span>PlayStation: The Concert</span></a><span>, an orchestral show featuring music from games such as </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, and more, was scheduled to begin the American leg of its tour this week with a show at Williamsport’s Community Arts Center. However, it seems like the tour might be collapsing in on itself days before the first show, as Sony has started canceling performances without explanation.</span></p> <p><span>The show’s </span><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/playstation-the-concert-tickets/artist/3244629"><span>Ticketmaster page</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-quietly-cancels-remaining-playstation-the-concert-2025-tour-dates-in-the-us/"><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>) lists several of its remaining 2025 shows as canceled, with tickets for only a few still for sale. To some extent, this isn’t much of a surprise, as the concert series had already canceled </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-the-concert-is-reportedly-cancelling-numerous-tour-dates-and-delaying-others/"><span>several of its UK shows earlier this year</span></a><span> and pushed them to next summer. Right now, it looks like most of the US cancellations are just that, rather than postponements to another date. I checked some of the listings that have yet to be officially canceled on the site, but I was still met with an error message saying tickets were no longer available on Ticketmaster. At the moment, the concert’s 2026 dates remain largely untouched on Ticketmaster’s website.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has yet to explain the reasoning behind the cancellations, but we have reached out for comment and will update this story if we hear back. Some speculate that poor ticket sales may have played a part, as some attendees noted </span><a href="https://x.com/Hazzehh/status/1914836561402744976"><span>a lot of empty seats at their shows</span></a><span>, though other performances </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magictreehouse.bsky.social/post/3lnj7g35t7s2x"><span>look pretty packed</span></a><span>. I wouldn’t be surprised if, even with the PlayStation branding, the show wasn’t drawing a lot of people in because it seemed very fixated on the PlayStation 4 and 5 era, spotlighting games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, rather than making a show that encompassed a wide spread of the brand’s history. I feel like a dedicated show for any of those franchises would have pulled in crowds, but when you put them all under one umbrella and the whole thing seems like an ahistorical account of PlayStation history, I can see why people might not be flocking to buy tickets. It also doesn’t help that Sony didn’t have a huge marketing push behind the tour. I frankly forgot that it was coming up, and I was supposed to go to the Madison Square Garden show.</span></p>

 <p><strong>Update, 10/6/25 at 11:45 a.m.:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>GEA Live, the company behind the PlayStation Concert, has released the following statement to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is with great regret that we have cancelled the PlayStation | The Concert tour in North America. Our team has spent a considerable amount of time developing this project, and we share in the disappointment of fans who will no longer be able to attend. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported the show and appreciate your understanding in making this difficult decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Though the initial statement reads as if the rest of the North American tour has been canceled, GEA Live representatives clarified in a follow-up statement that it specifically refers to the 2025 dates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Oh hey, a new <i>Call of Duty </i>is on the horizon. This time it’s <i>Black Ops</i> season (even though we just had one of those), and to help them fine-tune its competitive action and the overall ebb and flow of its speedy combat (as well as to test the game’s anti-cheat tech), developers Treyarch and Raven Software ran a beta for those with an active pre-order over the weekend.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271"><i>BLOPS7</i> aims to be a very fast</a>, bouncy shooter of a game, with players granted the ability to jump off walls much like they could in <i>Titanfall</i>. It looked super fun in motion during the multiplayer reveal last week, but now that folks have finally been able to pour into the lobbies and get some matches in, how did it all work out?</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271"><i>Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7</i> Shows Off Everything Coming To Multiplayer At Launch</a></p> <p>TL;DR: The community is really upset over doors; TTK rates might be a touch too high; no one will ever be satisfied with SBMM; and <i>Battlefield</i> threatens to eat <i>COD</i>’s lunch for the first time in a long while.</p>

 <h2>Cheaters got the boot (most of ‘em, anyway)</h2> <p>This weekend’s beta was a perfect opportunity for <i>Call of Duty</i>’s anti-cheat initiative, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-beta-cheaters-cod-blops-black-ops-7-ban-secure-boot-ricochet-2000630268">Team Ricochet</a>, to test out their defenses. And from the sounds of things, cheaters had a hard time getting into matches. TMP 2.0, along with whatever other magic Team Ricochet is using to block cheaters, <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/article/1974942752485077132">appears to have caught 97 percent</a> of cheaters “within 30 minutes of their first sign-in,” with “fewer than one-percent of cheating attempts reach[ing] a match, and those that did were removed within minutes.”</p>

 <h2>SBMM, the eternal debate</h2> <p>Discourse over skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) was at the heart of last weekend’s beta, with a mode that specifically sought to avoid this controversial form of matchmaking. SBMM aims to make sure you’re matched with other random players of similar skill level. Sounds good in theory, but in practice it tends to be a bit of a tricky situation, especially if you’re playing with a friend who’s of a different skill level than you, resulting in unfair pairings. It can also make games feel more competitive and sweaty when some folks are just looking for a chill set of rounds.</p>

   <p>The debate over SBMM is sure to rage on, but Treyarch and Raven seem to be aware that not everyone’s a fan. During the beta, “<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes#oct4">Open Moshpit” was introduced</a> to let folks jump into matches where “skill consideration is drastically reduced.”</p>

 <h2>Time-to-kill rates and those frakin’ doors!</h2> <p>Time-to-kill (TTK), the average amount of time it takes a player to die while being shot, would appear to be pretty speedy in <i>BLOPS7</i>. Perhaps too speedy. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes#oct3">The devs are aware</a> that folks are finding they die a bit too quickly right now, and so they’ll be “releasing a weapon balance patch in the coming days to adjust TTK and ensure all weapons available in the beta are competitive.”</p>

 <p>Quick deaths weren’t the only issue some folks had. Doors, it would seem, really got under some players’ skin. Though doors in <i>BLOPS7</i> maps are automatic (they can be shot to open them too), they don’t stay open, and the interruption of sightlines and the unwelcome surprise of running into someone you didn’t expect runs counter to the flow of gameplay many folks expect from <i>COD</i>. (Previous games saw doors stay open during a match.)</p>  <p>There aren’t too many doors, however. Treyarch reports that just five of its 16v16 maps currently have them. Still, the team is looking to possibly reduce that number, with an option to disable them in private matches.</p> <h2>The <i>Battlefield</i>-sized elephant in the room</h2> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/the-black-ops-7-beta-introduced-a-mode-without-sbmm-and-call-of-duty-players-are-psyched-we-need-battlefield-6-to-come-out-every-year/">reported by <i>GamesRadar</i></a>, the upcoming <i>Battlefield 6</i>, which is shaping up to be somewhat of a return-to-form for the beleaguered military shooter franchise, seems to be spooking Treyarch and Activision a bit. That the devs even considered removing SBMM via Open Mosphit, according to some, is proof that <i>COD</i>’s gonna do whatever it takes to try and offer an alternative to the allure of <i>Battlefield</i>.</p> <p>At the very least, it should be entertaining to see where this arms race between <i>Battlefield</i> and <i>COD</i> will go as we near the release of both games. <i>Battlefield 6</i> arrives on October 10, 2025, with <i>Black Ops 7</i> following it a month later on November 14.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft ramped up the price of its current-gen consoles. The 512GB Xbox Series S jumped up from $300 to $380, with all the models above it seeing similar price hikes. Well, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Microsoft is at it again</a> as the company decided to tack on an extra $20 to make it an even $400 as of October 3. This comes alongside the announcement that the various levels of Xbox Game Pass are getting some light rebranding along with, you guessed it, price increases. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">However, looks like someone forgot to tell Amazon because right now, you can score the 512GB Xbox Series S for just $329.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">This Xbox gaming consoles comes packed with one controller and an internal storage of 512GB</a>. A full 1TB version is available but that one is not on sale at the moment. This game system is disc-free meaning all the games you play will need to be downloaded onto the consoles or onto an external SSD which can be purchased separately. Some games are avail to be streamed from the cloud with the right Game Pass subscription as well.</p>
<p>The console does not support 4K gaming, but it still produces a resolution higher than the standard HD, rendering at 1440p. Through apps and streaming subscriptions like Netflix, HBO MAc, and Disney Plus, you can enjoy TV and movies in full 4K. It’s got HDR support to really make sure those dark spots stay dark and that vibrant colors brightly pop. A game like the newly released <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> looks awesome in HDR on a proper screen as so much of that game exists in solid black areas with radiant colors sprinkled throughout.</p>



<p>You can even play&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>for free with a subscription to Xbox Game Pass. This does come with the small caveat of that price jump announced earlier this week. The top tier of this video game subscription service just went up from $20 a month to $30. A 50% price increase to the premiere game service alongside price increased for consoles across the board doesn’t exactly feel great. There are however some great titles on the Essential tier of Game Pass which is just $10 per month. On that tier you’ll find games like&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>,&nbsp;<em>Psychonauts 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tunic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>. You may not be getting day one first party launches there but there is a deep treasure trove of awesome titles waiting to be played.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo 15.6″ Laptop (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) Crashes to Nearly Free After 82% Cut, Early Prime Day Exclusive]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-giving-away-this-brand-new-loaded-2199-lenovo-laptop-for-practically-nothing-2000631661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-15-6%E2%80%B3-laptop-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-crashes-to-nearly-free-after-82-cut-early-prime-day-exclusive.1317496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When is something both overpriced and a massive bargain? When it’s a brand-new 15.6-inch FHD Lenovo laptop with an Intel N4500 processor, and Windows 11 Professional pre-installed, and it has a kinda-crazy original price tag that’s marked down in a <em>huge</em> way at Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">This limited-time deal knocks 82% from the (overpriced) $2,199 original cost to a (massive bargain) $400.</a></p>
<p>Toss that original price and look at what the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 packs into a $400 package, and the quality of this Amazon deal becomes obvious very quickly. Simply, this is a stalwart everyday laptop that can handle serious work while giving you ample options to play. Lenovo’s longstanding reputation for building durable laptops enhances the broad appeal of the IdeaPad 1 for professionals, students, or just casual PC users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid as a Rock</h2>
<p>From end to end, everything about the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 speaks to absolute reliability. There are faster laptops, there are laptops with more memory than the IdeaPad 1’s 16GB of RAM and more storage than the IdeaPad 1’s 512GB — although both are easily and inexpensively expanded — and there are laptops with bigger and more spectacular displays. But the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 isn’t lacking anywhere — the Intel Celeron N4500 processor can reach 2.8GHz in speed, the FHD display (1920 x 1080 resolution) has anti-glare treatment, and the Intel UHD Graphics chip pairs with the monitor to deliver a solid and reliable performance.</p>
<p>When it’s time to put the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 to the test with a video conference or video call, it comes ready with a 720p HD webcam with built-in Privacy Shutter, and two Dolby Audio speakers. The rest of your everyday productivity is made easy by the preloaded Windows 11 Professional OS, which includes Microsoft Copilot for an ultra-fast AI assist whenever you need it.</p>



<h2>Connections For All</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad 1 has all the connections you need, and perhaps even more. Start with the Wi-Fi 6 11ax 2×2 and Bluetooth 5.2 hookups that make your browsing and streaming life a cinch, and the USB ports — a 2.0 Type-A, a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C for fast data transfers — HDMI 1.4b port, and card reader present all the options you need for peripherals and external monitors.</p>
<p>We’re not really sure who came up with the original $2,199 price tag on this Lenovo 15.6-inch IdeaPad 1. It’s certainly not a price we’d ever recommend for an exceptionally solid and reliable laptop from a leading manufacturer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">But for just $400 after Amazon’s jaw-dropping 82%-off limited-time discount? </a>We’re all in on that.</p>
