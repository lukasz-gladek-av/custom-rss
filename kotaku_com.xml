              <p>The first half of the Switch 2’s first year is in the books. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188">Here’s how we graded it back in December</a>. But now Nintendo’s latest earnings report is here to offer some hard numbers on how the Mario maker’s current next-gen platform shift is going. TL;DR: Incredibly strongly, though it’s still searching for that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">runaway hit no one can shut up about</a>.</p> <p>This week <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_3e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk="tooltip_parent">the company announced</a> it had sold 7 million Switch 2 consoles during the 2025 holiday period, bringing the lifetime sales up to 17 million for the first six months. Meanwhile the original Switch sold an additional 1.36 million units, with another 750,000 expected to sell through the end of the current fiscal year on March 31, 2026.</p>

 <p>The original Switch has now cleared the lifetime total of 154 million set by the DS, officially making it the company’s most popular console ever. At the same time, it now seems unlikely to actually eclipse the PlayStation 2 as the most popular console ever. At 155 current lifetime sales, the OG Switch would need to find another 5 million sales in the couch cushions somewhere <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733">to beat the PS2’s 160 million</a>.&nbsp;Here are the other interesting takeaways from Nintendo’s latest earnings:</p> <h2>&nbsp;Digital is king on Switch 2</h2> <p>While digital sales remain increasingly dominant, physical game sales usually tick up during the holiday as people gift each other games. Well, for the Switch 2’s first holiday, digital sales did way better than expected. Nintendo reported a 14.7 percent increase year-over-year. It attributed that “mainly due to an increase in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software and add-on content.” And this excludes people buying the digital version of <em>Mario Kart World</em> via the Switch 2 bundle. The proportion of packaged software that was sold in downloadable versions in holiday 2024 was 56 percent. In 2025 it was 58.7 percent.</p>

 <h2>Switch 2 is still wildly outperforming the Switch</h2> <p>While Nintendo reports a slower holiday than expected for the console in the U.S., demand in Japan has been exceeding Nintendo’s expectations and the Switch 2 continues to outpace its predecessor by a healthy margin. It’s outsold the original Switch during the six-month launch window by nearly two to one. Of course, the Switch 2 has the benefit of the holiday season being in that launch period, while the original Switch launched in the spring as opposed to the summer. Still, it shows people are hungry for the upgrade.</p>

 <h2>Annual playing users are actually down though</h2> <p>Weirdly, despite launching a long-awaited, highly anticipated new console in 2025, Nintendo actually ended the year with fewer annual players than it had in 2024. That number, which includes anyone with an account who played a game at some point in the past 12 months, peaked at 130 million in 2024 and ticked back down to 129 million in December. That suggests that while Switch 2 is converting existing players to the new hardware, the push hasn’t necessarily helped expand the platform’s overall footprint.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000665377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665377"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665377">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> didn’t chart</h2> <p>Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4 </em></a>launching in December, Nintendo didn’t release any sales data for the game, a very bad sign. That suggests the game hasn’t yet cracked 1 million sales on either Switch 1 or Switch 2, even if it may have cumulative sales across both platforms may have passed that benchmark. On the one hand, that’s not shocking. <em>Metroid</em> has never been a big seller for Nintendo. On the other hand, it suggests that we might not get a new <em>Metroid Prime</em> anytime soon, and that players weren’t rushing to make it their big Switch 2 blockbuster for the holiday. Total software sold is up compared to the Switch 1, but the overall attach rate is lower, likely because Switch 2 owners already have a huge backwards-compatible Switch 1 library to pull from.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 is missing a big new hit</h2> <p>Nintendo has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">14 million copies</a> of <em>Mario Kart World</em> but that includes the Switch 2 console bundles. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is doing great for a Switch 2 exclusive at 4.25 million sales but hasn’t yet proven if it can do<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em> numbers.<em> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> has sold over 11 million copies, including nearly 4 million on Switch 2. And even <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> broke 1 million sales. That’s about where the Switch 1’s launch lineup was at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmiiboCanada/comments/79o6oa/summary_of_switch_sales_from_nintendo_q22017/">after its first six months</a>, but that didn’t include Christmas or <em>Mario Odyssey</em>. The Switch 1 finished its first year with multiple first-party games breaking the 5 million sales mark, and so far the Switch 2 doesn’t seem likely to match that without a big surprise announcement or two in the next six months.</p>

              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">Avowed</a> </em>and <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> were some of the best games released in 2025. We over here at <em>Kotaku</em> liked<em> Avowed</em> so much that we called it one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161">12 best games released last year</a>. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> was my personal game of the year. A lot of other critics liked both of these Obsidian Entertainment-developed RPGs, too. But according to Obsidian, all that acclaim didn’t translate to big sales.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">In a new feature from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> about Obsidian’s big year–the studio launched three games in 2025–there’s some bad news about two of those releases. According to Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart, <em>Avowed</em> and <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> didn’t meet expectations.</p>

 <p>“They’re not disasters,” Urquhart told the outlet. “I’m not going to say this was a kick in the teeth. It was more like: ‘That sucks. What are we learning?’” The disappointing sales for these two semi-open-world RPGs have Urquhart thinking “a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take.” Both games took over six years to develop. Moving forward, Urquhart wants to cut down dev time to three to four years.</p> <p>Meanwhile <em>Grounded 2,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/grounded-2-obsidian-eidos-xbox-unreal-engine-halo-2000617443">a game developed primarily by Eidos</a>, took around three years to develop and has ended up being a massive success for Obsidian. Yet another example of how it isn’t necessary to spend most of a decade making a game for it to sell millions of copies.&nbsp; It is also likely that the ongoing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175">large-scale BDS-connected No Games For Genocide boycott of Xbox</a> over its connections to Israel and the country’s horrific attacks on Palestinians caused all of Obsidian’s games to sell fewer copies.</p>

 <p>As for the future, Obsidian has no plans to develop <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 3</em> after the sequel failed to sell as well as expected. The RPG studio did confirm with <em>Bloomberg</em> that it is working on new content for <em>The Outer Worlds 2,</em> and future games will be made that take place in the same universe as <em>Avowed </em>(which shares a setting with the <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>games).</p>

 <p>“Our job, all of us here, is to go make games that people want to play and buy,” said Urquhart, “and if we continue to do that, then we have a solid business.”</p>
