            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Big changes are coming to Discord next month. The company behind one of the most popular voice and chat services on the planet announced that all new and existing Discord users will soon have to prove their age via face scan or ID to gain access to the entirety of the app.</p> <p>On February 9, <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally">Discord announced</a> that as part of its “long-standing commitment to creating a safer” experience for teens, all Discord users worldwide will be shifted to a “teen-appropriate experience” by default. This change will happen in early march and once fully rolled out, it means users who can’t prove they are adults will lose access to a number of features and parts of Discord.</p>

 <p>To prove you are an adult, Discord is going to make you either upload an image of a legal ID or share a video selfie to verify age. Discord promises that all legal documents will be deleted “in most cases” immediately after the user’s age is verified and claims all selfies will never leave the user’s device. It does warn that some users might need to submit multiple pieces of information to prove their age, and there will be a method to dispute an assigned age if Discord gets it wrong. And a new age inference model will “run in the background” and will “help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age.”</p> <h2>What features you’ll lose if you have a teen account on Discord</h2> <p>So what do you lose access to if you aren’t an adult on Discord? Quite a bit, actually, though you’ll still be able to use most of the apps basic features with some restrictions. Here’s what’s being blocked or gated for teen Discord users or people who don’t verify their age.</p>

 <ul role="list"> <li><strong>Content Filters:</strong>&nbsp;Discord users will need to be age-assured as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting.</li> <li><strong>Age-gated Spaces</strong>&nbsp;– Only users who are age-assured as adults will be able to access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands.</li> <li><strong>Message Request Inbox:</strong>&nbsp;Direct messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and access to modify this setting is limited to age-assured adult users.</li> <li><strong>Friend Request Alerts:</strong>&nbsp;People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know.</li> <li><strong>Stage Restrictions:</strong>&nbsp;Only age-assured adults may speak on stage in servers.</li> </ul> <p>“Nowhere is our safety work more important than when it comes to teen users, which is why we are announcing these updates in time for Safer Internet Day,” said Savannah Badalich, head of product policy at Discord. “Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility. We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-ai-powered-age-verification-is-a-complete-mess/">This is a similar approach to how</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045"><em>Roblox</em> has rolled out its age verification system</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/age-verification-is-sweeping-the-us-activists-are-fighting-back/">follows on the heels of various laws in the United States</a> that <a href="https://nym.com/blog/porn-restrictions-by-us-state">force users to prove their age via face scan or ID to access pornographic websites</a>. The age of truly anonymous internet ended a long time ago, but this new era of face scans and age verification is something else entirely and a huge blow to privacy advocates and people who feel weird having to send a selfie to a computer to look at porn, visit a website, or send a message to a friend.</p>

            <p>You might be wondering why a video game website like <em>Kotaku</em> is writing about sports, but the connection between games and sports runs much deeper than the annual release of <em>Madden</em>. Super Bowl ads tie the year’s biggest sporting event to every facet of our culture, serving as annual conversation pieces thanks to their high-concept ideas, celebrity appearances, and big-budget production value. The event <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lvi-total-viewing-audience-estimated-at-over-208-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draws nine-figure viewership every year</a>, so whether they’re shilling chips, cars, or crypto, Super Bowl ads tend to pull out all the stops. Video game ads during the big game are no exception, and developers and publishers have put out some real standout commercials during the Super Bowl over the years. Let’s look at a few of the best (and worst) video game ads to ever grace a football intermission.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fareeha Andersen, the voice actor behind Anran, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s newest fire-wielding hero</span></a><span>, has thrown her support behind an ongoing fan movement begging Blizzard to redesign her character.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you open the comments section of just about any </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>social media post, you’ll likely see dozens if not hundreds of fans spamming comparison images of Anran as she appears in the game versus how she looked in the animated trailer for Wuyang, her younger brother and a support hero added to the game last year. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-kiriko-juno-face-edit-reaction-change-2000666138"><span>The difference is pretty stark</span></a><span>, with her original design having sharper features and a longer nose.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Anran that showed up in </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>itself looks pretty different, with a smaller nose, rounded face, and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-heroes-characters-hotter-young-skins-collab-2000665796"><span>distinct resemblance to previous heroes Kiriko and Juno</span></a><span>. This has fans calling her another example of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s “same face syndrome” in which characters, women especially, tend to all look alike.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Now that fans have gotten loud about it, Andersen has responded in a video that supports the fan movement, with her calling on Blizzard to make Anran look more like her original appearance.</span></p>   <p><span>“I got to mourn Anran between the design I had hoped for her and the design we ended up with,” Andersen says. “Because I think in her comic and the cinematic Elemental Kin, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said, ‘We are going to challenge the beauty standards plaguing—ransacking—media these days,’ right? The ozempic-chic, the ‘contour your nose, you have no nose, the tiniest nose,’ and I think because of that precedence, people feel understandably let down.”</span></p>

 <p><span>She continued, “</span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> is a trailblazer at challenging that, right? Of trying to break those molds, trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic, and I think the result we got says something else. It says something that leaves a bad taste in our mouths. It’s not the bold, optimistic swing that we know </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> to make.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Andersen says that she has shared the community’s concerns with the Blizzard team, and she hopes that they see and hear all of the feedback. She encourages others to do so as well with “boldness and kindness.” We’ve reached out to Blizzard for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <p><span>Given the massive response (seriously, you can’t look at pretty much any of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s social media channels without seeing people spamming the comments about this), I would be surprised if Blizzard doesn’t make some changes, but it’s probably not going to be overnight. Anran is currently playable as part of a testing phase before her proper launch tomorrow, February 10, alongside four other heroes as part of the game’s next season.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There isn’t time for Blizzard to update her look before she’s in the game but maybe in a future patch we’ll see some of those more distinct features come back.</span></p>
