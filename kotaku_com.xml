              <p>If your New Year’s resolutions for 2026 include being more productive and pushing creative boundaries, you need a solid processor by your side. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6845/">AMD’s Ryzen 7 5700G is one of the best mid-range options out there, and it’s currently discounted by 43% on Amazon.</a></p>
<p>It’s now down to $204, which is $155 off its original $359 price. It’s also tagged as Amazon’s Choice at the retailer, and is backed by thousands of great reviews from users.</p>

<h2>Impressive Performance</h2>
<p>This processor doesn’t require a dedicated graphics card. It comes with built-in Radeon graphics that are capable of handling all your everyday workloads, light gaming, and some creative tasks comfortably. This makes it great for anyone looking to upgrade an older AM4 setup without overspending.</p>
<p>Ryzen 7 5700G’s got 8 cores and 16 processing threads, plus offers boost speeds up to 4.6GHz. There’s support for DDR4-3200 memory, and the processor also comes bundled with an AMD Wraith Stealth cooler, which maintains its temperature while offering consistent performance for all your tasks. Additionally, the processor features a full suite of Ryzen technologies such as Precision Boost 2 and Precision Boost Overdrive to take the experience even further. The former intelligently raises CPU clock speeds to deliver maximum performance, while the latter pushes it further when your system can handle it. Translation? Fast speeds with strong power for heavy tasks.</p>



<p>The chip is built for the AM4 socket, so it plays nicely with a wide range of motherboards. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6845/">At just over $200, you’re getting incredible performance with stunning graphics for all your entertainment and creative tasks</a>. We highly recommend it to work professionals, creatives just starting out, and even students looking to enjoy reliable performance that doesn’t slow you down. The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime members. There are no delivery charges to worry about either, so $204 is all you’ve got to pay today.</p>
<p>That said, now is also a great time to stock up on other gaming/work essentials, as we’re spotting several solid deals across different categories. Our shopping experts are keeping an eye on the best ones worth your money and sharing worthwhile offers as they come. Be sure to check back to explore newer drops!</p>

              <p>Controllers can make or break your gaming experience. After all, you rely on these gadgets to find your way around in digital worlds, fight battles, explore, and more. If you’re experiencing persistent stick drift, poor connectivity, and unresponsiveness from your current option, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">Right now, you can grab the latest Xbox wireless gaming controller in carbon black at a sweet 25% discount for $49.</a> Several other options are discounted too, but the prices may vary. For instance, the stunning Heart Breaker version with vibrant patterns is sitting at $59, while the Shock Blue option is going for $52.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gives You a Competitive Edge</h2>
<p>The controller features a modern design with sculpted surfaces and refined geometry for enhanced comfort during gameplay. Textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case make it easy to lock onto targets and stay on them, while the new hybrid D-pad offers incredibly accurate yet familiar input that gives you a competitive edge. Additionally, if the standard layout doesn’t quite work for you, or you simply want more control over the way you play, you can also customize button mappings with the Xbox Accessories app. It lets you tweak controls according to your playstyle, offering accessibility and increased comfort, which can eventually lead to better performance.</p>
<p>Those who like to show cool in-game moves and strategies off will appreciate the new Share button, too. With this, you can take screenshots and record with just a single click. There’s a 3.5mm audio headset jack to connect headphones for easier communication, as well.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the controller plays nicely with Windows, Android, iOS, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and VR Headsets. You have the option to plug in directly via the USB-C port for a quick setup, or go wireless using Bluetooth for cable-free gaming across all your favorite devices. Maybe use it with your console for gaming on the go, and switch to a bigger screen when you want to enjoy a more immersive gaming experience, especially with friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">The console is now down to just $49, after Amazon knocked a nice $16 off its retail price.</a> Several colors are going for less, so there are options to choose from. You can pick the one that best fits your gaming aesthetics. It’s important to note that the discount is only around for a short time. We’re not expecting it to last more than a day, so it’s best to grab it as soon as you can. Once it’s gone, we can’t guarantee that the controller will be this affordable again.</p>
