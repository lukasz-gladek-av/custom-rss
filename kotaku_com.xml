              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-collaborations-survey-pokemon-star-wars-1851787277"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>‘s</span></a><span> hero design philosophy has changed since the sequel launched in 2022. With the exception of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ramattra-dive-comp-update-season-2-patch-1849870329"><span>Ramattra</span></a><span>, the robotic omnic tank who was the fourth character added to the new roster, every other hero Blizzard has added to the hero shooter has been a human, most of whom are probably considered conventionally attractive. It’s a far cry from the game that once greeted players each time they booted up the game with a speech from a talking gorilla, but it turns out, this isn’t just a coincidence; it’s a result of a new design philosophy Blizzard has adopted since </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> launched.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-story-background-wuxing-university/"><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> lead concept artist Daryl Tan explained that the team has been prioritizing characters they believe fans can make a “deeper connection with,” and that means they’re moving away from the “oddball” characters like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wrecking-ball-rework-season-10-patch-notes-1851407454"><span>Wrecking Ball, a robot-piloting hamster</span></a><span>, or even Ramattra, who is a central piece in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>‘s fiction, but is an outlier in the design philosophy the team has adopted.</span></p> <p><span>“We always will approach making </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> heroes… aspirational in some sense,” Tan told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. “They’re aspirational in their physique, in their expertise at what they do, and just being really cool heroes that we can look up to.”</span></p>

 <p><span>That doesn’t mean that there will never be a non-human character in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> again. Tan says that there is some “exciting stuff down the road” in this regard that the team will “sprinkle” into the roster in between these more “aspirational” heroes. That being said, the quote has got a lot of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>fans talking, with some viewing it as a smoking gun revealing underlying philosophies they’ve long suspected given the way characters have been rolled out and treated in recent years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>long-debated problem</span></a><span> with only a handful of characters in its 44-hero roster getting the lion’s share of cosmetics. Heroes like Kiriko, Mercy, and lately Juno have received a plethora of skins each season, while less popular heroes have been in a drought. As Blizzard has started releasing more conventionally attractive heroes who receive skins at an abnormally high rate compared to others, some characters have come to be seen as skin-selling cash cows rather than something that adds to the world or live game. If those are the characters whose skins sell, it certainly makes sense that Blizzard would keep giving them new outfits, but it does mean that Mercy mains </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sakura-mercy-skin-bundle-price-kiriko-shop-2000617479"><span>shoulder an unnecessary burden</span></a><span> of setting the tone for what Blizzard can get away with in terms of cosmetic prices. For some </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans, Blizzard saying that it’s prioritizing “aspirational” character design over quirkier characteristics seems like a thinly veiled way of saying it is prioritizing conventionally attractive heroes who people will buy skins for. It has fans debating whether or not long-established and beloved characters like the omnic Zenyatta or gorilla scientist Winston would have made the cut 10 years later.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the first thing you see when you start Overwatch for the first time btw <a href="https://t.co/2R6FgBXC5X">https://t.co/2R6FgBXC5X</a> <a href="https://t.co/UrtUKwQr6A">pic.twitter.com/UrtUKwQr6A</a></p> <p>— Banjo (@banjonosequemas) <a href="https://twitter.com/banjonosequemas/status/1955758886411186681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To me it's actually getting boring and isn't "relatable" or "aspirational" at all to see the same conventionally attractive heroes with the same physique be pumped out by every live service game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Batman Beyond and Static Shock are teaming up again, the spiritual successor to <em>Patapon</em> finally has a release date, and there’s always a bigger PC gaming handheld, apparently. It’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, culture, and other ephemera. But before we begin, there’s an important update. Our hoagie hero from earlier in the week? He was caught and charged with “forcefully” throwing a Subway sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent. So much for eating fresh.</p> <h2>Can your Switch 2 do this?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617743"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617743">Bilibili / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>No, no it can not. As reported <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/modder-builds-12-5-inch-4k-gaming-handheld-powered-by-nvidia-rtx-4090-laptop-gpu">by VideoCardz</a>, a DIY modder <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1EdrHYgEow/?spm_id_from=888.80997.embed_other.whitelist&amp;t=7.861177&amp;bvid=BV1EdrHYgEow">posting on Bilibili</a> took a RTX 4090 laptop, stripped it down, and repurposed it into a handheld. It sports a 12.5-inch display and a Core i9 processor, plus 64GB of DDR5 memory. The existing cooling system apparently vents enough heat to keep the GPU below 160 degrees. I don’t think this one is going to win any awards for battery life, but running <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> and other PS5 games at 4K in your hands is no small feat. I’m mostly impressed with the appearance, which has a certain appeal despite being closer to a contestant on <em>Robot Wars</em> than a mass market device. It makes Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-nitro-blaze-11-steam-deck-ces-2025-size-handheld-1851734392">look almost normal by comparison</a>.</p> <h2>On whether <em>Tekken 8</em> will get ported</h2> <p>With <em>Street Fighter 6</em> being a launch game for Switch 2 (and a decent version at that), it seems like a no brainer for Bandai Namco’s 3D fighter to make the jump as well. Is a <em>Tekken 8</em> port already in the works or still something fans will have to wait for? “It’s an interesting option, and not totally off the table,” series director Katsuhiro Harada said at Evo earlier this month (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2">via <em>Eurogamer</em></a>). “But it would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware.”</p>

 <p>But it sounds like Harada still hasn’t made a decision. “From a business standpoint, [the Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you’re trying to get a bigger audience. But the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision. At this point in time, there are no…(laughs)…there is nothing to announce.”</p> <p>While <i>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</i> was on Wii U, no numbered entry in the series has ever appeared on a Nintendo platform. Harada also recently said he <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/harada-feels-like-making-tekken-tag-tournament-3-wouldnt-make-much-sense-and-that-tekken-needs-a-tag-mode-instead/">doesn’t think it would make sense</a> to make a new<em> Tekken Tag</em>, with it being more practical to just add that as a mode to the existing game.</p> <h2>Starbucks asks customers in Korea to stop treating it like an office</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ko" dir="ltr">❗️어메이징 스타벅스❗️</p> <p>스타벅스 코리아 본사는 매장에서 개인용 데스크톱 컴퓨터를 비롯해 프린터·칸막이·멀티탭의 사용을 제한키로 결정하고, 전국 매장에 공지를 했답니다.</p> <p>멀티탭을 막 써서 컴퓨터나 프린터를 쓰고, 테이블 위에 가림막까지 설치한다니! </p> <p>너무 심한 거 아닌가요? <a href="https://t.co/ueZRyNrifj">pic.twitter.com/ueZRyNrifj</a></p> <p>— UNICON 𝕏 (@UNICONTSLA) <a href="https://twitter.com/UNICONTSLA/status/1953286006033236483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>South Korea is famous for its PC bang internet cafes, but what if you have the equipment already and just need a place to plug in? According to <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10550038"><em>The Korea Herald</em></a> (via <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/just-a-tap-water-please-starbucks-korea-asks-customers-to-stop-bringing-desktop-pcs-printers-and-pop-up-dividers-into-its-coffee-shops-for-a-cheeky-work-session/">PC Gamer</a></em>), customers have been bringing full-on office setups to their local Starbucks, complete in some extreme cases with printers and cubicle dividers. As a result, Starbucks stores in the country have been putting out gentle notices on tables reminding patrons that it’s not a free WeWork space. I’m going to try to throw my next LAN party at Burger King.</p>

 <h2><em>Tales</em> news is on the way, including a likely remaster of <i><b>Xillia</b></i></h2> <p>Bandai Namco Europe apparently <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1955973635589427262">let slip a thumbnail</a> on YouTube for an upcoming showcase seemingly scheduled for August 18 that would include updates on the <em>Tales</em> RPG series. Included in the quickly removed screenshot was a reference to a rumored <em>Tales of Xillia</em> remaster. The 2013 game came out at the tail end of the PS3’s lifecycle and <a href="http://e-kotaku-review-1146006980/">was largely well-received by fans,</a> minus some really clunky English voice acting.</p> <h2><em>Batman/Static: Beyond</em> is a six-issue series coming this fall</h2>   <p>Comics are still one of the hardest mediums to keep up with, but anything <em>Batman Beyond</em>-related always has my attention. So I was excited to see DC <a href="https://www.dc.com/blog/2025-08-13/dc-announces-batman-static-beyond">announced a new limited-run series</a> with Terry McGinnis and Static Shock’s Virgil Hawkins teaming up for the second time to face new techno-infused threats together. And that was before I realized that <em>Kotaku</em> alum Evan Narcisse was writing it with artist Nikolas Draper-Ivey!</p>

 <p>“This story is intended to be a commentary on our overreliance on technology and the imminent dangers becoming complacent and too comfortable using AI to substitute our own imagination and human ingenuity,” the artist said. “We now use our watches to find our phones, we use our phones to connect to everything else. We don’t rely on our own memories. We rely on technology to remember for us. That deeply concerns me. I worry that we are getting to a point where if all these things were to be suddenly taken away from us in an instant—at the rate we’re going now, humanity will be at a huge disadvantage.”</p> <h2><em>Ratatan</em> finally has a real release date</h2> <p>The<em> Patapon</em> remaster came out earlier this summer <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-patapon-donkey-kong-shadow-mgs3-1851786599">and was great</a>, but what I’ve really been waiting for is the spiritual successor from the original designer himself. Crowdfunded project <em>Ratatan</em> will deliver that when it comes to Early Access on PC on September 19. There are so many ways the game could fail to live up to the hype, but I’m looking forward to seeing what creator Hiroyuki Kotani has been cooking up either way.</p> <h2>ICYMI</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-review-fx-tv-show-science-fiction-2000617442">Here’s why you don’t want to miss out on <em>Alien: Earth</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Read <em>Kotaku</em>‘s review of <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> to find out why it’s “a deal you probably can refuse.”</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-gooner-skins-swimsuit-interview-psylocke-emma-frost-2000617518"><em>Marvel Rivals</em> still isn’t beating the “gooner game” allegations</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to ALL Hit Expedition 33" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DaVCFdzGq-A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>You’ve heard about <em>Dark Souls</em> no-hit runs, but YouTuber&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ymfah/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ymfah</a> decided to pull off an “all-hits” playthrough of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, completing the game without parrying or dodging a single attack.
