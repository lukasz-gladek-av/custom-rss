            <title><![CDATA[SNL’s Stranger Things Skit Stokes The Flames Of A Dying Fan Fire]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> actor Finn Wolfhard hosted </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span> over the weekend, and given the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>online shitshow that’s transpired</span></a><span> since Netflix’s horror series wrapped up last month, the sketch comedy show had a lot of material to work with. Like most episodes of </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>, this one had its assortment of</span> <span>hits and misses, but particularly noteworthy was its </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>spoof, which touched on the backlash that has sprung up in the wake of the finale and mentioned the widespread Conformity Gate conspiracy theory which proposed the existence of a secret, “better” ending to the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Wolfhard’s monologue may not have touched on the backlash </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ final season has received online, but it has come under some fire for some low-hanging misogynistic jokes. The former child actor talks about growing up on the Netflix show over the past decade, and says the first time he learned what a woman looked like “down there” was captured on camera during the show. We then cut to a clip of his character Mike seeing a Demogorgon open its monstrous jaws. You get it? Vaginas are scary! Like a flesh-eating monster!</span></p>

  <p><span>Thankfully the show’s actual </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>skit fared better, envisioning Netflix milking the series into multiple spin-offs, including a </span><i><span>Sex and the City </span></i><span>parody starring Wolfhard’s character as a writer in ‘90s New York City. However, it too has come under fire for what some are calling a tasteless joke about Lucas’ future sex life with partner Max, who now “just lies there like she’s back in that coma,” a reference to her character being in a coma during the show.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the skit’s joke about Will’s infamous coming-out scene in season 5, which fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>said was sweet but a bit hokey and longwinded</span></a><span>, has gotten an absurd bad-faith response from some viewers. </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>’s skit jokes that Will isn’t getting a spin-off because this coming-out scene is still going on. The choice to poke fun at the scene has been </span><a href="https://x.com/w1llb1yers/status/2012864726955380789?s=20"><span>deemed homophobic</span></a><span>, to which I say, making fun of the scene’s notorious length is not the same as making a joke at the expense of gay people.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real joke of note is the skit’s direct reference to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>Conformity Gate conspiracy</span></a><span> which posits that a secret ninth episode that will “fix” the divisive finale is on the way. Wolfhard and two of his co-stars reunite on a mountaintop in Iceland, and Wolfhard exclaims that “everything we thought happened was an illusion that was planted by Vecna.” When asked for “one good reason” why they should believe him, Wolfhard responds, “How about eleven?” at which point Kenan Thompson steps in for Millie Bobbie Brown, holding an Eggo waffle and spouting gibberish.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though the </span><i><span>SNL </span></i><span>episode has come and gone, the Duffer Brothers were in attendance, and some </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans unhappy with the ending </span><a href="https://x.com/bylerhughes/status/2012800392644436357?s=20"><span>heckled them in public</span></a><span> as they were leaving the venue.</span></p> <p><span>The Conformity Gate conspiracy has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>mostly died down at this point</span></a><span>, though some true believers are moving the goalpost and saying that it might still be coming. While some cast members have been hesitant to comment on it directly, actor Joe Keery has </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcradio1/video/7595593028492856598"><span>flatly denied that any such episode exists</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Office 2024 Lifetime License Hits Its Lowest Price of the Year With 60% Off, No Subscription Required for Mac or PC]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-office-2024-lifetime-license-hits-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-with-60-off-no-subscription-required-for-mac-or-pc-2000661036</link>
            <guid>1410982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft Office suite comes packed with all the apps you need to work, study, and handle everyday tasks more efficiently. To get started with these, you must buy a separate license, which normally ranges from $100-$150 for the Home version, and up to $250 for the Home and Business option.</p>
<p>Those shopping for one today – we’ve got great news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/">You can now grab a lifetime license of Home and Business Microsoft Office 2024 at a 60% discount at StackSocial, which brings its price down to just $100.</a> The Home version is discounted too, going for $120, down from $150, after a modest 20% drop. Both of these are one-time purchases that give you access to all the essential tools. Note that this version does not include the services offered with a Microsoft 365 subscription or upgrade to future releases.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Essential Apps</h2>
<p>Once you complete your purchase on StackSocial, you’ll receive a redemption code via email. The code is valid immediately after your purchase and must be redeemed within seven days, after which it expires. There are some browser and operating system requirements to keep in mind. As for compatibility, the license works with Windows Internet Explorer 11 or newer, Mozilla Firefox 12 or newer, Apple Safari 5 or newer, Google Chrome 18 or newer, and Microsoft Edge. Operating system requirements are straightforward and shouldn’t be an issue with most modern PCs and laptops. Still, we recommend going through the complete list once before you make your purchase, just to be safe.</p>
<p>The subscription gets you access to classic apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more. Create assignments using Word, make presentations on PowerPoint, and work on boring spreadsheets with Excel. There’s Outlook to manage emails and create schedules, plus OneNote that serves as a digital notebook for organizing and sharing notes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the 2024 version of Office offers significant improvements over Office 2021. These include superior performance and better speed, which lets you handle larger datasets and juggle multiple tasks at the same time without slowing down. You can now record presentations on PowerPoint with voice narration, and even ensure your emails meet accessibility standards in Outlook before sending them. What’s more, the interface across all Office applications is more unified, and the improved touch and pen input make it easier to stay productive during busy days.</p>
<p>AI integration takes the experience even further. Office 2024 uses the power of artificial intelligence to offer smart suggestions for text, formatting, and design elements. You can use it to summarize text, translate content in real time, create charts, manage data better, and more. So, whether you need to write a lengthy research paper or create digital notebooks for each of your projects, Office 2024 makes it easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/">You can now grab the Home and Business version for $100, while the Home version is sitting at $120</a>. Considering how the former offers more for less price, we highly recommend considering that over the standard Home option. It’s best to act fast, though. The offer is selling fast, and we’re expecting it to wrap up within a day or two.</p>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass kicked off 2026 with a couple of huge games in its opening crop for the new year, offering both <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em> among eight other games. The latter part of this month seems equally stacked, with the announcement that by the end of January we’ll also have&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em>.</p> <p>Obviously the sheen really has come off Game Pass after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">last few years of bungled reshuffling</a> of tiers and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">outrageous price hikes</a>, but if you&nbsp;<em>can</em> still afford the monthly sub, it’s at least been a decent investment this January. Joining the 10 games that were already added so far are another seven, along with two more sneaking in at the very start of February. And it’s a fantastic mix.</p>

 <p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> is being added tomorrow, January 21, alongside PC-only road repair sim <em>RoadCraft</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-2d-blasphemous-1851787265">last year’s stunning 2D platformer</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>. Then, nearly a week later, we get the mindblowingly clever <em>The Talos Principle 2</em>, followed by 2022’s ok-ish&nbsp;<em>ANNO: Mutationem</em>, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-clair-baldurs-duchy-savage-planet-1851780035/4">rather splendid</a> 2025 indie mix of city builder and&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>,&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em>. Then comes whatever&nbsp;<em>MySims: Cozy Bundle</em> might be, before a massive finish to the month with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029">glorious&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em></a>.</p> <p>For some reason a couple of February releases have been included too. These are <em>Indika</em>, 2024’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861">intriguing exploration of religious trauma</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy II</em> in its revamped 2D pixel form.</p> <p>Here’s the full list:</p>  <ul> <li><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>RoadCraft</em> (PC)</li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 27</h2> <ul> <li><em>The Talos Principle</em> (PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 28</h2> <ul> <li><em>Anno: Mutationem</em> (Cloud, PC, Console)</li> <li><em>Drop Duchy</em> (Cloud, PC, Console)</li> </ul> <h2>January 29</h2> <ul> <li><em>MySims: Cozy Bundle</em> (PC)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>February 2</h2> <ul> <li><em>Indika</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>February 3</h2> <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy II</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul>

            <title><![CDATA[DJI’s New Released Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer Crashes to All-Time Low After Two Surprise Price Drops, Built-in Extension Rod and Tripod]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/djis-new-released-osmo-mobile-8-gimbal-stabilizer-crashes-to-all-time-low-after-two-surprise-price-drops-built-in-extension-rod-and-tripod-2000661054</link>
            <guid>1410922</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to create content with your phone, there are some great options to help you better the way it looks and sounds. That includes a gimbal to make sure your picture stays static even when your phone or your subject is moving around. Case in point: The DJI Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/">If you’re interested in grabbing your own DJI Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer, head to Amazon where you can get it for just $126, which is a $23 or 15% discount from the regular retail price of $149.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A stabilizing gadget to help improve your mobile photos and video</h2>
<p>This gadget is designed to produce smooth video and professional-looking results. It has AI-powered subject tracking (for subjects such as people and pets), and additional features like built-in light support and audio pickup. It even has 360-degree pan rotation for more creative movements, an extension rod and integrated tripod for transitioning between handheld shots and stationary shots without the need to swap equipment, and a stated 10 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>The gimbal itself weighs approximately 13.1 ounces and the handle has been designed to fit comfortably in the user’s hand for extended periods of time. It even includes an extension rod to create space for a wider view for framing groups, overhead shots, etc.</p>



<p>Stabilization using robust 3-axis gimbal technology is the key to providing you with stabilized video footage when moving the gimbal around. The motors on the gimbal will adjust to your hand movements resulting in smoother footage than what would be produced by in-phone stabilization. Plus, its unlimited 360-degree horizontal pan allows for options to capture wrap-around movements and panoramic sweeps. The gimbal has features such as Timelapse, Motionlapse, Hyperlapse, and multiple panorama modes, which provide users with the ability to creatively compress time or stitch together large areas with minimal manual setup.</p>
<p>Tracking with audio and lighting is accomplished natively through the inclusion of the DJI OM Multifunctional Module, which brings several tools into one unit. The module can track individuals and pets, receive audio, and integrate with external light support to ensure your subject remains visible and well-lit.</p>
<p>Overall, this handheld gimbal works hard to deliver more stable footage, improved framing, and smoother movement for the photos and video you take on your phone. It accomplishes that with three-axis stabilization, unlimited 360-degree panning, the extension rod and tripod, and the Multifunctional Module.</p>
<p>For this price, and considering the fact that it’s often hard to find DJI products anymore, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/">this a purchase you’re going to want to jump on right now before it’s out of stock again</a>. Be sure to grab yours fast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-remake-remaster-mods-2000661284</link>
            <guid>1410871</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span>, a mod that combines the world maps of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-director-sawyer-xbox-bethesda-1851620259"><i><span> Fallout 3 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i></a><span>, won’t be getting ported to (or otherwise remade for) those long-rumored remasters and remakes. One of the best ways to experience the wasteland will remain anchored to the older games..</span></p> <p><span>The existence of upcoming new versions of Bethesda’s</span><i><span> Fallout 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> might be the worst-kept secret in gaming right now, much like </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </span></i><span>was prior to its release last year</span><span>. If this is the first you’re hearing of this, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><span>here’s </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s breakdown</span></a><span> of why everyone is so convinced that the remasters are on the way.</span></p>

 <p><span>The community is understandably excited, with said excitement at least partially fueled by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">success of <em>Fallout </em>season 2</a> </span><span>on Prime. But a remastered version of either game comes with the same potential headache as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-steam-mixed-review-ue5-stuttering-2000624074"><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</span></i></a><span> did</span><span>: a lack of support for close to two decades of mods.</span></p>  <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span> is concerned, Bethesda </span><a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672"><span>outright confirmed</span></a><span> at release that “mods are not officially supported” for the game. This didn’t stop the modding community from </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/"><span>finding workarounds</span></a><span> for certain classic </span><i><span>Oblivion </span></i><span>mods, but the end result is clear: the original </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivion/mods"><span>2006 release</span></a><span> of the game has ten times the number of mods on popular mod distribution site Nexus Mods that </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=downloads"><i><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span> has</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2026/01/19/161756.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span>, at least one huge total conversion mod for both </span><i><span>Fallout 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> won’t be making the jump to the current generation, as confirmed by the team behind </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands </span></i><span>in their Discord server. Why? Because, understandably, producing a version of </span><i><span>TTW</span></i><span> that works with both remasters “would be a mammoth effort and would require an entire rebuild of the project.”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Tale of Two Wastelands</em> feels like its own game</h2> <p><span>If you haven’t played </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span> for yourself, let me be the first to tell you that you really should. Merely describing it as a way to play through both games with a single character is massively underselling it, because it doesn’t just smoosh the Mojave and the Capital Wasteland together.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands </span></i><span>overhauls both games in a way that makes the experience truly cohesive by completely rebalancing the game, altering the level cap and perks, and even restoring a bunch of cut content. It’s such a huge undertaking that it even has its own separate tag on Nexus, with over 1,200 support mods of its own. The </span><i><span>TTW</span></i><span> team aren’t exaggerating when </span><a href="https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/faq.html"><span>they describe the project</span></a><span> as its own “unique game.”</span></p> <p><span>Ever since I first tried <em>TTW </em>back in 2019, I haven’t returned to the standalone versions of either </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> or</span><i><span> Fallout 3</span></i><span>. It obviously sucks to hear that the project won’t be supported once the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> remasters drop, even if it’s completely understandable. We can only hope that Bethesda makes a better effort to support legacy mods this time around, but, in the case of </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span>, we may have to make peace with the fact that some <em>Fallout</em> modding projects are simply too grand in scope to get ported to their remastered counterparts.</span></p>
