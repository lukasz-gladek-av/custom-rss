              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> first Lego sets</span></a><span> are launching later this month for the series’ 30th anniversary, but some reviewers and creators have gotten early access to the sets and are building them for coverage. These models are made up of hundreds or thousands of pieces, and sometimes, Lego sneaks an easter egg or two into the build. This is the case with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914"><span>Eevee</span></a><span> model, which has a hidden reference to the Pokémon’s various evolutions.</span></p> <p><span>Eevee’s whole schtick is that it’s able to evolve into one of several evolutions depending on certain conditions, including the time of day, the use of a certain evolution stone, or whether or not it knows a Fairy-type move. Each form is pretty distinct, with each carrying a different color scheme, elemental theme, and shape. While Eevee’s eight evolutions aren’t getting their own Lego sets (yet), the Eevee model’s innards are a nod to each of them.</span></p>

   <p><span>As TikToker and Lego creator Bricks By Mind demonstrates, the inside of the Eevee model includes colored bricks that correspond to each of its evolutions. Parts of it are made up of yellow, orange, and blue bricks that resemble the colors of the electric Jolteon, flaming Flareon, and water-wielding Vaporeon, respectively. Meanwhile, the inside of the head has a brick for each of the other evolutions stacked next to one another behind its eyes. This includes the aforementioned three, but also blocks for the Ice-type Glaceon, Grass-type Leafeon, Psychic-type Espeon, Dark-type Umbreon, and Fairy-type Sylveon. It’s a neat touch.</span></p> <p><span>Thankfully, the Eevee model is the cheapest of the </span><i><span>Pokemon </span></i><span>Lego sets, and will only run you $59.99 compared to the $200 Pikachu one, or the staggering $649.99 you’ll have to pay for the Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise one, when they all launch on February 27.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Amazon is making a live-action adaptation of </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, specifically the 2018 game set in Norse mythology. The show hasn’t begun shooting yet, but the casting announcements are trickling out as Amazon and Sony prepare to move ahead with production. Some actors fans will recognize from other shows and movies as well as the games, but so far only one is reprising their role from the actual Santa Monica Studio’s franchise. Let’s run down who we know is in the</span><i><span> God of War </span></i><span>TV show thus far.</span></p> <h2><b>Ryan Hurst as Kratos</b></h2>  <p><span>Leading the show will be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-amazon-kratos-ryan-hurst-2000659874"><span>Ryan Hurst as the god of war himself</span></a><span>. Hurst played Thor in the games, so he’s familiar with the source material, though the familiar casting wasn’t without </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584"><span>a little bit of controversy</span></a><span>, as this will be the first time Kratos is not portrayed by a Black actor. Outside of playing Thor in </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>, Hurst has also played Opie in </span><i><span>Sons of Anarchy</span></i><span> and Beta in the </span><i><span>Walking Dead </span></i><span>franchise. Most recently, he has played Miles in the new Netflix western series </span><i><span>The Abandons</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Callum Vinson as Atreus</b></h2>  <p><span>The co-lead of the series will be child actor Callum Vinson as Kratos’ son Atreus. One of Vinson’s most high-profile roles hasn’t actually premiered yet. He’s playing a young Jason Vorhees in </span><i><span>Crystal Lake</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Friday the 13th </span></i><span>prequel coming to Peacock later this year. But beyond that, he’s also appeared in series like </span><i><span>Poker Face</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Chucky</span></i><span>, and voiced Piglet in recent iterations of </span><i><span>Winnie the Pooh</span></i><span>. That’s a pretty decent resume for someone so young.</span></p> <h2><b>Alastair Duncan as Mimir</b></h2>  <p><span>One of the other game actors coming back to </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>for the show is Mimir actor Alastair Duncan, who is, thus far, the only performer reprising their existing role from the games for the show. Duncan’s voice performance was already one of the stand-outs in the </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>games, so I’m sure he’ll crush it again on TV.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka as Brok and Sindri</b></h2>  <p><span>Rounding out our known heroes are Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka as the bickering dwarven brothers Brok and Sindri, respectively. Woodburn has been in shows like </span><i><span>Seinfeld</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Conan the Adventurer</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Bones</span></i><span>, and recently appeared as Zoltan in Netflix’s </span><i><span>Witcher </span></i><span>series. Gulka, meanwhile, has worked on shows like </span><i><span>X-Files </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Stargate</span></i><span>.</span></p>

  <h2><b>Max Parker as Heimdall</b></h2>  <p><span>It looks like the show will be playing with the timeline of the games a bit, as Heimdall is set to appear in the first season, though he didn’t appear in the games until </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Boots </span></i><span>actor Max Parker will portray the evil bastard. He has also led </span><i><span>Vampire Academy </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blood, Sex &amp; Royalty</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Thor</b></h2>  <p><span>With Hurst playing Kratos this time around, someone else has to pick up Mjölnir for the show. Icelandic actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson will portray the god of thunder. </span><i><span>Severance </span></i><span>fans will likely recognize him as Mr. Drummond, where he was a very intimidating presence throughout the second season. Not a bad pick for </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>’s version of Thor.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mandy Patinkin as Odin</b></h2>  <p><span>Odin, who, again, was an enigma throughout the first Norse </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, will be showing up early in the Amazon series, as well. Storied actor Mandy Patinkin will be playing the all-father, and I’m eager to see him fill the shoes left by Richard Schiff, who played him in </span><i><span>Ragnarok</span></i><span>. Patinkin, on top of having a long history in theater collaborating with legends like Andrew Lloyd Webber, has also been in plenty of films and television across his decades-long career, including his iconic role as Inigo Montoya in </span><i><span>The Princess Bride</span></i><span>.</span></p> <h2><b>Teresa Palmer as Sif</b></h2>  <p><i><span>Warm Bodies </span></i><span>actor Teresa Palmer has joined the cast as Sif, the wife of Thor and mother of Magni, Modi, and Thrúd. Palmer has most recently led the TV series </span><i><span>The Last Anniversary</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Mix Tape</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Family Next Door </span></i><span>last year.</span></p> <p><span>That’s all we know so far, but if you’ve played the Norse </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> games, you know they’re packed with characters. We still haven’t heard who’s being cast for Freya, Baldur, Angrboda, and many, many others. The </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>show is currently in pre-production, with the 2018 game’s director Cory Barlog on board as an executive producer, but there’s no set release date yet.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://defector.com/super-bowl-lx-was-the-beatdown-that-will-leave-no-trace">Super Bowl 60 is over.</a> The Seahawks won it all. Bad Bunny’s performance was amazing and just what was needed at this time. And as usual, there were many, many expensive commercials in-between all of the action. As has been the case for the last few years, basically every ad featured celebs and big-name actors selling out to help promote AI, donuts, crackers, and more. And almost all of it fucking sucked shit. It’s depressing to watch talented actors sell out. So many of the ads were for awful products. Nothing about them was even fun or memorable.</p> <p>This year, for the first time in a bit, I decided to skip the Super Bowl. So instead, I only saw people’s reactions to the ads via social media, and it sounded bad. But when I woke up this morning and mainlined all of the ads, I was shocked to discover it was worse than I expected and even worse than the previous star-studded sell-out showcase that was Super Bowl 59. American culture’s marketing machine has hit a new low.</p>

 <p>Many of the ads featured random assortments of celebs that seemed picked by rolling the dice. Worse, some of these ads used CG to de-age the celebs, compounding the horror. Many of the ads were too long and felt like nearly every marketing agency around the country has forgotten how to actually sell people stuff. The worst part of the night was Dunkin’ Donuts attempt at making a joke about ’90s sitcoms that seemingly started and ended with the same juice-less punchline: “Noted Dunkin’ lover Ben Affleck was in a movie that sort of rhymes with our company’s name.” A few million dollars later, the end result was this CG-face-filled cameo-packed nightmare.</p>  <p>Xfinity also got in on the de-aging celebs action with an ad that, on paper at least, sounds like a winner. What if <em>Jurassic Park</em> actually worked because our company’s internet powered it? Could be funny, but it’s hard to laugh when faced with CGI smooth-skinned versions of the film’s stars inhumanely moving around like haunted wax figures.</p>

  <p>Here’s a great way to sell AI-assistants: Spend a minute showing all the ways it could murder you.</p>  <p>MrBeast was here too and wanted to sell you AI. He also demonstrated that despite making videos for years online, he seems to have zero charisma on camera. How was this the best take?</p>

  <p>Then we have the case of Sofía Vergara, who wins the award for biggest sellout of the night for appearing in three different Super Bowl 2026 commercials. Look, <a href="https://youtu.be/9OvibwfflDg">$26 million mansions don’t pay for themselve</a>s, okay?</p>     <p>Meanwhile, Uber Eats continues to run with this marketing campaign built around some made-up conspiracy about food and the NFL, and… look, I have no idea why this is supposed to be funny or entertaining.</p>

  <p>Don’t worry, Matthew Broderick was here to sell AI that will do your job for you in an ad that feels like Genspark had to pick its star after all the other companies already had theirs and got stuck with Ferris Bueller showing people how to AI-maxx at their lifeless office jobs.</p>  <p>Remember that thing from the 80s that was popular? I hope so, or otherwise this commercial won’t make any sense.</p>  <p>Medicine maker Novo Nordisk’s Super Bowl ad wins the award for “Most Random Celeb Appearances” by shoving anyone who was available in LA on a Tuesday a few weeks ago into it.</p>

  <p>This is like one of those SNL fake ads featuring a real product, but somehow even less funny.</p>  <p>I’m so tired.</p>  <p>There are so many of these.</p>  <p>Please, I can’t keep watching all of these bad, boring, unfunny ads starring sellouts.</p>

  <p>I’m tapping out here. This isn’t even all of them, but it’s enough to see that marketing agencies are cooked, AI companies are desperate, and actors no longer feel shame for selling out to sell crackers. Bad timeline. We need to shut it all down and start over.</p> <p>As I said last year, stars and actors have been popping up in commercials for a long time. But around the time we entered the 2000s, something changed. To quote Zack from 2025:</p> <blockquote><p>Sure, if you dig through history you can find numerous examples of famous&nbsp;<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/51/1b/25/511b2500e00c3eddc3fca5968a3020b9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actors and artists appearing in ads</a>, even during the height of their career. It definitely happened. However, it was still a fairly rare occurrence and most big-name actors were careful about appearing in too many. For example, Tommy Lee Jones and other Hollywood stars would&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fly over to Japan and other countries to do commercials</a>&nbsp;so nobody over here in the States would see them. There was still a fear that if you sold out&nbsp;<em>too&nbsp;</em>much and&nbsp;<em>too&nbsp;</em>often you’d look desperate and signal that your career was ending. And this was the case for decades.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Then Super Bowl commercials became bigger and bigger in the 2000s</a>&nbsp;and companies spent more and more to create a viral, popular ad. And as this was happening, the lines between TV, movies, and internet content started to blur, while streaming services and YouTube grew in popularity. Hustle culture—the belief that as long as you were getting paid it was worth it—also grew during this time.<a href="https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I remember people in 2015 cheering Kim Kardashian</a> for appearing in a big Super Bowl ad and celebrating that she “got paid!” That has led us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly every damn Super Bowl ad</a> including big name actos to help sell soda or crackers. And it’s all so sad.</p></blockquote> <p>See you next year when a de-aged Mark Hamill uses AI to help him blow up the Death Star alongside Snoop Dogg and some ’90s actor who needs to buy a new car.</p>
