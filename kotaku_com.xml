              <p>At the very end of 2025,&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3</em> developer CD Projekt Red announced it had sold its long-running PC gaming store GOG to CD Projekt and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński. And while Kiciński launched GOG with its anti-DRM ethos, he’s been away from both companies for the last 13 years, and it was unknown if he might take the now independent storefront in a new direction. According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, there are no fears of GOG backing down from its bold stance, even if it means missing out on lucrative AAA gaming sales.</p> <p>Then known as Good Old Games, the store was originally launched by Polish developer CDPR in 2008, with a focus on selling classic games that had become hard to get hold of, stripped free of old, decaying digital rights management software. As the store developed, it began selling newer games too, but always on the condition that they shipped without any form of DRM.</p>

 <p>In the late 2000s, DRM had become the cause of a huge amount of controversy, with games shipping on DVD-ROM with ludicrous, game-breaking restrictions, such as limits on how many times they could be installed, the inability to run fully installed games without the discs in drives, and most insidiously, online checks that meant games couldn’t be played without an active internet connection. Ostensibly in place to prevent the illusory threat of “piracy,” these restrictions only ever prevented legitimate game owners from playing their games freely, while pirated versions were usually stripped of all DRM by the first day of a game’s release. It was a farce. (And it still is, with DRM software in digital games now severely impeding performance.) GOG has been run for the last 18 years with a refusal to sell DRM-infected games.</p>

 <p>It’s good to know that time hasn’t changed Michał Kiciński’s position on the matter. Speaking to&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em>, the new outright owner of GOG explained that after a bidding process against an unknown rival company, he succeeded in buying the company he created because he sees “opportunities” for the business. GOG made very little money for CDPR, but Kiciński believes there’s a route to more financial success, and he’s not exactly unambitious.</p>

 <p>“I see huge opportunities for GOG to grow,” Kiciński says. “And somebody might say that having a competitor like Steam with 80 percent of the market share is a huge obstacle, but to me it’s the opposite. I see: ‘Oh, there is one big competitor, it’ll be difficult for them to defend the market, because they already have 80 percent, so it should be easier to take the market from them.”</p>

 <p>The focus to try to do this is not to try to out-Steam Steam, but rather to “just be better at a certain segment.” This is the site’s focus on classic games, but also working with independent developers with big-game games who are willing to sell via GOG. Citing games like&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em> and&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, which were simultaneously released on GOG alongside Steam, it proves that outside of the mega-publishers, there are those willing to embrace GOG’s ethos. Oh, and as part of the sale it was agreed that CDPR’s games will remain on GOG for at least the next six years—that certainly helps.</p>

 <p>When it comes to refusing DRM, Kiciński tells&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em> that it remains “a core value of GOG, and there’s no signs that it might die in any visible future,” describing this as both an ethical and pragmatic choice. And, with a refreshing frankness, he says he has no time for publishers who don’t get it. “Most corporate people, they make plain stupid decisions.”</p>

 <p>You can read the rest of the interview, along with details over whey the company was sold and its plans for the future, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">over on&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-tp-links-tri-band-wifi-6e-router-at-its-lowest-price-with-42-off-2000659062</link>
            <guid>1404496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Built to improve Wi-Fi performance in large homes, the TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router delivers faster speeds and more reliable connectivity. With the addition of an extra 6 GHz band, Wi-Fi 6E expands on the two bands (5 GHz and 2.4 GHz) that have been standard in routers for years, giving each device more space on the airwaves and reducing congestion. The combined speeds of all three bands reach up to 5400 Mbps, enabling smooth, uninterrupted 4K and 8K video streaming while you continue browsing the Internet, chatting, and downloading files on other devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/">The TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router is now available on Amazon for $116, down from its usual price of $200, for a savings of $84, or 42%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful router to improve your home Wi-Fi connection</h2>
<p>With the added 6 GHz band in the tri-band Wi-Fi 6E on the Archer AXE5400, there are three independent paths for traffic, making it ideal for applications such as gaming, video conferencing, or high-bitrate video streaming, where interruptions can be frustrating. Smart TVs, gaming consoles, and laptops typically run on the 5 GHz band, while smart home devices and general web surfing can use the 2.4 GHz band.</p>
<p>This router has true tri-band capabilities and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), so it can communicate with multiple devices simultaneously rather than waiting for each device to connect one by one. It also includes a 1.7 GHz quad-core processor and 512 MB of RAM to handle heavy traffic, especially when many devices are accessing the Internet simultaneously.</p>



<p>In addition to delivering the performance gains of Wi-Fi 6E, the router also offers advanced network security features that enhance protection and control. HomeShield tools included with the router include: basic network scans, identification of new devices connecting to the network, built-in Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities, and reporting to display network usage patterns over time. There are also basic parental controls and WPA3 encryption, providing an additional layer of security for compatible devices compared to WPA2-based equipment, as well as support for both a built-in VPN server and a VPN client to protect your traffic or securely access your home network from remote locations.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, the TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router works with major Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including but not limited to AT&amp;T, Verizon, Xfinity, Spectrum, Cox, CenturyLink, and Frontier. However, most cable and DSL connections require a separate modem, which must be purchased separately. The router itself provides Wi-Fi, plus wired Ethernet WAN and LAN ports, and a USB port for supported accessories so that you can mix wired desktop computers with wireless mobile phones and streaming devices. Plus, the TP-Link Tether app lets you set up the router from your smartphone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/">Once operational, the router’s relatively small size makes it easy to fit next to your modem, and its $116 sale price is a better value than the $200 original list price.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steams-big-new-zombie-game-is-tense-but-comes-at-a-bad-time-2000658992</link>
            <guid>1404442</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I screwed up real bad in my first few in-game days of the latest Steam hit, <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint.</em> I let an infected person into the safe zone of our military-run camp. They turned into a zombie overnight, and I woke up to dead survivors. The reason I let them in? Right now, the last thing I want to do is hand off random citizens to soldiers in masks who will take them away to get “liquidated.”</p> <p>Before you email me or screenshot this article and share it online, let me be very clear: <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">I know I’m breaking the rules</a>. I know I’m not supposed to talk about the real world when writing about video games. That’s a big no-no. To dare connect the dots between a digital game and the real world we all live in is often seen by some of the loudest online as a cardinal sin. Unforgivable. Well, get over it because I find it genuinely impossible to write about<em> Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> without addressing the current state of America.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/">In <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint,</em></a> out now on PC, you play as a commander who has just arrived at a hastily put-together military installation in the middle of New York City. Your job is to help make all the big decisions on this base, including managing resources, upgrades, and the health and safety of personnel. But most of my time in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> was spent manning a single entry point at the front of the base, where survivors crawl out of a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested city in the hopes of finding shelter, food, and medicine. But first, they have to get past me, the asshole with a flashlight and gloves who decides who lives and dies.</p>

 <p>The majority of<em> Last Checkpoint</em> revolves around operating that point of entry. Early on, you are equipped with a flashlight and a small list of various symptoms and injuries to look out for, like bites and bloodshot eyes, and must use that list to determine who is healthy enough to enter, who needs to hang out in a quarantine cell for a few days, and who might need to be taken over to a non-descript room just out of eyesight of everyone to be shot in the head. As the in-game days go on, you start getting new tools, like a rubber mallet to check reflexes, and an X-ray gun to scan for hidden bites.</p>

 <p>In my first few days, I avoided sending anyone to the kill room. I’ve spent the past few months watching President Trump’s jackbooted thugs in masks, aka ICE, grab people off the street, sometimes at gunpoint, and take them away to places none of us can see. Not everyone comes back. And as I played <em>Last Checkpoint,</em> my phone was filled with photos and videos from out of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv7knz8e8mo">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2000-federal-agents-sent-to-minneapolis-area-to-carry-out-largest-immigration-operation-ever-ice-says">where ICE continues to cause mayhem and destruction</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/09/nx-s1-5672502/minneapolis-portland-ice-shootings">even shooting an innocent woman in the face in broad daylight</a>. So the armed guards decked out in full masks and carrying large assault rifles in<em>&nbsp;Last Checkpoint</em> were hard to trust.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659009" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659009"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659009">©Brigada Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But eventually, as space in quarantine ran out and I sent a few too many infected people into the safe zone and got others killed, I had to start sending people away to get shot in a room for the good of everyone else. There is no cure for the zombie plague in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em>, so once you think someone is infected, there’s not much of an option left. Each time I’d send a survivor away, I’d wait for the message to pop up on the screen confirming whether they were infected or not. When I finally screwed up and realized I’d sent an innocent man to his death at the hands of gun-toting soldiers, I wasn’t sure if I was having fun anymore.</p>

 <p>Tracking symptoms and managing a small military base in the middle of a zombie apocalypse using various tools and having to make hard calls is a very tense experience. And when I could disconnect what was happening in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> from the world I currently live in, I found myself having a good time succeeding at helping people, something the game also rewards you for and makes clear is the main goal of all this. But then I’d check my phone and see what <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chicago-immigration-enforcement-children-tear-gas-border-patrol-rcna241629">government-controlled soldiers are actually doing at a time when we aren’t being eaten alive by zombies</a>. The in-game soldiers and officials in <em>Last Checkpoint</em> have more restraint and empathy during a zombie apocalypse than the authorities walking our actual streets do right now. Wild shit.</p>

            <guid>1404415</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If high laptop prices have been holding you back from upgrading, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/">The 15.6-inch HP business laptop is down to $400 at Amazon, after a massive 56% or $500 discount on its usual $900 price.</a></p>
<p>The bundle includes a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, and a recovery USB. Delivery is free, so you’re saving a bit on that front too, which brings the overall cost down even further. But as you’d expect, the discount is around for a short time. We’re not expecting it to last longer than a day, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expandable Memory and Storage</h2>
<p>For just $400, you’re getting a sleek laptop that features a nice 15.6-inch Full HD display. With a resolution of 1920 × 1080, the screen delivers crisp details and vibrant colors for an immersive viewing experience. The anti-glare coating keeps it easy on the eyes, allowing you to use the laptop comfortably in all lighting conditions. Working on an important work presentation or just catching up on your favorite show, expect vivid, sharp visuals consistently.</p>
<p>The machine is powered by the latest Intel Core i3-1315U processor that features 6 cores (2 performance cores + 4 efficiency cores) and 8 threads to deliver fast, efficient performance. Intel Turbo Boost Technology helps it reach up to 4.5 GHz, meaning you can rely on the laptop for everyday work tasks, plus casual use (browsing, streaming, checking emails, communicating). Paired with the laptop is a modest 8GB RAM, which keeps everything running smoothly at the backend. It’s not massive, so you won’t exactly be able to multitask, but here’s the good part – the memory is expandable up to 64GB. That means you can always upgrade as your needs grow. The same is the case with the 628GB SSD (128GB SSD+500GB external). It’s sufficient to house important files, work documents, and media content, but the PCIe NVMe SSD supports capacities up to 2 TB. If it ever feels tight, you expand the capacity to keep the system running smoothly.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’re covered with Ethernet (RJ-45) for speedy wired networking, an SD card reader, USB-C, two USB 3.2 Type-A, HDMI output, and a headphone/microphone combo jack. That’s more than enough to create a productive setup for both office and studies. You can add external drives, and even connect another monitor if you need more than one screen.</p>
<p>Freebies add even more value to the bundle. You’re getting a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, which offers access to efficient apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and more. You will also enjoy 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage, handy AI features, and other useful tools that make remote productivity and creativity a breeze. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, which means you can get started with using the laptop right away. And finally, there’s a WOWPC recovery USB in the bundle, which offers quick and convenient system restoration in case of software issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/">This future-proof HP laptop is now sitting at just $400 at Amazon.</a> It’s practically nothing considering all the features the machine is packed with. We highly suggest grabbing it as soon as you can before the price shoots back up to $900.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tom-clancys-the-division-the-kotaku-review-1766431754"><em>The Division</em></a> came out nearly a decade ago. You can still go and play it but it hasn’t received a meaningful update since 2018. That could all be about to change. Marketing for “<em>The Division: Definitive Edition</em>” recently appeared in Japan suggesting the Tom Clancy-branded loot shooter could be getting a modern version to bring players back into its snowy, post-apocalyptic New York City.</p> <p>A mural advertising the unannounced version was spotted at the <a href="https://twitter.com/domen0204/status/2010224815131766796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2010224815131766796%7Ctwgr%5E03918b0436fb66d4f458378427f25deceae49e55%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fit-looks-like-the-division-definitive-edition-is-on-the-way-10-years-after-its-initial-release">FPS Day X esports event</a> where Ubisoft shared other info about the franchise, like a new “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zo5k8xkeHs">Realism Mode</a>” for <em>The Division 2</em> that will make the RPG play more like a traditional shooter with quicker time-to-kills and other more lethal tweaks. The first <em>Division</em> game originally launched back in March 2016, so it’s likely that whatever this Definitive Edition is could become available in just a few months.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FPSDayX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FPSDayX</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheDivision2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheDivision2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%93%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B32?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ディビジョン2</a> <a href="https://t.co/1ySkfSb98B">pic.twitter.com/1ySkfSb98B</a></p> <p>— Domen🐻Gaming | ドウメン (@domen0204) <a href="https://twitter.com/domen0204/status/2010224815131766796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>What a Definitive Edition would actually entail has been the subject of much speculation over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1q9ywr5/the_division_definitive_edition_spotted_at_fpsday/"><em>The Division</em> subreddit</a>. Will it be a current-gen remaster that brings the game natively to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S? <em>The Division 2</em> never got one, making that theory seem unlikely to some. Others would be happy if the game simply got support for 60fps on console and other quality-of-life improvements. Some fans have also suggested the possibility of new story content, or the merging of certain mechanics and modes from the current game back into the older one.</p>

 <p>Of course, it’s very possible that what Ubisoft might mean by a “Definitive Edition” is that it’s bringing all of <em>The Division 1</em> and <em>The Division 2</em> into a single cohesive package. That would seemingly be a much bigger undertaking and it’s hard to see exactly how it would work. The second game’s Warlords of New York added the first game’s location, but there’s still a ton of missions, story, and other content that could make its way there. A single package would also make it a more obvious candidate for a Switch 2 port.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division</em> seems to be doing exactly what <em>Destiny</em> fans keep begging for</h2> <p>Assuming that whatever this Definitive Edition is, it brings the old game forward for new and returning players to enjoy fresh in 2026 in some way, developer Massive will be fulfilling the dream that many <em>Destiny</em> fans have had ever since <em>Destiny 2</em> wrapped up its big, 10-year story arc with <em>The Final Shape</em>. While Bungie has brought some of the best parts of the old game forward into <em>Destiny 2</em> over the years, it also ditched most of the sequel’s original campaign to make room for ongoing expansions.</p>

 <p>A perennial request of fans is for the Red War and other cut content to return. Another pie-in-the-sky wish is for the old <em>Destiny</em> to return in some “vanilla” form similar to<em> World of Warcraft Classic.</em> It would be the original game but with a visual overhaul and on modern platforms so that players feel like there’s a reason for everyone to go back at the same time. The third request you’ll find in the replies for almost any new announcement from the <em>Destiny</em> social media account is for Bungie to simply start fresh and make <em>Destiny 3</em>.</p>

 <p>https://x.com/blueberriesGG/status/2010713900975902762</p> <p>Those are all very tall orders for a studio that’s suffered tons of layoffs, cuts, and player attrition in recent years, especially as it works on getting its new sci-fi shooter, <em>Marathon</em>, out the door alongside ongoing <em>Destiny 2</em> updates. But this is kind of what fans of <em>The Division</em> are in for right now. Executive producer Julian Gerighty recently teased that <em>The Division 3</em> is “<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489">shaping up to be a monster</a>.” In addition to its recently revealed Realism Mode, The <em>Division 2</em> is also getting its delayed Survivors mode later this year.</p>

 <p>If this Definitive Edition of the original game doesn’t disappoint, fans of the apocalyptic shooter will be eating well. <em>Destiny 2</em> fans might even be envious. Something they’ve never had much reason to feel before, if ever.</p>

        <p><span>It wasn’t April Fool’s Day when Nintendo announced a big, new update for </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>—but mid-20s programmer Lemmy still thought it was a joke. His girlfriend sent him a link on Instagram, and he thought it was a fake announcement. He went straight to the source: Nintendo, where he realized that yes, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>Nintendo </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> releasing a new update for the five-year-old game</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo’s 3.0 update and Switch 2 upgrade for </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>will be released on January 15, the first big update to the game since 2021. </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> is far from a dead game, but its massive playerbase—which swelled during the COVID-19 pandemic—has, naturally, fell off. Those of us who spent hundreds of hours on our </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> islands for a year and a half have moved on; many of us haven’t visited our islands since. We’ve left messes on our islands, and remain forever indebted to Tom Nook. With the economy inevitably stalling after we took our “go get ‘em!” industriousness with us, the villagers we left behind have spent the last couple of years fending for themselves.</span></p>

 <p><span>“[My girlfriend and I] played </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> when it released and then I pretty much played it every day for a year, and maybe a little less often for another six months,” Lemmy said. “I think I fully stopped playing it summer 2023.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The new content and quality-of-life improvements it introduces make Nintendo’s 3.0 update the push many players needed to return to the game. But that raises a big question: To nuke or not to nuke? For some players, like Lemmy, the </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update was the perfect excuse not only to return to the game, but also to make a fresh start. “When I saw and heard about the update it persuaded me to restart,” he said. “I did that just before the new year.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659292"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659292">Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Morri Koester, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8BqWN05p7W_TOoFB7d9oA">a YouTube creator</a> who has played</span><i><span>&nbsp;New Horizons</span></i><span> for more than 5,000 hours and built a dozen or so islands, told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> that they aren’t making a new island, but are still using the new update “as an excuse to do things differently”—”new year, new me sort of vibes,” they said. Koester has been working on their current island for two years at this point, and unlocked nearly all of the DIYs and catalogue items. The big reason they’re not doing more to totally overhaul their island or start anew is because the 3.0 update has a feature that’ll essentially do that itself—Resetti. Resetti’s Reset Service is a quality-of-life feature intended to clear up big swaths of an island; it’ll remove flowers, decorations, and fencing from a specific area. (Everything, including flowers, shrubs, and trees, will go straight into inventory.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“My island is a mess because I refuse to do the man’s work for him, but I can’t wait to see that mess just poof into a blank canvas to start my new island theme,” Koester said.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of completely restarting, Koester spent the time between the 3.0 announcement and the update’s release day working on a series of different goals—primarily, prepping to complete the Nook Miles goals they set for themself. The 3.0 update’s bulk crafting mechanic, which lets players craft in bulk straight from their inventory, means it’ll be easier to finish some of the harder Nook Miles tasks. One of the Nook Miles challenges that’s notoriously hard to complete is crafting 3,000 furniture items. Koester is looking to reach this goal in a day when the update is released; they’re collecting coconuts so they can craft nearly a thousand Coconut Juices—a furniture item in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, which requires only coconuts to craft—in a day.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I know everyone has a specific opinion or strategy for preparing for the update, whether it’s cataloguing items or gathering resources, but my personal opinion is to prepare for what is going to give you the most joy in the game,” Koester said. “If that means restarting your island on update day to get the full 3.0 experience on a new island, do that. If that means cleaning out your inventory on your five-year-old forever island, do that! If that means collecting a crapton of coconuts like an obsessive gaming gremlin, do that. Prep is all in the mindset, not in specific gameplay.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Lemmy, meanwhile, has spent the time between the update announcement and January 15 working through the early hours of any new island—opening the museum, saving resources.</span></p> <p><span>“I just wanted a fresh start, especially to experience some of the changes and the DLC with a clean canvas, making use of the new items and features without ripping everything up first,” he told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “My preparation is kind of just that—restarting. But also I’m just saving resources, not worrying about decorating my island or anything yet, and just progressing through the early parts of the game with as little planning as I can.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659000"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659000">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Players that are restarting don’t have to go it alone, though: Lots of players on social media and forums are offering to help support players looking to start over. “I’ve been going on and off mystery islands to collect materials for restart care packages,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1pqbpn7/comment/nut7toc/"><span>one person on Reddit wrote</span></a><span>. There’s no right or wrong way to experience a new update, but some players, indeed, do feel pressure to do things the “right” way; lots of players have spent a lot of time on their islands, perfecting every little detail, or rushing to gobble up all the new content.</span></p>

 <p><span>But Koester wants to remind players that even the most seasoned players, like them, don’t necessarily feel prepared.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a big change to the game, with new mechanics, new buildings, new NPCs, and new items,” they said. “Seasoned and new players alike will experience it at the same time for the first time, which in itself is a pretty magical feeling to share. If you’re worried, just know that everyone is going through the ‘new’ feeling, and take it slow. Not everything has to be experienced at once. So no matter what, whether you’re starting a new island, had your island for years, stopped playing for a time, there is no being late to experiencing joy. You’re fashionably on time.”</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987]]></content:encoded>
