            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, folks! I’m back after my week-long vacation. A big thanks to Ethan for handling Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about, for the last week. But the vacation is over, and I bring you news about Nintendo getting hacked, another Sony franchise leaping to PC, 2K not giving up on that extraction shooter it announced last year, Sakurai’s manga, and a report that Jim Carrey might star in an upcoming <em>Jetsons</em> movie.</p> <h2><strong>Nintendo Claims Nothing Was Leaked Following Recent Hack Attempt</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/nintendo-allegedly-hacked-by-crimson-collective-hacking-group-screenshot-shows-leaked-folders-production-assets-developer-files-and-backups">Earlier this month,</a> hacker group Crimson Collective claimed to have gained access to private, unreleased Nintendo information and data. However, the company behind Mario has pushed back against these claims, <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">sharing in a statement</a> that no “personal” or dev-related info was leaked, though the company did confirm some external servers that display Nintendo’s website were affected.</p>

 <p>“We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information,” claimed Nintendo.</p> <h2><strong><em>MLB The Show</em> Might Be Getting A PC Port In The Future</strong></h2> <p>Sony’s San Diego Studio, the company behind the long-running and popular baseball sim <em>MLB The Show</em>, is currently looking to hire a “Senior PC Graphics Programmer” for a “AAA PC” game. Hmmmm. What could that game possibly be? Oh, it’s probably <em>MLB The Show</em>. The franchise has become the de facto MLB game over the last few years and even made the leap to Xbox and Switch due to a lack of other baseball sims and pressure from the MLB. So it would make sense that Sony’s baseball series would land on PC, too.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">PlayStation Studios – San Diego Studio (MLB The Show) is seeking a Senior PC Graphics Programmer for a "AAA PC title" <a href="https://t.co/arat0yL1W2">https://t.co/arat0yL1W2</a> <a href="https://t.co/WsMRDaFKD9">pic.twitter.com/WsMRDaFKD9</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1978574996575490486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><strong>2K Isn’t Giving Up On That Extraction Shooter You Already Forgot About</strong></h2> <p>Remember colorful, <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-ethos-2k-games-twitch-f2p-fortnite-overwatch-1851675279"><em>Fortnite</em>-like extraction hero shooter <em>Project Ethos</em></a>? Probably not. I write about games for a living, and I forgot about this thing until just now. <em>Project Ethos</em> is from 2K-owned 31st Union and was announced last year to a resounding “meh” from folks online. <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173">We’ve not heard much about the game since then</a>, but as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2k-reaffirms-support-for-project-ethos-names-apex-legends-executive-producer-as-head-of-31st-union">reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, an internal memo indicates the game isn’t dead. In fact, 2K has brought on Ben Brinkman, a longtime executive producer on<em> Apex Legends</em>, to help develop the game. I’ll be curious the next time we get a look at <em>Project Ethos</em> and see what’s changed since its big reveal in 2024.</p>

 <h2><strong>A New Manga Based On The Life Of Masahiro Sakurai Is Out Soon</strong></h2> <p>Masahiro Sakurai, the creator behind <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby, is getting a manga adaptation of his life. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/images/202510/55235/506460">As reported by <em>Famitsu</em>,</a> the 160-page book will be released in Japan on November 18. There are currently no plans to release the manga in the United States. Sakurai supervised the creation of the book, which will launch two days before <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a>, directed by Sakurai, arrives on Nintendo Switch 2. Here are the six chapters, according to <em>Famitsu</em>.</p> <ol> <li>Young Sakurai and Games</li> <li>The Birth of Kirby</li> <li>The Beginning of Super Smash Bros</li> <li>The Founding of Sora, Inc</li> <li>The Legacy</li> <li>A Beacon for the Future</li> </ol> <h2><strong>Jim Carrey Reportedly In Talks To Star In Colin Trevorrow’s <em>Jetsons</em> Movie</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jim-carrey-jetsons-movie-colin-trevorrow-live-action/"><em>The Wrap</em> is reporting</a> that <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797">Jim Carrey</a> and director Colin Trevorrow (<em>Jurassic World</em>) are teaming up to make a live-action<em> Jetsons</em> movie. Sure! I guess. I mean, why not? They made a <em>Flintstones</em> live-action movie (and it got a sequel), so I guess it’s only fair that <em>The Jetsons</em> get their own Hollywood movie. I’m not sure how many people are chomping at the bit for this reported adaptation, which might explain why the studio is going after Jim Carrey for the starring role. As someone who doesn’t care at all about <em>The Jetsons</em>, I’m mildly interested in seeing this movie simply because it might have Jim Carrey in it, and I’m always down to see him be a cinematic buffoon.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-theater-return-halloween-2000635744"><em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em> Is Coming Back To Theaters&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">Xbox’s new handheld device is fine, but expensive</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-plants-vs-zombies-remastered-replanted-trailer-cringe-fake-twitch-stream-2000635689">This new trailer for the remastered PvZ game is hard to watch</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[EA’s Saudi Arabia Buyout Faces Fresh Backlash From Senators And Developers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-deal-senate-union-banking-interest-rates-2000636023</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-saudi-arabia-buyout-faces-fresh-backlash-from-senators-and-developers.1326655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have called on the Treasury Department to hit the brakes on Saudi Arabia’s private-equity-backed buyout of Electronic Arts over national security concerns, including the deal giving a foreign country unfettered access to “sensitive consumer data.” They’ve demanded an investigation into the risks associated with the unprecedented agreement which is expected to earn a $500 million windfall for the banking partners involved in the fees alone.</p> <p>“We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company and request that you provide the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs information on how CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) plans to ensure that the national security risks arising from the proposed acquisition may be mitigated,” the Democratic senators <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">wrote in a letter</a> to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week.</p>

 <p>It goes on to outline some of their concerns:</p> <blockquote><p>The PIF’s control over EA’s operations could extend to influencing or directing the company’s design, features, and product decisions to advance the Saudi government’s specific and long-term objectives. PIF would be well positioned to dictate or veto what stories are told to Americans through the popular medium of video games, controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture. In short, the Saudi government’s ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide. As one analyst observed, “Saudi Arabia clearly recognizes the political and cultural influence of video games, especially among young people.”</p></blockquote> <p>In addition to asking for guarantees from the Trump Administration that it’s investigated national security risks associated with the deal and how to mitigate them, the letter also calls for information about any communications the Treasury Department had with Jared Kushner ahead of the buyout’s announcement. Trump’s son-in-law is one of the members of the “consortium” that’s acquiring EA and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">prior reporting claimed</a> his connections to the president would be instrumental in helping it avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p>

 <h2>“EA is not a struggling company”</h2> <p>United Videogame Workers-CWA, a direct-join, industry-wide video game union with the Communications Workers of America, has also called for regulators to investigate the threat of mass layoffs associated with the acquisition. “If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company,” the group <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">wrote in a statement</a> on Thursday.</p>

 <p>It continued, “We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful.” The group is now <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">circulating a petition</a> for fans and developers to write to the Federal Trade Commission in support of investigating the terms of the deal more closely.</p>

 <p>While the CWA has made major in-roads with unionizing game workers at Microsoft-owned studios thanks to a <a href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa">soon-to-sunset labor neutrality agreement</a>, that organizing effort hasn’t yet resulted in unionized shops at places like EA. The leveraged buyout, set to complete sometime in mid-2027, could be the catalyst for teams at Respawn Entertainment or other EA-owned studios to seek union membership.</p>

 <h2>A $500 million windfall for Wall Street</h2> <p>While the exact terms of the buyout are still unknown, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-13/ea-buyout-why-jpmorgan-and-other-banks-have-so-much-riding-on-deal?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that the banking partners involved are set to make a small fortune just from the fees associated with it. Roughly $20 billion of the $55 billion acquisition will be debt-financed, with JP Morgan organizing the loan. <em>Bloomberg c</em>alls it the “biggest debt commitment ever by a single lender for an LBO [leveraged buyout].”</p>

 <p>That’s a lot of risk for EA, which would need to begin servicing high interest rates on the debt as part of the deal, and it’s led to fears that a new round of mass budget cuts and staff layoffs will follow if the merger is approved. While some analysts have argued that going private could free the publisher to pursue longer-term creative visions, it could just as well be an anchor that makes it more cash-hungry than ever.</p> <p>Banks, on the other hand, could make out either way. Anyone helping JP Morgan underwrite the debt will be in line for a piece of the roughly $500 million in banking fees that <em>Bloomberg</em> estimates the deal will bring in. EA’s c-suite will also be in position for a premium payout on all of their stock awards over the years. Most of EA’s employees, on the other hand, will be rewarded with fresh fears of layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Specialty <em>Street Fighter s</em>andwiches are coming to select McDonald’s restaurants in Japan. The collaboration was revealed earlier today with a slick SNES-looking promo that made me want to grab my old 16-bit console back out of the closet. But while the food is inspired by<em> Street Fighter II</em>, there’s also a burger voting contest in <em>Street Fighter VI</em> right now complete with a new McDonalds-themed costume for Vega.</p> <p>The “Street Burgers” go on sale next week for a limited time, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55254">according to <em>Famitsu</em>,</a> and feature a teriyaki burger with an egg on it, a sweet and sour fried chicken sandwich, and a triple cheeseburger. What exactly do those combinations have to do with <em>Street Fighter</em> icons like Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li? No idea. But it’s neat and I want them.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">喰らえ！うまいやつを！ <a href="https://t.co/GpdKbCU5QN">pic.twitter.com/GpdKbCU5QN</a></p> <p>— マクドナルド (@McDonaldsJapan) <a href="https://twitter.com/McDonaldsJapan/status/1978634498175639955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately, they’re only available in Japan and I don’t have any international flights coming up. I’ll settle for watching someone on Instagram do the taste test in the weeks ahead. While the promo is supposed to get people to buy from McDonald’s, it’ll probably just get me to dip back into the <em>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</em> for a mini-impromptu arcade session instead.</p> <p>In addition to the sandwiches, the “Street Burger” event also features an “Overflowing Energy” McFizz that appears to be sparkling apple juice, and a McFloat that adds a scoop of soft-serve ice cream on top. That one you can definitely make at home if you’re feeling tempted.</p>
