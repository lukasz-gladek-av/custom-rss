              <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite offers a lot in a compact tablet, including a 10.9-inch LCD, an included S Pen for note-taking, a long-lasting battery, and USB-C charging. Inside, the tablet features 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage, giving you enough space to run multiple apps and their associated data. Battery life is also quite impressive, with the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite offering up to 16 hours of video playback. When you do need to charge the tablet, the USB-C port provides fast charging, and you should be able to get the battery from empty to nearly full in less than 2 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/">You can pick up the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite on Amazon for only $280, which is $70 off the standard price of $350, for a 20% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful tablet perfect for every use case</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Lite’s 10.9-inch LCD provides a large viewing area while keeping the tablet relatively light and portable. In addition, the display’s brightness automatically adjusts based on the ambient lighting conditions where you are using the tablet.</p>
<p>The Exynos 1380 processor and 6 GB of RAM provide plenty of power for running demanding apps, including video games, social media, and streaming services. While 128 GB may seem like a small amount of internal memory, it is actually sufficient for most tablet users’ needs. However, if you need more space, it also includes a microSD card slot that supports microSD cards up to 2TB.</p>
<p>An included S Pen stylus lets you create handwritten notes and drawings directly on the screen. The S Pen delivers high precision for creating and editing digital content, which is ideal for writing short reminders, drawing simple diagrams, and highlighting text in documents.</p>



<p>Beyond running apps, the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite also includes a range of advanced AI-based features. One example is the Circle to Search option. When enabled, this lets you draw a circle around an item on the screen and instantly view relevant information about it. In addition to search capabilities, you also get AI-based tools for translating text, refining and organizing handwritten notes, and reducing redundant steps within supported apps.</p>
<p>You can connect the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite to your other devices and the broader Galaxy ecosystem using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Through these connections, you can answer smartphone calls from the tablet, transfer ongoing documents and projects between devices, and control compatible smart home devices using the SmartThings Map View feature.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite delivers a strong mix of features and performance at an affordable price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/">At $280, down from its regular price of $350, it offers a cost-effective way to enjoy a large, high-quality 10.9-inch display, long battery life, S Pen support, storage expansion via microSD cards, and Galaxy AI features.</a></p>

            <guid>1413037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you use a Steam Deck or another handheld PC for games or work, and want to switch to a bigger screen for a more immersive experience, a dedicated dock can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">Right now, the 6-in-1 Ugreen Steam Deck dock is on sale at Amazon for $30, down from its usual (and already affordable) $46 price</a>. You’re saving an impressive 35% on an option that packs a punch and offers solid compatibility across a range of devices. Shipping will be free for Prime users, so they’re saving a bit on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comes With a Foldable Stand</h2>
<p>The dock supports HDMI 2.1 output with up to 4K@120Hz, plus VRR, FreeSync, and G-Sync. It’s made to deliver an incredibly smooth and immersive gaming or movie playback experience without screen tearing or noticeable lag. You’ll enjoy sharp, vibrant visuals on compatible displays for all your favorite titles.</p>
<p>There’s 100W PD 3.0 fast charging support, too. The Steam Deck dock delivers up to 85W to your host device, while also powering itself, which means you can keep the connected device charged and running without relying on an external power solution. This is also great for ensuring the secondary device doesn’t run out of power in the middle of an important session with friends.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’re getting two USB-A 3.0 ports, a USB-C data port, Gigabit Ethernet, and the HDMI output. These are more than enough to connect a bunch of peripherals, from controllers to keyboards and external storage solutions, without feeling limited. The thing plays nicely with gaming handhelds like Steam Deck, ROG Ally, ROG Xbox Ally, ROG Xbox Ally X, Region Go, and is also fully compatible with laptops, PCs, Macs, and phones.</p>
<p>Getting started couldn’t be easier. The dock offers a simple plug-and-play setup across Windows, macOS, Linux, and SteamOS, meaning there’s no need to worry about installing drivers or following complicated setup processes. Connect it to your device, and you’re good to go in no time. Just note that the dock is mainly designed for PC-based setups, so it is not compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. Additionally, the built-in foldable stand holds your handheld safely in place as you teach the bad guys a lesson. It’s made out of aluminum alloy and PC+ABS, so it’s sturdy for both daily use and occasional travel.</p>
<p>You can now enjoy all these features and a lot more for just $30, which is basically nothing considering the convenience this dock brings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">The 35% discount is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon.</a> If you’ve been looking for a way to play your favorite titles better, now is the time to make the move.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>People who play gacha games sometimes tell me they’ve spent thousands of dollars in them over the course of years of playing, but in those situations at least they’re doing so on purpose and with full knowledge of their actions. </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span> players, however, were charged thousands of dollars for mundane microtransactions due to a Paypal glitch, prompting developer Hypergryph to take the option to make purchases through the service offline. Not a great start to the game’s launch today.</span></p>   <p><span>Players reported (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arknights-endfield-paypal-launch-issues/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>) multiple odd Paypal charges from the game in various currencies and amounts within hours of </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span>’s launch, ranging anywhere from a few dollars up to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjj50k/comment/o0zecyy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>the equivalent of $3,300 USD</span></a><span>. The glitch seemed to </span><a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultCooperativeAntDuDudu-5OOgZdEZo-lg2RNm"><span>charge players for other users’ purchases</span></a><span> if their Paypal account was linked to the game, hence why some players saw charges in different currencies from around the world, rather than solely in their own domestic currency.</span></p>

 <p><span>Developer Hypergryph was made aware of the issue and has since </span><a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888?s=20"><span>taken the game’s Paypal compatibility offline</span></a><span>, and recommends players use any other means of purchasing microtransactions for the time being.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>We have received reports that the PayPal payment channel is currently undergoing temporary maintenance and upgrades.</span></p> <p><span>All affected Endministrators are advised to use other available payment channels.</span></p> <p><span>Transactions involving abnormal item delivery or payment deduction will be handled accordingly.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Well, it couldn’t possibly get any worse for launch day, right? God willing. Hopefully those four-figure charges weren’t too widespread. Hypergryph says it will be handling all these erroneous transactions, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the company also gave out some in-game currency or rewards as an apology. If you’re playing </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span>, keep an eye out for any odd transactions for a bit in case this affects other payment options as well.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-amd-ryzen-9-cpu-at-its-lowest-price-after-a-sudden-discount-16-core-32-thread-processor-2000661946</link>
            <guid>1412983</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC hardware deals don’t always line up this cleanly, but this one is hard to ignore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">Amazon has dropped the price of AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X by 20%, knocking it down to $519 from its original $649 launch price.</a> For anyone planning a new gaming PC or looking to anchor a high-end upgrade, this discount puts one of AMD’s most powerful consumer CPUs firmly within reach.</p>
<p>Building a PC might look intimidating at first glance, but the real challenge usually comes long before a screwdriver ever touches a case. Sorting through spec sheets, comparing model numbers, and figuring out what actually delivers value can feel overwhelming. CPUs in particular tend to blur together when clock speeds, core counts, and generation labels start stacking up. Finding a processor that’s got power and long-term relevance that doesn’t break the bank is key. So please direct your attention to the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="870" data-end="911">A Flagship CPU Built for Modern Gaming</h2>
<p>Only a little more than a year old, the Ryzen 9 9950X sits at the top of AMD’s consumer lineup. With 16 cores and 32 threads. It’s designed to handle far more than today’s games alone. Paired with a strong GPU, this processor can comfortably drive high refresh rate gaming, including demanding titles running at ultra settings. High-resolution streaming, background apps, and content creation tasks won’t slow it down either.</p>
<p>Clocked at a base speed of 4.3 GHz, the Ryzen 9 9950X delivers excellent performance right out of the box. Anyone who like to squeeze out extra power will appreciate that the chip is fully unlocked for overclocking, with boost speeds reaching up to 5.7 GHz under the right conditions. That extra headroom can make a noticeable difference for video encoding, 3D rendering, and competitive gaming scenarios where every frame counts.</p>



<p>AMD’s Ryzen Master software adds another layer of control. The utility provides real-time monitoring of temperatures, voltages, clock speeds, and memory timings, all from a clean interface. Custom profiles make it easy to switch between performance-focused settings and quieter, power-efficient configurations depending on the task. Keep in mind that the Ryzen 9 9950X does not ship with a stock cooler, and AMD recommends pairing it with a quality liquid cooling solution to maintain optimal performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">At $519, the Ryzen 9 9950X is a serious investment, but also a smart one</a>. CPUs of this caliber tend to age gracefully, staying relevant for years as games and software continue to evolve. This is the kind of processor that can serve as the backbone of a system well into the next generation of PC gaming. With the current Amazon discount in play, now is an excellent moment to lock in elite performance at a much more approachable price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-nintendo-switch-2-optimized-microsd-card-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-at-under-0-16-per-gb-2000661937</link>
            <guid>1412962</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="594">Nintendo’s next-generation console, the Switch 2, has already had a strong start. Since launching earlier last year, Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most successful consoles in gaming history has rolled out several notable exclusives, including <em data-start="248" data-end="266">Mario Kart World</em>, <em data-start="268" data-end="289">Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em data-start="291" data-end="309">Kirby Air Riders</em>, and and <em data-start="334" data-end="359">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While that exclusive lineup is still growing, the real strength of the Switch 2 at launch is its backwards compatibility. The full eight-year library of original Nintendo Switch games can be played on the Switch 2.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="594">That’s a lot of games, but unfortunately, you’re Switch 2 won’t even be able to hold a small fraction of them on its internal storage alone.&nbsp;Fortunately, Nintendo has once again made storage expandable via microSD cards—though not just any card will do this time around.</p>
<p data-start="994" data-end="1336"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Amazon is offering the Samsung P9 Express 512GB microSD card at 25% off.</a> Normally priced at $120, the discount brings it down to $80, saving you $40 for a limited time. Additionally, the 256GB option is down from $55 to just $40, saving you $15.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="1338" data-end="1805">The Switch 2’s updated system architecture delivers improved performance and noticeably faster load times compared to its predecessor. However, that performance leap also means the console requires microSD Express cards to keep up with its faster data speeds. Older microSD cards that worked perfectly fine on the original Switch simply won’t meet the new standards. Express cards tend to cost more, which makes sales like this Samsung P9 deal hard to pass up.</p>
<h2>Triple Your Gaming Storage</h2>
<p data-start="1807" data-end="2237">Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage. While that’s a massive improvement over the original Switch’s paltry 32GB, the usable space is slightly lower than what’s listed on the tin once system software is accounted for. On top of that, Switch 2 games are noticeably larger than last-generation titles. <em data-start="2114" data-end="2176">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Switch 2 Edition</em>, for example, takes up more than 20GB on its own.</p>

<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Adding a 512GB Samsung P9 microSD Express effectively triples your total storage, giving you far more breathing room as new releases roll out over the coming years. With that kind of capacity, you won’t need to constantly juggle downloads or delete old favorites to make room for the next big Nintendo release. I’ve still got my fingers crossed for a new <em data-start="2624" data-end="2634">Star Fox</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Beyond the Nintendo Switch 2, the Samsung P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the original Switch, the Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Xbox Ally.</a> Also it’s not just for gaming. Photographers have been using these for ages too, so maybe you’re just looking to take more photos and videos on your Canon. The deal is just as good regardless of what you plan on using it for.</p>
