              <p>Playing video games with over-the-ear headphones feels like a wholly different experience than just having the audio play through your TV speakers. The word “immersion” gets tossed around so easily these days, but I get it. Having you game sound pumped right into your ears is a more immersive experience. If you don’t have a pair, you can actually get yourself a wireless gaming headset for not too much money. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/">The HyperX Cloud III which normally goes for $150 just dropped by 33% at Amazon.</a> That shaves $50 off the price, bringing what you pay down to only $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><strong>The audio of the HyperX Cloud II gaming headset is strong</strong>. It’s got angled 53mm drivers designed to optimizing your listening experience while gaming. Hear the pitter-patter of enemy footsteps so no one can get the jump on you when playing ranked.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfort Is King</h2>
<p>The HyperX Cloud IIIs are a comfortable wear. The HyperX signature memory foam all along the headband softens and spreads out the pressure along your crown so you won’t get that weird pain some headsets can cause after a long wear. The ear cushions are plush, wrapped in a premium faux leather which serves the purpose of keeping your ears cozy and locking in the sound.</p>
<p>Any wireless headset worth it’s salt needs good battery life. There ain’t no point in going wireless if you always need to plug it back in to charge after just a couple Victory Royales. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/">The HyperX Cloud III is a behemoth of power.</a> This thing can last you up to 120 hours on a single charge. That’s five full days of battery. So long has you make a habit of plugging it back in every couple of weeks when you’re done, you’ll never have to worry about not having a charge to play. If your gaming sessions are lasting longer than five days, please see a doctor.</p>



<p>Not in a party chat? Just playing some solo runs of <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> or something of the like? Go ahead and pop off the detachable microphone to get it out of the way. When you are in those chats and using the microphones, you can expect high-quality audio with clear voice coming through and going out. The mic is noise-cancelling with a built-in mesh filter to ensure your squad mates only hear your voice and not any disruptive noises in the background.</p>
<p>The headset is durable with it’s flexible aluminum frame. It can travel easily without worry and if you’re prone to accidentally knocking your stuff off your coffee table when you walk by, it should be just fine.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-25000mah-laptop-power-bank-drops-below-prime-day-pricing-for-labor-day-game-freely-without-outlets-2000621092</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-25-000mah-laptop-power-bank-drops-below-prime-day-pricing-for-labor-day-game-freely-without-outlets.1283907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe someone challenged Anker to see just how much power and potential they could pack into a portable charger that’s only 6 inches long and weighs a scant 1.3 pounds. There’s really no other logical explanation for <strong>the Anker Laptop Power Bank, a 25,000mAh universally compatible behemoth with that can charge up to 4 devices at a time.</strong></p>
<p>Could this be the best portable charging device of all? Four-device capabilty, two built-in cables including one that doubles as a carrying strap, able to charge an M3 MacBook Air from zero to 50% in just 21 minutes, and the winner of an iF Design Award and a Red Dot Design Award in 2025? Finding out for yourself has never been easier now that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">Amazon’s running a limited-time 30%-off deal that drops the Anker Laptop Power Bank to just $94.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charges Everything, Fast</h2>
<p>The Anker Laptop Power Bank can charge four devices in total, and even with three devices connected for some juice — including a laptop — all three get up to 100W at the same time. Two of the three USB-C ports have dedicated built-in cables, thus eliminating that mad scramble to find one when you’re on the go or in a hurry. One of those built-in USB-C cables extends up to 2.3 feet and can retract back into the body of the Power Bank, while the other doubles as a carrying strap. That’s a lot of cable-bending, so it’s good that Anker has built both cables to endure over 20,000 bends and retractions.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter which device you’re looking to charge — the Anker Laptop Power Bank works with Mac and Windows laptops, smartphones, tablets, and wireless earbuds and headphones from Apple, Samsung, Google, or any brand that’s USB-C compatible, and also Steam Decks and other handheld gaming consoles. The fourth port is USB-A, so older devices aren’t getting left out.</p>



<h2>See It Work</h2>
<p>The hi-res real-time display screen at the front of the Anker Laptop Power Bank gives you all the information you could possibly need, including the output and input wattage for all four ports, remaining charge time, and the temperature and health of the Laptop Power Bank itself. The Laptop Power Bank takes its own temperature and those of the devices it’s connected to 3 million times per day, basically eliminating any chance of an excessive-heat-related failure. It’s TSA approved, so it’s the ultimate travel accessory to keep all of your devices up and running.</p>
<p>There’s a very solid case to be made that the Anker Laptop Power Bank is indeed the very best portable charger on the market. The combination of compact size, power output, number of devices it can charge, built-in cables, and safety measures is unparalleled, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">now during Amazon’s limited-time 30% off deal, so is the $94 price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate’s Portable 2TB Hard Drive Is Just $5 More Than the 1TB, Almost Free Insurance Policy for Gamers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-portable-2tb-hard-drive-is-just-5-more-than-the-1tb-almost-free-insurance-policy-for-gamers-2000621088</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-portable-2tb-hard-drive-is-just-5-more-than-the-1tb-almost-free-insurance-policy-for-gamers.1283883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A catastrophic data loss goes way beyond just losing files. You could have digitized photos or home movies on your hard drive, and if they’re not backed up when your computer meets with a sudden disaster, they’re gone forever. That’s when your data loss becomes a huge ball of emotional stress that you really could do without.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">The $70 price attached to the Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive at Amazon during a limited-time deal</a> might be the least expensive insurance policy you’ll find today, and that’s true for PC and Mac users, and also Xbox and PlayStation gamers. (Because losing game data also sucks.) It’s two terabytes of plug-and-play, cross-platform-compatible peace of mind at an exceptional price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast and Secure</h2>
<p>The Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive works with USB 3.0 for super-fast file transfers of up to 120MB/s, and also with USB 2.0 on older devices. Either way, there’s no app or driver you need to install, and it doesn’t need any external power source. It’s strictly plug-and-play across all of its compatible platforms. The included 18-inch USB 3.0 cable gives you flexibility when it comes to where to set up the drive. (There’s really nothing worse than those cheap 4-inch cables packaged with other drives.)</p>
<p>The Seagate 2TB drive works with automatic backup apps like Apple’s Time Machine, and also as a drag-and-drop interface. If you want to take your data or game files on the go, the Seagate is literally pocket-sized, barely over a half-inch in thickness and exceptionally light, and built sturdily enough that you don’t have to worry about tossing it into a backpack on your way out the door.</p>



<h2>Backup for your Backup</h2>
<p>Things <em>do</em> happen, which is why you’re buying a reliable backup drive in the first place. And if some awful fate were to befall your Seagate drive, it comes with a year of Seagate’s Rescue Service, which depending on the severity of the damage would either repair the drive or extract the data from it and send it back to you on a new drive.</p>
<p>A smart and increasingly common practice is to copy your most precious and/or sensitive data and files onto one drive and store it in a safe location outside of your home, thus covering yourself in case of fire or other natural disaster. At the current $70 Amazon price for the 2TB Seagate Portable Hard Drive, having one emergency backup drive offsite and another to keep with your computer is a smart tactic. But having at least one fast, reliable backup drive is essential, so <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">head to Amazon now and grab a Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive while it’s on sale for just $70.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is good noise? “Golden” by Hunter/X from <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em> is good noise. New episodes of Jamie Loftus’ <em>Sixteenth Minute (of Fame) </em>podcast is good noise. The guns firing in the bank heist scene of Michael Mann’s <em>Heat</em> is good noise. What about bad noise? The couple on the bus with you arguing is bad noise. The turbine engines on flight is bad noise. Your cubicle’s neighbor punching away at their mechanical keyboard is bad noise. Wouldn’t it be swell if we could just cancel out the bad noise so we can focus in on the good noise? Well, you can do just that with <strong>the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless noise cancelling headphones.</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">For a limited time, Amazon has them for a whopping 43% off this labor day weekend. Normally priced at $348, you can currently pick them up for a solid $150 off.</a> That means you only have to pay $198.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones utilize digital noise cancellation to ensure you can hear each and every note or word clearly with no disruptive sounds from your environment coming through. Two microphones in each earcup work together to capture and eliminate surrounding noise when listening to your music, podcasts, or audiobooks, removing it in real time with the help of the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1.</p>

<p>The noise-cancelling tech also works to amplify your voice during calls. Five microphones work to deliver clear voice quality. They isolate your voice from any background noise so the person on the other end hears you and just you.</p>
<p>The headphones are designed for all day listening. You can expect a full 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. That’ll last you the whole workday, your commute, and beyond. If you ever find yourself having forgotten to charge it, no need to worry. Just plugging it in for 10 minutes will let you listen for a solid five hours.</p>



<h2>Multipoint Connection</h2>
<p>One standout convenience with the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones is that they can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at once. This is great as it allows you to be connected to your phone and a gaming console at the same time. It’s perfect for wanting to listen to your own music or podcasts through Spotify or something while playing a game on your Nintendo Switch. You can take a call without disconnecting and reconnecting anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">Through Labor Day weekend, you can grab yourself a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless noise-cancelling headphones for $150 off.</a> The price is down to just $198 for a limited time.</p>
