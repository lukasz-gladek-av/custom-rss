              <p>The Bose SoundLink Plus is a portable wireless speaker that’s designed for both indoor and outdoor use. A compact, rectangular body with a looped carrying strap makes it easy to hang, grab, or slip into a bag when you’re ready to go. It’s built to be rugged, dustproof, and waterproof (IP67), allowing it to handle wet, sandy conditions and random rain showers without interrupting your music. Plus, its battery lasts up to 20 hours, providing solid playtime for your playlists, podcasts, and background music until you need to recharge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/">Go to Amazon and buy the Bose SoundLink Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $199, down from its original price of $269, for a savings of $70 and 26%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful speaker that projects sound beautifully</h2>
<p>The sound produced by the Soundlink Plus is engineered to produce rich bass and clean mids, making your music feel full and robust, not thin. The speaker can produce enough decibels to comfortably fill a room or an outdoor area, making it perfect for both relaxing background listening and concentrated sessions. So, whether you’re playing music, podcasts, or dialogue-driven shows, this speaker will provide enough presence to make them audible.</p>
<p>Portability and durability were key factors in the design of this speaker. The loop allows you to hang it securely or attach it to a strap, while the durable outer shell protects against minor mishaps like drops and knocks. Since the speaker is also dustproof and waterproof, you can place it on a picnic table, a beach towel, a poolside ledge, etc., without worrying about damaging it. You can also use the speaker to charge your mobile device if needed, as it can double as a power bank.</p>



<p>Wireless features extend the capabilities of the SoundLink Plus beyond a single-speaker setup when you want to expand coverage. For example, you can pair two SoundLink Plus speakers together for greater stereo width, or engage Party Mode with other Bose portable speakers to play the same track across multiple locations. Bose’s SimpleSync feature also lets this speaker connect with certain Bose smart soundbars and speakers, which can be convenient when you want to send a movie or playlist to other parts of your home without physically moving speakers.</p>
<p>The Bose SoundLink Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker has an IP67 rating, an estimated 20 hours of battery life, a USB-C charging port, the ability to fine-tune your EQ via the Bose app, and the ability to pair with multiple speakers using multi-speaker modes, all at a reduced price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/">At $199, compared to the regular retail price of $269, this is a great deal for a high-quality portable wireless speaker to use as your primary music source at home or on the go.</a></p>

These images are from the games’ 2024 beta, so ideally, they’ll look more polished when we see them later this month. We can see several varied environments, including an underwater area, a frozen tundra, grassy fields, and a city. Some of them are very clearly from an early stage in development, though, where a lot of the general shapes are laid out but the details and textures haven’t been added yet.</span></p>

              <p>Is there anything more frustrating than heading out and realizing your phone or laptop is almost out of power, or dying in the middle of something important when you’re on the go? Probably not.</p>
<p>This is where an efficient power bank can come in handy, and now is a great time to pick one up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/">We just spotted the 20,000mAh, 165W Ugreen Nexode power bank going for $70 at Amazon, after a solid 30% discount on its usual $100 price</a>. This offer is open to all shoppers, and the retailer is also offering free delivery on your purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charge Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>This portable, yet mighty charger features a built-in 25.6inch (65cm) retractable USB-C cable that expands when needed and tucks away once you’re done topping your devices up. That means you don’t need to worry about carrying extra wires with this power bank at hand – just toss it in your backpack, and you’re good to go. Additionally, the cable is tested for over 25,000 retractions and 10,000 bends, so it’s going to comfortably support your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p>There are also two additional ports with up to 165W max output, so you can charge a MacBook Pro and an iPhone simultaneously (delivering 100W and 65W respectively). In a setup like this, the power bank can take a 16-inch MacBook Pro from 0 to 43% in just 30 minutes. The informative smart display at the front shares real-time port status and power flow, keeping you in the loop about the charging situation at all times.</p>



<p>The 20,000mAh high capacity is built for demanding days, as it’s capable of supporting all-day business activities without searching for outlets. For reference, that’s enough power to fully power an 11-inch iPad Pro twice, a Galaxy S24 Ultra up to three times, or a 13-inch MacBook Air just over once. Recharging the power bank doesn’t take forever, either, thanks to its 100W max input that juices it back up to full in just under 2 hours. You’ll also appreciate how this thing is equipped with high-rate battery cells that are specifically designed for endurance, and can retain up to 70% health after 1000 full charge cycles. Translation? A longer lifespan, which ensures you won’t really need to replace the power bank anytime soon.</p>
<p>Security is taken just as seriously. Ugreen has packed the Nexode with 13 layers of protection to guard against high-temperature, low-temperature, overvoltage, overcharge, overdischarge, short circuit, and more. All things considered, if you’re looking for a reliable solution that lets you power all your essential devices – from laptops to smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and earbuds – on the go, this Nexode power bank can help. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/">It offers great speeds with a huge battery capacity, and you can now snap it up for just $70 at Amazon</a>. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-nintendo-ram-memory-ai-2000666430</link>
            <guid>1428175</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The question on every video game investor and analyst’s lips during the recent Nintendo earnings Q&amp;A was whether the Mario maker will have to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326">raise the price of the Switch 2</a> due to spiking memory prices amid <a href="https://kotaku.com/dell-ces-ai-hardware-llm-gpu-2000657729">AI-fueled shortages</a>. RAM is through the roof and graphics cards are getting delayed, but Nintendo is keeping a cool head through the market turmoil.</p> <p>“We are working to secure stable supplies of memory components by holding discussions from a long-term perspective with our business partners,” president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">said this week</a>. “As a result, the recent rise in memory prices did not have a significant impact on hardware profitability in the third quarter. In addition, we do not expect any significant impact in the fourth quarter.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “However, if this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability. If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond.” As a result, Nintendo confirmed that no decision on raising the price of the $450 Switch 2 has been made yet, but if and when that time comes, it will decide based on things like the “platform’s installed base, sales trends, and the market environment.”</p> <p>Not satisfied with that ambiguity and uncertainty, Q&amp;A members kept grilling Furukawa for more specifics. The company admitted that the recent spike in component prices “exceeds our expectations” but said that it’s been stockpiling inventory and arranging long-term deals to absorb the shocks. Even if prices continue to rise into the summer, Nintendo can put off any painful pricing changes for a bit longer. But not indefinitely.</p>

 <h2>Selling Switch 2 at a profit vs. growing the install base</h2> <p>If push comes to shove, will Nintendo maximize profitability or growing the hardware’s install base? “It is difficult to predict the changes in the external environment that are currently taking place, but I think it is not an appropriate approach to be excessively influenced by short-term trends,” Furukawa said. “The second and third years for Nintendo Switch 2 are very important, and if we can expand the hardware installed base, we can use that as a basis to greatly expand software sales.”</p>

 <p>It certainly sounds like Nintendo is going to do everything in its power to avoid making the Switch 2&nbsp;$500 by this time next year. At the same time, if sales momentum picks up even more after the announcement of a new 3D <em>Mario</em>, <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, or the long-awaited Gen 10 <em>Pokémon</em> games, well, maybe it’ll be in a position to do whatever it wants. Nintendo isn’t rushing to embrace one strategy or another just yet.</p> <p>Who knows what will happen to t<a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">he AI bubble</a> in 12 months, what new tariffs will hit consumers in the U.S., or if the company’s most lucrative sales market will be plunged into an unexpected recession? Predicting any of those things is as much a fool’s errand as trying to guess <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-country-dixie-free-update-switch-2-2000661812">what Nintendo’s next move is these days</a>.</p>
