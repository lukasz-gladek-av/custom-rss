As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444">previously teased</a></span>, we saw an upcoming mobile card game, but we also got new looks at the future of <em>Digimon </em>video games and anime in between some (incredibly long) merchandise drops. If you want to watch the nearly three-hour presentation, you can do so below. If you want the highlights, read on.</p></div></div><div><p>Bandai Namco announced <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>last month during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893">PlayStation State of Play showcase</a></span>, and we didn’t see much new from the RPG in the Digimon Con 2025 presentation. However, the team confirmed a few things about the game’s structure, noting that you’ll be able to move between the real world and the digital world, both of which have their own towns and environments where you can walk around, interact with the locals, and prepare before embarking on quests. The team also introduced some of the characters you’ll meet, revealing that you can choose between a male or female protagonist and that the character you don’t pick will be your “operator,” assisting you throughout the game. The presentation also announced that the starter Digimon this time around are Patamon, Gomamon, and DemiDevimon, and there will be over 450 Digimon you can recruit in total.</p></div><div><p>The presentation then shifted over to the card game. After showing off the new Protector of Light and Hero of Hope starter decks, new booster pack sets, and a new run of the <em>Digimon Liberator </em>online comic, the showcase revealed the new mobile game <em>Digimon Alysion</em>. The card game app seems a bit more elaborate than <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, as it includes a story mode complete with a new cast of characters. It will feature cards that are in the current TCG, as well as exclusive cards only found in the game. New Digimon and characters will make their debut in the game as well. A closed beta test is in the works.</p></div><div><p>There were two major announcements on the anime side. The first was the reveal of <em>Digimon Adventure Beyond</em>, an OVA set between the <em>Digimon Adventure tri. </em>and <em>Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna </em>films. The four-minute video is available to stream on the official <em>Digimon</em> channel. The more notable announcement was <em>Digimon Beatbreak</em>, the next season of the anime set to premiere in October 2025.</p><p>The short teaser is light on details, but references “emotion-devouring digital lifeforms.” We also see a brief glimpse of the new protagonist and their Digimon partner, but that’s about it. <em>Beatbreak </em>is bringing <em>Digimon </em>back to TV after a two-year hiatus. The last anime series, <em>Digimon Ghost Game</em>, concluded in 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Using FPGA technology (which replicates original hardware instead of emulating it), the company promised the “ultimate solution to play N64 today in total fucking glory” for just $250. It was scheduled to release last year but ended up being delayed until early 2025. </p><p>Earlier this week, the company delayed it again. “Analogue 3D shipping is delayed (as of March 18th, 2025) and is now shipping by July 2025,” an update to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the pre-order FAQ read</a></span>. “We are working hard to get your 3D order in hands asap and appreciate your patience.

Especially since the Analogue 3D is still currently sold out. </p><p>Of course, even if Luckey’s M64 turns out to be as good as the Chromatic, it’ll still require buying retro gaming hardware from a guy who says stuff like, “The United States should not be the world police. We should be the world gun store.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it’s also a big, complicated game with a lot of different mechanics, systems, features, and options. And <em>Shadows </em>doesn’t always do a great job of explaining how all of this stuff works.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,196299,195922" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>So let us help you out with 25 tips for<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Don’t worry, there are no spoilers below, and these tips will be useful both for people just hopping in and for folks who have played a dozen or so hours. </p><h2 id="h6448"><a id=""></a><strong>Use Balanced Mode If You Can</strong></h2><p>If you have a 120hz TV I recommend playing the game in “Balanced” mode. In this mode, <em>Shadows</em> runs at 40FPS instead of the slower 30FPS or super-smooth 60FPS. But on a 120hz display, 40FPS feels great and still lets the game look really sharp. If you can’t use that mode, the 60FPS “Performance” option is a good second choice that loses some clarity in pursuit of smoother gameplay. </p><h2 id="h6449"><a id=""></a><strong>Regardless of the mode you pick your HQ runs at 30 FPS</strong></h2><p>Here’s something weird: Your main base of operations that you update and build over time always runs at 30FPS. I guess this is because of some tech issues involving how you can stuff the base with animals and buildings. But yeah, it’s not just you; the game just runs slower in that area. </p><h2 id="h6450"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t worry about catching up on<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> lore</strong></h2><p>While there is some modern-day story stuff in here if you look for it, 90 percent of the game is focused on the characters living in feudal Japan and their own goals. So don’t feel like you need to do homework before hopping in. </p><h2 id="h6451"><a id=""></a>Use the “Pathfinder” feature</h2><figure id="" data-id="2b3f8639122a6d07c6a3b6edbbef10ac" data-recommend-id="image://2b3f8639122a6d07c6a3b6edbbef10ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b3f8639122a6d07c6a3b6edbbef10ac" data-recommend-id="image://2b3f8639122a6d07c6a3b6edbbef10ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, I get it. You probably think you don’t need a floating white line that points you near your objective or map marker. I thought that too...at first. But the large map in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>is filled with big swaths of mountain forests which are really annoying to cross.</p><p>So instead of doing that, save some time and frustration and just hold Left on the d-pad to activate “Pathfinder” and follow the white line to your next faraway objective or location.</p><h2 id="h6452"><a id=""></a><strong>Swap between the two characters often</strong></h2><p>While you can complete most of <em>Shadows </em>as just Naoe or Yasuke, I highly recommend swapping between them periodically as you play. I think this is a lot more fun, as you essentially get to two different games in one: A sneaky ninja sim and an action-packed samurai adventure. </p><p>It’s also helps the very big game feel less tedious in long stretches. Bored of sneaking? Switch! Want to climb more? Switch! Mission too hard? Switch! Don’t get stuck on one when playing both is so much better. </p><h2 id="h6453"><a id=""></a><strong>Upgrade Naoe’s Shinobi and Assassin tree ASAP</strong></h2><p>At the start of the game, the sneaky Naoe is a solid fighter and ninja, but she becomes a force of nature once you unlock her full Assassin toolbox, including the ability to one-hit-kill large enemies, assassinate anyone during a fight, and even the always cool ability to take out two targets at the same time.</p><h2 id="h6454"><a id=""></a>Oh, and get her smoke bomb, too!</h2><p>This is found and unlocked in the shinobi skill tree and will let you escape in a flash, which can be useful if you are surrounded by a large group of angry samurai. </p><h2 id="h6455"><a id=""></a><strong>Upgrade Yasuke’s Samurai tree ASAP</strong></h2><p>He can become a one-man army if you dump points into this tree early on, granting you some powerful boosts to combat, health, and unlocking abilities that you can use regardless of your weapon. </p><h2 id="h6456"><a id=""></a><strong>Level up your Knowledge Level by doing side activities </strong></h2><p>In <em>Shadows</em>, you level up by earning XP, which grants you skill points that can be used to unlock or upgrade new options in the skill tree. But while XP levels you up, it doesn’t grant you access to the later sections of each skill tree. To do that, you’ll need to improve your Knowledge level. This can be done by completing side activities marked with orange icons. These include meditating, finding hidden pages at temples, archery competitions, and more. </p><h2 id="h6457"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t be dumb like me: Click the Knowledge Level icon to see more upgrades</strong></h2><p>Perhaps the game says this, I don’t know for sure, but it wasn’t until nearly 30 hours into the game that I realized you can CLICK the knowledge level icon in the skill tree menu and see a different universal tree. All the skills here are passive bonuses, and while you shouldn’t dump points into them until later in the game when you’ve maxed out other trees, it’s still good to be aware of it.</p><h2 id="h6458"><a id=""></a><strong>Help people in random encounters to earn free scouts</strong></h2><p>Scouts are useful for gathering resources, finding objectives, and even clearing your wanted status in a region. But you can only use them once and then you have to wait for them to refresh when the season changes (or you can spend 200 gold to refresh them). However, if you are out and about you’ll sometimes see people being abused by guards or robbed by bandits. If you save the day, the person you help can become a free scout for you, or can reveal some valuable loot on the map if you don’t need a scout. </p><h2 id="h6459"><a id=""></a><strong>Oh yeah, you can use scouts to clear your wanted status</strong></h2><p>I didn’t realize this until way too many hours into the game, but you can burn two scouts to clear your wanted status in a providence of the map. Seriously, I had no idea this option was in the game.</p><p> It can be spotted at the bottom-right corner of the map screen and will tell you to press a certain button depending on your platform. This can be useful if you need to play as a certain character in a region where you got in trouble and guards attack on sight. </p><h2 id="h6460"><a id=""></a>The seasons and weather can be helpful</h2><figure id="" data-id="bb32da8eff6aa3bccb01cb42c7e6a6cd" data-recommend-id="image://bb32da8eff6aa3bccb01cb42c7e6a6cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb32da8eff6aa3bccb01cb42c7e6a6cd" data-recommend-id="image://bb32da8eff6aa3bccb01cb42c7e6a6cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don’t assume the change of seasons in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>is purely cosmetic. Some weather conditions and seasonal changes can help you sneak into an area easily without being spotted. For example, deep snow can  hide you if you go prone, and heavy rainstorms can help conceal you as well, especially at night. Speaking of...</p><h2 id="h6461"><a id=""></a>Wait until nighttime to find more sleepy guards</h2><p>During the night you’ll spot sleeping guards more frequently. These guards can’t see you and can be easily taken out. Just remember loud noises can still alert them instantly. </p><h2 id="h6462"><a id=""></a><strong>Use the left trigger / focus mode! </strong></h2><p><em>Shadows</em>, by default, doesn’t give you specific map or in-game markers to go to. Instead, quests and tasks provide some hints about where to go and then a general area to search in. This can be annoying at times, but make sure to use your focus mode a lot and look for blue dots to find quest-related NPCs or items. This will save you from running around for 20 minutes trying to find the person you need to kill. </p><h2 id="h6463"><a id=""></a><strong>Use Naoe’s grappling hook to climb pagodas quickly</strong></h2><p>I suspect a big reason Ubisoft added the grappling hook at all was to help you quickly and easily scale pagodas, which can be annoying to scramble up normally.</p><h2 id="h6464"><a id=""></a><strong>Yasuke can’t climb ropes hanging across gaps</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Trust me. The rope will break and you’ll come crashing down to the earth. You can leap off high points into piles of hay, but the haystack will be destroyed and Yasuke will make a loud noise that will alert guards. </p><h2 id="h6465"><a id=""></a><strong>When attacking bases, destroy all bells</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Bells can be spotted easily as they are found on towers with ladders. These bells can be shot from afar or sabotaged by hand close up by either Naoe or Yasuke. And you should do this as it will stop enemies from ringing the bell, calling reinforcements, and making whichever character you are playing as wanted in the providence. </p><h2 id="h6466"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t ignore your HQ / Assassins base</strong></h2><p>You don’t have to decorate it or anything if you don’t want to, but periodically return (I tried to do so each time the seasons changed) to upgrade your favorite gear at the blacksmith and expand the HQ. I recommend building any facility that helps you earn XP faster and upgrading buildings to unlock new features, including the ability to create loadouts. </p><h2 id="h6467"><a id=""></a><strong>Use currency to unlock more safehouses around the map</strong></h2><p>These locations are extremely useful for fast travel, can refill your tools and rations for free, and you can refresh your scouts there, too. And if you unlock the Assassin building at your HQ and upgrade it, even more of them will pop up on the map and all of these hideouts will now cost less to unlock. </p><h2 id="h6468"><a id=""></a><strong>Focus mode can help you locate Samurai leaders and their chests </strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0ad87dd187bd6999b726d2475c9066b7" data-recommend-id="image://0ad87dd187bd6999b726d2475c9066b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ad87dd187bd6999b726d2475c9066b7" data-recommend-id="image://0ad87dd187bd6999b726d2475c9066b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When infiltrating a castle to kill its samurai leaders, use focus mode (pull the left trigger on consoles) to quickly find and mark them. The leaders will be marked as white dots. Even Yasuke, who doesn’t have fancy Eagle Vision like Naoe, can target them through walls using focus vision.</p><p>Once all the samurai leaders are dead, don’t forget to open the big red chest in the castle—also marked by a white dot—for some really good loot. </p><h2 id="h6469"><a id=""></a><strong>Hit the deck! (Go prone) </strong></h2><p>It’s a very useful new move that both Yasuke and Naoe can pull off and it can make sneaking around much easier. If an enemy starts to see you and there’s not a bush or wall nearby, try going prone. That will often be enough to help you escape without being seen. </p><h2 id="h6470"><a id=""></a><strong>Use shadows, too! </strong></h2><p>They are new to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, powerful, and worth using, especially as Naoe. Try blowing out candles and knocking over lamps to make environments darker and better for sneaking around. </p><h2 id="h6471"><a id=""></a><strong>You can roll-hop up most surfaces </strong></h2><p>Okay, this is not by design and it might get patched, but I discovered that if you quickly mash the roll and climb/jump buttons while pushing up, you can climb most steep cliffs and “unclimbable” slopes. This helped me cheese a few puzzle areas and dodge some castle defenses more efficiently. </p><h2 id="h6472"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t try to assassinate samurai who are on alert </strong></h2><p>Samurai are well trained and can’t be assassinated from the front if they are on high alert and are searching for you. Even if you come at them from the shadows, it won’t be enough. They’ll catch your blade and knock you back. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Prime Minister Ishiba was asked about the topic during a budget meeting by House of Councillors member Hiroyuki Kada, who represents the region where the Itatehyōzu Shrine is located, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a report by <em>IGN</em></a></span>.</p><p> “I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life,” Kada told Ishiba. “Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided.” </p><p>The Prime Minister responded, “Defacing a shrine is out of the question—it is an insult to the nation itself. When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them.”</p><p>The concern seems to be primarily about the potential for the features in the game to encourage copycat attacks in real life, as politicians the world over have frequently worried about with regard to other games—primarily <em>Grand Theft Auto—</em>that mix hyper-realistic simulations with the freedom to commit violent acts. Another issue expressed in the meeting was the lack of express permission from the Shrine to have its name and likeness included in the first place. </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, originally scheduled to come out last fall, has already been delayed twice. Developers at Ubisoft have worked on adding extra layers of polish and fine-tuning to avoid any potential snags at launch that might derail the blockbuster’s early momentum. Following disappointing sales for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and mounting financial pressures from other delays and cancellations, reports have swirled about a potential sale or break-up of the French publisher. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>currently has an 81 on Metacritic, in line with previous games in the franchise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647">while our own review</a></span> lauded it as “one of the most dynamic, fun, and best-looking open-world games of the current console generation.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
