              <p>The AirPods Pro 2 are still Apple’s flagship earbuds and they sit just one generation behind the recently released Pro 3. Here’s the thing though: the improvements between these two generations are incremental at best and definitely don’t justify paying 30 percent more for the newer model. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">you can grab the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169, down from their usual $249 price tag</a>. That’s<strong> an all-time low on Amazon</strong> and makes these earbuds three times cheaper than Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The first reason listeners are drawn to AirPods Pro 2 is that they fix the problem with listening to audio in noisy settings in the first place. <strong>Noise cancellation in these AirPods is made possible with Apple’s own H2 chip</strong>&nbsp;where it picks up background noise using external microphones and generates anti-noise that effectively cancels it out before it hits your eardrums. The end result is incredibly quiet background noise so that listeners can enjoy their audio with the volume turned down to safe levels rather than competing with background noise.</p>



<h2>Advanced Audio Technology for a Fraction of the Price</h2>
<p>The custom-built driver in each earbud produces<strong> high-fidelity sound with rich bass response</strong>, clear treble, and balanced midrange frequencies that bring out the details in your music. Apple’s Adaptive EQ continuously adjusts the sound profile based on how the earbuds fit in your specific ear shape, which means you get consistent audio quality even if the buds shift slightly during movement. This real-time tuning happens automatically in the background, so you never have to fiddle with manual EQ settings or worry about suboptimal sound. The <strong>personalized spatial audio feature creates an immersive three-dimensional soundstage</strong> that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you rather than just two points inside your ears.</p>



<p>The <strong>transparency mode</strong> is one such feature that totally unites the manner in which you use your wireless earbuds in your daily life. You no longer need to physically take out your earbuds every time someone is talking to you or if it is an announcement that you need to pay attention to; rather, with the transparency mode, all you need to do is press the stem, in which case you can immediately understand what is happening around you without having to stop the musical playback in the background, thanks to the external microphones that allow background sounds to seep in while keeping the volume low so that it doesn’t completely pause the playback.</p>
<p>The<strong> hearing aid function is a true innovation</strong> that is more than just an ordinary consumer audio device feature. Following a basic hearing test done by using the app in partnership with the AirPods Pro 2, it is possible to amplify certain frequencies according to your own hearing needs, thus serving as an authentic hearing aid for mild to moderate hearing loss using a clinical-grade level device for the true benefit derived from its usage.</p>
<p>Listening time with the battery is almost six hours with active noise cancellation on, and then<strong> the charging case gives multiple charges for a total playback time of almost 30 hours combined</strong>. The use of USB-C is also a big improvement since it is compatible with charging any other Apple device such as the new iPhone 15 series, iPad, MacBook, and also AirPods with just one cord, thus eliminating cords on your desk or in your backpack. Also, the <strong>charging case is compatible with any Qi-certified charging pad</strong>, plus it is also compatible with the new MagSafe charging devices.</p>
<p>At $169, AirPods Pro 2 provides the essential high-end benefits one would want in a daily listening experience at an affordable price.</p>
