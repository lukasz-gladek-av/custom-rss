              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/they-finally-did-it-fallout-76-is-pretty-good-now-1845315294"><em>Fallout 76</em></a> is going to Ohio, and waiting for players in the new region is none other than the Ghoul from the popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138"><em>Fallout</em> TV show on Amazon</a>. This new expansion, which the devs claim is the biggest map expansion they’ve done yet, is out later this year and also adds bounty hunting, new characters, fresh mutated creatures to kill, and more.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7uCbEFtoNrbecM1hMWtY3u/fallout-76-burning-springs-first-look">Bethesda announced <em>Fallout 76′</em>s next big update,</a> Burning Springs. This new update is set to arrive in early December for all platforms and adds a brand new region to the game’s map. The region is named Burning Springs, hence the name of the update. This area is set in Ohio, a location that we’ve not seen much of in past <em>Fallout</em> media, giving the devs a bit of a blank slate to do whatever they want.&nbsp; And according to the people making it, Burning Springs is directly inspired by <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas.</em></p>

 <p>Here’s a big update video from Bethesda going into more detail about the new region, what players can expect to find there, and more:</p>   <p>“The new region is terrifyingly beautiful and will feel very familiar to fans, drawing its main influences from&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3 </em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>,” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76s-burning-springs-draws-its-main-influences-from-fallout-3-and-fallout-new-vegas-as-players-venture-to-a-whole-new-state-ohio/">creative director Jon Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We wanted it to remind folks of what they came to know and love in <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. And so when we set out to make this new region, the three pillars that we gave to the team were, ‘It’s got to have desert, death claws and Raiders,’ and to me, that captures the tone, the essence, and the danger of those games.”</p>

 <p>While it’s neat that the new area is inspired by past <em>Fallout</em> games, the big news with Burning Springs is that it will directly connect to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>. As mentioned, the Ghoul from the show will be an NPC that people can talk to in <em>Fallout 76′</em>s new region. Located in Highway Town, he will hand out various repeatable bounties to players and is even voiced by Walton Goggins himself. Another example of the show and game syncing up: The free update is launching at around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-teaser-deathclaw-new-vegas-gamescom-2000618496">same time season two of the show is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video</a>. And that’s not an accident.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>© Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>“Burning Springs is in total tonal tandem with <em>Fallout</em> season two, “Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em>. “It is poised to be our biggest update ever, and will coincide with the timing of the premiere of the Amazon <em>Fallout</em> series season two that’s coming this December.”</p>

 <p>The new location in <em>Fallout 76</em> will be added to the Western edge of the current map in a similar way to how the last world expansion, <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/fallout-76-skyline-valley">Skyline Valley</a>, was added in 2024 to the bottom of the map. To access this new area, players will travel across the Point Pleasant Bridge, leaving Appalachia and entering Ohio.</p> <p>Console players will have to wait until December to make that journey to Ohio to meet the Ghoul. But PC players willing to check out the update before launch will be able to start visiting the new region as early as tomorrow, October 2, via <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s testing server. Bethesda also says full patch notes for the big update will arrive at that time, too.</p>
