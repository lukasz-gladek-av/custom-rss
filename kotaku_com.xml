              <p>Well, folks, it seems like billionaire nepo baby David Ellison is probably going to get his way after all. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-paramount-trump-bidding-war-2000651372">throwing a hissy fit</a> because Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">sell its company to Netflix</a> instead of the Ellison-owned Paramount Skydance, Ellison launched a months-long campaign, including a hostile takeover bid that appealed directly to WBD shareholders, to get the company to reconsider. Netflix decided to put an end to Ellison’s aggressive posturing by allowing Paramount Skydance to submit a best and final offer for WBD earlier this month—and WBD’s board has now found that new offer to be a “company superior offer.” Netflix had four days to respond and raise their bid, but, in a surprise move just hours after Paramount’s superior offer news broke, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/netflix-declines-to-raise-offer-for-warner-bros-1236738005/">Netflix declined to raise its bid</a> and dropped out of the running. This has left the door wide open for a Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. Discovery merger.</p> <p>Paramount Skydance’s new offer of $31 per share for WBD’s entire portfolio, including its cable channels, puts the deal at roughly $111 billion. Netflix had offered $27 a share for only Warner Bros.’ film studio and HBO Max, a deal worth approximately $83 billion. In a press statement, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said, “…this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p>

 <p>The Netflix deal was also facing increased regulatory scrutiny from a group of <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/netflix-warner-bros-deal-bad-for-america-attorneys-general-1236735795/">Trump-aligned attorneys general</a>.&nbsp; A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. Discovery merger will likely have an easier path to approval, thanks to the Ellison family’s close ties to the Trump administration. Ellison’s apparent willingness to cave to Trump’s outrageous demands, as demonstrated by a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-1236465383/">$16 million lawsuit settlement</a> Paramount paid out to Trump, is a deeply troubling sign about the integrity of the person who will soon own Batman, among many other culturally significant properties. Read Netflix’s full statement below.</p> <p><em>Netflix, Inc. today announced that it has declined to raise its offer for Warner Bros. Netflix had earlier received notice from Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) that its Board of Directors has determined Paramount Skydance’s (PSKY) latest proposal constitutes a “Superior Proposal” under the terms of WBD’s existing merger agreement with Netflix. Netflix issued the following statement in response from co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters:</em><br> <em>The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.</em></p>

 <p><em>Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process. We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.</em></p>

 <p><em>Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program.</em></p> <p><em>We will continue to do what we’ve done for more than 20 years as a public company: delight our members, profitably grow our business, and drive long-term shareholder value.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/project-windless-chicken-protagonist-patrik-methe-2000674111</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During a career at Ubisoft that spanned more than a decade, Patrik Méthé worked on series like </span><i><span>Far Cry</span></i><span>,</span><i><span> Rainbow Six</span></i><span>, </span><span>and <em>Splinter Cell</em></span><span>. Now, he’s the creative director on Krafton Montréal’s</span><i><span> Project Windless</span></i><span>,</span><span> an upcoming action RPG in which you play as a big, beefy rooster. </span><span>If you’ve read the Korean fantasy novel series that </span><i><span>Project Windless </span></i><span>is adapting, Lee Youngdo’s <i>The Bird That Drinks Tears</i>, the choice of protagonist may seem odd, as Krafton Montréal could have chosen any of its other three main races, which are not chickens, for its lead role.</span></p> <p><span>In a recently published interview with </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/project-windless-creative-director-says-the-developers-chose-a-9-foot-warlike-rooster-goliath-as-their-protagonist-because-literally-every-candidate-interviewed-to-work-on-the-game-wanted-to-play-as-one-all-of-them-and-we-were-like-ok/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, Méthé revealed the reason behind the team’s choice of leading man/chicken: every single potential hire Méthé interviewed thought it would be cool. “When every candidate was leaving, they would say, ‘I hope I will hear from you, but one thing for sure, I want to be able to play that character.’ All of them. All of them—and we were like, ‘OK.'”</span></p>

 <p><span>Still, Méthé wasn’t certain that the team had made the correct choice until the first trailer for </span><i><span>Project Windless</span></i><span> premiered at <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-sony-ps5-god-war-castlevania-kena-castlevania-2000668291">Sony’s State of Play</a> on February 13. “We knew that the hero would create a shock, but I was surprised by the amount of people who were like, ‘<em>W</em></span><i><span>hat the f—huh?</span></i><span>,</span><em><span>‘</span></em><span> but then were like, ‘I’m in,’ before three quarters of the trailer had even played.”</span></p> <p><span>In a recent </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/former-assassins-creed-and-far-cry-director-says-ubisoft-became-very-allergic-to-new-games-which-contributed-to-a-talent-drain/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> interview, Alex Hutchinson, another ex-Ubisoft creative director who worked on </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed III</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Far Cry 4</span></i><span>, said,</span><span>&nbsp;“[Ubisoft] always had a history of sequelizing the franchises, but also having a couple of new things coming along. They became very allergic to the new things, and so they killed a bunch of our ideas, like when I was working on </span><i><span>Pioneer</span></i><span>. They had nothing new to come through.” Ex-Ubisoft employees have a habit of creating new and exciting games after leaving the studio; Sandfall Interactive, the developers behind 2025’s record-breaking awards darling <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i>, was founded by several former Ubisoft team members.</span></p>

 <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/he-directed-4-far-cry-games-but-project-windless-is-offering-its-lead-developer-a-chance-hes-been-waiting-for-his-whole-career-i-never-had-the-opportunity-to-work-on-a-medieval-fantasy/"><span>separate interview</span></a><span>, Méthé commented on his transition from working at Ubisoft for over thirteen years, starting with </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Conviction</span></i><span> in 2009 and ending with </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Extraction</span></i><span> in 2022, to working on a medieval fantasy game starring a cockerel. “It’s something that people can take for granted, but because I have a long career I know it’s a rare opportunity to create something new: not with a follow-up, not with a sequel, not with a copy of something else—to have the means and the support to say, ‘You know what? Here’s the universe, create something new.'”</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-server-slam-beta-ps5-review-impressions-guns-extraction-shooter-2000674107</link>
            <guid>1447804</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> isn’t out yet. But you can play a big chunk of it starting today via the “Server Slam” beta on PS5, Xbox, and PC. After completing the tutorial and a few runs on PS5, I’m happy to report that what’s here is better than the version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-arc-raiders-censorship-beta-server-slam-2000674097"><em>Marathon</em></a> we played last year via an early alpha. But I still have some issues with <em>Marathon</em> that have me concerned about its short- and long-term future.</p> <p>The <em>Marathon</em> Server Slam, which runs from today until March 2, features most of the playable runners as well as a few maps, some of the progression system, and a short solo tutorial. Bungie has been very clear with players that this isn’t the full experience, but a taste of <em>Marathon</em> intended to help the studio test server capacity and iron out any major last-minute issues. So let me be very clear also: This isn’t a review or even in-depth impressions about <em>Marathon</em>. This is my feelings and thoughts after a few matches, some of which ended in defeat and two that ended in escape.</p>

 <h2>What I liked in <em>Marathon</em>‘s server slam</h2> <p>First, the good: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheating-bans-marathon-exploits-2000673239">Marathon</a> </em>looks and plays great on PS5. The colorful, neon-futuristic art style and vibes seen in past trailers, marketing, and tests are still here and still awesome. Menus look sharp. Guns look rad. Every building, gun, and item is covered in tiny details alluding to some horrible techno-nightmare that the colonists of Tau Ceti were living through. It also ran perfectly on PS5, with no framerate issues or major performance hiccups. And so far, the servers are holding up pretty well.</p>  <p>The opening tutorial, which feels similar to what was available in the alpha, is also an effective introduction to both the world of <em>Marathon</em> and how this game works. I imagine a lot of people will die in that tutorial once they get into a big fight with some AI bots. I almost did. Some might find that annoying, but I think it’s smart for Bungie to frontload <em>Marathon</em> with an intro that makes it clear that death is just a second away at all times in this tense, high-stakes sci-fi extraction shooter.</p>

 <p>I also have to shout out the guns in <em>Marathon</em>. Each and every one of them sounds perfect. Assault rifles rip apart the air with aggressive blasts while laser-y pistols sound digital and mean. Shooting them makes you feel powerful. Getting shot at is scary as heck. Good stuff. And what else should I have expected? Bungie has always been good at making guns that sound powerful, like thunder in your hands, and <em>Marathon</em> continues that with some of the studio’s coolest-looking guns yet.</p>

 <h2>What I didn’t like in <em>Marathon’s</em> free open beta</h2> <p>Okay, now for the bad parts of the <em>Marathon</em> server slam. Right out of the gate, I was not a fan of how movement and aiming feel while playing with the default settings. Moving around the world and trying to look at items on the ground feels extremely clunky using the default stick options. I recommend changing those ASAP. Turning around to fight using the settings Bungie has chosen is going to be a pain in the ass on console. Increase look speed and decrease the deadzone for the thumbsticks to help make <em>Marathon</em> feel more snappy.</p> <p>It’s really surprising how off this FPS feels, considering it was developed by Bungie, the king of console shooters. I wonder how many will bounce off the game after just a few hours without ever tweaking the settings? Probably more than zero, and if I were Bungie, I’d be tweaking those default settings ASAP.</p>

  <p>Once I got the settings all locked in, moving around the world and getting into firefights with NPCs and other players became a lot more enjoyable. The initial map is a foggy swamp filled with high-tech buildings and dead vehicles to loot and explore. But watch out for the turrets. They can quickly take you down with a few shots, especially if you are limping away from a previous fight. And if you’re playing solo, which I did in a few matches, this will end your run in a frustrating way.</p> <p>Time-to-kill is short, and player engagement feels brief in a way that I’m not sure is going to work for fans of <em>Destiny</em> or <em>Halo</em> hopping over to check out Bungie’s latest FPS. Meanwhile, NPCs can sometimes feel a bit too spongey, especially when using low-rarity weapons. I need to spend more time with the game to really lock in on an opinion, but my knee-jerk reaction is that combat in <em>Marathon</em> is fine.</p> <p>At one point, I was able to escape even after I was downed by a random player. That felt great. I extracted with some loot, resources, and a big smile on my face. In that moment, <em>Marathon</em> clicked, and I could feel myself wanting to hop in and play more. Then the next match ended quickly after a player popped around a corner and downed me in less than two seconds. A teammate tried to help and was killed, too.&nbsp; The pull to play more <em>Marathon</em> lessened after that.</p>

 <p>At the moment, I’m not sure if I like this game or just want to like it. It looks great, sounds awesome, and when you can pull off a cool escape, it feels amazing. It also has an incredible style that is unlike any game out there. But clunky controls that took tweaking to improve, annoying turrets, and a short time-to-kill make it tricky for me to enthusiastically recommend <em>Marathon</em> at the moment. Do I really like <em>Marathon</em>? Or am I just in love with its world and visuals, and also nervous about another live-service shooter eating shit? More data is required.</p>

              <p><em>Marathon</em>‘s pre-launch server slam went live earlier today. Over 100,000 players immediately flocked to give Bungie’s new extraction shooter a try for free on PC and console. Naturally, they immediately tried to type<em> “</em>Arc Raiders,” the name of the game’s biggest genre rival, into chat. You’ll never guess what happened next.</p> <p>Yes, <em>Marathon</em> censored the game name. Typing <em>Arc Raiders</em> into your squad’s group chat returned “*** *******” instead. One Twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lirik/clip/FriendlyEnchantingOpossumRalpherZ-HA7GJI8yzhJd3Uw9">streamer’s clip</a> showing the censorship has already started making the rounds online.</p>  <p><em>Kotaku</em>‘s Zack Zwiezen is currently playing the <em>Marathon</em> beta as well and tested the game’s no–”Arc Raiders” filter a bit further. You can type “arc.” You can type “raiders.” You can type “arcraiders.” You can even type “arc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;raiders.” But you can cannot type “Arc Raiders.” Weird!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000674100" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674100"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674100">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Even weirder, this isn’t the first time “Arc Raiders” has been censored in an online multiplayer shooter. <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-arc-raiders-beta-chat-censor-2000632129">The same thing</a> happened with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> last fall, even though the rogue text filter issue was later patched out. EA was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">reportedly censoring</a> 2025’s hit extraction shooter as well.</p> <p>In <em>Marathon</em>‘s case, the genre rivalry is a bit more straightforward. The game’s success will depend in part on people taking a break from <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ new season to loot robots on Tau Ceti IV instead. <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheating-bans-marathon-exploits-2000673239">Shots were already fired</a> over competing approaches to banning cheaters. So far at least, <em>Marathon</em>‘s free weekend appears to be off to a decent start.</p>

 <p><strong>Update 2/26/2026 4:02 p.m. ET:</strong> The weird bug appears to have been patched out. <em>Arc Raiders</em> love is officially welcome on Tau Ceti again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/mTGwEwSi2h">pic.twitter.com/mTGwEwSi2h</a></p> <p>— Marathon Development Team (@MarathonDevTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2027121247696699432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-marriage-candidates-new-update-1-7-qi-2000674093</link>
            <guid>1447720</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Over the past 10 years, </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> has risen from indie darling to the most popular farming sim ever made. It’s also apparently been a huge labor of love for its creator, Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone, who keeps returning to release new major updates after claiming he’s done. Now, on the game’s 10th anniversary, Barone is looking both to the future and the past with two big reveals: additions to its romanceable cast, and some pretty neat looks back at its development history.</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, in a video commemorating </span><i><span>Stardew’s </span></i><span>10th anniversary, Barone revealed two marriage candidates heading to the game’s 1.7 update: Clint and Sandy. Clint is the town’s blacksmith, and he’s almost universally despised (and occasionally even panned as an incel). On the other hand, Sandy, who lives in the game’s desert area and runs the store there, is pretty cool and mysterious!</span></p>

  <p><span>Barone </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425"><span>revealed that the game would receive new marriage candidates earlier this month</span></a><span>. Players, of course, spent the whole month speculating who they could be—if they’d be new characters entirely, if the Wizard would finally become romanceable, or if there would be a divorce in town that rendered a married couple eligible. Quite a few people hoped it would be Sandy (although her addition seemed unlikely because she lives so far away), while mostly nobody wanted Clint.</span></p> <p><span>The video is also packed with some pretty charming peeks back at the game’s development timeline, especially from the game’s 2012 iteration called </span><i><span>Sprout Valley</span></i><span>. As far as I’m aware, this is the first time he’s shown off so much of that version. The layout of </span><i><span>Sprout Valley’s</span></i><span> world resembles that of the one we know today pretty closely, but the art is vastly different and (sorry) a lot less cohesive. Barone himself didn’t have too many kind words to say about the game’s earlier version either, calling the pixel art “crap” and speculating on what his life would have been like if he hadn’t put more time into development.</span></p>

 <p><span>“If I had just released this game after 6 months,” he said, “where would I be right now?”</span></p> <p><span>However, the footage he showed off later revealed that the game pretty quickly turned into the </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>we all know and love, with the build he showed off from just one year later looking almost identical to the game as it exists today. That’s just a really, really impressive turnaround for a developer to make. “</span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> hit puberty here,” he joked.</span></p>

 <p><span>Footage of the older builds also revealed a few massive features that were completely scrapped. He let on that the mines were initially procedurally generated and inspired by </span><i><span>Terraria</span></i><span>, and there was also an entire underground goblin village that was axed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It was really neat to get a peek at this older gameplay, especially the axed features, the latter of which I’m sure will spawn plenty of theories about the game’s lore. I’m less happy about the marriage candidates, though. As someone who’s married to Emily in the game, I’m absolutely </span><i><span>repulsed </span></i><span>by Clint, who still flirts with Emily constantly despite my farmer literally having two children with her. Maybe it’s good that he can finally find a partner who’s not my freaking wife, I guess? Sandy, on the other hand, is fun! I can definitely see her newfound status as a marriage candidate sparking new challenge runs since players don’t meet her until much later in the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Out of everything today, though, I’m most shocked by Barone’s pronunciation of Qi, the last name of an endgame character who provides the game’s most challenging quests. His last name is apparently pronounced “qwee,” which is possibly the worst thing I’ve learned all week. Thanks, Barone.</span></p>
