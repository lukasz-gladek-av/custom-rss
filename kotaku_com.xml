              <p>A new Unreal Engine 5-powered horror game based on 1978’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/retrorealms-halloween-ash-evil-dead-horror-16-bit-retro-1851620847"><em>Halloween</em></a> from director John Carpenter is in the works and will launch next year. It’s titled <em>Halloween: The Game,</em> and will feature iconic slasher Michael Myers killing people on the night he returns home.</p> <p>Announced on August 20, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219630/Halloween/">Halloween: The Game</a>,</em> which isn’t the most creative name, will be heavily inspired by the original movie and will feature a “one-versus-many stealth horror experience.” The game will let players put on Michael’s mask and stab their friends online in multiplayer or run away from the killer as a civilian of Haddonefield. IllFonic, the team developing <em>Halloween: The Game, </em>is a studio that has become well-known for its focus on asymmetrical online games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/predator-hunting-grounds-is-only-fun-when-the-predator-1843181244"><em>Predator: Hunting Grounds</em></a> and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/rest-in-pieces-friday-the-13th-the-game-1827582283">now-defunct<em> Friday the 13th</em> game.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Here’s the official trailer for <em>Halloween: The Game:</em></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFfhM1Jxqds?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>In a press release for the newly announced horror game, it was confirmed that <em>Halloween</em> will include a story mode and the ability to play against bots, too. As someone who has been disappointed by so many <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game">horror movie franchises</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-game-review-crossplay-ps5-1850752842">getting video game adaptations</a> that are purely online-only, this is good news. And I imagine many other players will agree. <em>Halloween: The Game</em> will also feature “multiple maps” and a soundtrack “inspired by” that of the original <em>Halloween</em> movie. Interestingly, the original film’s director, John Carpenter, is credited as an executive producer on the upcoming game.</p>

 <p>“Working with Compass International Pictures and Further Front has been a dream,” said Charles Brungardt, CEO of IllFonic. “As rights holders of the film and producers on the game, they’ve shared incredible insights to help us stay true to the soul of the 1978 film. Their tremendous passion for Michael Myers has pushed us to craft something that fans of the franchise will truly appreciate.”</p> <p><em>Halloween: The Game</em> is set to launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2026. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Illfonic to see if this project is the same one <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ign-halloween-games-michael-myers-john-carpenter-1851619732">teased back in 2024.</a></p>
