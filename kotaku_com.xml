              <p>Is the Switch 2 doomed to be a physical graveyard of third-party game key cards? Why are so many new special edition controllers so ugly? And has Amazon really pulled the plug on its fledgling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO? It‚Äôs another edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‚Äòs daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>I don‚Äôt need any more gaming devices in my life but I‚Äôm obsessed with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd8eqcbZsKo">latest batch</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVAHh-DmDu8">of DS knock-offs</a> out of China. Nintendo is really leaving money on the table by not shipping its own legacy handhelds. I mean, people were so desperate for a new Game Boy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiDrCRSRUHM">they hacked the Lego one</a> so it could run games.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> Pro controller looks bad</h2>   <p>It‚Äôs the same dark shade as the normal Pro controller but with graphics from an in-game newspaper over the front. The words <em>Resident Evil</em> are also there but largely interrupted by the central Switch 2 logo. Truly a bummer. In other bad news, the Switch 2 version of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> has been confirmed to be a game key card. Rip.</p>

 <h2>Amazon Games dev suggests its <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO has been canceled</h2> <p>As spotted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-have-reportedly-cancelled-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-again">by<em> Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>, developer Ashleigh Amrine made a now-deleted post on LinkedIn about the layoffs that hinted at the game no longer being in production. ‚ÄúThis morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on&nbsp;<em>New World</em>&nbsp;and our fledgling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game (y‚Äôall would have loved it),‚Äù she&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">wrote</a>.</p>

 <p>Amazon did not respond to a request for comment about whether the project has been killed. It‚Äôs always possible the company is still still looking to offload the project or just license it out to another studio. If that game ever does come to market, however, it‚Äôll probably bare no relation to whatever early prototype the <em>New World</em> devs were working on.</p>

 <h2>Xbox hardware revenue is still in freefall</h2> <p>Microsoft announced its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast">second quarter earnings</a> yesterday. While Azure cloud services and its AI gambles continue to pay off, the gaming division actually shrunk. Xbox gaming revenues were down $113 million with already terrible hardware numbers down 29 percent year over year.</p>

 <p>It‚Äôs worth noting that this was the same quarter when Microsoft jacked up the Xbox Series X/S consoles to $400 and $600 respectively due to Trump‚Äôs trade war. Somehow I don‚Äôt think a <a href="https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-paid-multiplayer-game-pass-2000639263">more expensive PC-like next-gen console</a> with no exclusives will turn that around.</p>

 <h2><em>Bloodlines 2</em> has more hairstyles, fewer bugs thanks to Halloween update</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy Halloween! üéÉ</p> <p>Enjoy our free Halloween Update with new customization options and bug fixes. Future updates might include an FOV slider, save game options, and custom difficulty settings. </p> <p>Check the website for more details: <a href="https://t.co/sMvXHoerxh">https://t.co/sMvXHoerxh</a> <a href="https://t.co/9T9PDRoeTG">pic.twitter.com/9T9PDRoeTG</a></p> <p>‚Äî Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines 2 (@VtM_Bloodlines) <a href="https://twitter.com/VtM_Bloodlines/status/1983542184302272741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines 2</em>‚Äòs latest free update adds 24 new style customizations for your sexy goth avatars. It also addresses a ton of crashes and bugs. Enough to turn around initially grim sentiments on the messy vampire RPG? Perhaps not. But bigger-ticket changes like FOV sliders and better saving options are on the docket for upcoming patches.</p> <h2>AI slop will not replace video games</h2> <p>That‚Äôs according to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick who happens to oversee some of the biggest and most critically acclaimed franchises in the world with <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and <i>BioShock</i>. He said AI is currently incapable of making the<em> GTA 6</em> marketing plan, let alone an entire game. And even if it could, he doesn‚Äôt think it would be any good.</p> <p>‚ÄúAnything that involves backward-looking data compute, it‚Äôs really good for that and that applies to lots of things,‚Äù he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">told CNBC</a>. ‚ÄúWhat we do at Take-Two, anything that isn‚Äôt attached to that, it‚Äôs going to be really, really bad at.‚Äù Plus, he admits, it‚Äôs a legal minefield.</p>

 <h2>Hideo Kojima had no idea he had a chance to make a<em> Matrix</em> video game</h2> <p>Former Konami executive Christopher Bergstresser <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-wachowskis-matrix-game-movie-mgs-konami-ps2-2000-2000639384">recently revealed</a> that the Wachowskis had approached the Japanese publisher about recruiting Hideo Kojima to make a <em>Matrix</em> video game back in 1999. ‚ÄúIn all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place,‚Äù Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">shared on X</a> in response.</p> <p>I could be projecting but the admission seemed tinge with sadness and a slight sense of betrayal. ‚ÄúAt that time, I was already extremely busy with <em>MGS2</em> and probably couldn‚Äôt have accepted the offer right away,‚Äù the <em>Death Stranding</em> director concluded. ‚ÄúBut if someone had told me, maybe there could‚Äôve been a way to make it work.‚Äù</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battle-suit-aces-review-impressions-chef-brigade-trinket-2000639931">Don‚Äôt sleep on the hot new card battling RPG <em>Battle Suit Aces</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-not-scary-games-to-play-on-halloween-1844512015">The best non-horror games to play this Halloween</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst-2000639864">Our definitive ranking of the best and worst days of the week</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">fucking insanity man. <a href="https://t.co/LITLrLyKzu">pic.twitter.com/LITLrLyKzu</a></p> <p>‚Äî Seriously (@seriouslyjokinn) <a href="https://twitter.com/seriouslyjokinn/status/1983465563293966585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
