And players couldn’t re-order the upcoming games. Since then,  Nintendo games have largely been unavailable for purchase directly from Amazon. Instead, when purchased on the site, they were sold and shipped via third-party sellers. And earlier this month, the Switch 2, its first-party launch games, and its official accessories, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were similarly unavailable to pre-order on Amazon</a></span>. It’s been a frustrating situation for gamers who rely on the online retailer. But it’s finally, possibly, coming to an end. </p><p>Over the weekend, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as spotted by <em>IGN </em>and others</a></span>, a handful of first-party Nintendo games popped up on Amazon and are being officially shipped and sold by the retail giant. <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/amazon-switch-2-nintendo-mario-donkey-kong-pre-orders-1851784603&amp;asc_source=&amp;asins=B0F66KLYVH,B0F66JNF9W,B0F66GWKZS,B0F66DW2X7,B0F66DXJNM,B0F66GQLHH,B0F66DHVR7&amp;isPreview=1&amp;isSlp=1&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree, </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</em></a></span><em> </em>are some of the first-party Nintendo games now available to pre-order directly from Amazon and Nintendo. This seems to indicate that the two companies have come to an agreement and ended the lockout. There was even a listing for the Switch 2, though that has been removed for now. But this all seems to point to Nintendo products and games returning fully to Amazon in the near future. </p><p>As for why Nintendo stopped selling new games and consoles on Amazon, there’s never been a confirmation from either company. Some fans speculate that Amazon was shipping games ahead of their release and that this led to leaks, but that has yet to be confirmed. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
