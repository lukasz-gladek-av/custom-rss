            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I haven’t seen the full </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>stage play, but I was already well aware of the twists and turns we’d see in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>.</span></a><span> The musical sequel covers the events of the play’s second act, and it includes several direct ties to the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> story. As such, I was braced for it to reveal the brainless Scarecrow, but I was not prepared for how the guy would actually look when on screen, and neither were most people, it seems, as the reveal has caught fans off guard.</span></p>  <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>continuity, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people-final-fantasy-2000641145"><i><span>People</span></i><span>’s Sexiest Man Alive</span></a><span>), the carefree prince who starts growing a conscious after he meets Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), becomes the Scarecrow. He starts off as a dashing, charismatic narcissist, but as Fiyero grows to care for Elphaba and her battle for animal rights, he turns against the Wizard’s fascist regime and becomes a fugitive with the Wicked Witch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Later in the film, he is captured by the Wizard’s guards and tortured. Elphaba, desperate to save her lover, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTv_FrdBQ6A&amp;pp=ygUTd2lja2VkIG5vIGdvb2QgZGVlZA%3D%3D"><span>casts a spell to keep him from dying or feeling any pain</span></a><span>. We don’t see Fiyero’s face for almost the entirety of the second half of the movie because </span><i><span>For Good </span></i><span>goes out of its way to obscure it and hide his identity, but we unknowingly see the back of his head a few times. That’s because Elphaba’s spell turned him into the Scarecrow who accompanies Dorothy in </span><i><span>The Wizard of Oz</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We don’t actually see Fiyero as the Scarecrow until the final moments of </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, and while an eagle-eyed </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>fan may have caught onto this twist when he was strung up on a cross in a cornfield during Elphaba’s spell, plenty of first-time viewers were genuinely shocked by this reveal, not only because of Fiyero’s dark fate, but because Bailey straight up looks like a patched together version of Ryan Reynolds in his Scarecrow look.</span></p>       <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My entire theater burst out laughing when they saw the Scarecrow's design</p> <p>— 5 DAYS UNTIL DON CHEADLE'S BIRTHDAY (@Schaffrillas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Schaffrillas/status/1991721384129777945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">out mogged the wicked for good scarecrow <a href="https://t.co/CHKems9MTo">pic.twitter.com/CHKems9MTo</a></p> <p>— 👹 (@tummyhxrts) <a href="https://twitter.com/tummyhxrts/status/1992245081273991321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">also happy to report fiyero looks chopped asf as the scarecrow like even tin man boq is out mugging him <a href="https://t.co/lrDdCGEHAQ">pic.twitter.com/lrDdCGEHAQ</a></p> <p>— gelphie conquers all (@aIicentinchains) <a href="https://twitter.com/aIicentinchains/status/1990796884131426684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While some might be unsettled by Fiyero’s new face, others aren’t going to let some straw and burlap keep them from </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHed_tTvyhI"><span>recreating that one scene from </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i></a><span>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extract-rat-elevator-revive-defib-2000646958</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Extraction shooters are eager to take everything away from you. And though <i>Arc Raiders</i> has proven to be a more friendly approach with its multiple paths of progression, dying at the end of a successful run still sucks. Getting pushed 99 percent of the way to failure and then surviving, however, is a feeling like no other.</p> <p>As more folks pour into <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers to hopefully extract and craft their way to glory, they’re capturing epic victories snatched from the jaws of defeat and sharing them as reminders that even when you think you’re about to lose everything, luck (or a guardian angel) can always intervene.</p>

 <p>Last night, I came across one such clip from a few days ago of what would seem to be an unfortunate PvP instance during a Night Raid (usually a preem opportunity to score some great loot if you know where to look) suddenly turned on its head:</p>

   <p>Gunned down by a rando, Reddit user Over_here_vibin prepares to get sent back home with nothing to show for it. Then his assailant gets sniped in the head literally out of nowhere. Turns out, some folks must’ve been watching nearby and were quick to put down the threat while also escorting Over_here_vibin to extraction.</p>

 <p>Fun fact learned from this video? If you don’t have a defib to revive a stranger, you can use bandages to temporarily stabilize them, which is often enough to see someone successfully get out.</p> <p>Humans aren’t your only potential allies, though. As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-karma-doesnt-get-any-sweeter-than-this-extract-camper-gets-a-spoonful-of-justice-from-bots-accidentally-saves-his-would-be-victim-and-misses-his-own-extraction/">spotted by <i>Games Radar</i></a>, another fantastic clip sees someone gunned down literally as they’re standing in the elevator. If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, then you know getting shot in the elevator is literally one of the worst feelings (especially as it often happens right as the doors are closing, meaning your assailant doesn’t even have time to loot your body and just offed you seemingly just for the fun of it).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Beautiful ❤️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <br>🎥RedRiser <a href="https://t.co/RkAYVow0rL">pic.twitter.com/RkAYVow0rL</a></p> <p>— ARC Now (@ArcRaidersNow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersNow/status/1991792146995986490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As luck would have it, a Rocketeer (one of the most menacing of airborne threats in the game thus far) not only interrupts the execution animation, but knocks the assailant out of the elevator with a rocket, downing them in the process. While it is possible the assailant might’ve been able to crawl over and call in a new elevator, it’s likely their decision to shoot someone in the back led to their loss.</p> <p>My feeds are full of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueRaiders/comments/1ovl0bh/got_rescued_today_was_this_one_of_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">situations like this</a>. It just goes to show that, until the game literally sends you back to Speranza, don’t give up. A friendly human, or Arc, might just save the day.</p>   <p>Oh, and if you run solos, please carry defibs for your fellow Raiders!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-kicks-off-black-friday-week-with-an-all-time-low-price-on-the-m5-ipad-pro-2000646585</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-margin-blind-with-the-m5-ipad-pro-as-black-friday-brings-an-unprecedented-drop-for-its-newly-released-tablet.1363039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Picking up the M5 iPad Pro for the first time should come with a wary bystander asking, “are you sure you can handle this thing,” as if you were sliding into the driver’s seat of an F1 race car. The amount of power under the hood of the newest iPad Pro is&nbsp;<em>that</em> significant, and with Black Friday week kicking off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Amazon is handing you the keys to the 13-inch version with a first-ever $100 price drop to $1,195.</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, learning how to harness all of the crazy amount of power and features of the M5 iPad Pro won’t end with you pancaked into a wall. If anything, you won’t be able to put it down once you see just what the upgrade to the M5 chip — the very same one found in the newest MacBooks — has done for the iPad Pro. Everything from editing 4K video, precision art creation, and heavy-duty gaming is now firmly on the table.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Enough</h2>
<p>The best reviews on iPads or any tablets has always been that they’re “good enough” to take on visually challenging or work-intensive tasks normally done by laptops or desktops. The M5 iPad Pro isn’t merely “good enough” to be your primary device for streaming, photo editing, content creation, number-crunching, or anything else — it handles them all as easily as virtually any laptop.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the M5 iPad Pro falls in line with pretty much every iPad ever made by having an industry-best display. The 13-inch screen is a Liquid Retina XDR thing of beauty, and it’s not going to lag or glitch out on you while you stream or edit videos or play an action game, thanks to the GPU built into the M5 chip.</p>
<p>Take a deeper dive into the Apple ecosystem by adding the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard folio (both sold separately) and you have a truly formidable touchscreen laptop, but one that runs the clean, silky-smooth iPadOS 26, updated with Liquid Glass design, helpful widgets and improved interaction with the Apple Pencil.</p>



<h2>Best iPad Ever?</h2>
<p>Need more power? Take Apple Intelligence out for a spin to help you create and execute pro-level workflows, and the iPad Pro’s Neural Accelerators will have them up and running in no time. Browsing or streaming speed? This iPad Pro can run Wi-Fi 7 with Apple’s brand-new N1 chip to deliver stunning online speed. The landscape 12MP front camera and 12MP rear camera are top notch, and when you combine them with the elite-level built-in mics and speakers, your FaceTime calls and videoconferencing will be the best ever delivered by any iPad. There’s also a USB-C port that lets you connect to an external Thunderbolt or USB 4 monitor.</p>
<p>Call it a race car, a thoroughbred, a rocket, or any other analogy you want, and the M5 iPad Pro lives up to it. Simply put, it’s Apple’s best and by&nbsp;<em>far</em> most powerful tablet yet, and it should be at the very top of the Black Friday list for anyone who wants it all when it comes to portable smart-device power. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Hit Amazon now and grab the 13-inch M5 iPad Pro while it’s at an all-time low price of $1,195.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-players-please-capture-control-points-2000646929</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-please-capture-control-points.1363036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Later this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-free-week-star-wars-fan-film-exodus-leaks-bf6-2000646871#:~:text=Battlefield%206%E2%80%B2,royale%20spin%2Doff."><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s conquest mode and some of its maps</a> will be free to play across all platforms. That means an influx of new players. So now seems like a good time to ask everyone, even the people already playing EA’s blockbuster online FPS, to please capture control points in Conquest. Please. I’m begging you.</p> <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em> since it launched in October</a>. And I’ve had a great time with it. The FPS is easily my favorite <em>Battlefield</em> in a few years and will likely be a game I return to a lot in 2026. But whenever I play Conquest, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Conquest">the franchise’s iconic mode</a> that’s been around since the OG <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, I get frustrated by how many players seem not to understand the point of the mode. That point being: Capture control points, hold and defend them, and if needed, take them back from the enemy. Hold more points, and your team will win faster. Let them control the battlefield, and you’ll lose just as quickly.</p>

 <p>Sounds simple enough, yet I’ve lost a Conquest match and skimmed the scoreboard afterward countless times, just to spot half or more of my team with zero captures.</p>  <p>Now, I understand that some people are sniping and aren’t capping points. Fine. And some are using tanks and aircraft to support the team and won’t have as many captures as some other players or me. I get that, too. My problem is that so many players who aren’t sniping or using tanks seem to just… not take control points.</p>

 <p>I’ve watched players run into the first control point at the start of a match and capture it, then just run around the next one, never going in to cap it or help their team hold it. These aren’t snipers either, but support or assault players. Other times, I see people run to an enemy base, help fight and clear it, and then leave when it’s neutralized but not fully capped. Or some players will cap a base and then never leave it.</p> <p>I don’t care if you only get three kills. I don’t care if you a dozen times. As long as you are helping our team cap points, push forward when it makes sense, and fall back when needed to defend, I’ll be happy. And you’ll likely get more XP and be higher up on the scoreboard, too, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> greatly rewards teamplay and objective support over kills. So help your team win, get to the top of the leaderboard, and have a fun time by capturing control points in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, okay? Please.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-decided-money-doesnt-matter-q10-s5-robot-vacuum-drops-50-off-with-10000pa-suction-2000646915</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-decided-money-doesn%E2%80%99t-matter-q10-s5-robot-vacuum-drops-50-off-with-10-000pa-suction.1363030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has become the premium brand in robot vacuums with their latest flagships such as <em>Qrevo CurvX</em>&nbsp;and <em>Saros 10R</em>&nbsp;crossing the $1,000 threshold even with Black Friday discounts. But here’s the thing: t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">he Roborock Q5 S10+ is currently sitting at an all-time low of $259 on Amazon, down from its original $549 price tag</a>, and it’s flying off the shelves. This model packs serious technology into a mid-range package – think <strong>10,000Pa suction power, a self-emptying station that holds 70 days worth of debris, and a sonic mopping system that scrubs 3,000 times per minute</strong>. The kind of deal that makes you wonder if someone in Roborock’s pricing department made a mistake.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Vacuum Cleaner</h2>
<p>First of all, the 10,000Pa suction power puts this vacuum in the <strong>same league as models costing twice as much</strong>. That level of suction pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, grabs crumbs from hardwood floor crevices, and handles the kind of everyday mess that accumulates a lot quicker than you’d like to admit. The HyperForce technology behind this suction isn’t just a marketing term: it’s the difference between a robot that pushes debris around and one that actually removes it.</p>
<p>The self-emptying station completely changes the way you interact with the vacuum. You are looking at a 2.7L dust bag, able to hold up to 70 days of dirt and debris, which essentially means that you can forget about emptying for over two months. This is where pet owners will appreciate it more than anyone because pet hair fills up the standard robot vacuum bins in a matter of days. The <strong>station will automatically empty the robot after each cleaning session</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll never need to deal with those pesky clouds of dust or tangled hair when manually emptying a bin.</p>



<p>The <strong>VibraRise 2.0 mopping system</strong> is where this vacuum starts to feel like a premium product. Dual-zone sonic vibration scrubs floors up to 3,000 times per minute, which is enough force to handle dried spills and stuck-on messes that regular robot mops just smear around. The mopping module automatically lifts 8mm when it detects carpet, so you’re not dealing with wet carpets or having to manually remove mop pads before running a cleaning cycle. You can adjust mopping intensity through the app depending on how dirty your floors are, giving you control without requiring manual intervention.</p>
<p>The smart carpet detection uses ultrasonic technology to identify when the vacuum moves onto carpet from hard floors. Detecting carpet, it lifts the mopping modules and automatically increases suction power for a deeper cleaning. This dual response ensures that the carpets get the aggressive cleaning they require while protecting them from water damage. It’s reliable enough that you can run cleaning cycles while away from home with no fear of returning to soaked rugs.</p>



<p>Navigation on this vacuum relies on PreciSense LiDAR technology which scans 360° to create detailed maps of your home. The system supports multi-level mapping, meaning if you have a two-story house, the vacuum remembers the layout of both floors and can plan efficient cleaning routes for each level. With ReactiveTech obstacle avoidance, structured light technology is used to detect objects in real time and navigate around them, meaning fewer situations where it gets stuck and more complete cleaning coverage without needing to pre-clean before the robot vacuum cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, this vacuum delivers technology that was reserved for $500+ models just a couple of years ago. Roborock’s reputation for build quality means you’re not sacrificing reliability to hit this price point, and the fact that it’s selling in huge volumes on Amazon suggests plenty of people have figured out this is an unusually good value.</p>

              <p>When people recall their favorite <em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games, it’s often focused on which was their first. For me, that was <em>Tomb Raider II</em>, and as such, it remains very special. For others, it’s the wonderful opener to Crystal Dynamics’ era of the franchise, <em>Tomb Raider Legends</em>. And for many more, it’ll be one of the more recent entries, like 2018’s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. But for all the reminiscing and celebrating, there’s one entry that seems to get little love, despite being one of my absolute favorites at the time, and to replay today:&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>. It turns 25 years old today.</p> <p>There is a perennial issue for both games and movies, which I call Critic Fatigue. It doesn’t matter how good a series may be, nor how increasingly popular it might be among audiences: at a certain point, critics seem to believe it’s their role to be sick of something. “Uh, <em>another</em> <em>Avengers</em> movie? I hate it just for existing!” “More&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>?! It’s time for it to be taken down a peg or two!” It’s like it’s their collective job to punish a franchise for having too many entries. That happened astoundingly harshly to&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> at the turn of the century.</p>

 <h2>Business is boobing</h2> <p>Obviously, the first three <em>Tomb Raider</em> games were a phenomenon. From 1996 to 1998, the original trilogy received international hype that today is hard to even conceive. It was a messy combination of a worthwhile celebration of three genuinely fantastic video games and the lecherous misogyny of the late-90s era. The reason an entire generation bought 3DFX cards, Lara Croft championed and emboldened the third-person action genre, <em>and</em> had rather large boobies. So yes, there <em>was</em> a lot to be frustrated by, especially in Lara’s home country of the UK, where “lad mags” ruled supreme with their soft-porn photography and lifestyle articles. This aspect was so blatantly exploited by publisher Eidos that there was always an <a href="https://www.laracroftonline.com/pictures/tomb-raider-models-images-gallery-page-one.html">“official” Lara Croft model</a>, despite these people never appearing in movies, TV shows, or any other actually extant tie-in media. Instead, the likes of Rhona Mitra, Ellen Rocche, and Nell McAndrew would show up on the covers of those lad mags with multi-page photo shoots within, and on cardboard cut-outs in every gaming store. (And on the covers of many a gaming magazine.) It’s pretty embarrassing to look back on, not least remembering how Nell McAndrew was hypocritically fired from the role after posing for <em>Playboy</em>.</p>

 <p>But for all the squirm-inducing marketing, the games remained <em>fantastic</em>. They still are. Then, in 1999, came <em>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</em>, and the tide started to turn. Critic Fatigue was due to kick in, and you could smell the backlash coming. <em>The Last Revelation</em> was more of the same, and for some reason, more of something we previously loved stops being good enough after a while, and scores came in lower. It wasn’t helped by a crappy Dreamcast port, but there was still enough residual love for the franchise that <em>The Last Revelation</em> escaped the brunt of the kickback. That was reserved for—in my opinion—a better game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646923"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646923">© Eidos</figcaption></figure> <h2>Putting the fun in funeral</h2> <p><em>The Last Revelation’</em>s ending deserved far more criticism.&nbsp;The game, during which you watched Lara Croft die some 40 billion times, ended with a cutscene in which Lara Croft died. A pyramid falls on top of her. “Reload then!” I remember saying to the screen at this ridiculous forced ending, reloading to see if I’d made a mistake. But nope, she was dead. It was extremely silly, but it happened for a reason. Core, the developers of the games, were sick of making <em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games. It was hoped that by killing her, the developers would be free to make something else. It didn’t work, and Eidos demanded more.</p>

 <p>However, it also set up a superb conceit for the fifth game,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>. Rather than beginning with Lara in the middle of some improbable heist, then bringing us back to her manor to start a new series of international adventures, <em>Chronicles</em> began with Croft’s funeral. That’s something, right! And of course, everyone was expecting the immediate reveal, that having the Pyramid of Giza squish her flat turned out not to be so serious, and reports of her death were greatly exaggerated. Except that’s not what happened at all. Instead, post-funeral, Lara’s butler Wilson invites two of her close compatriots back to the manor for a drink. Together, the three begin to reminisce about their friend, recalling adventures that had yet to be seen in the games. And that’s what you play! Four stories, in completely unique settings, at different stages in Lara’s life—including as a teenager.</p>

 <p>The result was almost all great! Each of the four chapters was a distinct game, with enormous variety in setting, from haunted islands to modern, high-tech skyscrapers, via an abandoned submarine, delivering the intricate puzzles and acrobatic antics we’d come to expect from developers Core. That no one involved in the game apparently wanted to make it really didn’t come through, perhaps via some sort of involuntary competence, or as a result of breaking it into small chunks that felt less oppressive to create. I can imagine if someone had just played the first four games through in a row and then instantly started on this fifth, they could be thoroughly sick and tired of Lara and her formula. But giventhat&nbsp; a year went by between each entry, I really want to push back against this “fatigue” argument.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646924">© Eidos / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2>Backlashing out</h2> <p>No matter <em>Chronicles</em>‘ merits, they wouldn’t matter. The backlash was due, many critics were ready to put Lara in her place for having the temerity to keep returning. Scores came in hard and harsh, with even <em>IGN</em> almost hitting its lowest possible score of 6.&nbsp;<em>EDGE</em> dished out a mauling 4, while the usually supplicant&nbsp;<em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em> joined in with a 5. But as you read through those reviews (or the residual summaries remaining on the internet), they all praise the game, celebrate its great level design, recognize it as a good example of a&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> game, but then penalize it for…existing? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010220230712/http://www.zdnet.com/opm/stories/main/0,11891,2667614,00.html">That&nbsp;<em>OPM</em></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010220230712/http://www.zdnet.com/opm/stories/main/0,11891,2667614,00.html"> review</a>, that 2.5 star score, described the game as “the best sequel in the series thus far,” albeit then claiming that all the other games “downright sucked.” The same magazine gave <em>TR II </em>a 9, then the third game 7. The fourth game, that one got a 10.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/22/tomb-raider-chronicles"><em>IGN</em>‘s review</a> couldn’t make my argument any better. The 25-year-old article had the strapline, “Lara Croft’s last adventure on PlayStation is also her very best. Still, it’s just more of the same.” There it is! The whole point, perfectly encapsulated! How dare this game be the best example of a thing?</p> <p>The review goes on to say that the matter of annual releases “turned what could have been one of gaming’s most cherished franchises into one of the most reviled.” Most reviled! For the crime of carrying on being good too often. The article also praises the game for its four distinct chapters, offering “the greatest amount of diversity in play style and atmosphere,” then calls the fourth story “one of the best <em>Tomb Raider</em> levels ever.”</p>

 <p>A huge part of this reaction, as indeed is the case in most other examples, is leveling complaints at the latter entry that should have been raised from the start. So <em>Chronicles</em> was repeatedly berated across reviews for its control issues, and indeed the games’ silly combat, even though these aspects were almost always overlooked in the rush of excitement for, er, the first three games. The best example of the series so far, having the same faults as the poorer examples in the past, makes the most recent game the worst? That seems to be the rule.</p> <p>And yes, of course, I’m not naive. Having the same control issues five games in&nbsp;<em>is</em> crappy and should be dealt with. But given they were given a critical pass the first four times, and the games sold eighty million-billion-squillion copies despite them, there’s not a great deal of incentive being put before the developers to prioritize them. It is, in a large part, a failure of criticism.</p>

 <p>It’s the same reason Bethesda gets to release half-finished games with barely functioning UIs, because why would the developer bother to do otherwise? It knows it’ll get a round of 9s and 10s from every outlet despite it, and given the company releases new games every decade rather than every year, these consistent issues don’t seem to amount to “fatigue.” It took an actively&nbsp;<em>boring</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>, for any hint of that backlash to appear.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000646925" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646925"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646925">© Eidos / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2>The fallen angel</h2> <p>I’m here to say that I loved&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>, despite the litany of flaws that haunted the entire franchise up until that point. I played&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> games on PC, with one hand on a game controller and the other on my keyboard, because this was the only way the crummy control issues were overcome. That worked for&nbsp;<em>Chronicles</em> as well as it worked for&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider II</em>, and if anything, I was used to it by then. It was a splendid game, despite the malaise behind its creation, because—as so many identified at the time—it featured some of the best levels in the series!</p> <p>The irony that it was&nbsp;<em>Chronicles</em> that received the backlash when the borderline unplayable <em>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</em> was just three years away isn’t lost on me either. Both games were developed simultaneously, the former a reluctant sop to the publisher, the latter a whole fresh start for Core. But after years of delays and brutal development issues, <em>Angel of Darkness</em> was atrocious. Lara was close to uncontrollable, the enemy AI was abysmal, and the game quickly became a laughing stock. And it reviewed the same as <em>Chronicles</em>, because it was new! It was fresh! So it&nbsp;<em>had</em> to be interesting. This time, reviews went, “While the game is so broken as to be functionally useless, it has new graphics!” (To be abundantly fair to <em>IGN</em>, after just picking on them, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/24/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">the site gave it a good kicking</a> with a score lower than some thought it could reach: 5.3.)</p>

 <p><em>Chronicles</em> is included in Aspyr’s recent remake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-angel-darkness-release-date-1851670508"><em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em></a>, although <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-review-pc-lara-croft-1851250080">given my experience with the gruesome mess of the first three</a>, I’m not convinced it’d be the best way to play—definitely stick to the original graphics and controls. You can also <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_the_last_revelation_chronicles">pick it up paired with&nbsp;<em>The Last Revelation</em> from GOG</a> for under $9, and then <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tomb_Raider_Chronicles">go crazy on&nbsp;<em>PCGamingWiki</em></a>, getting it all patched up for modern machines.</p> <p>I say it’s worth it! Ignore those fatigue-ridden naysayers. It’s OK for something to be good five times in a row.</p>

              <p>Amazon is practically giving away its smart plug at a price that barely exceeds what you’d pay for a basic outlet adapter: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/">At $12, down from $24, this connected device costs roughly the same as a dumb power strip from the hardware store</a>.</p>
<p>This Black Friday, Amazon slashed prices across all its <strong>own-brand products by approximately 50%</strong>, selling at zero margin to drive ecosystem adoption. The smart plug exemplifies this aggressive strategy and offers voice control and automation at a price that removes every excuse for not starting your smart home journey.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Voice Control That Changes Your Daily Routine</h2>
<p>The <strong>Alexa integration adds voice commands to any device</strong> that has a physical on/off switch. Tell Alexa to turn on your coffee maker from bed, and hot coffee waits when you reach the kitchen. Command the lamp in your living room to turn off from the couch. Turn on a fan in another room without walking there. These minor conveniences compound throughout your day into proper quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Setup takes literally minutes</strong> and requires no technical knowledge whatsoever. Plug the Smart Plug into any outlet, open the Alexa app on your phone, and follow the simple, on-screen prompts. The plug connects automatically to your 2.4GHz WiFi network. You then name the device based on what you’re controlling, such as “bedroom lamp” or “coffee maker.” It takes less than five minutes from box to working smart device.</p>



<p><strong>No smart home hub requirement</strong> removes the additional hardware cost that plagued earlier smart home adoptions. It directly connects your Smart Plug to your WiFi and communicates with Alexa over the cloud. You avoid buying expensive hubs like SmartThings or dedicated Zigbee coordinators. The Alexa app manages all your Smart Plugs from one interface.</p>
<p>Routine automation turns disparate smart devices into cohesive systems that react intelligently. Create a morning routine that starts the coffee maker at 7 AM, turns on bathroom lights, and starts playing the news on your Echo. A bedtime routine might turn off all the lights, smart lock the doors, and drop the thermostat. Leaving home triggers an away routine to power down everything non-essential. These are scheduled automations that happen independently of you and creates the smart home experience most people envision when they first hear about connected devices.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa+ capabilities give you much more natural interactions</strong> with your smart home. You can set routines without having to open the app, using voice commands for actions that power multiple devices at once, such as saying, “Alexa, it’s movie night,” to activate all the smart lighting in the room and turn on TV-connected devices. You can be a lot more casual about what you are asking for without needing to follow strict command structures. It all feels less robotic compared to earlier smart home controls, which required you to say things in a very specific way.</p>
<p>At $12, the smart plug provides fundamental smart home functionality at just about the price of basic electrical accessories this Black Friday. Want to start controlling devices by voice without spending hundreds on smart home infrastructure? This record-low price eliminates that barrier.</p>
