            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s only been a week since <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">new hard mode was added</a> to the multiplayer roguelike, and FromSoftware is already patching in some relief after even the most stalwart fans found themselves brutally beaten down. The mode has five depths, with the goal being to eventually complete enough successful runs to reach the deepest and most difficult one. Now, however, players will have the option to arbitrarily boot themselves back up to upper levels so they can stop dying and actually have fun again.</p> <p>Depth 1 is straightforward enough. While some <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-libra-nerf-deep-night-2000624624">harder enemies and new item debuffs</a> force players to adapt to the game in new ways, most were able to make short work of it. Then came Depth 2. For my team it was like hitting a brick wall, but others successfully made it to Depth 3. Past that, the game basically becomes a no-hit run mode in disguise. Within a few days some fans were already begging for an option to play on the lower difficulties again just for fun. With a shockingly quick turnaround, FromSoftware has now obliged.</p> <p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-upcoming-deep-of-night-adjustments">An update that went live today adds</a> “a new feature to voluntarily decrease your Depth ranking by one level.” It also gives loss protection to players at lower Depths, so that your first loss on Depth 3, 4, or 5 won’t immediately lose you points and kick you back to the previous one. This protection even applies if you’re returning to Depth 3 or 4 for the dozenth time. This is mostly for players at the final Depths who lose more points from a loss than they earn for each win.</p>

   <p>“Lets go voluntary derank,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1nl4hun/elden_ring_nightreign_upcoming_deep_of_night/">wrote</a> on the subreddit. “This is based,” wrote another. “But we really just need more bosses.”</p> <p>The new system allows more casual players the option to enjoy the mechanics in the new mode without having to run something they just keep dying in. At the same time, some players are wondering why FromSoftware doesn’t just nuke the whole ranking up system altogether and just let players choose which Depth they want to play on from the jump. Some fans were also hoping for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989">a true “endless” mode,</a> which was rumored based on original datamines for the Deep of Night update but which appear to have been based on a mistranslation.</p> <p>Deep of Night is cool overall, but the progression system has been a bit of a bust. It’s also not a replacement for new bosses, maps, or random events during runs. The new difficulty mode will need more tweaks if it’s going to keep<em> Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> in the multiplayer rotation for a lot of current players, especially with so many other big games coming out this fall. But in the meantime, at least everyone can go back and farm the broken Deep Relics they need from easier Depths.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review.1302810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been six years since the last mainline </span><i><span>Borderlands </span></i><span>game. (No, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496"><i><span>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</span></i></a> <span>doesn’t count.) A lot has changed in the last six years, both in the land of video games and in the real world. Players expect a lot more from co-op shooters. And the people in charge are power-hungry losers. </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>tries to change with the times, with mixed results.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While it’s a damn fine shooter, the best Gearbox has made, and one which lets the franchise now stand comfortably next to genre titans like </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, its attempts to address life living under a fascist regime don’t work out as well. But you’ll probably be too busy talking and joking with your friends to notice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span>, in a lot of ways, feels like a soft reboot of the series. The past games still happened and are referenced in big and small ways throughout the story, but the sequel is set on the new planet of Kairos and features new villains, allies, and things to kill. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">And unlike </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570"><i><span>Borderlands 3</span></i></a><span>’s story, which revolved around saving the universe and hopping across the galaxy, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is a smaller, more contained yarn mostly focused on what happens when powerful people take control and never let go.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>A New World To Be Saved</b></h2> <p><span>While I won’t spoil any specific details in this review, I’ll let you know ahead of time that if you are coming to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>to enjoy a satisfying tale of people rising up under fascism to defeat evil, you’ll get that—right up until the end of the main campaign. Then it kind of falls apart.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A twist in the game’s finale turns its main villain, the Timekeeper, into a far less compelling character. But before that, I really enjoyed the amount of time Gearbox devoted to showing how evil the Timekeeper and his cronies are, and how characters deal with the question of how much they’re willing to sacrifice for freedom. And what happens when some go too far, or not far enough? Don’t expect </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>-like depth and writing about genocidal leaders here. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by how often I cared about what was happening to both new and returning characters alike. Gearbox’s writers do a fantastic job of really making you hate the Timekeeper and his various underlings. Don’t get </span><i><span>too </span></i><span>attached to anyone in this story. That’s all I’m saying…&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Of course, if you play </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>with a group of your rowdy, silly friends, a lot of its writing will get buried under your pals screaming about loot drops or laughing about inside jokes. If you care at all about the tale Gearbox is telling here, do a run through the story by yourself and take your time to interact with characters and listen to audio logs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of whether you play alone or with others, to defeat the Timekeeper and break his ironclad hold over Karios and its suffering populace, you’ll need to kill thousands of troopers, aliens, monsters, and robots using some of the billions of guns available to loot in</span><i><span> Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <h2><b>Killin’ In The Name…Of Fun</b></h2> <p><span>What’s going to keep me coming back to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> for (likely) years is the gunplay and movement. I’ve never outright hated the combat in past </span><i><span>Borderlands</span></i><span> games, but this is the first one where I think Gearbox has truly nailed it. And not just because they tossed in more guns than ever before.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> lets players double jump, glide, grapple, and wall climb around the open world of Kairos. This, combined with guns that, overall, feel more distinct and punchier, really helps elevate </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>into the upper echelon of first-person shooters.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Further elevating combat in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>are the shooter’s four distinct and new playable Vault Hunters. Each one shakes up how combat encounters play out thanks to their different powers and abilities. Playing alongside a powerful Rafa, a cybersoldier, will lead to combat encounters that feel very different than when you play alone or next to other hunters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Really, you get like</span><i><span> 12 characters,</span></i><span> because each hunter has three skill trees that each feature mini-skill trees inside. Perhaps you and a pal both play Vex, the new Siren character. Well, you’ll likely be very different versions of Vex by the time you both reach level 50, thanks to all the different skill and ability options available to each of you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627162">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As I leveled up, found great guns I liked, and got more comfortable with the new movement options, I would often get into flow states where I’d lost track of time. I’d end up losing 10 minutes to a random encounter on my way to a big quest simply because I just love shooting shit in this game so much.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I did find, though, that </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>has a nasty habit of throwing a few too many waves of enemies at you during a lot of encounters. I’d wipe out the fourth or fifth wave of angry psychos or space buffalo, and then another wave would arrive. And then another. It often felt like too much, and made some missions and activities drag on. Still, I wasn’t too mad because once I’d wiped every enemy out, I was left with piles of loot.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Crappy Green Pistols For As Far As The Eye Can See</b></h2> <p><span>The loot in </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> like in past games, is the real secret sauce. It’s what keeps you going through a boring mission, or makes it hard to stop playing despite feeling tired and needing to go to bed. That promise that the next gun, shield, or grenade that drops will be better than anything you have.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sure, most of the time, what drops is garbage you won’t use, but thanks to</span><i><span> Bord</span></i><i><span>e</span></i><i><span>rlands 4</span></i><span>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953">improved loot management options</a>, collecting and selling truckloads of terrible rifles and shotguns is easier than ever. And when that amazing piece of loot </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>pop out of a dead enemy or chest with a distinct ping noise, it’s one of the best feelings ever. If I could bottle it and sell it, I’d be a very rich man. It feels even better in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>because some of the best loot, Legendary guns, are much rarer than in the last game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And because nearly everything you do around the open world of Karios rewards you with loot, it can be hard not to just keep playing for hours and hours. Kairos is a big map, chockablock with small activities to complete–like activating a radio tower and defending it from baddies–as well as bigger or sillier side quests, world bosses, collectibles to hunt down, secrets to find, and random events to complete.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box-quote</p>                 <p>"Billions of guns, four friends, one meh ending."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Gearbox</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC (Played on both PS5 and PC) </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person co-op focused sci-fi looter shooter</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Combat better than ever, great traversal options, QoL changes, open world.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bugs and performance problems, less-than-satisfying ending, some fights feel too big.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 12, 2025 </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>As a result, the open world of </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is more active and alive than in any previous entry in the franchise, and all of this content rewards you with more loot. Thank god you can junk most of it in seconds. Otherwise, I’d have drowned in all the green pistols that the game dumped on me over my 60 or so hours with it across PS5 and PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Loot also becomes a currency among friends. Get a cool sniper, but you don’t snipe? Drop it for your friend. And then, if they find a badass shield that suits your character build better, they’ll share it with you, or you can at least guilt-trip them into giving it over. And because guns can spawn with all sorts of wild extra parts that turn SMGs into rocket snipers or whatever, hunting for loot and sharing it with pals is more exciting than ever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Well, assuming you can </span><i><span>see </span></i><span>the guns you have. A nasty bug affected one of my friends and made all his guns invisible. Which leads me to my biggest disappointment with</span><i><span> Borderlands 4: </span></i><span>the technical problems.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Excuse Me, There’s Some Bugs In My Looter Shooter</b></h2> <p><span>On PlayStation 5 Pro, I routinely had to restart the game due to the performance tanking <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">after a few hours of play</a>. I also encountered a few bugged quests that required restarts, too. Over on PC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">many players and I have experienced optimization and performance problems</a>. Even on my RTX 5080, which can run everything I throw at it, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>demands I turn on DLSS and frame gen while also turning down visual settings. And despite getting the game to run at a mostly stable 120FPS, I still encounter microstutters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>On both platforms, I’ve also found empty vending machines, seen characters hovering off the ground, had animations break, events not start, and encountered audio lines cutting out randomly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>None of this has completely ruined my enjoyment of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">Borderlands</a> 4</span></i><span>, and I’ve had some sessions in which it all worked pretty flawlessly, minus some hitches or stutters. But it would be irresponsible not to mention these technical flaws and annoyances in a review o</span><i><span>f Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> as they are just as much a part of the game as the loot, combat, and story. Hopefully, Gearbox can patch the game over the next few weeks and months to create a better experience, and this part of my review will then become a weird artifact from the past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627163">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Still, despite some annoying bugs and performance problems, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> in many ways, is the best game Gearbox has ever made.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It takes what the studio has learned about creating looter shooters and builds upon that in a way that feels like a big moment for the franchise. A large leap forward in both gameplay and narrative. I joked with colleagues that critics and players would suggest this is where the series “finally grew up,” but really, that’s what it feels like.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The story isn’t as cringeworthy, with far fewer memes, more character-driven jokes, and a sense that you might not get out of this adventure with all your friends in one piece. The combat and movement are more refined and expanded, no longer feeling like an afterthought as was the case in past games. And the world of Kairos is visually varied and packed with good reasons to explore it alone or with friends.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Bugs, performance problems, a less-than-memorable villain, and a grindy endgame are disappointing for sure, but what Gearbox has put together is still a mostly fun, action-packed, and hand-crafted looter shooter that proves once again that this studio is still the best at making these kinds of over-the-top FPS RPGs. </span></p>

              <p><span>There’s a lot to love about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>. The kart racer is just under a week away from launch, and I’ve been playing it and really enjoying Sonic and friends’ latest run around the racetrack. It’s got a surprising amount of depth with its customizable builds, a wide spread of tracks referencing </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>history, and its races are chaotic, fast-paced fun. But one of the best things the game does happens just before the races. In single-player modes, you’re pitted against a specific Rival racer, and before the first race, they’ll exchange some words with whoever you’re playing as. These brief back-and-forths are absolutely delightful, and show that everyone in the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cast is a professional trash talker.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CNSbEod2FF">pic.twitter.com/CNSbEod2FF</a></p> <p>— Mlick (@Mlickles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mlickles/status/1968720889840562281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>When I play </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>, I play almost exclusively as Shadow the Hedgehog, so I’ve seen just how vicious Sonic Team has made my boy when talking to pretty much everyone on the roster. Now that reviews are out and more coverage is circulating, I’m seeing a lot more of this banter and realizing that there’s some grade-A smack talk happening in this game. </span><i><span>Crossworlds&nbsp; </span></i><span>doesn’t really have a story like previous </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racing games, so most of the character interactions come from these pre-race rap battles. Everyone in the roster has a little bit of attitude, and it means that if you put them in a competitive situation, they’re gonna try to rustle their opponents’ feathers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not all of these interactions are hostile, though. These races are all in good fun, so if characters who vibe get paired up as rivals, they’re usually pretty chill, and it’s sometimes illuminating to hear them talk, especially if they haven’t really had much screentime together over the years. So sit back and enjoy some of the best exchanges I’ve seen online thus far.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMEGA REALLY SAID YOU HAVE  NO MONEY, NO LEADS NO BITCHES</p> <p>OH MY GOD😭😭😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF">https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF</a></p> <p>— Chonzo (COMMS OPEN) (@chonzodraws) <a href="https://twitter.com/chonzodraws/status/1968712490281287904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get the feeling Shadow might not like Charmy.</p> <p>Though to be fair he doesn't seem to like a lot of people. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZhyKA60fqu">pic.twitter.com/ZhyKA60fqu</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968672404940451959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don't think you can blame Shadow for this TBH they've barely even interacted beyond that one recent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDWSonic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IDWSonic</a> issue. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/C1ubko6qvn">pic.twitter.com/C1ubko6qvn</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968745172587471248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn, Jet is really mad at Big <a href="https://t.co/8u3lIcKwzz">pic.twitter.com/8u3lIcKwzz</a></p> <p>— Funkin 🦉🐓 (@funkin03) <a href="https://twitter.com/funkin03/status/1968711269621383350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is why Shadow is the best Sonic character.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-50000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon-2000627131</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-50-000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon.1302735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all been there: that moment when your iPhone runs out of battery when you desperately need it to last. Even if you do have a power bank, more often than not, it’s the wrong cable, or worse, the standby battery isn’t even charged. That’s the frustration this 50,000mAh power bank seeks to eliminate entirely: It’s enormous in size, has all the cables you could possibly need integrated right in, and is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/">currently priced at an all-time low of $34 on Amazon, down dramatically from its usual $199</a>. That’s an <strong>83 percent off sale on a charger</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An Actual Power Bank That Fixes Everyday Charging</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the number that means the most: <strong>50,000mAh</strong>. That is just a phenomenal amount of mobile power. In all realism, you could <strong>charge your iPhone more than a dozen times before this battery depletes itself</strong>. That’s seven days of continuous use without having to use a wall charger, or more than enough power to charge your phone, your earbuds, your tablet, and even a friend’s phone when you and your group are all running low on power. The appeal is that you don’t need to bring a lot of extra accessories with you. Instead <strong>of working with adapters and wires, all you need is built-in</strong>. The unit contains four cables built in (USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB-A) so you just grab one out and plug in straight into your device.</p>



<p>And on top of that, this charger isn’t just small, but fast: With <strong>22.5W fast charging backed by PD 3.0 and QC 3.0/4.0 technology,</strong> it recognizes your device instantly and adjusts for optimal charging. For example, an iPhone 17 can go from zero to about 60 percent in half an hour. That’s faster than the old wall chargers Apple used to pack, and it’s incredibly useful when you’ve only got a few minutes before heading out the door.</p>
<p>Safety has been integrated into the system as well: The company also had a monitoring chip that keeps an eye on<strong> charging by milliseconds to avoid risks like overvoltage, overcurrent, or short circuits</strong>. Protection steps in if something goes amiss. That is, all your gadgets (whether the new iPhone 17, an iPad Pro, a Galaxy S25, or a Pixel phone) are charging without harm effectively.</p>
<p>If battery drain ever stranded or stressed you, grabbing this 50,000mAh power bank at its all-time lowest price is one of those genius purchases you won’t regret.</p>

              <p><span>In the wake of the assassination last week of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration and other reactionary movements have wielded the act as a tool to silence critics of Kirk’s views, and those who are critical of the Trump administration more broadly. One of the most highly publicized instances of this was Disney-owned ABC’s pulling of </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i><span>, following pressure from the FCC, after the talk show ran a segment that said the Trump administration had latched onto the event in order to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHT7ICvMtlA"><span>“score political points.”</span></a><span> In response, several public figures have spoken out in protest, including some actors who have prominently worked for Disney by appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span></p> <p><span>Marisa Tomei, who plays Spider-Man’s Aunt May in the superhero franchise, took to Instagram to urge people to boycott Disney, including the Marvel movies she starred in, from </span><i><span>Captain America: Civil War </span></i><span>in 2016 to </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home </span></i><span>in 2021. May was killed in the last </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>movie by the Green Goblin, and given that her death was a thematic pillar of the film, it was unlikely that Tomei would have been asked to reprise the role, but still, speaking out against one of the most powerful companies in modern media isn’t nothing.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marisa Tomei reshares post urging for the boycott of Disney brands. <a href="https://t.co/7Ni0CSu3ui">pic.twitter.com/7Ni0CSu3ui</a></p> <p>— Buzzing Pop (@BuzzingPop) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzingPop/status/1968833688759591240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Meanwhile Tatiana Maslany, the actor behind the titular hero of </span><i><span>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</span></i><span>, posted on social media urging people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. Maslany’s post was even more pointed, with her Instagram story featuring a photo of her in a motion capture suit while shooting the </span><i><span>She-Hulk </span></i><span>series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not everyone would risk their entire career for what’s right. Tatiana Maslany just did.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaked-song-limp-bizkit-songs-intel-nvidia-gpu-switch-2-amazon-2000627132</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Zack here, filling in as your host today for your regularly scheduled Ethan edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of news and other stuff you might care about. Let’s get through this thing together, and then at the end we can listen to some music and celebrate the upcoming weekend.</p> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> contains a big list of licensed songs and a lot of Limb Bizkit</strong></h2> <p>According to a new <em>Battlefield 6</em> leak, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1968725668042063960">as reported by <em>Battlefield Bulletin</em>,</a> the upcoming military shooter contains a surprisingly large list of licensed music. <em>BF Bulletin</em> says these songs will be played on the radio when driving in-game vehicles, but EA has yet to confirm any of this. Here’s the track listing, which contains three different songs credited to Limp Bizkit. Seriously.</p> <ul> <li>“Awake” – Godsmack</li> <li>“Bodies” – Drowning Pool</li> <li>“Break Stuff” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Can’t Stop” – Red Hot Chili Peppers</li> <li>“Domination” – Pantera</li> <li>“Got Each Other” – The Interrupters ft. Rancid</li> <li>“Hey Man, Nice Shot” – Filter</li> <li>“Invaders Must Die” – The Prodigy</li> <li>“Making Love to Morgan Wallen” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Master of War” – Bob Dylan</li> <li>“Nuthin’ But A G Thang” – Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg</li> <li>“Pain” – Chalk</li> <li>“You’ll Never Guess Who Died” – The Kinison</li> <li>“Battlefield: The After-party” by Henry Jackman &amp; Limp Bizkit</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://youtu.be/iCEGrHGmb1o">one of the listed Limp Bizkit songs was uploaded to Limp Bizkit’s official YouTube channel last week</a>. And the artwork for the song includes the singer on a tank that has <em>BF6</em> graffiti on it and the song’s credits list EA Music.&nbsp; So, yeah, I think we can deduce that this list is probably accurate.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">When I traveled to Los Angeles earlier this year</a> to attend the game’s big multiplayer reveal, I was shocked that its big trailer featured the Limp Bizkit song “Break Stuff.” I assumed it was a fun joke or a one-off thing. But it seems like EA and the people making <em>Battlefield 6</em> have partnered up with Limp Bizkit in some capacity, and folks, I’m not sure how I feel about any of this.</p> <h2><strong>Intel is still going to make its own GPUs following the Nvidia deal</strong></h2> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that GPU maker and tech giant Nvidia was partnering up with Intel as part of a large, long-term plan. Nvidia is investing billions into Intel and the two will work together on new products. Wild stuff. And if you were wondering if this meant the end of Intel’s own GPUs, that doesn’t seem to be the case for now. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/intel-says-arc-gpus-arent-going-anywhere-just-yet-despite-the-new-nvidia-collaboration/">As <em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>, Intel still has plans to keep making Intel Arc cards for the foreseeable future. We’ll see how long that lasts.</p>

 <h2><strong>It seems like you can just buy a Switch 2 on Amazon now</strong></h2> <p>If you’ve been wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch 2, well, it’s pretty easy to do now. As pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-for-sale-on-amazon-no-invite-required-132503609.html">Engadget</a></em>, Amazon is now selling the console in the United States without any waiting list or hoops to jump through. You just fork over $500 and wait a couple of days, and there you go. I’ve also seen multiple Switch 2 units at my local Target. So it seems like you’ll be able to snag a Switch 2 without much effort ahead of the holidays.</p> <h2><strong><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>‘s excellent soundtrack now available on Nintendo’s Music app</strong></h2> <p>I’m so mad at myself that I’ve not finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. And a big reason for that is because I miss listening to the 3D smasher-jumper, which has one of the best Nintendo soundtracks in years. Thankfully, the songs are now available on the Nintendo Music app. Now, I just need to find time to finish that game.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-have-a-button-that-blows-up-everything-in-a-map-and-its-fun-to-press-it-2000626898"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and the big button that blows everything up</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Law enforcement is reportedly digging into the gaming history of Charlie Kirk’s killer</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">The legal battle between Sony and Tencent over a knock-off <em>Horizon</em> game continues</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>Sure, why not?</p>
