              <p>A CG-rendered trailer for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/pubg-mobile">PUBG Mobile</a>‘</em>s next big update appears to confirm previous rumors that Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be appearing soon in the popular mobile port of the battle royale game. But it also features Sega’s mascot fighting… Skibidi Toilets?</p> <p>On September 24, <a href="https://x.com/Sonic_Hotspot/status/1970848502566850838">Sonic Hotspot on Twitter posted</a> what appears to be a real trailer for a yet-to-be-announced or confirmed Sonic crossover event in the long-running <em>PUBG Mobile. </em>This was spotted and s<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonicstadium.org/post/3lzlv3hy5o22u">shared by<em> SonicStadium.org</em> on Bluesky.</a> The pre-rendered event trailer shows Sonic the Hedgehog fighting a massive Skibidi Toilet character. Here’s the leaked trailer, and sorry in advance. I was going to link a YouTube re-upload of it, but that has since been removed. Hmm..</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/BaLCNi5eAV">pic.twitter.com/BaLCNi5eAV</a></p> <p>— Sonic Hotspot (@Sonic_Hotspot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sonic_Hotspot/status/1970848502566850838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Skibidi Toilets, <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-skibidi-toilet-song-dafuqboom-tiktok-explained-1850660405">which were created as part of a now massively popular YouTube animated series of shorts</a>, were already <a href="https://x.com/PUBGMOBILE/status/1970548836260069598">announced</a> to be coming to <em>PUBG Mobile</em> later this month, so it’s no surprise they are popping up in a leaked trailer. And Sonic has been rumored to be coming to <em>PUBG Mobile</em> for a few months now. Sega’s beloved mascot was <a href="https://www.topuplive.com/news/pubg-mobile-sonic-collaboration.html">even teased last month</a> in an official <em>PUBG Mobile</em> post promising six new collaborations. So that’s also not a big surprise for fans, but a nice confirmation that he’ll be here soon. However, I don’t think anybody was expecting Sonic’s reveal to include <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-outfit-costume-spirit-halloween-kids-1851637121">Skibidi Toilets</a>.</p>

 <p>There is something deeply depressing about watching Sonic fight a <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-venture-times-square-ad-skibidi-toilet-meme-1851561388">Skibidi Toilet</a>. It feels like my fears that all of pop culture will one day merge together into <a href="https://kotaku.com/iron-giant-multiversus-wb-smash-fighting-game-superman-1848945122">a single giant, boring blob of content</a> are coming true, and faster than expected. Everything is becoming <em>Fortnite</em>, and because all of this crossover slop is making companies millions of dollars, it’s unlikely to stop anytime soon.</p> <p>And so, that’s how we end up in a timeline where some silly videos made using the Source Engine have become a massively popular IP that has attracted the attention (and money) of <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-tv-show-real-youtube-1851603676">Michael Bay</a>. Sonic, you deserve better. <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-joe-biden-colbert-late-show-clip-meme-1851496589">We all do.</a> Yet, here we are.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony’s September State Of Play: New Rumors And Where To Watch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch-2000628219</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch.1307352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest PlayStation Showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-date-time-where-to-watch-2000627924">is later today</a>. Will it deliver or are Sony fans destined to wander the PS5 generation with big first-party announcements remaining few and far between? The Tokyo Game Show 2025-adjacent State of Play could deliver major updates on any number of highly anticipated games, including what’s next on Sony’s first-party docket for 2026. Is it finally time to see what Insomniac Games has been cooking with <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em>?</p> <p>The September State of Play livestream begins at 5:00 p.m. ET and will stream, per usual, on YouTube and Twitch. It has a “mercifully” concise runtime of just 35 minutes, with at least some of that devoted to Housemarque’s upcoming sci-fi shooter roguelike <em>Saros</em>. That suggests it could be on deck for the first half of next year, exactly five years after the launch of<em> Returnal</em>, a development cadence that a lot of PlayStation studios are hitting this generation.</p>  <p>But what about the rest of the 2026 release slate for the PS5? Leaks <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-showcase-state-play-tgs-2025-ff7-remake-part-3-2000626000">earlier this month</a> suggested that a new trailer for <em>Wolverine</em>, first seen back at a September 2021 Sony showcase, was ready for primetime and likely to air during the company’s next event. A build was leaked in the malicious hack back in 2023 and the game’s creative director left the studio last year. Outside of that, we still know hardly anything about how it will play or what <em>X-Men</em> stories it will weave into its campaign.</p>

 <p>On the third-party front, there’s a rumor that our next look at<em> Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> could be at the showcase to confirm a potential 2026 release window. We also know that Square Enix doesn’t have its own livestream booked for TGS, suggesting updates on <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, <em>Dragon Quest 12</em>, or <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part III</em> could come during Sony’s showcase. It would be great to finally be able to put the rumors about the<em> Final Fantasy 9</em> remake to bed one way or the other as well.</p>

 <p>One game that seemingly won’t be at the showcase is Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/09/23/bungies-marathon-not-at-sonys-new-state-of-play-next-look-months-away/"><em>Forbes</em>‘ Paul Tassi reports</a> that an expected update on when the extraction shooter will launch won’t be part of the event. “The earliest we will see something more from <em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is November. And that’s a ‘maybe,’ right now,” he writes. The game has been going through some last-minute reworks after feedback from an alpha earlier this year and a scandal over plagiarized art soon after.</p> <p>Sony previously said it was still expecting the extraction loot shooter to hit before the end of March 2026. Given the wretched state of <em>Destiny 2</em> this summer, there couldn’t be more riding on it for the company’s live-service legacy and, more importantly, Bungie’s future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security posted a <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">gross video of ICE making multiple arrests</a> set to the original <em>Poké</em><em>mon&nbsp;</em>anime’s theme song, as well as using interstitial cuts of the show and displaying mock-ups of trading cards for several of the individuals arrested. After millions of people saw the video and called on Nintendo or The Pokémon Company to pursue legal action, the company has issued a statement to <em>Kotaku.</em></p> <p>“We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand,” the statement reads. “Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gotta Catch ‘Em All. <a href="https://t.co/qCvflkJGmB">pic.twitter.com/qCvflkJGmB</a></p> <p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The statement stops short of mentioning whether the company plans to take any further action. Doug McGowan, <em>Pokemon</em>‘s ex-legal chief, told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">IGN</a>&nbsp;</em>that if he were still working with the company, he “wouldn’t touch this” case for a few reasons.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t see them doing anything about this for a few reasons,” McGowan told <em>IGN</em>. “First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]’s name in the press,” McGowan told <em>IGN</em>. “They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn’t touch this, and I’m the most trigger-happy [Chief Legal Officer] I’ve ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s probably the safer course of action, but it’s certainly not the more principled one considering The Pokémon Company has pursued legal action for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-mobile-lawsuit-pocket-monster-remake-1851765825">far less egregious offenses</a>. But hey, at least it’s putting all its legal team to good use by <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">patenting mechanics</a> and suing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit-patent-1851652489">knock-off monster-catching franchises</a>, right?</p>

              <p>How many cables do you have running across your desk right now? The more smart devices we have the more clutter we accumulate as each needs its own cable and adapter to keep it’s battery charged up. My nightstand is a nightmare. Having to plug in my phone, earbuds, and smartwatch at the end of the day leaves barely any room for eave a glass of water. And when I reach to check a notification on my phone, the cables get tangled, pulling stuff off the stand. At least that was the case before I got myself a dedicated charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/">Take a look at this 3-in-1 wireless charger from Acer. It’s normally selling for $70, but Amazon has it in a limited time deal, bringing the price down by 32%.</a> That equates to a savings of $22 having you only need to pay $48.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Acer MagSafe charging station is designed with Apple in mind, making use of Qi2 wireless charging. Modern Apple devices all are equipped with wireless charging capability. If you have an iPhone 12 or later, your phone will be compatible. The 3-in-1 charger’s three dedicated charging platforms are each made for you iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, magnetically adhering to your devices. This keeps clutter down and you’re devices still easily accessible while charging. No more knocking things off the nightstand when you get a late night text.</p>
<p>The cylindrical base is made for stability, keeping it always upright even when you phone is providing some extra weight on top while charging. The anti-slip pads along the bottom keep it firmly planted in place. The charger also doubles as a stand. If you choose to keep the Acer charger on your desktop, you phone when mounted is set at an ideal viewing angle so you can scroll with it in place or just keep it there next to you in view in case a notification pops up.</p>



<h2>Portability in Mind</h2>
<p>The charging stand is made to be portable. The iPhone charging platform can rotate around to for a cylinder while the AirPod and Apple Watch platforms can retract into the base. This leaves you with a little capsule about the size and shape of a soda can which you can easily fit into your bag while traveling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/">Get the Acer 3-in-1 charger and eliminated clutter on your desk for a hefty discount for a limited time</a>. Right now, you’ll save 32% while the sale is still active.</p>
