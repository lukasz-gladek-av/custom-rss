              <p>Apple’s pricing strategy since Black Friday has been wild to watch with the AirPods Pro 3 dropping roughly $10 each week like clockwork. Yesterday <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">they were sitting at $209, and today they’ve hit $199, marking an all-time low</a> that you won’t find on Apple’s official site where they’re still listed at the full $249. <strong>Amazon’s exclusively offering this discount</strong> and makes it the perfect moment to grab wireless earbuds that pack hearing aid features, live translation, and heart rate sensing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why These Earbuds Are Worth the Hype</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation <strong>cuts out up to twice as much unwanted nois</strong>e as the AirPods Pro 2 and makes a bubble of silence that works just as well on subway rides as it does in open offices where coworkers won’t stop talking. The new acoustic architecture changes how music sounds to your ears, the bass feels deeper without making the midrange sound muddy, and the clarity lets you hear each instrument in complex tracks. <strong>Vocals are so clear that it sounds like the host is talking directly to you in podcasts</strong> and audiobooks. Last but not least, <strong>spatial audio makes the soundstage three-dimensional</strong> and moves with your head.</p>



<p>Heart rate sensing lets you track your fitness right from your earbuds, keeping track of your pulse and calories burned during up to 50 different types of workouts without needing to wear an Apple Watch. You can use the Move ring, count your steps, and Workout Buddy, which is powered by Apple Intelligence and learns your habits and pushes you when you’re not working hard enough.<strong> Live Translation makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages</strong> in real time and Apple Intelligence does all the hard work in the background: This one feature changes how you can travel and talk to friends and clients from other countries.</p>
<p>With ANC on, the battery lasts up to 8 hours on a single charge and with Transparency mode and the Hearing Aid feature on, the battery lasts up to 10 hours. The <strong>USB-C charging case lets you listen for more than 24 hours</strong> before you need to find an outlet. If you plug it in for just five minutes, it will charge quickly and give you about an hour of playback time<strong>. With five different ear tip sizes</strong>, you can finally find a fit that stays in place while you run or just listen to music.</p>



<p>The hearing health features are more advanced than what you’d find in regular earbuds and you can take a clinical-grade hearing test at home using guided tones and frequency sweeps. The Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost makes voices louder in noisy places, so you can follow conversations at restaurants or family gatherings without having to ask people to repeat themselves all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connections</strong> stay strong even in crowded places where wireless signals usually have trouble: Your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will automatically switch between them based on which one you’re using at the time. You can control playback, answer calls, and switch between noise cancellation modes on each earbud stem without having to look for your phone. With spatial audio and dynamic head tracking, movies and TV shows sound like they are coming from a personal surround sound system, and the sound moves naturally as you turn your head.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get Apple’s best earbuds for $199 instead of $249 which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. This is a great deal for features that used to only be found in medical devices and high-end headphones. With better noise cancellation, heart rate tracking, live translation, and real hearing aid features, you get tools that make your daily life better than just listening to music.</p>

<h2>A powerful cordless vacuum built for all your everyday messes</h2>
<p>This model is more than just your average push-and-go vacuum, with features like intelligent suction and a LCD screen on the frame itself to give you real-time info while you clean. That includes giving you a heads up on its battery life down to the second, so you know exactly how much time you have left to clean. It also lets you know about any potential maintenance needs, which helps keep the vacuum performing at its best. This small detail makes a big difference, especially if you like knowing what’s going on with your appliances.</p>
<p>But really, all that to say its major feature is the fact that it’s cordless. Sure, there are tons of cordless vacuums out there. It’s just that this one has better maneuverability that going corless facilitates, so it’s easier to clean stairs, corners, and tight spaces. You can quickly grab it for a spill or mess without needing to plan around outlets. The vacuum converts into a handheld unit, making it simple to clean furniture, car interiors, shelves, and baseboards.</p>



<p>The filtration system can capture even the smallest of particles and dust, as well as germs. Thats super helpful for homes with pets or allergies. It traps debris inside the bin rather than releasing it back into the air, helping your home feel cleaner after you’re done vacuuming.</p>
<p>Battery life is solid for most households. You can clean several rooms on a single charge, and the vacuum is efficient enough to handle routine cleaning without constant recharging. The included wall mounted dock keeps it charged and ready, while also giving you a neat place to store attachments.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">There’s a lot to love about this vacuum, but in all honestly, we’re mostly attracted to the discount right now.</a> Whether you have a large house or a small apartment, this is an appliance you’ll want to use regularly, and it’ll make the money back for you in terms of time. Plus, you won’t have to keep buying new vacuums. Buy this one once, and you should be as good as done.</p>
