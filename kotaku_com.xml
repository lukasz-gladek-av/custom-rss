              <p>Laptop screens restrict your productivity to a cramped workspace, and portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch merit something way more than their diminutive built-in displays. The <em>Arzopa</em> 15.6-inch <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">portable monitor just hit an all-time low of $74 for Black Friday over at Amazon, down from the usual $104</a>. This ultra-slim display solves your need for extra screen real estate without having to carry around bulky monitors. This <strong>monitor weighs in at just 1.6 pounds and measures 0.35 inches thick</strong> which makes it portable – not just technically movable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Looks Good</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel pushes 1920 by 1080 resolution</strong>&nbsp;which provides crisp text for productivity work and detailed visuals for gaming. IPS technology delivers accurate colors and maintains image quality<strong> across a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you don’t see color shifting or contrast loss when viewing the screen from the side. The display adeptly handles everything from work documents to game graphics. The 1080p resolution nets you enough pixels to comfortably read small text or see fine details in games without everything looking blocky.</p>



<p>This ultra-slim design makes the monitor genuinely travel-friendly: At 1.6 pounds, <strong>you hardly notice it in a backpack beside your laptop</strong> while its 0.35-inch thickness lets it slide into laptop sleeves or backpack pockets designed for tablets. Arzopa built the monitor with metal materials that feel solid without adding any unnecessary weight. The compact form factor fits easily on airplane tray tables, coffee shop counters, or hotel desks where space is at a premium.</p>
<p>An<strong> integrated kickstand negates the need to carry around separate stands</strong> or lean the monitor against a stack of books. The stand adjusts across multiple angles, letting you position the screen for comfortable viewing as you sit at a desk or recline on a couch. It reliably holds position, without slowly creeping closed during use. The integrated approach means you have all you need for setting up without any extra accessories cluttering your bag.</p>



<p>Multiple display modes adapt to different use cases without complicated configuration. Duplicate mode simply mirrors your primary display, ideal for presentations or showing content to others. Extend mode gives you more workspace, expanding your desktop across both screens and effectively doubling your screen real estate. Second screen mode makes the portable monitor a stand-alone display for phones or tablets.</p>
<p>The <strong>USB-C and HDMI connectivity covers</strong> just about every device that you might want to connect. With modern laptops that come with USB-C ports, you can send out video and power over a single cable, meaning no need for a separate power adapter if your laptop provides enough juice. HDMI input handles game consoles, older laptops, and any device with standard HDMI output. Thanks to plug-and-play functionality, you connect the cable and the display works right off without drivers installed or visiting configuration menus.</p>
<p><strong>Wide compatibility across laptops, desktops, Macs, phones, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch</strong> means no adapter hassles or workarounds.</p>
<p>For $74, this portable monitor is less than many people spend on a single dinner out and promises legitimate productivity and entertainment value. You get a full HD IPS display with metal construction, integrated stand and universal connectivity for almost 30% off of the regular price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/act-fast-to-snag-the-jbl-flip-5-for-80-after-this-early-black-friday-deal-dropped-it-by-20-2000645565</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-flip-5-bluetooth-speaker-hits-its-deepest-price-cut-ever-the-moment-amazon-black-friday-begins.1359379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Good music means good vibes. The right speaker can bring any party or gathering to life. If you have been after something that delivers powerful sound that’s rich and deep, yet balanced for all your tracks, without spending big bucks, Amazon is making the upgrade easier than ever.</span></p>
<p>The retailer is now offering its early Black Friday sales across a wide range of categories, including audio gear. We are spotting deep discounts on headphones, earbuds, and even some top-rated Bluetooth speakers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5740/">One of our favorite markdowns from the sale? The JBL Flip 5, which is now going for just $80 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> The offer applies to almost all color options, so there’s plenty to choose from. These include black, red, white, teal, and even the most stunning pink!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5740/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Both Prime and non-Prime members can snag the deal, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase. This is the lowest price this speaker has dropped to in the last 30 days, but we don’t expect the discount to stay around for long. Snap it up before it expires for good.</p>

<h2>Portable Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>This can-sized Bluetooth speaker is easy to carry around with you on the go. It features a durable fabric and rugged rubber housing that prevents it from everyday wear and tear. You won’t have to continuously worry about keeping it safe on your trips. Just toss it in your bag and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Don’t let the size fool you, though. With up to 20 watts of power, it delivers JBL signature sound that’s both rich and balanced. It captures all the highs and lows exceptionally well, making podcasts come through clearly and bringing your favorite tracks to life. The sound is big enough to spread evenly through most places, but you can always pair two JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers for stereo sound or multiple compatible speakers for a much larger experience. This way, you can host your very own private concerts right there in the yard!</p>
<p>The IPX7 rating means you can take your speaker with you on the beach, by the pool, or even in the shower without a worry. In fact, the JBL Flip 5 is waterproof up to three feet deep, so even an accidental drop in water won’t hurt these. You can focus on enjoying the songs instead of babysitting the speaker all the time.</p>



<p>The built-in 4800mAh rechargeable battery lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge. That’s enough to keep the party going all night long. Just plug these in the morning for an hour or so, and enjoy all your favorite tracks the entire night with friends. The speaker works well with a range of devices, and you just need to have a stable Bluetooth connection to get started. All that you need to do is turn the speaker on, enable Bluetooth on your desired device, and choose the speaker from the list of available options. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. There’s also a quick start guide included in the box, which you can refer to if you run into any issues while pairing it.</p>
<p>All things considered, this tiny but mighty Bluetooth speaker not only offers powerful, rich sound but also gets you an impressive battery life. It’s reliable enough to take with you on the go, as can handle everyday wear and tear well. If you’re planning to host some fun gatherings during the holiday season or just want to enjoy your favorite songs in a more immersive way, now is the time to act.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-is-powering-every-next-gen-console-and-its-gpus-are-about-to-get-even-more-expensive.1359319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans of AMD’s GPUs, which are typically more cost-effective than those made by Nvidia, might be in for some sticker shock in the near future. Team Red is likely to start raising the price of its goods. And unfortunately, there’s a chance this will affect more than just your graphics card.</p> <p>As <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-rumored-to-raise-gpu-prices-just-as-radeon-rx-9070-xt-finally-reaches-msrp">reported by <i>VideoCardz</i></a>, AMD has informed its partners of an impending price hike for its GPUs. Last month the company reportedly adjusted prices for its corporate partners to reflect changes in the market, though it managed to save retail customers from the shift. This time around, however, retail prices are likely to get hit. The culprit? Well, if you’ve been paying attention to the price fluctuations of computer components, you may already know: the cost of DRAM components, which provide the memory for computers and other electronics, is going up as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-hikes-memory-chip-prices-by-up-60-shortage-worsens-sources-say-2025-11-14/">the AI industry</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/wM8LDVIiwhA">wolfs down</a> the earth.</p>

 <p>And if you’re familiar with what goes inside consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series machines, or even the upcoming Steam Machine, then you know AMD chips power those too.</p> <p>Retail prices haven’t gone up just yet, but the prospect is frustrating.Sure, PC gaming has always been more expensive than just grabbing the latest Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo box and plugging it in, but it’s continued to get worse. And given the central role AMD plays in all of these devices, PC gamers aren’t the only ones likely to get a haircut.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordvpn-is-almost-free-on-black-friday-now-selling-at-77-off-for-us-customers-only-2000645733</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nordvpn-is-almost-free-on-black-friday-now-selling-at-77-off-for-us-customers-only.1359313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>NordVPN just launched its Black Friday deal this morning</strong> on November 20th and matches Amazon’s Black Friday kickoff with aggressive pricing of its own: The NordVPN <em>Basic</em> plan <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">dropped to a record low of $2.99 per month when you commit to 27 months, which works out to $80.73 total instead of the usual $312.93</a>.</p>
<p>VPN services protect your internet privacy, encrypt your connection and let you access content that’s geographically restricted, but most people skip them because monthly costs add up quickly. This <strong>Black Friday pricing makes premium VPN protection cost less than a fancy coffee each month</strong>, and you<strong> get three extra months</strong> thrown in on top of the two-year commitment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<h2>What NordVPN Does for Your Daily Internet Use</h2>
<p>NordVPN <strong>encrypts all the data that travels between your device and the internet</strong> which prevents your internet service provider, government agencies, or hackers on public Wi-Fi from seeing what you are doing online. Normally, your ISP tracks every website you visit and can sell that data to advertisers or hand it over to authorities without your knowledge. The encryption forms a security tunnel that scrambles your traffic into unreadable code and anyone intercepting it sees only gibberish instead of your passwords, bank details, or browsing history.</p>
<p>The service<strong> works by masking your actual IP address</strong> and routing your connection through NordVPN’s servers in the country of your choice. Websites and online services will see the VPN server’s IP address instead of your own, effectively blocking them from tracking your physical location or compiling deeply detailed profiles of what you do online. Based on where you choose, you could appear to browse from within the UK, Japan or anywhere else NordVPN has servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<p>NordVPN currently operates <strong>more than 6,000 servers across 111 countries</strong> which builds the required structure for fast and reliable connections, no matter where you are located or through which region you connect. The distributed server network allows one to always find a nearby server that will impact your speed very little, or connect to distant servers when you need to access specific regional content. Based in Panama, this country has no obligatory data retention laws: It’s also outside of international agreements, including Five Eyes surveillance. In this context, <strong>NordVPN can follow its strict no-logs policy</strong> without any government pressure to capture user data.</p>
<p>For $2.99 per month, the <em>Basic</em> plan will get you the core VPN functionality: secure, fast connections, and the ability to use the service on up to 10 devices simultaneously. Protect your laptop, phone, and tablet, or configure your router to lock down every device on your home network with a single VPN connection. <strong>The 30-day money-back guarantee</strong> lets you try out the service completely risk-free, and you’ll receive a full refund if it doesn’t meet your needs. You’ll save 74% compared to paying month-to-month, and the total cost for 27 months plus those three bonus months drops to just $80.73.</p>
<p>NordVPN Plus plan jumps to $3.89 per month and adds anti-malware protection, ad blocking, tracker blocking and a password manager with breach scanner. Complete at $4.89 monthly includes everything in Plus plan plus scam call protection and 1TB of encrypted cloud storage. Prime plan at $6.89 monthly adds NordProtect identity protection with cyber crime monitoring and insurance coverage.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Turns Beats Solo 4 Into Apple’s Cheapest Headphone for Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-solo-4-headphones-2000645533</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-turns-beats-solo-4-into-apple%E2%80%99s-cheapest-headphone-for-black-friday.1359310/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good headphones that offer solid sound quality, have a reliable battery life, and are comfortable to wear for an extended period are hard to find. And when you do find a pair that offers all this, the price tag isn’t always the most friendly. In fact, most such options sit well over $250.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that’s not the case today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">Amazon, like most other retailers, is offering plenty of impressive early Black Friday discounts you can score ahead of the event.</a> It has also dropped the price of the top-rated Beats Solo 4 by 35%! Normally, these would run you around $200, but you can now grab them for just $130. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this pair go for in a long time, and the offer applies to all color options. Looking for something minimal? The matte black version looks stunning. Want something with a bit more personality to it? Pink and blue color options are just as heavily discounted. Just note that, like most other big discounts, this one won’t be around for long. If you have been wanting to grab a premium pair without spending a ton, now is the time to act.</p>
<p>Add the product to your cart, and the discount will apply automatically; no coupon codes or complicated procedures to worry about!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound That Pulls You In</h2>
<p>These headphones feature a premium design. The overall build is super lightweight, and the headband folds down safely when not in use. This means the pair doesn’t take up much space in bags; just fold it, toss it in, and you’re good to go. They are also quite comfortable to wear, thanks to the UltraPlush ear cushions that fit nicely and stay in place throughout the day. You can wear them for hours while travelling, streaming, or gaming without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Powerful sound is made possible with a custom acoustic architecture and updated drivers that deliver the brand’s signature sound. Expect rich, deep audio, whether you’re listening to a podcast, vibing to your favorite songs, or winding down after a long day with some relaxing music. These also support spatial audio with dynamic head tracking for a more immersive, surround-sound experience, which pulls you in. This mode makes it feel like you’re part of whatever’s playing, in real-time, from concerts to action-packed movies.</p>



<p>Best of all, plugging in via USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable lets you stream in a format that preserves the original quality of any recording; perfect for when you want to experience a more detailed texture in your music. Calls get a boost, too. The upgraded microphones are smart enough to automatically reject background noise (chatter, laughter, traffic) on your end while precisely targeting your voice. You can attend meetings and catch up with friends even in busy cafes and chaotic subways!</p>
<p>The battery is designed to last up to 50 hours on a full charge. That’s more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging the pair in. Recharging is fast, as well, and you can get an additional five hours of listening with just a quick 10-minute top-up. Compatibility-wise, the Beats Solo 4 work well with both Android and iOS devices. Pairing them with smartphones, tablets, computers, and more hardly takes a few minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The pair is now down to $130, which makes grabbing these quite affordable right now.</a> The discount could wrap up soon, however, which is why it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time. All color options are discounted, so you can grab the one that suits your aesthetics the best.</p>

              <p>Homer will break new ground in <em>Fortnite</em>: his underpants version will blast its nips, unlike every previous bare-chested skin before it. It’s all seemingly part of the next beat in the battle royale’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-fortnite-homer-mascots-santa-monica-2000645254">ongoing <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season</a>.</p> <p>While a giant naked Homer was shown off in the latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buwIZkFuBA0">Multiplidiocy</a>” animated trailer this week, the actual giant Homer skin <a href="https://twitter.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1991097774012797411%7Ctwgr%5E6b2bc80873737b841841aee64dc4d0c99c09bc95%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fleaked-underwear-homer-would-be-first-fortnite-skin-with-nipples%2F1100-6536357%2F">has also leaked</a> ahead of its introduction to the game, confirming the existence of nipples. Casual fans might be thinking, “So what? I’ve seen Homer’s nipples dozens of times before.” Yes, yes you have. We all have. But not in <em>Fortnite</em>, a game which has famously refused to put nipples on character skins until now.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-underwear-homer-would-be-first-fortnite-skin-with-nipples/1100-6536357/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">As <em>GameSpot</em> points out</a>, a shirtless Travis Scott performed nipple-less in<em> Fortnite</em> way back in 2019. Bare-chested skins for Castaway Jonesy, Menace, TheGrefg, Raz, Dude, and others all had their nipples nerfed as well. Kong was not immune. Neither was Avatar’s Aang. Even Drax and Blanka had their glands removed. The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.resetera.com%2Fthreads%2Fhelp-me-understand-male-nipples-in-japanese-media.455356%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw35zTq1Jgy_2Lw9GQ7eKL7n&amp;ust=1763734655381000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;opi=89978449&amp;ved=0CBkQjhxqFwoTCPCNtOT1gJEDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">mighty Goku</a> was stripped as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First look at New (Giant) Homer Skin! <a href="https://t.co/LI2ibt7SfM">pic.twitter.com/LI2ibt7SfM</a></p> <p>— Dr Cacahuette – FN Leaks (@DrCacahuette) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So why is Homer different? Is he just more cartoony than the others, and so Epic Games is less squeamish about adding a pair of dots to his cel-shaded character model? Or is this the company dipping its first toe into the pond, with more realistic anatomy to eventually follow for other characters?</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/here-are-a-bunch-of-other-video-game-nipples-1818495101">Other companies</a> haven’t shied away from adding nipples to lots of other cartoon-y video game characters. Sora from <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> had nipples all the way back in the PS2-era, when they probably took all week to animated and half the RAM to render. Even Nintendo bravely <a href="https://kotaku.com/marios-supposed-to-be-cute-which-is-why-his-nipples-gr-1828557226">let&nbsp;Mario’s nips go free</a> in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, though it has <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-it-seems-has-removed-marios-nipples-1844723285">occasionally censored them</a> in other contexts.</p> <p>It’s nice to see Epic Games finally catching up.</p> <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s <em>Simpsons</em> season is set to end on November 28, so it probably won’t be long until whatever final showdown Epic has planned with giant naked Homer goes into effect. That’s likely when the new skin will drop. After that, well, the company is already trying to get fans hyped for its next big Hollywood takeover: <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-kill-bill-yukis-revenge-lost-chapter-tarantino-2000645687"><em>Kill Bill</em></a>.</p>
