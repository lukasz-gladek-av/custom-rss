              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><span>coming on December 10</span></a><span>, and the $30 expansion is bringing new Pokémon to Lumiose City that weren’t in the base game. Some of these monsters are getting Mega Evolutions, and we already know Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur will definitely be getting these powerful transformations next month. And because these three were confirmed in today’s trailer, we also probably know all the others that will be added thanks to fans datamining the game.</span></p>  <p><span>The supposed list of new Megas that began circulating last month included Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur, so it stands to reason that it’s at least a partial view of what new Mega forms will debut in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. Notably, some Pokémon who already have Mega Evolutions in the base game are supposedly getting a second Mega Evolution that fans are calling “Z” forms, but it’s unclear at the moment what they’ll actually be called in-game. The full list reads as follows:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu X</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu Y</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Chimecho</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Absol</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Staraptor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Garchomp</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Lucario</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golurk</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Meowstic</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Crabominable</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golisopod</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Magearna</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Scovillain</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Glimmora</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tatsugiri</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baxcalibur</span></li> </ul> <p><span>I’m not holding my breath, but it would be cool if there were even more Mega Evolutions that we don’t know about. Corviknight, the armored bird from the Galar region, is shown in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>trailer, and one of my favorites, so I would love it if he got a surprise Mega form as well. I can’t get too greedy, though. Raichu is finally getting a Mega Evolution after a decade of disrespect, so I should probably just shut the fuck up.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>appears to take place in the post-game, so you will likely have to beat the main story before you can play it. You better get to grinding up those Z-A Royale ranks if you haven’t </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>seen the credits yet</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="175">You really can never have too much storage space on your PC — especially a gaming PC. Luckily, Samsung’s making it easy to seriously upgrade your setup with this killer deal on its premium gaming SSD. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus comes in three sizes — 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB — and almost all of them are on sale right now: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/">1TB model is down 19%, dropping from $104 to just $84</a>. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/">2TB version is discounted 15%, now $149 instead of $177</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="175">This SSD has both space and speed. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus delivers read speeds up to 7,250 MB/s and write speeds up to 6,300 MB/s, so your games and apps will load faster than you can Google, “What’s taking so long?” Whether you’re gaming, editing videos, or working with high-res photos in Photoshop, this drive keeps things running with smooth performance.</p>

<p data-start="1604" data-end="1801">Samsung also makes it easy to keep your drive in top shape. With the free Magician Software, you can monitor your SSD’s health, install updates, and make sure it’s always running at its best.</p>
<h2>PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="1125" data-end="1602">And if you’re a PlayStation 5 owner, this SSD can give your console a big storage boost too. The PS5 only has 1TB of internal space, but you actually get just over 800GB of usable storage since the system software need to take its share. With games ballooning in size year after year, we’ve got AAA title well into the triple digits of gigabytes needed. If you limit yourself to the base internal storage, you can really only limit yourself to a handful of games before you need to cleanup your storage and delete the old stuff.</p>


<p data-start="1125" data-end="1602">To expand your PS5 storage, you’ll need an SSD with at least 5,500 MB/s read speed, and the 990 EVO Plus fits the bill. Just remember though you’ll need a heatsink to go with it. This is just a small metal casing that helps keep the SSD cool while gaming. You can pick them one up for roughly $10 to $20.</p>
<p data-start="1604" data-end="1801">For a limited time, you can upgrade your PC or console storage by 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB, and save up to 19% on the Samsung 990 EVO Plus — starting at just $84. That’s a small price to pay to never need to worry about managing your PC or PS5 game storage again.</p>

              <p>Early next year, the 21-year-old MMO&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em> is releasing its 11th expansion, <em>Midnight</em>. Alongside new zones in the Blood Elf homelands, player housing, and a wealth of new content, the expansion is also going to see yet another revision of the game’s UI, focused on implementing the features most players currently have to mod in. And this has caused people to suggest such streamlining could be part of preparing <em>WoW</em> for its debut on consoles. However, according to director Ion Hazzikostas, that’s absolutely not happening.</p> <p>“If we were actively working towards bringing <em>WoW</em> to consoles or a bunch of other platforms,” says the game’s current lead, “we’d be saying, ‘We’re actively working towards it, we know we have a lot of work to do but it’s a place where we want to land.'” Speaking to t<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4">he Unshackled Fury podcast</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-isnt-coming-to-consoles-game-director-says-no-reason-for-us-to-hide-anything-about-this/1100-6535952/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>GameSpot</em></a>), Hazzikostas said if it were really in the works, Blizzard would just say so. “To be fully transparent, there’s no reason for us to hide anything about this,” he said.</p>

  <p>There was once a time where the MMO’s only feasible home was the PC. While there were exceptions, like the Dreamcast-only <em>Phantasy Star Online</em>, for the majority of massively multiplayer online RPGs lived on home computers. But not any more. However, that’s now all changed. As consoles have become PCs in boxes, and controllers now offer eighty-million buttons, it’s the norm for any new MMO to appear on Xbox and PlayStation alongside PC. Titles like&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Throne and Liberty&nbsp;</em>thrive on consoles, and while the genre is certainly not even a fraction as popular as it once was, it’d be a foolish developer not to release a new one cross-platform. Which all makes it so extraordinary that Blizzard is still not even considering porting <em>World of Warcraft</em> outside of the PC.</p>

 <p>It’s even more peculiar when you remember that the consolidation of so much of the games industry in recent years means that Microsoft now owns Blizzard (a fact that’s weirdly easy to forget, given how Blizzard has always operated so independently, for good and for ill). You would think that the megacorp would rather appreciate&nbsp;<em>WoW</em> on Xbox, especially with the potential for a Game Pass version that’s provocatively lacking the very many paid-for expansions.</p> <p>Still, while Hazzikostas’ frank words seem very final, it’s impossible to believe that the conversation isn’t happening. It would be frankly weird if the follow-up to the Xbox Series couldn’t just directly hook up to Battle.net, and it certainly wouldn’t do any harm of the MMO already had a controller-friendly UI in place. However, what we appear to know for sure is that this isn’t something that’s happening imminently, no matter how much it would appear to make sense.</p> <p>For PC players, however, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24245100">the beta test for&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em> begins November 11</a>.</p>

              <p>There isn’t anything quite like a fresh cup of coffee to start your day. And then a fresh cup of coffee to continue your day right after lunch. Oh and what about a fresh cup of coffee with dessert. Then ya gotta have a nice decaf right before bed. Or maybe go with a full espresso shot, I won’t tell anyone. Then if you manage to sleep, you can wake up and have another fresh cup of coffee to start your day and do it all over again.</p>
<p>If you’re a coffee aficionado, you know a simple single-serve pod coffee maker like a Keurig just won’t cut it. You’re very particular about how you like your coffee and you need a machine that can brew exactly to your liking, every time. Ahead of Black Friday, Amazon has the famous Breville Barista Express on sale for 21% off. It’s normally <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/">sold at $699, so the discount ends up saving you a whole $150: You end up only having to pay $549 for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brew It How You Like It</h2>
<p>You can make yourself the finest cup of coffee brewed perfectly how you like it thanks to the Breville Barista Express’ integrated precision conical burr grinder with 16 precision grind settings. It grinds coffee beans on demand to the exact right amount needed for your selected roast of bean and personal preferences. It’s an easy enough espresso machine to operate as it give you precise control over grind size regardless of the bean you use.</p>



<p>This Breville coffee maker heats up the coffee with the help of a thermocoil heating system. This gives you complete control over the water temperature, thereby making a cup of coffee with a much more balanced flavor. When it starts, the machine gradually bumps up pressure which can help to draw out the coffee’s flavors evenly as it extracts. What you’re left with is a damn cup of coffee that Dale Cooper himself would compliment.</p>
<p>The powerful steam wand let’s you make silky smooth microfoam from added milk to complete you latte. Before you know it, you’ll be pouring perfect latte leaves in every cup.</p>
<p>The Breville Barista Express measures in at 15.9 inches high by 12.5 inches wide and 13.8 inches deep. If you’re a little worried about how much space it will take up in your kitchen, you can fist download the Breville Augmented Reality app and place it virtually on your countertop to see how well it fits.</p>
<p>Choose between either a brushed stainless steel or the refined black sesame finish. Both are currently on sale for the reduced price of $550 for a limited time.</p>
