              <p>Early today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/epstein-drop-live-00757275">the Department of Justice released more than three million pages</a> of files connected to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And as people have started digging into all the new emails and documents, we are learning a lot more about Epstein and his elite inner circle. Oh, and apparently, he would sometimes send people links to porn featuring characters from <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em>.</p> <p>On May 4, 2017, Epstein sent a message to Karyna Shuliak, his last known girlfriend, that simply contained a link to an animated gif uploaded to 4chan that featured multiple characters from <em>FNAF</em> engaging in sexual activities. The animation was apparently made in Source Filmmaker and was shared on 4chan in April 2017. Epstein simply commented “amazing animations” in the subject line of the email.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02328259.pdf">This 2017 email</a>, as well as others from the Epstein files purporting to show him sending <em>FNAF</em> porn he found online to Shuliak, spread across social media <a href="https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/2017398693834420299?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">as part of a collage image</a>. Many assumed it was a joke. But <em>Kotaku</em> and others online have been able to verify that the 2017 email did include <a href="https://archived.moe/gif/thread/10501788">a link to this NSFW 4chan gif post</a>.</p> <p>Discovering that Epstein looked at and shared porn based on the horror game <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> is <em>far</em> from the worst piece of information to come out of the Epstein emails. But it is a strange piece of information I didn’t know before, and now I do. I can’t stop thinking about him writing “amazing animations” in the subject line as he emailed the link to his girlfriend. We live in a weird, horrible timeline, huh?</p> <p>In other Epstein video game news (because yes, there is more), <a href="https://kotaku.com/emails-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-from-xbox-live-2000664660">he was banned from Xbox Live in 2013</a> after Microsoft figured out he was a registered sex offender.</p>

              <p>Early today, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/epstein-drop-live-00757275">the Department of Justice released more than three million pages</a> connected to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And as people have started digging into all the new emails and documents, we are learning a lot more about Epstein, his elite inner circle, and also that apparently he was banned from Xbox Live over a decade ago.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href="https://archive.is/o/VHGL6/https://xboxera.com/2026/01/30/jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-on-xbox-live/"><em>Xbox Era</em> spotted an email from December 2013</a> sent from Microsoft and Xbox Live to an email address used by Epstein in many of his illicit communications. The email was letting the then-alive mogul and convicted rapist know that his Xbox account had been banned permanently due to “harassment, threats, and/or abuse of other players.” That might make you think that Epstein was using his Xbox Live account to do some heinous shit, but a follow-up email from Xbox a few hours later explains exactly why he was banned.</p> <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01944468.pdf">Epstein was banned because he was a registered sex offender</a>, and Xbox works with law enforcement to keep these kinds of people off its gaming network. While Epstein had been a registered sex offender for years at this point, another email spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871425/jeffrey-epstein-xbox-live-ban-microsoft-sex-offender"><em>The Verge</em></a> seems to indicate he didn’t create an Xbox account until <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00668878.pdf">October 2012</a>. Microsoft joined a New York-led legal initiative to remove registered sex offenders from online platforms in April 2012. So it took some time before Xbox caught Epstein and kicked him from the service.</p> <p>It’s unclear if Epstein actually used his Xbox Live account to play games. Other emails revealed in today’s massive dump include him asking about an<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02101088.pdf"> Xbox 360 Kinect in 2014</a>. Another message from 2019 has him asking: “<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02265766.pdf">Why is there a $25.24 charge on Xbox?</a>“</p>
