              <p>An easy and cost-effective way to upgrade the look and feel of your space is by improving lighting. You don’t need a full-blown overhaul either, as there are plenty of smart lamps that can instantly do the job.</p>
<p>The Govee floor lamp “2” is one such option and it’s going at a discount on Amazon today: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6763/">lamp would typically cost you around $160, but you can grab it for just $128 today</a>: that’s after a generous, but limited time 20% drop. Additionally, multiple color options, including black, blue, and silver, are discounted. You can pick the one that best suits the aesthetics of your space.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6763/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Preset Scene Modes</h2>
<p>This 60-in floor lamp is made to light up larger areas, such as living rooms and bigger bedrooms. The body illuminates the surroundings, while the base infuses vibrancy for a stunning, eye-catching effect. You’ll enjoy 1725 lm brightness, which is considerably higher than previous models, plus adjustable 2200 K to 6500 K warm/cool whites. The latter offers flexibility, making it easy to switch from cozy setups to bright, focused lighting within seconds.</p>
<p>Color-wise, there’s a lot to discover. The Govee Home app comes packed with over 80 preset scene modes and user-customizable DIY modes. You can choose between effects like Sunset, Night Light, and Rainbow – based on your mood. Maybe go for something a bit on the warmer side while winding down at night, and switch to a brighter light when it’s time to focus on a deadline. Best of all, you can even create your own styles by playing with the gradients in the app!</p>



<p>The lights can be synced to music, too. Hosting a fun party at home? Impress the guest with a personalized light show that reacts to the beats of your favorite tracks. There’s also support for voice assistants built right in, which makes it easy to control the thing without getting up from the couch or using the dedicated app. The floor lamp responds to commands via HomeKit (Requires IPv6 network), Alexa, and Google Assistant. Just say something like “Alexa, dim the lights”, or “Siri, set the floor lamp to 60%,”, and the job will be done within seconds. For an even better hands-free experience, consider setting timers for the lamp. For instance, you can have it switch to warm lights after 6 PM automatically.</p>
<p>The lamp also plays nicely with other Govee lights. You can use it to connect up to 10 Govee lights within a 30 m range and sync music lighting effects together for a larger setup. Setup is quick, so you can start using the lamp almost right away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Kevin Afghani </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-wonder-charles-martinet-new-voice-actor-switch-1850922124"><span>stepped into the voice role of Mario, Luigi, and Wario in 2023</span></a><span>. He took over the job after Charles Martinet, who voiced the fireball-throwing plumber for decades, was confirmed to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-voice-charles-martinet-nintendo-64-galaxy-1850757371"><span>“stepping back”</span></a><span> from voicing him to become a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-ambassador-voice-actor-charles-martinet-nintendo-1850805915"><span>“Mario Ambassador.”</span></a><span> This weekend, Afghani is making his first American convention appearance at Charlie’s Comic Con in Florida, and he did an interview with </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/"><i><span>USA Today</span></i></a> <span>to talk about taking on the job of voicing Nintendo’s mascot. He had a lot of praise for his esteemed predecessor.</span></p> <p><span>“Look, Charles, as far as I’m concerned, </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> Mario,” Afghani told </span><i><span>USA Today</span></i><span>. “He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn’t nervous, then I’m the wrong guy. I’m the second guy who’s doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Afghani says he’s a long-time </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>fan who spent a lot of his life “mimicking” Martinet’s Mario and Luigi performances, so these characters are “important” to him, and he views taking on the job as carrying them on so they can “keep being important to other people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“I couldn’t explain to you how important these characters have been to me my entire life,” he said. “I’m a really jokey person, and I’m a really silly person. But there’s just a part of me that can’t help but get teary-eyed when I talk about this.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Though Martinet’s last credit as Mario was in 2022’s </span><i><span>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope</span></i><span>, he did have a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-chris-pratt-charles-martinet-cameo-1850307200"><span>small cameo in </span><i><span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</span></i><span> in 2023</span></a><span> as Mario’s dad. According to Martinet, he’s </span><a href="https://x.com/CharlesMartinet/status/1932458680542474319"><span>allowed to perform Mario’s voice for fans</span></a><span>, but won’t improvise dialogue, so don’t expect him to open up a Cameo to record voice messages for fans as Mario anytime soon.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-after-bose-now-selling-the-bluetooth-micro-speaker-at-a-new-record-low-2000660305</link>

              <p>Good music can instantly lift your mood and the overall vibe of any space. Those shopping for a portable Bluetooth speaker today should consider grabbing the 2nd-generation Bose SoundLink Micro speaker, while it’s going for less than $100 at Amazon.</p>
<p>The retailer is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6762/">currently offering this mini yet mighty device at a 23% discount, which drops its $129 price to just $99</a>. Delivery is free, and the offer applies to all color options. Pick black if you’re looking for something basic, or go for the stunning pink version if you want something that can make a statement! The discount ends soon, though. If you’ve been on the lookout for a solid speaker, we highly recommend acting before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs a Solid Punch</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, this speaker is truly portable. The pocketable size, paired with the upgraded strap, makes it easy to carry around anywhere with ease; slide it into your pocket, attach it to your backpack, or just hold it in your hand as it delivers rich sound. It won’t add unnecessary weight, which is essential if you’re trying to travel light. Durability comes from its rugged design, plus an IP67 design that makes it dust, water, shock, and rust proof. Whether it’s a party on the beach, fun by the poolside, or just a solo session in the rain, the weather conditions won’t interfere with your listening session.</p>



<p>Of course, portability doesn’t mean a compromise on the sound quality. SoundLink Micro Speaker delivers crisp sound and impressive bass for all your tracks, from energy-filled songs to podcasts and even guided meditation sessions. The Bose app takes the experience even further by letting you tweak bass, treble, and mid-level to your liking. The app can also be used to control volume and create shortcuts. What’s more, you’ll also have the option of linking two SoundLink Micro speakers (2nd Gen) together for larger sound, which is great when you want to entertain a crowd. In this setup, you can choose between Stereo mode and Party mode. The former balances out the audio from each speaker, while the latter plays the same sound at once from any paired compatible Bose speaker.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point here. A single charge gets you up to 12 hours of continuous listening, which is more than enough to keep the party going all night long. Additionally, the extended range of up to 30 feet and increased bandwidth improve connectivity and make it easy to move around freely with your connected device, instead of feeling tied to the speaker.</p>
<p>This speaker normally retails for $129, but you can snap it up for just $99 today. All colors are discounted, so you have options to choose from. Just be sure to grab it as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting the discount to last long.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rust Exec Reacts To Amazon Killing New World: ‘Games Should Never Die’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-world-mmo-servers-rust-facepunch-amazon-2000660558</link>
            <guid>1408174</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>New World</em> was once the crown jewel in Amazon’s rising gaming ambitions. Developed in-house, the MMO initially exploded in popularity on Steam and seemed to have decent legs in the notoriously competitive genre. Less than five years later, it’s officially being killed. Servers will go offline in January 2027. The news has prompted a reaction from many who are tired of big games vanishing so quickly after launch, including an executive at <em>Rust</em> maker Facepunch Studios.</p> <p><span>“25m, final offer Amazon Games,” the London-based company’s COO, Alistair McFarlane, wrote in response to the news <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011890710468071708">on X</a>. “Games should never die,” he added, before going on to juxtapose Amazon’s approach to online games with Facepunch’s. “As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community.” when someone asked what the<em> Rust</em> maker buying <em>New World</em> would look like. “Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.”</span></p>

 <p>The writing for <em>New World</em> has been on the wall since last fall. Despite recently releasing new updates and seasonal content changes appearing to come and go as planned, Amazon <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-amazon-mmo-shutting-down-servers-2026-layoffs-new-content-2000639761">announced in late October</a> that the game would be going on life support with no meaningful additions planned in the future. The servers would remain open and operating “through 2026” to allow the community “<span>time to continue their adventures in Aeternum.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Games should never die.</p> <p>— Alistair McFarlane (@Alistair_McF) <a href="https://twitter.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011894052128768316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While Amazon is technically holding up that end of the bargain, remaining fans probably weren’t expecting the tech giant to kick the new year off with a full-blown death sentence. “We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you,” an <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">unattributed blog post</a> that went up on the game’s website this week reads. “Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.”</p>

 <p><em>New World</em> is no longer for sale but anyone who already owns it can still re-download the game and play until January 31, 2027. Will there be any refunds? Of course not. Can you still buy premium in-game currency for real money? Strangely, yes. “Beginning July 20, 2026, players will no longer be able to purchase Marks of Fortune or anything else in game,” reads the new FAQ. Why not unlock everything and make all cash transactions in the game free? No idea.</p>

 <p>All of this stems from <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">Amazon’s wider pivot</a> away from internal game development, with mass layoffs last fall that included not only the end of <em>New World</em> but seeming cuts to other projects including a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO. The company hasn’t confirmed if that project is dead or still being shopped around to other outside development partners. Amazon is also set to publish the upcoming<em> Tomb Raider</em> games, including this year’s <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>, a remake of the original game.</p>

              <p>Following on from 2024’s original Lego&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> build, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-lego-legend-zelda-great-deku-tree-set-price-1851503670">the Great Deku Tree</a>, leaks have revealed the forthcoming follow-up, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-lego-ocarina-time-n64-ganon-price-date-2000642945">previously teased set</a> called The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time, due to release at the beginning of March.</p> <p>This repeats the pattern, given the original collab between Lego and Link leaked in 2023, and then was <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-deku-youtube-copyright-1850136690">pretty much confirmed as real</a> by Nintendo rapidly firing off copyright takedown notices. It’ll be interesting to see if the Japanese giant attempts the same pointless endeavor this time with the leaked images, or whether the fact that the new set is seemingly due in less than a couple of months means it’ll have the sense to consider this the beginning of its promotional campaign.&nbsp;<strong>Update:<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>indeed this seems to be the case, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/ocarina-of-time-the-final-battle-77093?CMP=AFC-AffiliateUS-0wLgH49VWzI-2949699-115554-2">with the set now officially listed on the Lego store</a>.</p> <p>Posted to Reddit’s dedicated forum for such matters, /Legoleak, user BrickTap shared two images to that my eye look like they’re from a fairly clumsily put-together internal slideshow. The images reveal the build number, title, release date and pricing.</p>

   <p>So for $129.99 (considerably less than the Great Deku, which was $300), the 1003-piece set features the climactic battle of&nbsp;<em>Ocarina of Time</em>, with Link, Zelda and Ganondorf minifigs, as well as an enormous brick-built Ganon dual-wielding mighty swords. Also featured are a Triforce, Megaton Hammer, and even some recovery hearts should Link’s fight meet complications.</p>

 <p>The second image reveals a hidden secret in the first, what looks like a ruined piece of castle opening up to reveal minifig Ganondorf’s throne.</p> <p>I do think it looks a little paltry. Less than half the brick count (hence less than half the price) of the previous&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> build, this really does seem to be primarily about constructing a large Ganon, with the rest of the scene being really rather underwhelming. It’s primarily a flat base with a couple of bits of broken castle poking out, and really seeming to lack in fun extra details or interesting terrain. I do like how Link is leaping, but the brown/gray dirge of the majority of the diorama seems a shame. Forgivable maybe at $60, but a hard sell at $130.</p>

 <p>If the details are correct, the set will go on sale March 1.</p> <p><strong>Updated: 01/16/2026, 10:12 a.m. ET:</strong> Since this article was posted, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/ocarina-of-time-the-final-battle-77093?CMP=AFC-AffiliateUS-0wLgH49VWzI-2949699-115554-2">Lego has officially announced the set</a>, confirming all the details in the leak as accurate.</p>
