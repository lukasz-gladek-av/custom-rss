              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647"><em>007: First Light,</em></a> the next game from the development studio behind <em>Hitman</em>, is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC in March 2026, as revealed during Sony’s latest State of Play.</p> <p>On September 3, <a href="https://kotaku.com/james-bond-state-play-wolverine-god-war-sony-showcase-2000622073">as previously announced</a>, Sony and IO Interactive showed off over 30 minutes of <em>007: First Light</em>, giving us our first real look at gameplay following some <a href="https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647">teasers and trailers.</a> And at the end of the showcase—which featured Bond sneaking around, killing people, driving various vehicles, and causing mayhem—IOI revealed that <em>First Light</em> is launching on March 27, 2026 on all platforms.</p> <p>Here’s a new gameplay trailer of Bond in action:</p>  <p>Of course, because in the year 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675">all games must have expensive pre-order versions and early access bonuses</a>, if you pre-order any version of the game digitally, you get to play 24 hours “early.” <a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame">What is more shocking is the $300 special collector’s edition</a> of <em>007: First Light.</em> This pricey package includes a physical copy of the game, some digital goodies, and a replica Golden Gun, as well as gold bullets and a stand to display them with. Seems a bit odd to include such a classic Bond prop in a game that, seemingly, has nothing to do with that era of the franchise, but hey, what do I know?</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-makers-of-hitman-are-working-on-a-new-james-bond-ga-1845713628">First announced back in 2020</a>,<em> 007: First Ligh</em>t is the long-awaited next game from IO Interactive, and it tells the tale of a younger James Bond as he completes some of his first missions. It’s been a long five-year wait for fans of <em>Hitman</em> who are hoping that <em>First Light</em> will play a lot like Agent 47’s franchise. In today’s State of Play reveal, it did indeed seem like this is very much a <em>Hitman</em>-style game, with multiple options for infiltrating areas and a big focus on stealth and problem-solving. However, the gameplay in the presentation also had moments that were marred by some nasty performance dips and a lot of motion blur. Hopefully, <em>007: First Light</em> looks better and runs well when it arrives on Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a> is launching soon on a new platform. No, the popular superhero online PVP shooter isn’t coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290">NetEase</a> has quietly announced that <em>Rivals</em> is getting a PS4 port. I can already imagine how loud an old PS4 will sound when Doctor Strange creates a portal.</p> <p>On September 3, <a href="https://youtu.be/67FVMNGMFXU">NetEase released a new trailer</a> for the upcoming fourth season of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, “Heart of the Dragon.” The new season arrives on September 12 and brings Daredevil to the game’s already large roster. However, at the very end of this slick, action-packed story trailer, NetEase included a bit of news.<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1963275058534600760"> Seen briefly in the final moments of the trailer</a> is the logo for the PlayStation 4. It seems the online superhero game is getting a last-gen port.</p>  <p><a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1962496976731214040">Word of this PS4 port first appeared earlier this week</a>, with dataminers finding evidence on the PlayStation Store’s back end of a new PS4 version of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Today’s new teaser seems to confirm that, yes, NetEase is porting its blockbuster superhero game to the aging PS4. Sony’s old home console launched back in November 2013, nearly 12 years ago. And yet, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will soon be playable on the old hardware. Some fans are confused as to why <em>Rivals</em> is making the backward leap to PS4 while it still lacks a Switch 2 port. It would seem logical that if <em>Rivals</em> can run on PS4, it can likely run on a Switch 2. <a href="https://gamerant.com/marvel-rivals-switch-2/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20game%20director%20Guangyun%20Chen%20stated%20that%20NetEase%20is%20still%20in%20the%20process%20of%20obtaining%20a%20Switch%202%20development%20kit%20from%20Nintendo">Perhaps a lack of</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-gamescom-digital-foundry-2000620055">dev kits is to blame</a>?</p> <p>Regardless of all that, it is extremely wild to me that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is launching on PS4 in 2025. This is a console that launched during the tail end of the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is a machine that arrived when Barack Obama was still president of the United States. And soon you’ll be able to play <em>Marvel Rivals</em> on it. Sure, it’s not the first time we’ve seen a current-gen game go backwards with a PS4 port. But it is still odd.</p>
