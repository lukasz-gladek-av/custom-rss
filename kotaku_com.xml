This optional battery preservation option will instead see the device max out at around 90 percent. This means that if you have the setting on, your battery will rarely, if ever, be fully charged, costing you some playtime when out and about. So why would anybody choose to use it? </p><p>Well, because its really good for the Switch 2's rechargeable lithium battery. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gridx.ai/knowledge/what-is-battery-degradation-and-how-to-prevent-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gridx.ai/knowledge/what-is-battery-degradation-and-how-to-prevent-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">These types of batteries can degrade over time</a></span> if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://You should let the battery get all the way down to 0 percent before recharging False  Strangely enough, batteries are under the most strain when they’re fully charged or completely empty. The real sweet spot for a battery is 50 percent charge as that means that half of its moveable lithium ions are in the lithium cobalt oxide layer and the other half are in the graphite layer. This equilibrium puts the least amount of strain on the battery, and extends the number of charge cycles it can withstand before degrading.  So really, if you were super-keen on keeping your battery living as long as possible, you should keep its charge between 20 and 80 per cent. This means that it spends as little time as possible with lots of lithium ions crammed into either layer, a situation which causes the layers to expand, putting physical strain on them. “But if you did that you’d only be getting about half as much charge every time you used it,” Griffith says. Maybe not, then.  Charging past 100 percent will damage your battery True (but not for the reason you think)  This one is closely linked to the above myth. Charging your phone so it stays at 100 percent overnight isn’t great news for the battery, but that’s not because you’re cramming in more charge than it can handle. A “trickle charge” mechanism cuts off the charger after the phone has reached 100 per cent charge, and only tops up the battery when it drops down a little.  The problem is that you’re keeping the charge level at 100 per cent which, as we know from the previous myth, puts the battery under a certain amount of strain. “It’s not good,” Griffith says, “but the battery manufacturer has set [the battery’s limits] it so it shouldn’t be harmful.”&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://You should let the battery get all the way down to 0 percent before recharging False  Strangely enough, batteries are under the most strain when they’re fully charged or completely empty.

Completing them rewards you with swimsuits, which offer no tangible benefits beyond having more outfits to choose from. Some of the challenges are now infamous, in part because they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/gameonysus.bsky.social/post/3lokou7d7ac2s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/gameonysus.bsky.social/post/3lokou7d7ac2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lean into some of the worst parts of the game</a></span>, focusing on movement and demanding platforming precision when the controls aren’t really designed for it, and also because they are often ridiculous and require an absurd amount of dedication for no real gain. </p><p>Sandfall Interactive game director Guillaume Broche explained the inspiration behind them in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent podcast interview</a></span> with YouTuber Xavier “MisterMV” Dang (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kiohbe/game_director_guillaume_broche_when_asked_who/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kiohbe/game_director_guillaume_broche_when_asked_who/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span>). It’s in French, but the gist is that he liked how certain minigames of the past were so bad, they live rent free in our memories forever. He referenced the chocobo race and lightning dodging in <em>Final Fantasy X</em> specifically. The final race requires players to get a time of 0:00 by collecting only blue blitz balls, which in turn requires using the least responsive steering controls of any PlayStation 2 game in existence. The lightning minigame, meanwhile, requires successfully dodging bolts of electricity 200 times in a row without missing. </p><p>Both are notoriously infuriating tasks, though unlike in<em> Expedition 33</em>, they are necessary to unlock two of the strongest weapons in the game. Is that better or worse? “There’s a kind of hatred but love that can be felt,” Broche said (via a Google translation of the interview). He added, “If you make a rotten game that you have rotten minigames [in],  well, it doesn’t work too well, but if you have a game that you were attached to and you have this kind of challenge, a little bit extra on the side...it’s funny.”</p><p>He admitted the Gestral Beaches were his idea—“I personally insisted on putting them in the game and so yes, Gestral volleyball, if you want to insult me, ​​it’s me, I’ll take it”—but some fans are praising the development team for achieving the desired effect with the annoying challenges in an otherwise excellent game. “Spent an hour climbing the vertical tower one, and got Monoco’s swimsuit at the top,” one player wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kiohbe/game_director_guillaume_broche_when_asked_who/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kiohbe/game_director_guillaume_broche_when_asked_who/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Reddit</a></span>. “There is no better possible reward for all of that pain than something as hilariously asinine as Monoco in a speedo. It is just absolute perfection, totally carries the spirit of those old stupid FF minigames. I love that they’re there. I love that they’re stupid. I love that I have the music stuck in my head forever now. THIS is quality and love from the developer.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
