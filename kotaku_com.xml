We don’t have a standalone price yet, but the full season pass for all three initial DLC packs is $35, suggesting it will be at least $15 for those who only own the base game. Here’s everything that’s included:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>4 Gohans (Base, SS, Ultimate, Beast)</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>4 Piccolos (Base, Awakened, Orange, Giant) </li><li>2 Gammas (Base and form 2) </li><li>Cell Max</li><li> New Piccolo costume   </li><li> 3 Custom Battles﻿</li></ul></blockquote><p>It might strike some as stingy to not include all of Gohan and Piccolo’s transformations in the base game, but fans are happy to finally be getting them. “I DON’T CARE IF THIS ISN’T A COMPETITIVE GAME THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DRAGON BALL GAME OF THEM ALL,” wrote one in the comments of the trailer on YouTube.</p><p>Alongside the first DLC, Bandai Namco also announced an incoming Legendary Warrior Face-Off limited-time mode that will pit players against overpowered AI-controlled foes. The first one will be against Broly. While it’s not completely clear how the mode will work (or why it’s only sticking around for a little bit)  players are interpreting it as the fighting game equivalent of an MMO raid, similar to events in<em> Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>.</p><p>Otherwise, the focus is largely on incorporating all of the characters and transformations showcased in 2022's <em>Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>which gave both Gohan and Piccolo massive power-ups to take on the return of Cell. DLC2 and DLC3, while not fully revealed, teased further additions from <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> and the new<em> Dragon Ball Daima </em>anime series that recently started streaming on Crunchyroll—it features the Z-fighters transformed back into children. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Due to unprecedented interest in new cards driven by <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, spiking resale prices, and over-excitement at a new Eevee-based special set, the latest sets are selling out everywhere before regular customers can find them. It’s into this situation that Prismatic Evolutions launches, which is a double-shame, given it’s the most fun set to open in <em>forever</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Prismatic Evolutions is that Eevee-based set, and that furry brown pup tends to set <em>Pokémon</em> fans into a furor the likes of which only Charizard can beat. The last time Eevee fronted a collection was in 2021 with Evolving Skies, and that’s <em>still</em> causing conniptions in the resale market. (Evolving Skies booster boxes, $130 on release, now sell for $1,300+, and the so-called Moonbreon card alone currently has a market price of $1,600.) So it is that from the moment of Prismatic’s announcement in November, pre-orders sold out faster than they could be advertised, and sadly a lot of it was scalpers.</p><p>However, <em>Kotaku </em>is in the fortunate position of having had The Pokémon Company International send over a box filled with various Prismatic Evolutions collection boxes and an ETB, with a total of 26 packs to open. And people, it’s a really good set! It is, dare I say, the first Scarlet &amp; Violet era set to feature pull rates that feel generous.  And I feel that way despite, in opening all 26 packs, not pulling a single card above an ultra-rare. Yeah, it’s odd.</p><figure id="" data-id="73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-recommend-id="image://73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-recommend-id="image://73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Prismatic Evolutions is packed with so many special-feeling cards that the pull rate I experienced was close to 1. As in, after opening 20 packs we’d sleeved 19 cards. Scarlet &amp; Violet’s reorganization of pack contents mean there’s a holo in every one, making them generic, and this has meant that for most sets of the era, getting anything better has been around 1 in 4. But in Prismatic, so much of the set is made up of ex cards, new full-art holo patterns, Ace Specs, the first international version of Japan’s Poké Ball and Master Ball holos, and a whopping 49 alt-art cards of varying rarity, that it’s hard not to get something interesting in every pack. Sure, that reduces their “value” given their ubiquity, but after two years of being starved for fun, it feels giddying. Right up until you notice that you’re not actually getting the alt-arts.</p><p>That’s the important thing, right there. If you’re looking to buy a pack of cards where you’ve got a good chance of getting something pleasingly shiny, and you can find them, this is a great purchase. For kids, it’s <em>exactly how it should be</em>, meaning they’re not almost always wasting $4 of allowance on a pack containing nothing but bulk. This is a win. But now, let’s get into the weeds.</p><figure id="" data-id="570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-recommend-id="image://570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-recommend-id="image://570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of those 26 packs, and obviously ignoring promos that came in the various boxes, we got a total of six holo-pattern Energies, five ex cards, one Ace Spec, eight Poké Ball holo patterned cards, one Master Ball holo pattern, and four full-art trainers. Now, most people won’t consider ex and holo Energies that special, but given they’re better than nothing, we’re still close to a 1:1 ratio on 26 packs. (I’d say, given double-ups, that there were perhaps just five packs overall that had nothing but a standard windowed holo.) But even discounting them, this is still top-notch hits. It’s just that, on another level, we entirely missed.</p><p>Which is to say, in all 26 packs, we didn’t get a single Special Illustration Rare or Hyper Rare, and this set has 37 of them to find! That suggests that, while it was so much fun to tear this open and keep on feeling like we were hitting, anyone trying to complete the set is going to be facing a bankruptcy. And that’s all the more true given this set contains a collection of Eeveelution arts that are going to be so, <em>so</em> expensive. TPCi hasn’t exactly been subtle here: the SIR Umbreon is a work of art, and it’s got a giant moon in it—they know exactly what they’re doing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/610516/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-umbreon-ex-161-131?page=1&amp;Language=all&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/610516/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-umbreon-ex-161-131?page=1&amp;Language=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s already selling for almost $1,500</a></span>.</p><p>I’m not the least bit fussed not to have the Hyper Rares—they’re gold cards that look ridiculous, and I can’t imagine any of the five, but for the Pikachu, will hold any value at all. But oh my god, as I leaf through the ETB’s booklet, I’m overwhelmed with the most stunning collection of artworks I’ve ever seen in a single set.</p><p>This is something that’s made to feel a little more galling when you learn that so much of the set’s bulk is reprints of cards from previous S&amp;V sets, and appear so frequently as to become farcical. In the 26 packs, we received four or five of almost every basic card, and a ridiculous <em>eight</em> copies of the Stage 1 Dipplin that originally appeared in Twilight Masquerade. That’s almost one in three packs containing the stupid toffee apple. Go away! </p><figure id="" data-id="4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-recommend-id="image://4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-recommend-id="image://4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So yes, I’m looking through this Player’s Guide at all those artworks I want and feeling enormous FOMO. In other circumstances, I’d be very tempted to go buy a bunch more in the hopes of getting a card that’d look awesome in a binder. (I’ll put together a gallery of the best art in this set, and it’ll be a million pages long.) Every one of the Eeveelution alt-arts is going to cost a bajillion bucks, and you could probably pay off your mortgage if you pulled that new Moonbreon, but the Dragapult ex and Palafin ex are mind-blowing pieces of work.</p><p>I’d like to imagine I could have found <em>one</em> alt-art in all those cards, but obviously the sample size is too small to draw conclusions from, and I may have just been spectacularly unlucky. However, looking at pack openings on YouTube, this does seem somewhat typical. We’ll know for sure when the likes of Danny Phantump et al put their data together.</p><p>But yes, this is all incredibly moot if no one can actually buy the stuff. Prismatic Evolutions is going to keep releasing new boxes all year, so hopefully the current madness will have eased off at some point and this will all become more available. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">Pokémon assures us</a></span> that they are working fast to run reprints of all the current boxes, and trying to get stock into stores. </p><p>And so back to that main point: if you can find it, and especially if you have kids, this is a treat of a set to open. Just don’t expect to be seeing many Special Illustration Rares.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They also said that Sony will continue to make both single-player and multiplayer games. <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Jason Schreier <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed on social media</a></span> that the canceled Bluepoint project was a live service <em>God of War</em> spin-off. </p><p>Bend Studio is best known for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975">the open-world zombie shooter <em>Days Gone</em></a></span>, while Bluepoint, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-is-buying-the-remaster-powerhouse-behind-all-those-1847774799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-is-buying-the-remaster-powerhouse-behind-all-those-1847774799">acquired by Sony as recently as 2021</a></span>, was responsible for the recent well-received PS5 remake of <em>Demon’s Souls</em>.

Prior to <em>Days Gone</em>, Bend was best known for the espionage shooter series <em>Syphon Filter</em>. </p><p>The cancelation of Bluepoint’s <em>God of War</em> spin-off, meanwhile, would make it the second high-profile live-service project based on a major PlayStation franchise to be killed in recent years.

Naughty Dog claimed at the time that the decision not to move forward with the project was because the studio didn’t want to become solely obsessed with maintaining a live-service game, as arguably happened with Bungie in recent years. </p><p>Back in 2023, then-PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495">promised 12 live-service games by 2025</a></span>.

While <em>Helldivers 2</em> turned out to be one of last year’s biggest surprise hits, the live-service push has so far yielded many more failures than success stories. </p><p>For now, multiplayer spin-offs of the sci-fi open-world action series <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> appear some of the few left standing within Sony’s first-party portfolio, which is currently led by the former head of the studio that made the series, Hermen Hulst. A <em>Monster Hunter-</em>style multiplayer <em>Horizon </em>spin-off and a possible MMO are both believed to currently be in production, and potentially nearing release in the next year or two. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
