              <p>Storage issues are more common than you think, and they affect almost everyone now and then; from work professionals to creatives, students, gamers, and even casual users. If you’ve been looking to expand the capacity of your PC, Mac, or console, we just spotted a deal that lets you do it for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/">Thanks to Cyber Monday, Amazon is offering the Seagate 2TB portable external hard drive at a 19% discount.</a> It usually sits at an already-affordable retail price of $80, but this $15 discount is making the upgrade even more approachable. It’s available to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime membership or prefer shopping without it. The only catch? The offer is selling out fast, and it expires tonight. You only have a few more hours left to save, so it’s better to grab yours without wasting more time. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Offload Files, House All Your Important Data</h2>
<p>Starting off with the capacity; you’re getting a nice 2TB of additional storage for your device. That’s enough to offload a bunch of files you don’t use as frequently to free some space on your internal storage, plus house all your important data. Think thousands of photos, hundreds of videos, heavy presentations, creative projects, long research papers, and never-ending spreadsheets. You’ll even be able to throw in some gaming titles. The 2TB capacity is enough for most users who don’t just want to rely on their internal storage for day-to-day use, but if it feels limited, Seagate is offering plenty of other options at a discount, too.</p>
<p>This HDD plays nicely with Windows or Mac computers, and the drag-and-drop functionality lets you transfer files across both with ease. It’s a traditional hard drive, so the speeds won’t be as fast as an SSD, but still not too bad for casual use. Getting started couldn’t be simpler. It’s preformatted for Windows and Mac, so all that you need to do is connect the drive to your device using the 18-inch USB 3.0 cable. Your device will recognize the HDD automatically, without requiring any specific software installation. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes for it to get up and running!</p>



<p>It’s also quite portable, which makes it easy to carry your entire digital library of documents and games with you, wherever you go. Just plug it into any computer, and access all the important stuff in seconds. This is great for anyone working remotely, and even for those relying on two devices at the same time. You won’t need to transfer files to both your PC and your laptop; the drive does it all.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to invest in a storage solution that’s both reliable and easy to carry around, this deal lets you do that for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $80 to enjoy the same features, but Amazon’s Cyber Monday sale lets you pick the solution up for just $65.</a> If 2TB is more than what you need, there’s a 1TB option available, too. Creatives looking for more space can consider the 4TB or 5TB versions, or go all out with the massive 8TB or 12TB options. There’s plenty to choose from, but we highly recommend grabbing yours fast. The deal ends soon, and you don’t want to be disappointed at the very last minute. It’s also a good idea to stock up on anything else you missed grabbing during Black Friday, whether it’s tech gadgets or entertainment upgrades.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147</link>
            <guid>1369357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-movies-best-worst-ranking-frozen-moana-tangled-1851708848"><span>a </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>fan</span></a><span> on the internet is like being god’s strongest soldier fighting the uncaring deity’s toughest battles. You can’t talk about how much you like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-plus-ai-generated-user-videos-ugc-sora-mickey-2000644077"><span>Disney’s</span></a><span> politically-charged take on the animal kingdom without it somehow veering into the topic of furry porn or a buckwild fan comic about aborting a fox/rabbit hybrid.</span></p> <p><span>Despite </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>not really getting into cross-species romance, something that has followed the franchise since the 2016 original is that a large, very loud side of the internet ships ex-con fox Nick Wilde and his bunny cop bestie Judy Hopps, and there’s no shortage of art, fanfiction, and fan theories about the two pining for one another. Infamously,, someone wrote a viral fan comic starring the two in which their relationship unravels over Judy wanting to abort their fox/rabbit hybrid baby that has become such a prominent meme in pop culture that it </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Survive_(comic)"><span>has its own Wikipedia page</span></a><span> After seeing </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>twice, I’m pretty confident someone at Disney has read that comic or is at least aware of it, and all the other nasty things y’all have been saying about these two for nearly a decade. Disney may not be looking directly into the abyss, as a lot of big studios </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction"><span>won’t read fan works</span></a><span> for fear of potential legal trouble if their stories end up overlapping with something an admirer wrote or drew, but </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>has all the makings of a movie almost winking at its fans in an hour-and-a-half-long metatexual tease. Despite this, the studio refuses to give WildeHopps shippers the catharsis they so desperately crave.</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>is straightbaiting, or using a potential romantic pairing like a carrot on a stick to draw in an audience they won’t actually satisfy. After living decades watching pairings of men with a ton of chemistry not end up confessing their love for one another in a sloppy on-screen kiss, I think that’s beautiful. Don’t come for me, saying that “straightbaiting” isn’t a real thing because straight ships aren’t victims to the same societal stigmas as queer ones. This is too funny for me. Let me have this. The movie begins with what feels like a direct homage to the abortion comic by having the pair do some undercover cop work, masquerading as a couple with a baby (Nick’s ex-crime partner Finnick, also in disguise). Their perp acknowledges the interspecies pairing is a bit different, but not unheard of in the city of Zootopia, where predator and prey live together in harmony. But when one of the most viral fan creations is about these two as would-be parents, leading your long-awaited sequel with a scene of these cops cosplaying as mom and dad to a little fox baby feels very intentional, and </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t let up with one gag.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you ignore what Nick and Judy actually say to each other, </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>has all the makings of a slow-burning enemies-to-friends-to-lovers arc a decade in the making. They’re constantly referring to each other as “partners,” as they’re the Zootopia Police Department’s newest duo, and they’re celebrating their week-long anniversary while trying to sort through their differences. They go to partner counseling, when Judy makes a joke about their anniversary while they ride on a Walrus’ belly, their chauffeur puts on mood lighting and plays one of Disney’s most iconic love songs, “Bella Notte” from </span><i><span>Lady and the Tramp</span></i><span>, and there’s a scene where mountain goats send the pair up to a honeymoon suite likely assuming they’re heading up to make a hybrid baby.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/z2spoilers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#z2spoilers</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/zootopia2spoilers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#zootopia2spoilers</a> <br>i don't see anyone freaking out over this yet so allow me bc this is one of my many new roman empires: </p> <p>WDYM THEY PLAYED BELLA NOTTE FROM LADY AND THE TRAMP ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC MOVIE SCENES EVER??? <a href="https://t.co/P3CKTNh6iD">pic.twitter.com/P3CKTNh6iD</a></p> <p>— caro 🐾 #z2spoilers❗ (@pumpkinberryxo) <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpkinberryxo/status/1994198957312835724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The brilliant part of this is that these assumptions play out without Nick and Judy ever acknowledging them. It would be so easy for the two to get really animated about these moments and be like, “No way! He’s just my partner. We’re just friends who have never even considered each other like that.” Instead, Nick and Judy let these moments go and focus on what’s actually important. Even in the height of the two’s crisis point, Nick refers to Judy explicitly as a friend, and when all of these conflicts come to a head in a glorious overshare of therapy speak, the two never even say a word about any romantic feelings. They talk to each other the way two secure, platonic individuals do: with an open, honest apology for their respective flaws, and a hope that they can work together better in the inevitable next movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s not to say that </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t have moments that could absolutely be read as romantic tension. Early on in the film, when the pair is scoping out a gala, Nick sees Judy yapping it up with Pawbert Lynxley, the awkward rich kid who seems to be an outcast in his evil rich people family. He gets so distracted by what looks like a fit of jealousy that he runs into a fellow party patron. It was in that moment that I worried that </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>might actually go down the romantic road, but even when Nick is having a major confessional moment, much later, after Judy runs off with Pawbert to try and salvage their larger case, he doesn’t confess any romantic feelings.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Fans will inevitably read </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>as another chapter in a decade-long slow burn, but as someone who finds Nick and Judy’s security in their friendship to be one of these movies’ greatest strengths, I gotta give Disney props for keeping their love platonic. That’s after a decade of earnest shipping and also a </span><i><span>whole fucking lot </span></i><span>of fan works. There are </span><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Judy%20Hopps*s*Nick%20Wilde/works"><span>literally thousands of fanfiction entries</span></a><span> of the two’s hypothetical relationship, and the Nick and Judy tags on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rule-34-rule34dle-guessing-game-stream-site-where-play-2000642575"><span>Rule 34</span></a><span> both have five-figure post counts of illustrated smut. But in </span><i><span>Zootopia 2</span></i><span>, Nick says, “Love you, partner,” at the end of the movie, and he means that platonically. Jury’s still out on how he feels about abortions, though. But hey, he has some very weird hangups about reptiles that are giving “conservative cousin at Thanksgiving,” so maybe he’s anti-choice, and we’ll find out when </span><i><span>Zootopia 3 </span></i><span>comes out sometime in the 2030s.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-extends-this-4-7-star-mini-pc-black-friday-deal-into-cyber-monday-but-limited-units-remain-2000648943</link>
            <guid>1369300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the biggest and best Cyber Monday PC deals at Amazon is on one of the smallest PCs on the market. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6132/">The ACEMAGIC M1 Mini PC, loaded with an Intel Core i9 processor, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and Windows 11 Pro, is a fat 38% off right now. Normally an $800 mini PC, the sale price of $500 is the lowest yet.</a></span></p>
<p><span>The idea that mini PCs are gimmicky pocket-sized devices that come at a fraction of the size and a fraction of the performance of their full-sized counterparts has been fading away with every new release, but the ACEMAGIC M1 might be the one that puts it away for good. With a max speed of nearly 5GHz and an ample supply of memory and storage, along with support for up to three 4K displays, there are no limitations on what the ACEMAGIC M1 can do.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6132/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny, Powerful Workstation Hub</h2>
<p><span>Place the ACEMAGIC at the center of your workstation, surrounded by three 4K displays and hooked up to a fast Internet connection, and you’re off and running. That’s true if you’re editing videos or hi-res photos, coding, tackling hardcore spreadsheets and data processing, or anything else you’d use a full-sized tower PC for. You can even devote one of those screens to streaming or gaming while you work — the ACEMAGIC M1 is up to the task.</span></p>
<p><span>It all starts with the Intel i9-11900H octo-core processor that’s a massive upgrade over the i7 and i5 versions that are still commonly found at the heart of brand-new PCs. It can blast away at full power without overheating even in the tiny chassis of the ACEMAGIC M1, thanks to the advanced cooling system that’s in place — dual air ducts and cooling fins, copper pipe for superior heat dissipation, and a high-speed fan that runs in nearly total silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The superefficient fan means less power consumption on top of lower temperatures, and it makes the ACEMAGIC M1 a viable option for 24/7 duties like being a fulltime media server, or for huge downloads or other background tasks that can run while you’re sleeping.</span></p>
<h2>Hide It Anywhere</h2>
<p><span>Needless to say, it’s remarkably easy to find a home for a PC that’s just under 6.5 inches square and 4.5 inches thick, weighing a whisker under 3 pounds. Even if you’re utilizing most of not all of its huge array of connection ports, it can be placed virtually anywhere — even behind a monitor or big-screen TV with the included VESA mount.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Cyber Monday is the day when tech deals fly fast and furious, and it’s easy to get lost in that hailstorm of numbers and percentages and offers. Do yourself a favor and bookmark this one, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6132/">this Amazon deal taking 38% off the price of the ACEMAGIC M1 Mini PC is going to be very difficult to beat.</a></span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[JBL Is Practically Giving Away the Go 3 Speaker at an All-Time Low, Even Throwing In 90 Days of Amazon Music for Free]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-is-practically-giving-away-the-go-3-speaker-at-an-all-time-low-even-throwing-in-90-days-of-amazon-music-for-free-2000648983</link>
            <guid>1369270</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sure, you can use your phone and tablet can play music, but can any of these provide an immersive, room-filling listening experience with punchy bass and clear lows? That’s debatable. If you’re looking to enjoy bold sound on the go, grabbing a portable speaker makes sense.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to Cyber Monday, bagging one doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6131/">Right now, Amazon is offering a 25% discount on the JBL Go 3, a mini Bluetooth speaker, which drops its price down to $30</a>. It’s a modest $10 drop, and you’ll also enjoy three months of Amazon Music for absolutely free with your purchase. Even better, several color options are up for grabs for less, so there’s plenty to choose from. Maybe go with the black version if you’re looking for something basic, or pick the stunning red model up to make a statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bold, Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>It comes in an ultra-portable design. The speaker looks like a tiny power bank and features an integrated loop that makes it easy to carry around. Clip it onto your bag, or just slip a finger through and get going. Durability comes from its IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, protecting the speaker from the not-so-ideal weather and environmental conditions. Take it to the beach, a picnic, by the pool, or even in the washroom; a few splashes or drops in the dirt won’t hurt it. It keeps the music going, regardless.</p>
<p>Despite the tiny size, the sound it packs is seriously impressive. You’ll enjoy the legendary JBL signature audio that’s deep and rich. It captures both the highs and the lows well, keeping distortions at bay. Punchy bass makes you feel your favorite tunes down to the bones for an even more immersive experience. Whether you’re using it to catch up on your favorite podcast or listening to the latest Imagine Dragons album, vocals come through with clarity, and every beat is heard. This also makes the speaker great for streaming your favorite shows with friends!</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at around 5 hours of playtime on a single charge. It’s not that massive, but still decent for on-the-go sessions and at-home gatherings. Recharging is fast, too, so the speaker should be back at it in no time. Compatibility is impressive, as the JBL Go 3 works with just about any Bluetooth-enabled device, from smartphones to laptops, computers, tablets, and more. A three-month free trial of the Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plan provides instant access to millions of songs and podcasts. You can shuffle play artists or albums, create your own playlists, download All-Access Playlists for offline jamming, and even get one free audiobook per month from Audible. The offer will be applied automatically to your account after you make your purchase successfully. You need to redeem it within 30 days. After the 90-day trial, your subscription will continue at the monthly price of $12, if you choose to keep it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6131/">All in all, now is a great time to grab the JBL Go 3 mini Bluetooth speaker. You won’t just be saving 25% on the speaker, but also get to enjoy Amazon Music for free for 90 days</a>. There are multiple color options to choose from, as well. The discount, like many other Cyber Monday deals, is going to expire tonight. If you’ve been thinking of grabbing a solid audio solution for less for yourself or to gift it to a loved one this holiday season, now is the time to make the move.</p>
