Spooky season is coming to a climax and then an abrupt close, but that doesn’t mean you can’t keep enjoying horror experiences for the remainder of the fall. Thanks to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/scream&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/scream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam’s ongoing Halloween sale</a></span> which <strong>runs till November 4, </strong>you’ll even have some more time than usual to sort through the wealth of great deals and pick out the perfect horror experience for yourself. We’re also here to help, so here’s a handful (or two) of great sales on horror games going on Steam at the moment.</p></div><div><p>The latest game from <em>Her Story</em> creator Sam Barlow, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/immortality-sam-barlow-horror-video-game-ps5-pc-1849470910&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/immortality-sam-barlow-horror-video-game-ps5-pc-1849470910"><em>Immortality</em></a></span>, is also easily his most horrific. Following the disappearance of actress Marissa Marcel, you are mysteriously gifted footage of her only three movies, each resembling a similar film or style of film of its respective era. There’s an erotic thriller based on the actual Gothic novel <em>The Monk</em>, a <em>Klute</em>-like detective movie set in New York, and a feature that cast Marissa as both a pop star <em>and </em>her lookalike. As you sift through the footage of the films—as well as behind-the-scenes content, wrap parties, table readings, and production meetings—disturbing revelations about what exactly happened to Marissa come to light through what can only be described as supernatural tricks and devilry. </p><p><em>Immortality </em>is occasionally maddening as it challenges the player to match-cut scenes and characters in order to produce a logical timeline of events, but it is also bewitching. <strong>It’s unlike anything I played before it, and it’s unlike anything I’ve played since. </strong>Y<strong>ou can see what I mean by picking up </strong><em><strong>Immortality </strong></em><strong>for just $10. </strong><br></p></div><div><p>What’s scarier than other people? The other people that you find in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dayz&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dayz"><em>DayZ</em></a></span>, specifically. This long-running survival-horror MMO feels like the only experience to really capture what <em>The Walking Dead</em>’s world might feel like in a game. Zombies, which populate the dilapidated post-apocalyptic Russian overworld, aren’t the real threat. The real danger is the need to survive the elements, stay well-fed, and ultimately, outlive other players scrounging for the same weapons and resources as you. </p><p>A few <em>DayZ </em>clones have come and gone since the initial <em>ARMA 2 </em>mod was released, but it<em> </em>still remains the king. I regularly get videos on my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tiktok.com/@tnf_sharpshooter/video/7407512902107680042?q=dayz&amp;t=1730210045564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tiktok.com/@tnf_sharpshooter/video/7407512902107680042?q=dayz&amp;t=1730210045564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiktok</a></span> or Twitter algorithms of people who are still logging in to <em>DayZ </em>for its unrivaled immersive qualities. <strong>Whether you want a deep roleplaying experience out of it or just a taste of a hardcore survival game, </strong><em><strong>DayZ </strong></em><strong>might just be the perfect horror game to pick up this season, and you can get it for $25 now.</strong></p></div><div><p>A few years ago, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitchs-latest-horror-sensation-phasmophobia-has-stre-1845362213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitchs-latest-horror-sensation-phasmophobia-has-stre-1845362213"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a></span> appeared out of nowhere and took the world by storm. Before I knew it, everyone in my friend circles was trekking through haunted locales and screaming at the top of their lungs as unseen paranormal forces stirred and struck them down one by one. I still haven’t tried my hand at <em>Phasmophobia</em>, but it damn sure has been fun watching my friends try their hand at ghostbusting and utterly failing in hilarious fashion. <strong>The game just made it to consoles, but if you’ve got a PC and a fun group, why not pick up </strong><em><strong>Phasmophobia </strong></em><strong>for just $15?</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Phasmophobia </em>casts players as wannabe ghost hunters, but <em>Lethal Company </em>takes a slightly different approach to a similar premise. In it, you are workers dropped into settings that are <em>known </em>to be plagued by certain monsters. In fact, you are explicitly sent in pursuit of scrap and resources to sell to an ambiguous “Company” despite the fact that these monsters will almost definitely get to you. Turn on proximity chat and get into the habit of regularly shouting for your friends throughout the barren halls of the abandoned factories the work sends you to. The job will almost assuredly go wrong to hilarious effect. </p><p>I have been gored by monsters, left behind because I was thought dead, blown up, <em>and </em>I believe shot by a friendly turret the majority of the times that I’ve played <em>Lethal Company</em>.<strong> If you prefer to be hunted by increasingly bizarre and horrifying monsters rather than ghosts,, </strong><em><strong>Lethal Company</strong></em><strong>’s a great time with friends and it can be yours for $7.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Upon emerging from your walk in the woods, you find a cabin on a hill. You enter that cabin and descend down into its basement to find a woman chained to a wall. Only that’s no mere woman, that’s the princess you’ve come to slay, and this job isn’t going to be an easy one. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305"><em>Slay the Princess</em></a></span><em> </em>is an exceptionally clever visual novel that has <em>so many </em>branching possibilities that it’s hard to put names to them all, let alone chart how they feed into one another. You will become intimately familiar with that cabin and that princess as you play through those events I outlined again and again <em>and again</em>. Much as it can feel like you’re going in circles, though, every one of those loops brings you a step closer to the truth about your own motivations here and those of the princess…or whatever she <em>really </em>is. <em><strong>Slay the Princess </strong></em><strong>is an exceptionally winding horror tale and it just got </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-pristine-cut-review-update-new-routes-1851678749&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-pristine-cut-review-update-new-routes-1851678749"><strong>expanded upon, entirely for free</strong></a></span><strong>. Now it’s discounted for Halloween, and you should pick it up while it’s $14.39.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>There isn’t much that needs to be said about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/l4d2-left-4-dead-2-broken-fast-sequel-valve-anacrusis-1851043368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/l4d2-left-4-dead-2-broken-fast-sequel-valve-anacrusis-1851043368"><em>Left 4 Dead 2</em></a></span><em> </em>at this point in time. It’s <em>still </em>one of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam, enjoys a healthy mod scene, and is a triumphant sequel that built on the already impeccable foundation of its inimitable predecessor. By now, it<em> </em>should just be software that’s already downloaded onto freshly delivered PCs and consoles. <em><strong>Left 4 Dead 2 </strong></em><strong>is quite literally $1 right now, so quit playing around and get it already.</strong></p></div><div><p>One of my favorite horror settings in games is in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a></span>, a <em>Souls</em>-ish Metroidvania that is definitely not a particularly scary game. Still, at a certain point in your travels, you are bound to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/hollow-knight/hollow-knights-ingenious-map-system-ensures-theres&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/hollow-knight/hollow-knights-ingenious-map-system-ensures-theres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fall into Deepnest</a></span>, a horrifying pit in the heart of Hallownest, <em>Hollow Knight</em>’s underground bug kingdom. There is little light here, obscuring some of your view, and there’s not really any music here either. Instead, you’re forced to constantly listen to the chitter of bugs that can be seen writhing in the foreground of the environments. It is the worst place imaginable, and one of the greatest highlights of the immensely varied and deeply layered world of <em>Hollow Knight</em>, the second best game ever, just behind <em>Bloodborne</em>. <strong>You can own </strong><em><strong>Hollow Knight </strong></em><strong>for $7.49, and you should. </strong></p></div><div><p>I’m a sucker for a game that looks and feels vintage, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span><em> </em>is definitely that. Styled after PS1 games, and more specifically <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-3-original-trilogy-bundle-gog-1851662547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-3-original-trilogy-bundle-gog-1851662547">classic <em>Resident Evil</em></a></span>, it features a low-poly look, fixed camera angles, and obscure puzzles that feel like true sendups of the survival-horror genre’s roots. It’s the latest in a recent string of indie success stories that have been deliberate throwbacks, showing that there’s an audience for the stuff that we thought we’d outgrown, when really there’s a place for the old and new. <strong>To see what I mean, pick up <em>Crow Country </em>while it’s $16 right now.</strong></p></div><div><p>I first played <em>I’m On Observation Duty </em>at a friend’s birthday a little over a year ago, and while I was zooted out of my mind for most of the trip, the experience of playing it has stuck with me with resounding clarity. While we were all huddled together around a couch in our Airbnb, one of the members of our group took the reins of the game, which grants players access to security cameras around a certain setting. Sometimes it’s an office, or a house, but there’s always something <em>wrong </em>with it, or at least there eventually will be. You scan the perimeter at first to see what it all looks like when things are normal, and then eventually, “anomalies” occur that either subtly displace things or visibly worsen the situation.</p><p>At first, I was struck by how mundane it all was. <em>I’m On Observation Duty</em>’s action felt a bit slow to start, and I think the room was feeling it too, since we were mostly divining what object had moved two inches to the right. But just as it felt like we might turn in, things escalated. <em>Things </em>began to appear, and elements of the environment became visibly distorted. The barks from our crew grew from murmurs to full-on shouts, as the anomalies of the game became more aggressive and haunted. At least one person nearly lept off the couch out of fear, and before long, I’d noticed that my grip on the couch’s arm had tightened over the session. Whether I cared to admit it or not, I was scared and having a wonderful time. </p><p>I’m rarely a passive participant to horror in games. I’m typically on the sticks myself, and usually alone in a room when I do play a horror game, but <em>I’m On Observation Duty </em>was one of my favorite experiences because it was time spent getting spooked with some incredible people. Horror is such a social genre, it only makes sense that one of the few times I open myself up to enjoying it with other people in the room, it blows most other titles out of the water despite its simplicity. If you do pick it up, corral your funniest friends into a call or the same room, because it’s a blast this way.<br></p><p><em>I’m On Observation Duty </em>is a series of short horror games, and <strong>most of them are discounted for the ongoing Halloween sale for anywhere between two to three dollars</strong>. <strong>Alternatively, if you’ve decided that this premise sounds like your kind of shit, you can pick up a collection with all seven titles in the </strong><em><strong>I’m On Observation Duty</strong></em><strong> series for about $33.</strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
