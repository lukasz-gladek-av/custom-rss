That happens.” Nothing more, nothing less. </p><p>The anonymous source who leaked information on Johnson’s pee proclivities explained the 52-year-old megastar did so in order to save time on set. But, allegedly having a production assistant or someone from his team dump it out may have rubbed the cast and crew the wrong way. Since Johnson was somewhat curt in his admission, we’d need an op-ed from one of the people who actually handled his container of urine entitled “Between The Rock and His Pee Place” to get to the bottom of this. Or, we could treat it as the the too-much-information news it really is. </p><p>Johnson and his <em>Red One</em> co-star <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-netflix-trailer-release-date-anime-cera-1850744608&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-netflix-trailer-release-date-anime-cera-1850744608">Chris Evans</a></span> did clear up a more damning allegation about Johnson arriving to set up to eight hours late, potentially contributing to the film’s $250 million production budget. While Johnson admits he has been late, he calls the eight-hour tardiness a “bananas amount” that is inaccurate. Evans attempted to massage the truth a bit by saying Johnson’s lateness was predictable enough for them to factor it into the production schedule, before he altogether says he wouldn’t even call what Johnson did as being late. It sounds like Johnson is so irreplaceable to a film that he is allowed to live by the famous Nas lyric from his song “Can’t Forget About You”: “Never on schedule, always on time.” </p><p>Honestly, when a man has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/dwayne-rock-johnson-box-office-hits-flops-reality/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/dwayne-rock-johnson-box-office-hits-flops-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grossed over $12 billion</a></span> at the box office, a little pee and a later start to the work day should be no big deal. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You have hundreds of setpieces to play around with, pathing tools, three different game modes, and roller coaster construction mechanics that take some time to grow accustomed to. It’s a lot to soak up. Hopefully, with the right beginner’s tips and tricks for <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, you’ll find your time as a park constructor more fulfilling!</p><h2 id="h73880"><a id=""></a>Start with the career mode</h2><figure id="" data-id="771d26e816930de61b3fa111437f03dd" data-recommend-id="image://771d26e816930de61b3fa111437f03dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An NPC introduces the player to career mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An NPC introduces the player to career mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="771d26e816930de61b3fa111437f03dd" data-recommend-id="image://771d26e816930de61b3fa111437f03dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An NPC introduces the player to career mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re anything like me, you’re probably tempted to dive straight into the sandbox mode, where you can build anything you desire with unlimited money and time. But wait! I recommend starting in career mode. It offers a guided experience with approachable objectives designed to teach you the core gameplay mechanics, like how to increase power throughout your park. Seriously, you need power to operate rides, so it’s helpful knowing this information!</p><p>Furthermore, the career mode introduces you to the new features of <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>: waterparks! You’ll learn how to craft and customize waterslides, pools, and sunlit expanses for your visitors to lounge around, tossing trash on the ground while you rake them over the coals for every dollar possible.</p><h2 id="h73881"><a id=""></a>Invest heavily in entertainers</h2><figure id="" data-id="0a072e0f6423d5c954bf50ae3e0cb3d3" data-recommend-id="image://0a072e0f6423d5c954bf50ae3e0cb3d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A Gulpee Rex entertainer wanders through crowds in Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A Gulpee Rex entertainer wanders through crowds in Planet Coaster 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a072e0f6423d5c954bf50ae3e0cb3d3" data-recommend-id="image://0a072e0f6423d5c954bf50ae3e0cb3d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A Gulpee Rex entertainer wanders through crowds in Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> features ten entertainers at launch that you can hire to entice crowds and keep everyone satisfied while wandering the park. These entertainers include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Chief Beef</li><li>Gulpee Rex</li><li>Cosmic Cow</li><li>Queen Splash</li><li>King Coaster</li><li>Crescendo Melodis</li><li>Saguaro Guitaro</li><li>Sandy Reef</li><li>Bodhi</li><li>The Viking</li></ul><p>Once you hire an entertainer, they’ll wander the paths of your park, interacting with guests at random and keeping parkgoers happy while they wait in the queue for the next big ride. These useful staff members help boost mood, which entices patrons to return for future visits and spend more money at your bustling park!</p><h2 id="h73882"><a id=""></a>Pause before pathing</h2><figure id="" data-id="e414dbe89ac1c69587282cb3a05f54a9" data-recommend-id="image://e414dbe89ac1c69587282cb3a05f54a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors walk through a new theme park in Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Visitors walk through a new theme park in Planet Coaster 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e414dbe89ac1c69587282cb3a05f54a9" data-recommend-id="image://e414dbe89ac1c69587282cb3a05f54a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors walk through a new theme park in Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Without proper pathing, you’ll find that your park’s visitors bunch up and cause roadblocks. It’s much easier to plan ahead than it is to upgrade your pathing down the line. So, to that end,<strong> I recommend you start your game—no matter the game mode—by pausing and creating a general layout</strong>. You can use the pathing tool to size up for a central concourse, as in the screenshot above, to help you plan out the general flow of your park. </p><p>As a park manager, you’ll want to guide patrons toward rides, merchandise, and meals that earn you money. If they can’t reach these attractions, they’ll glitch into a big ball and remain stuck, blocking future visitors from passing.</p><h2 id="h73883"><a id=""></a>Scenery boosts ride and park appeal</h2><figure id="" data-id="a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-recommend-id="image://a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-recommend-id="image://a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When’s the last time you went to an amusement park? Was it a barren landscape with cobwebs and dust bunnies rolling across the parking lot? Or was it full of life, with unique scenery that beckons the imagination to run wild? Most likely the latter, what makes for an exciting theme park in real life also works in <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>.</p><p>Once you place down a ride, spend a little time on its surroundings. You don’t necessarily have to follow a theme; it can be a mish-mash of different scenery objects and types, but you’ll want to eliminate much of the empty space within your park to boost appeal. The more appeal your rides and attractions have, the more Prestige you earn and the better your park performs overall. Keep these elements in mind and ou’ll be swimming in money—which you may then reinvest!</p><h2 id="h73884"><a id=""></a>Learn the major hotkeys</h2><figure id="" data-id="f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-recommend-id="image://f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-recommend-id="image://f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re playing on PC—the best platform for <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>—you’ll have access to numerous hotkeys to help construct the park of your dreams. Memorizing these will make playing the game a breeze.Some of the most important include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ctrl + Z </strong>- Undo</li><li><strong>Ctrl + Y</strong> - Redo</li><li><strong>Right Ctrl + Right Shift + G</strong> - Hide UI</li><li><strong>Alt </strong>- Radial Menu</li><li><strong>L</strong> - Camera Light</li><li><strong>Hold Z</strong> - Rotate Objects</li><li><strong>Z</strong> - Rotate 90 Degrees</li><li><strong>P</strong> - Toggle Angle Snap</li><li><strong>B/V</strong> - Align or Stick to Surface</li><li><strong>F</strong> - Snap Objects to Wall Piece</li><li><strong>Ctrl + D</strong> - Duplicate Objects</li><li><strong>U/J</strong> - Raise or Lower Pathing</li></ul><h2 id="h73885"><a id=""></a></h2><figure id="" data-id="04e764c1b23452f762360cd50a28d27a" data-recommend-id="image://04e764c1b23452f762360cd50a28d27a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two theme park visitors walk toward the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two theme park visitors walk toward the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04e764c1b23452f762360cd50a28d27a" data-recommend-id="image://04e764c1b23452f762360cd50a28d27a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two theme park visitors walk toward the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a park management game, you must satisfy the needs of your patrons completely. If they require drinks, provide them with a Gulpee stand. If they’re hungry, you’ll want to add Chief Beef. However, a new gameplay mechanic in <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>—dynamic weather—provides additional challenges beyond the tangible. </p><p>As the weather varies, so too do your guests’ comfort levels. They’ll seek cover and retreat to the waterpark if it’s too hot. If it’s raining, they’ll look for umbrellas. But without space for guests to hunker down, they’ll ultimately leave. You must consider the weather when crafting every inch of your park; that way, visitors spend more time and money!</p><p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> isn’t the only hit launching in November.

He hasn’t even read the script yet though, and isn’t sure how his character’s meaty arc across eight episodes of the HBO spin-off will be brought to bear on the Batman reboot’s sequel. “I signed up for three Batman films, but I didn’t know if I’d be in the second film,” Farrell told <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new interview</a></span>. “Matt Reeves is a brilliant writer and an extraordinary filmmaker, and what I’m most excited-slash-nervous about in the second film is not what Oz does—or what predicaments he finds himself in, or what moments of success he gets to experience—but what his voice is.”</p><p> The actor continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>How is his personality? It was forming and changing in the limited series, and, by the end of the eight episodes, it’s concretized into something else. There is a degree of almost delusion psychopathy present in the last scene. So how is that taken up in the second film? I was told I have five or six scenes. I don’t have any hopes or any expectations. I’m really an open book, and that’s the way I get excited by shit or not. I think sometimes actors, if they have a career that has a certain length of time, they sometimes get to make too many decisions. Which isn’t to say I won’t push back or argue or fight in Oz’s corner—I do believe I know him better than anyone now.</p></blockquote><p>While the success and critical acclaim of the HBO show provides a lot of extra room for <em>The Batman Part II</em> to play with the Penguin’s character, it will probably still be circumscribed by the fact that most of its potential movie-going audience will never have seen the show in the interim. But for fans at least, it should hopefully make Farrell’s character a lot more interesting and impactful than his lively but one-dimensional presentation in the last <em>Batman</em> movie. </p><p>More importantly, what are the chances that we get a season 2 of <em>The Penguin</em> sometime farther down the road? While Farrell previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/colin-farrell-return-the-penguin-season-2-1235998889/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/colin-farrell-return-the-penguin-season-2-1235998889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Total Film</em></a></span>, “I never want to put on that fucking suit and fucking head again,” he recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span> he’d be willing to return under the right circumstances. </p><p>“If there’s a great idea [for season two], and the writing was really muscular and as strong or stronger on the page than it was the first season, of course I would do it,” he said. “For me, the bar for success is not very high. It’s, ‘Do most people like it?’—just the simplicity of that. I love being in things that are critically approved—it’s much better than the alternative—but I’ve been around long enough [to know] that it’s the audience who are really the most important critics.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are still many titles being released, but I feel that the era of games where the volume is the selling point is coming to an end.”</p><p> Nagoshi left the<em> Like a Dragon</em> publisher three years ago to set up his own studio, and is currently working on a new project with NetEase Games. As the new game enters full production, he said the team is currently deciding on the final estimate of how much content will be in it. It sounds like he’s steering away from just making it big for the sake of an impressive-sounding interview soundbite or back-of-the-box quote </p><p>“Of course we have the map, but the current version is so large that it’s almost too large,” he told Famitsu. “This time, while researching existing games, we started by making a fairly large map with roads and highways. Now we are gradually shrinking it down and exploring the best balance for the game.”</p><p>The size of a game’s map, the total length of its script, and the average runtime for players are often deployed in pre-release marketing campaigns to bolster the sense that a game is worth its asking price. Value is reduced to how long it will keep a player busy, rather than whether any of the stuff they are doing feels meaningful or fun. That might be a plus for people who just want two or three games that will occupy them all year long, but for everyone else it can make getting to the “good” parts of a game feel like working a second job. </p><p>We’ll see how much that philosophy ends up impacting Nagoshi’s next project.
