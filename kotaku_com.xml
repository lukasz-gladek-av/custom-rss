However, there are also some surprising omissions from over the course of the cinematic universe.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>From the hip, here are some of the actors and characters that are seemingly not showing up in <em>Doomsday</em>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange </li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Chris Pratt as Star-Lord (or any of the Guardians of the Galaxy)</li><li>Tom Holland as Spider-Man</li><li>Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch</li><li>Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye</li><li>Mark Ruffalo as Hulk</li><li>Tatiana Maslany as She-Hulk</li><li>Brie Larson as Captain Marvel</li><li>Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau</li><li>Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel</li><li>Evangeline Lilly as Wasp</li><li>Kathryn Newton as Stature</li></ul><p>Some of those are less surprising than others, but given that this is supposed to be the next big “Everyone Is Here” moment, I’m surprised some of the major players like Doctor Strange and Spider-Man apparently aren’t making an appearance this time around. Granted, it’s not like the movie is lacking in characters, and it’s probably a good thing that Marvel isn’t squeezing every single one of them into an already-bloated movie. Will something terrible happen to some of the cast to make space for other heroes to play a role in <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em>, the sequel premiering in 2027? <em>Infinity War </em>temporarily killed off half the cast so <em>Endgame </em>could focus on a smaller group of heroes, after all, and Cumberbatch has already been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-future-sherlock-sundance-1236281025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-future-sherlock-sundance-1236281025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to appear in <em>Secret Wars</em></a></span>, so that’s at least one missing hero accounted for. It’s hard to even speculate about what <em>Secret Wars </em>will entail; the last time the MCU did a giant crossover film, it emerged after years of setup and foreshadowing, but that’s largely absent here because the series has been pivoting away from its previous plans in the wake of Kang actor Jonathan Majors’ domestic violence case. Anyway, the big takeaway here for me is that I guess I’ll just have to emotionally prepare myself to not see Star-Lord for at least two more years. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Then the PS5 arrived in 2020 and Sony turned its attention to live-service gaming with the hopes of capturing a piece of the growing multiplayer market. Former executive Shawn Layden, who abruptly left Sony after more than 30 years of service right before the new hardware launched, recently suggested that strategy pivot was part of the reason behind his departure. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“To be honest, you know, the company was making some strategic decisions about where they want to take the platform in the future with a heavy emphasis in games as a service, live-service gaming, subscription formulas, recurring revenue, whatnot, and that was kind of not my wheelhouse,” Layden, who was Chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2014 to 2019, said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/AutPkiVDSoQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/AutPkiVDSoQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent podcast interview</a></span> with Save State Plus. </p><p>“I just make things like<em> God of War</em> and <em>Spider-Man </em>and <em>Last of Us</em> and <em>Uncharted </em>[and]<em> Horizon</em>,” he continued, “I didn’t have the vision or the energy to try to, you know, take it to this this new area of live-service gaming so, all that considered, it seemed like a good time to step down after 32 years at Sony.”</p><p>Layden left Sony in September 2019, a little over a year before the launch of the PS5. “His visionary leadership will be greatly missed,” the PlayStation account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1178808151962816514?s=20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1178808151962816514?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> at the time, “We wish him success in future endeavors and are deeply grateful for his years of service.

They’ve also seen the live-service pivot go nowhere quickly. While PS5 sales continue to outpace those of the PS4 in the U.S., even without a price cut over four years into the console generation, there’s a sense that Sony’s live-service ambitions this hardware cycle have come at the expense of delivering more of the single-player hits and experiments with new franchises the publisher’s first-party portfolio has historically been known for. </p><p>And the fruits of the live-service approach have been few and far between. On one side of the ledger is a game like <em>Helldivers 2</em>, which despite its shocking success was technically a second-party game continuing an IP from the PS4 years. On the other side are flops like<em> Concord</em>, the stagnation of <em>Destiny 2</em>, and a graveyard of cancelled projects including everything from <em>The Last of Us Online </em>to a multiplayer <em>God of War </em>spin-off. </p><p>There are still upcoming multiplayer projects from Sony like heist shooter <em>FairGame$ </em>waiting in the wings, but the company has now cancelled far more of them than it previously promised to release by 2026. A spokesperson for Sony told Bloomberg earlier this year that it will continue to make both single-player and multiplayer games, though it’s unclear what the exact ratio will be moving forward. The company recently revealed new single-player projects, including one from Naughty Dog <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">called <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/saros-release-date-trailer-gameplay-roguelike-1851762075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/saros-release-date-trailer-gameplay-roguelike-1851762075">one from Housemarque called <em>Saros</em></a></span>, both of which look promising but could still be years away from release. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
