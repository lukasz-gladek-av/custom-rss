They’re impressive, deadly, and the game’s ostensible main attraction. But my favorite acquaintance in the Forbidden Lands is not some hulking, ferocious beast but a ‘lil guy named Rove. Other players agree: the philosophical Wudwud has been stealing the show. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

They’re a local forest tribe of stubby-looking cats, but not to be confused with the series’ long-running feline Palico pals. Wudwuds have a bit more of Disney’s Stitch in them. They don’t know English well and speak in very broken sentences. Except for Rove, who instead carries himself like <em>Sailor Moon</em>’s Tuxedo Mask trying out for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The guy fucking rules. </p><p>Why are <em>Monster Hunter</em> fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j47ow6/who_is_the_best_character_in_the_game_and_why_is/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j47ow6/who_is_the_best_character_in_the_game_and_why_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">losing their shit</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j44idn/is_it_too_early_to_call_him_the_goat/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j44idn/is_it_too_early_to_call_him_the_goat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over this furball</a></span>?

There are not many iconic lines in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. Rove has most of them. His big monologue comes early on when you encounter him all webbed up, Frodo-style, by a giant Nerscylla in an ice cave. It might be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibTtPWZcHDw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibTtPWZcHDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best scene</a></span> in the entire game. </p><p>“Ah, now death greets me with a new mask,” he says as he’s prepped for supper. “Or are you my salvation? So what shall it be, shall I leave it to fate? I squirm. I struggle. Ergo, I am. Faced with death, I am finally, truly alive.” His English voice acting is great.

It works because the game is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1897694824741863564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1897694824741863564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">always taking itself deadly seriously</a></span>, even when it’s being purposefully absurd and silly.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The best part is that Rove’s contributions to <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>aren’t limited to your initial meeting with him. You can bump into him out in the field and there are several side quests he’s involved in, including one particularly major story mission in the late game after hitting high rank. And every time you run into him he’s spouting stuff like, “Forget me. Go. If fate wills it, we shall meet again.” Same Rove, same.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>might not ultimately be most people’s 2025 GOTY, but Rove is without a doubt my current front-runner for 2025 video game character of the year. I wouldn’t take a bullet for him but I would take him to Hot Topic and we’d have a blast picking out dumb T-shirts together. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Yoc9Official,  the man seen in the video wearing a  black hoodie, baseball hat and white pants, was waiting in his car for the restock and tried to push past Yoc9Official to access the Pokémon vending machine. The two men pushed and shoved each other, as seen in the viral video below. </p><p>The video was recorded by someone else and shared by Yoc9Official, according to a comment posted the creator on TikTok. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@yoc9official/video/7478570100677889326&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yoc9official/video/7478570100677889326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a follow up video</a></span>, you can hear the man yelling at what appears to be a store employee, who explains they reviewed footage before being cut off by the aggressive man in white pants. Yoc9Official claims that eventually police showed up and arrested the other man. </p><p> “He claimed being in his car was in line,” said Yoc9Offical in a comment on TikTok. “Cops came [and] got him and he fell out pretending to be hurt. They asked me if I wanted to press charges and I said no.” </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>wasn’t able to verify the claims of police arriving or arresting anyone. We’ve reached out to Yoc9Official for more information about the incident and what happened. </p><p>After the clip went viral, people online reacted with confusion and disgust over grown men fighting over cards designed primarily for children. The two men are also believed to be Pokémon card flippers, leading to even more venom and anger directed at them. </p><p>“I’m sorry but I was part of the generation that had my Pokémon binder out trading with my friends on the front porch,” posted one user on Twitter. “It’s an absolute shame that this hobby has gotten so out of control.
