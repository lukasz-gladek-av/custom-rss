              <p>The DJI Osmo 360 Camera is designed to help you create high-resolution, immersive content by capturing a full 360-degree image using a 1-inch 360 imaging system that delivers native 8K 360 video and high-quality still images, wrapping every scene into a single frame. The camera also includes a new 180° invisible selfie stick and an extra battery, so you can keep filming creative third-person angles without stopping to swap batteries. The DJI Osmo 360 Camera Essential Combo includes accessories that make it easy for you to shoot spherical footage in multiple formats, including vertical videos for platforms like Instagram and YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7016/">You can get the DJI Osmo 360 Camera Essential Combo on Amazon for $389, which is $210 off its regular price of $599, or 35% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7016/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A high-quality camera for capturing life’s every moment</h2>
<p>The DJI Osmo 360 Camera uses a larger 1-inch dual-lens sensor to collect more light and deliver improved low-light performance. It natively records 8K 360 video at up to 30 frames per second, allowing you to zoom, reframe, and refocus footage to suit social media platforms and standard widescreen formats. The camera also captures 120-megapixel 360 photos, giving you detailed panoramic images of your surroundings. With 10-bit color and D-Log-M support, you have plenty of flexibility to color grade your 360 footage.</p>
<p>You can choose from a range of motion and framing options to customize how your content looks. You can shoot in 4K at 120 FPS for slow-motion footage or use the 170-degree Boost mode for a wider perspective similar to an ultra-wide lens. The 1.2-meter invisible selfie stick lets you position the camera above or in front of you while remaining hidden during post-production. Quick-release magnetic mounts and a standard ¼-20 threaded thread allow you to switch quickly between helmet mounts, tripods, clamps, or vlog-style single-lens setups.</p>



<p>The camera and included accessories are built for extended use. You get 105 GB of internal storage, letting you record 360-degree footage continuously even without a memory card installed. If you need more space, you can expand storage using the microSD card slot. Depending on your recording settings, you can record for up to 190 minutes, and the extra battery included in the Essential Combo gives you enough power to keep filming after the first battery runs out.</p>
<p>Additional features include audio recording, editing tools, and intuitive controls. Four built-in microphones capture sound from all directions, and when paired with up to two compatible microphone transmitters, OsmoAudio helps keep your audio setup clean and efficient. The DJI Mimo app gives you pano dewarp tools and color grading options for editing your 360 footage. You can also control the camera and transfer files using the built-in touchscreen with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. With the camera, invisible selfie stick, extra battery, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7016/">and the Essential Combo’s discounted $389 price compared to the usual $599, this setup gives you a strong starting point for expanding your content creation library with 360-degree video.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Copyright law nearly got in the way of whimsy, as a Spanish figure skater’s planned routine&nbsp; for the 2026 Olympics was in jeopardy. Why? The music his routine uses couldn’t be cleared for the event. The song in question? </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsas-7DcA6Q"><span>“Papaya” by the Minions</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté, a 26-year-old ice skater who has won many a gold medal across his career, has been performing a routine set to the </span><i><span>Minions</span></i><span> song throughout the competitive season leading up to the Winter Olympic Games, which are set to begin on Friday, February 6, in Italy. However, in an </span><a href="https://x.com/InTheLoPodcast/status/2018206034163073309"><span>Instagram story</span></a><span> posted yesterday, Guarino Sabaté revealed that he would not be able to do this routine, which has him dressed in blue overalls and a bright yellow shirt, because Universal Pictures refused to clear the song for the televised event.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“This season I competed with my </span><i><span>Minions</span></i><span> short program to bring joy and a playful style to the ice while still meeting every required element to show that skating as a male Olympic figure skater can be fun,” Guarino Sabaté wrote. “I followed all required procedures and submitted my music through the ISU ClicknClear system back in August, and I competed with this program throughout the entire season. Unfortunately, just days before the Olympic inauguration, I was informed that I am no longer permitted to use this program due to copyright clearance issues.</span></p> <p><span>“Finding this out last Friday, so close to the biggest competition of my life, was incredibly disappointing. Nevertheless, I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">A music rights clearance issue means we will all be robbed of seeing this at the Olympics:<br> <a href="https://t.co/tgBhpCG13i">pic.twitter.com/tgBhpCG13i</a> <a href="https://t.co/Hn09Kqmphq">https://t.co/Hn09Kqmphq</a></p> <p>— Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/2018309613095960743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>You can see a short clip from the routine above, and while, yes, there’s some impressive figure-skating athleticism on display here, there are also some silly dance moves in the mix as well. It would have been a shame if a company as big as Universal got in the way of Guarino Sabaté doing this on one of the world’s biggest stages. Luckily, it seems like he’ll be able to perform the short program at the event after an outpouring of public support got the company to reconsider.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Huge THANK YOU to everyone who reposted, shared, and supported,” Guarino Sabaté wrote </span><a href="https://x.com/AnythingGOE/status/2018619222536904730"><span>in a follow-up story</span></a><span>. “Because of you, Universal studios reconsidered and officially granted the rights for this one special occasion. I’m so happy to see that the minions hitting Olympic ice is becoming real again!!”</span></p> <p><span>Bullying works, I suppose. Never thought I’d be hooting and hollering for a piece of obnoxious </span><i><span>Minions</span></i><span> music to appear at the Olympics, but I hate to see big business keeping a whimsical king down. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340</link>
            <guid>1424050</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Longtime <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-north-boss-leslie-benzies-is-out-after-nearly-1752495562">former Rockstar North president</a> Leslie Benzies was one of the people whose name appeared in the recent trove of Epstein files released by the Justice Department. It included an allegation by an alleged Jeffrey Epstein victim who accused Benzies of sexual assault. He denied the allegation via a spokesperson in a statement shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p>“These allegations are false, I had a 3 months consensual relationship with this person, and I have never met Jeffrey Epstein, nor have I ever visited his island, his properties or travelled on his plane. Any suggestion otherwise is misleading,” the statement reads.</p>

 <p>The mention of Benzies appears in a 62-page file released by the Justice Department that includes allegations from Sarah Ransome, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/epstein-accuser-ghislaine-maxwell-chief-orchestrator/story?id=81589520">who previously sued</a> Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell for alleged sex trafficking. Ransome also released a book in 2021 titled <em>Silenced No More: Surviving My Journey to Hell and Back</em>.</p> <p>The released file was an alleged witness list Ransome appeared to be compiling. In it she accused Benzies of sexually assaulting her at one point. She also mentions Sam Houser, the current president of Rockstar Games, but not in connection with any allegation. There is no evidence that any of the claims in Ransome’s document were vetted by federal investigators. Ransom could not immediately be reached for comment. Rockstar didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>

 <p>Benzies is currently working at Build a Rocket Boy, a studio he cofounded after leaving Rockstar in 2016 amid litigation over royalties. It released its first game,<em> MindsEye</em>, last year. The shooter was critically panned, however, and became the subject of reporting and speculation about its troubled development. One YouTuber who has released several videos about the game was recently accused by Build a Rocket Boy’s co-CEO, Mark Gerhard, of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097">being part of an effort to sabotage the studio</a>.</p>

 <p>Gerhard threatened legal action against the creator, Cyber Boi, minutes after the latter published a YouTube video about Benzies appearing in the Epstein files. The video has since been deleted as a result of the threat of litigation. Build a Rocket Boy confirmed that Benzies remains employed at the studio as it continues updating <em>MindsEye</em> and working on its metaverse project <em>Everywhere</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This RIFFMASTER Wireless Guitar Controller for Xbox Drops to All-Time Low, Officially Licensed by Microsoft]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-for-xbox-drops-to-all-time-low-officially-licensed-by-microsoft-2000665101</link>
            <guid>1423975</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For most of us, Guitar Hero and Rock Band are just those gimmick games that were briefly popular for a couple years back in high school. But for some of us, it is life. The dream of peripheral-based rhythm gaming isn’t as long dead as you might think. The PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller is seeing a hefty sale on Amazon at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/">Normally sold for $150, it’s now down 33%, saving you a whopping $50. That’s brings it down to an even $100.</a></p>
<p>There are three models of the PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller, each designed for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles. The controller is suitable for Rock Band games, as well as Fortnite Festival, though I’m sure there’s someone out there attempting to beat <em>Bloodborne</em> with this thing. Each model is officially licensed for the system its designed for. The Xbox one is also compatible with PC if that’s where you’re looking to play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you’ve only ever played any of the Guitar Hero or Rock Band games using the controllers that came with the game, then you’ll find this one to be more closely resembling the Rock Band’s guitar controller. The five main buttons take up the entirety of the frets, and they’re also all duplicated higher up on the neck of the guitar if you want to switch up the way you play. The strumming trigger is also more akin to its Rock Band counterpart than it is the Guitar Hero one.</p>
<h2>Designed for Everyone</h2>
<p>The PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller is also designed for both righty and lefty guitarists, having a strap attachment available on both sides of the guitar. The buttons being the whole fret also support make playing righty or lefty feel more closely aligned. The strap itself is included with the controller as well.</p>



<p>Built into the front of the guitar controller is both a D-pad as well as a traditional analogue stick for easier navigation. The analogue stick is actually built into the neck of the guitar, while the D-pad is found on its face, beneath where you strum. The controller even has integrated volume controls so you can adjust on the fly, mid-song. And of course, gotta have the whammy bar.</p>
<p>Being a wireless controller, it works off a rechargeable battery. That battery should last you a solid 36 hours of playtime per charge. When playing, it has a 30-range of low latency wireless connection to work with, so feel free to rock out all across your friend’s basement.</p>
<p>When you’re done playing, the controller can even be collapsed for both easy transportation and for more flexibility when it comes to storage.</p>
