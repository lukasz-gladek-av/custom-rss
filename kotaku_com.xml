Luckily, not every Switch 2 from Target was delayed by multiple days. But if your console was, you can likely grab a free $50 eShop gift card from the retail giant. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1938309454581088412&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1938309454581088412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media</a></span>, Target has started sending out email messages to customers who pre-ordered a Switch 2 console but received it later than expected.</p><p>“We know you were hoping to receive your [Switch 2] sooner,” wrote Target. “Unfortunately, we didn’t make that happen. This isn’t the experience we intended, and we’re sincerely sorry. As a thank you for your patience and understanding, we’re including a complimentary code for one $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card.”</p><p>To redeem the gift card, you’ll need to add a $50 eShop card to your Target cart and check out while logged into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.target.com/l/target-circle/-/N-pzno9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.target.com/l/target-circle/-/N-pzno9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Target Circle account</a></span> that you used when ordering the Switch 2. If done correctly, assuming your Switch 2 was late, the $50 card will be discounted to $0. </p><p>There is a catch, because of course there is. There’s always a catch.

Films like the <em>Mortal Kombat </em>series, <em>Dead or Alive</em>, and the 1994 <em>Street Fighter </em>all possess a kind of so-bad-they’re-good ridiculousness that has made them cult classic guilty pleasures. Part of that is because, in narrative terms, the source material they’re drawing from is barely strung together to begin with, since in most fighting games the plot is there just to bring a series of memorable weirdos together to beat each other up. Those characters are the most interesting part, so casting actors who can bring all their bizarre sensibilities to life is key. That’s probably why the cast for the upcoming <em>Street Fighter </em>reboot reads like a randomly generated ensemble made up of some truly surprising picks.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,197586,196406" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-curtis-50-cent-jackson-1236299350/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-curtis-50-cent-jackson-1236299350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>, rapper, actor, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-this-50-cent-blood-on-the-sand-started-out-as-a-t-1847655379&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-this-50-cent-blood-on-the-sand-started-out-as-a-t-1847655379">occasional video game star</a></span> 50 Cent is joining the cast as Balrog, the boxer who made his debut in <em>Street Fighter II</em> back in 1991. 50 Cent isn’t the only musician-turned-actor set to star in the film next year. Masked country singer Orville Peck is set to make his feature film debut as the masked fighter Vega after taking on a handful of theatre roles in recent years. Other actors include Mr. Minecraft himself, Jason Momoa, as the eccentric creature Blanka, WWE star Roman Reigns as Akuma, Callina Lianga as Chun-Li, and <em>Reacher </em>star Alan Ritchson as Guile. Andrew Koji and Noah Centineo are also on board to play the leading rivals Ryu and Ken.</p><p>What a strange group. I’m a <em>Street Fighter </em>fan, so I was probably going to see this movie whether it was good or bad, but this line-up makes me all the more interested to see what kind of monstrosity Legendary Entertainment could be creating in its lab. If it’s good, great! If it’s bad, it will have to live up to the disastrous delight that is the 1994 film. I need the first trailer to drop as soon as possible. I sense the makings of a new Bad Movie Night staple.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-cast-actors-50-cent-jason-momoa-1851785178]]></content:encoded>
