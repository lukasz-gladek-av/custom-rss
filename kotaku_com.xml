              <p>If you’ve ever been stuck<strong> on a long flight watching a movie with those cheap wired earbuds the airline hands out</strong>, you’ll understand why small Bluetooth transmitters exist. The <em>Ugreen</em> airplane Bluetooth 6.0 transmitter solves one of the most annoying travel problems: letting you use your own wireless headphones with the in‑flight entertainment system. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/">it’s down to an all‑time low price of $18, down from its usual $27 on Amazon</a>. It’s the kind of tiny gadget that instantly makes travel more comfortable and feels like a small luxury upgrade.</p>

<h2>A Game‑Changer for Travel</h2>
<p>What’s so clever about this little adapter is that it turns <strong>almost any traditional audio source into a wireless one</strong>. Plug it into the headphone jack on the plane seat, the TV in your hotel room or even an old car stereo, and you can connect your Bluetooth earbuds or headset in seconds. No tangled wires, no adapters dangling from your seat — just your own choice of headphones and clear sound.</p>



<p>The connection quality is surprisingly solid for something this small. <strong>Due to Bluetooth 6.0, pairing happens almost instantly</strong> and the range extends up to 10 meters — that’s enough to move freely in a living room or even stroll across a hotel suite without losing the signal. The newer Bluetooth spec also cuts down the annoying audio delay that used to make videos and games slightly out of sync.</p>



<p>What’s more, the Ugreen unit <strong>holds up to 18 hours of use in receiver mode and 16 hours in transmission mode</strong>&nbsp;which will easily cover a full day of travel, including layovers and entertainment before landing. You can charge it during use if needed, but in practice, most users say it goes days between charges. For frequent flyers, that’s the difference between a gadget you need to babysit and one you can forget about until the next trip.</p>



<p>But what really makes this adapter flexible is its two‑in‑one design: In TX or transmit mode, it streams audio from non-Bluetooth devices such as airline seats, TVs, or older gaming consoles, directly to wireless headphones. In RX or receive mode, meanwhile, the device does the opposite, turning wired speakers or car stereos into Bluetooth receivers. You can stream music from your phone to your old home speakers or plug it into a car AUX port for instant wireless audio playback.</p>
<p>Even better, the Ugreen transmitter is able to <strong>pair with two pairs of headphones simultaneously</strong>. So if you’re traveling with a friend or partner, both of you can watch the same movie from the plane’s screen without bothering to split a pair of wired earbuds. It’s a simple feature, but one that genuinely makes those long flights more enjoyable. The built‑in microphone is another nice touch – if you’re using it in receiver mode with your phone, you can answer calls hands‑free without disconnecting.</p>
<p>At this price, it’s hard to think of another gadget that adds this much comfort to travel and everyday listening. The build quality is solid, the functionality is well thought out, and it covers so many small annoyances that accumulate over time. It’s the kind of item that costs very little yet quietly changes how you travel and listen. And considering this $18 deal is the lowest it’s ever gone on Amazon, it might be one of those rare impulse buys that pays off immediately.</p>

              <p>The ultimate luxury for anyone juggling big files&nbsp;: <strong>SSDs are faster, quieter, and far more reliable than the old-school hard drives</strong> we all grew up with. Of course, that performance usually comes with a pretty steep price. But not today: Samsung <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/">just dropped its sleek T9 Portable SSD 4TB to a new all‑time low of $299, down from $399 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed and Stability</h2>
<p>And that’s exactly what tech enthusiasts like most about SSDs: the speed. The T9 doesn’t just deliver: it dominates <strong>with sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s</strong>. That means heavy 4K videos, raw photos, or huge design projects pop up in seconds instead of minutes. For creators, gamers, and students managing several devices, it’s a serious timesaver without the dreaded transfer delays. Better yet, those speeds stay constant during long tasks-no throttling midway through some big job.</p>



<p>Inside, Samsung marries its <strong>trusted V‑NAND flash memory with a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 interface</strong> to ensure top performance on modern hardware setups. And unlike older drives that overheat under pressure, <strong>the T9 stays really cool</strong> thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guard. It automatically regulates temperature to prevent overheating, keeping everything stable even during hours of high‑intensity use.</p>



<p>Durability is another area where Samsung didn’t cut corners: The <strong>T9 has a rugged, textured casing</strong> that helps withstand drops and scratches, making it safe to toss into a laptop bag or camera kit. It’s built for travel, jammed workdays, and unpredictable coffee-shop setups. The design is practical yet premium, with rounded corners and a matte black finish that feels as polished as the tech inside.</p>
<p>Compatibility, meanwhile, couldn’t be easier. The <strong>T9 connects easily to Windows PCs, Macs, game consoles</strong> and even newer smartphones like the iPhone 17 Pro, which now supports direct 4K ProRes video capture directly to the drive. For content creators shooting high‑resolution footage, that alone can justify the purchase. That means no more running out of internal storage mid‑recording and no more waiting for files to move before editing begins.</p>
<p>Making long‑term ownership even smoother is the inclusion of Samsung’s <em>Magician Software</em> suite: It automatically handles firmware updates, security management, and health monitoring in the background, so that performance stays optimal without requiring manual tinkering. Encryption options keep sensitive documents protected if the drive is lost or stolen, while regular checks help to prevent data degradation over time.</p>



<p>And it’s even more exciting because<strong> Samsung is the number-one flash memory brand in the world</strong>. But still, the main reason this model gets attention right now is the price dro: Seeing a 4TB drive of this quality dip below the $300 mark is borderline unheard of. It essentially makes high‑speed, professional grade storage accessible to regular consumers.</p>

              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger is a $19 single-port affair that doesn’t include any cables in the box. Anker’s solution flips that equation entirely, with two chargers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">sporting dual-ports apiece, plus two included USB-C cables, all for just $12 on Amazon right now</a>. That’s down from the regular $18 price and an all-time low for this bundle. You’re essentially getting five times the charging capability for less than what Apple charges for their basic single-port adapter, and you won’t need to hunt down cables separately since Anker includes <strong>two 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> in the package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dual-Port Flexibility Changes Your Charging Setup</h2>
<p>Each charger <strong>has both a USB-C and a USB-A port,</strong> each of which works simultaneously, enabling you to charge two devices from a single wall outlet. The maximum output of 20W is intelligently split when you charge two devices simultaneously, though when charging just one device through the USB-C port, you get the full 20W for fast charging speeds. This dual-port design is very convenient, especially for traveling when hotel rooms never seem to have enough outlets, or when everyone in your family has a different device that they need to charge in the same area.</p>



<p>This means the 20W of power delivery through <strong>USB-C charges an iPhone from zero to 50 percent in roughly 30 minutes</strong> – just like Apple’s own fast chargers-and it works across iPhone 15, 16 and 17 series models, iPad Pro, and other USB-C devices that support Power Delivery protocol. For comparison, it would take older 5W chargers, which used to ship with iPhones, nearly two hours to reach that same 50 percent charge level.</p>



<p>Anker designed these chargers with compact form factors that <strong>keep them from blocking adjacent outlets on power strips or wall plates</strong>. The foldable prongs on the US version further make them more travel-friendly by removing the sharp edges that can snag on clothing or scratch other items in your bag. About the size of Apple’s standard charger, these easily slip into a laptop bag, purse, or jacket pocket without adding bulk.</p>
<p>The included safety features address common charging concerns through Anker’s proprietary protection system. Overvoltage protection prevents power surges or inconsistent electrical supplies from causing any damage and thus is important during international travels or when one has to use the electrical systems of older buildings. Monitoring temperature control means this charger will not overheat during a long session and can throttle power output in case temperatures rise above safe thresholds. Short-circuit protection provides protection against wiring faults that may otherwise damage connected devices.</p>
<p>Those <strong>two included 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables add a considerable value</strong> as quality USB-C cables usually cost $10-$15 each if you buy them separately. This 5-foot length is long enough to use your device comfortably while charging, unlike those frustratingly short 3-foot cables that make you sit right next to the outlet. These cables support the full 20W power delivery which means you are not bottlenecking the charging speed through some inferior cable.</p>
<p>That comes to $6 per complete charging setup when you buy two dual-port chargers plus two cables for $12, which is less than a third of what Apple asks for its base single-port adapter before cables. It gets even better because, with Apple, you would have to purchase the cables separately which will easily push the price tag north of $25 per charging setup if you were buying from Apple.</p>
