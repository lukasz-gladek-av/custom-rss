              <p>Keeping the floors clean with pets constantly shedding or kids bringing in dirt is a never-ending chore that consumes precious free time. The <strong>Roborock Q7 Max+</strong> tackles this daily struggle head-on, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">and it’s currently hitting an all-time low of just $219 on Amazon, slashed from its original $429 price</a>. This is the most affordable entry point into Roborock’s premium robot vacuum lineup and it <strong>still includes the self-emptying docking station</strong> that higher-end models boast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Premium Features at an Entry-Level Price</h2>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction power</strong> puts this vacuum in serious performance territory, generating enough force to pull embedded pet hair from carpet fibers and lift stubborn debris from hard floors in a single pass. That suction strength matters greatly when you have to deal with the fine dust that settles into textured surfaces or the heavier particles that accumulate along baseboards and in corners. The<strong> edge-cleaning design</strong> ensures the vacuum captures debris right up to walls and furniture legs, eliminating those frustrating dust lines that cheaper robots leave behind.</p>



<p>The<strong> dual anti-tangle system</strong> solves one of the most frustrating problems with robot vacuums: the constant need to stop and cut hair wrapped around brushes. The main brush on the <em>JawScraper</em> features a design that actively resists hair entanglement, while the side brush boasts a 0% hair-tangling rate even with long-haired pets or family members who shed constantly. This engineering improvement translates into fewer maintenance interruptions and more consistent cleaning performance. You can go several weeks without having to flip the robot over and go through the annoying process of cutting hair free from brush rollers.</p>



<p>Th<strong>e RockDock Plus self-emptying station elevates this vacuum from a good deal to an exceptional one</strong>. With a 2.7-liter sealed dust bag that holds up to seven weeks of dirt, pet hair, and other debris, you empty the system roughly twice a quarter, not after every cleaning session. The sealed bag does not allow dust to escape when finally needing to replace the bag so allergy sufferers are protected from the collected allergens being reintroduced into the air.</p>
<p>The integrated vacuum and mopping function covers the complete floor cleaning equation in one device: After it vacuums up dry debris, <strong>the mop functionality follows through with the ability to take on stuck-on spills and paw prints</strong>. Three adjustable water flow settings let you adjust the amount of moisture based on your floor type and just how dirty they’ve gotten-from light dampening during daily maintenance to heavier flow for deeper cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>LiDAR navigation accurately maps your home which is a far cry from what can be achieved with budget robots relying on simple bump sensors. The laser-based mapping creates a detailed floor plan that the robot then uses to calculate the most efficient cleaning path, covering every accessible area without redundant passes or missed spots. Real-time mapping updates when the robot discovers new obstacles or you have rearranged furniture, thus adapting to the changes in your home layout automatically.</p>
<p>For $219, this Roborock Q7 Max+ brings flagship features to midrange pricing and opens premium automated cleaning to households that may otherwise find these systems too expensive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony has announced its next State of Play showcase, spotlighting upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pc-cross-buy-leak-sony-handheld-ps6-2000641324"><span>PlayStation 5 games</span></a><span>. However, this one will be a little bit different when it premieres tomorrow, as it will specifically highlight games from Japanese developers, and thus will only be streamed in Japanese with English subtitles.</span></p>

 <p><span>The State of Play Japan stream will take place tomorrow, November 11, at 2 p.m. PT /&nbsp; 5 p.m. ET /&nbsp; 11 p.m. CEST, and will be hosted by Japanese voice actor Yuki Kaji, known for his roles in the </span><i><span>Ys</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>series overseas. According to a post on the </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/"><span>PlayStation Blog</span></a><span>, the 40-minute show will focus on games from developers in Japan, as well as Asian studios more broadly, and will have a spread of both “beloved series” and independent projects. Sometimes, when companies put on streams like a State of Play or a Nintendo Direct, Japan will get a different version than the one we see in English-speaking territories, but it sounds like this show will be the same across Japanese and English streams. The show will be featured on PlayStation’s YouTube channel.</span></p>

 <p><span>The blog doesn’t get into any specifics about what games will be shown, but Kaji hosting does make me wonder if we might hear more about the next </span><i><span>Ys</span></i><span> game. </span><i><span>Ys X: Proud Nordics</span></i><span>, an enhanced port of the original </span><i><span>Ys X</span></i><span>, was released earlier this year on Switch 2, so perhaps it might come to the PS5 when it launches in English next year. Or maybe a new </span><i><span>Ys </span></i><span>could be on its way? But that’s just me speculating.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, based on the show’s premise, we might not hear much from PlayStation’s internal studios because most of its first-party dev teams are based outside of Japan these days ever since Sony shuttered Japan Studio. Team Asobi operates out of Tokyo, but given that it just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a><span> last year, it’s probably too early for that team to deliver anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego%E2%80%99s-statue-of-liberty-1-635-piece-set-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-sells-tons-at-this-record-low-price.1348606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Few ideals are more powerful to the collective of humanity than freedom and there are few symbols more representative of that concept than Lady Liberty standing tall in New York Harbor. <strong>LEGO Architecture Statue of Liberty Set #21042</strong> brings this iconic monument into your home, pieced together from an astounding 1,635 pieces, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5416/">and now is available for only $80 on Amazon, down from its regular $119 price</a>. This is the lowest price this set has ever reached and for this reason alone, it’s a great opportunity to own a piece of American history in buildable form.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5416/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>More Than Just a Monument</h2>
<p>The level of detail LEGO packed into this 1,635-piece set goes way beyond what you’d expect from a normal building kit. The <strong>flowing robe features intricate folds and textures that catch the movement of fabric frozen in copper</strong>, while the detailed pedestal includes accurate shield designs, brick detailing patterns, and columned balconies that mirror the real monument’s neoclassical architecture. The seven-ray crown sits atop Liberty’s head, with each ray individually constructed to represent the seven continents and seven seas. The <strong>upraised arm holds the golden torch</strong> that has guided ships into New York Harbor for over a century, and the iconic tablet inscribed with the date of American independence rests in her left hand.</p>



<p>The sand-green and beige color scheme is really special as it authentically represents the patina that developed on the statue’s copper exterior over decades of exposure to the elements. When France gifted the statue to the United States in 1886, it shone bright with the vibrant copper tone of a new penny. The chemical reaction between copper and salt air in the sea slowly worked to transform the surface into the distinctive blue-green hue we recognize today. LEGO replicated this with perfection, and gives the model a historical accuracy that makes it not just a toy but something worth collecting.</p>



<p>The building experience itself provides hours of engaging activity that appeals to both teens and adults. Coming in at 1,635 pieces, this set offers true complexity without becoming overwhelming and strikes that perfect balance where you’re challenged but never frustrated. The construction techniques Lego used to recreate the statue’s curves and architectural details teach valuable lessons about how angles, specialized pieces, and creative stacking can produce organic shapes from rectangular blocks.</p>
<p>When complete, the model becomes a remarkable display piece that draws the eye in any room. <strong>Standing over 17 inches tall including the pedestal</strong>, the finished statue offers visual impact that simply cannot be matched by other, smaller Lego sets. The decorative nameplate included adds a museum-quality touch that frames the model as a serious architectural reproduction rather than a simple toy. The display works equally well on a desk in a home office, on a living room bookshelf, or on a bedroom dresser, starting conversations with visitors who can appreciate the craftsmanship involved.</p>
<p>At $80, this set is a great value considering piece count, display impact, and historical significance. The 33% discount off the standard $119 price represents real savings on a set that will remain desirable long after you are done building it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple unveiled its latest Watch Series 11 in September this year, and while we’re not expecting discounts on the new version anytime soon, you can grab the previous generation model, which still packs a serious punch for less right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5410/">Currently, Amazon has the Apple Watch Series 10 (GPS, 42mm) with a Jet Black Aluminum Case and Black Sport Band going for $280, which is 30% off its original price.</a> Several other color options are discounted too, but this Jet Black version is currently the lowest-priced one available. This watch covers all the essentials, and Apple also throws in three months of Apple Fitness+ to get you started on your journey. If you’ve been holding out for a deal on an efficient Apple smartwatch, now is the time to make a move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5410/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>A Solid Combination of Health and Fitness Features</h2>
<p>The Series 10 comes with a 30% larger screen area compared to older models, but it’s also lighter and thinner, which makes it easy to wear the entire day. It measures all the ways you move with the Activity Rings, and lets you track a range of workouts while also providing advanced metrics. Those into water sports will appreciate the built-in depth and water temperature sensors, along with 50m water resistance. Take it to the pool or dive deep in the ocean without a worry.</p>
<p>Health-wise, you get access to the ECG app, Blood Oxygen monitoring, high and low heart rate alerts, and Cycle Tracking with ovulation estimates. It can even monitor how well you rest at night, as well as detect sleep apnea with the Vitals app. You’ll also enjoy key safety features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and Emergency SOS, which can be a lifesaver in unfortunate circumstances.</p>



<p>When you have it connected to your phone, you won’t need to pull your iPhone out to check notifications, control music, or take calls. The watch lets you do all of that and more right from your wrist. Even better, you can unlock your MacBook, plus get directions to your iPhone with Precision Finding if it ever gets misplaced.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as strong, and you can expect the watch to hit 80% in just 30 minutes when it’s running low.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5410/"> On most days, the Apple Watch Series 10 would set you back about $400, but this deal knocks a solid chunk off the price</a>. You can treat yourself to one for less than $300 if you act fast.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wake-of-the-water-takes-steam-supergame-enshrouded-to-incredible-new-depths-and-levels.1348543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Every search for life begins with a search for water, and while <em>Enshrouded</em> has certainly been lively since its January 2024 launch, its new aquatic update is about to take it to entirely new levels of mindblowing gameplay.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/"><em>Wake of the Water</em></a>, the biggest update yet to the enormously popular Steam survival RPG, adds so much depth and so many new elements and features that even seasoned <em>Enshrouded</em> players will feel like they’re playing an entirely new game.</p>


<p>Rivers flowing and waterfalls surging with dynamic voxel water are the newest features in the realm of Embervale, and they aren’t just pretty backgrounds. The new water biome is dynamic and completely interactive – swim, collect it, use it to grow food and to terraform the world around you. But, be alert — with this new aquatic element comes new amphibious enemies that you must defeat, or perish while trying.</p>
<h2>An Incredible Detailed Layer</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/">As you explore the new world that&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water</em> brings to&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em></a>, you’ll quickly learn to become one with the water. Swimming and diving will be new skills to master, long with using your grappling hooks underwater. Beneath the surface lie chests to open and plants to harvest, while back on land you’ll learn how to enhance your base with water dispensers, rain barrels, and hydro-powered mills to process food or forge new materials.</p>
<p>When you discover the new Veilwater Basin biome, you’ll be sucked in for hours of incredible exploration. Hidden ruins, valuable gold ore and aquamarine to mine, capybaras and wildbeast crabs to observe, and settlements that strange lizard people call home will be revealed. But so will the Drak, a dangerous new amphibious enemy that claims the Veilwater Basin as their own and will be all too eager to lure you into battle in the water, where their amphibious nature gives them a huge advantage that you’ll need to adjust to quickly or be defeated.</p>

<figure id="attachment_2000642187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642187"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642187">© Enshrouded Wake of the Water</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Learn New Survival Skills</h2>
<p>Although the new depths of <em>Wake of the Water</em> present new challenges and danger in the form of the Drak, they are also a new source of sustenance — provided you’re able to master the rod and reel. As you encounter a new survivor selling gear and bait, soon you’ll progress through five different fishing rods and a variety of bait, including worms, moths. fireflies, and frogs. Your prizes come in the form of three common tiers of fish and 5 epic tiers, and as your talent in these mini-games grows, so do your rewards: loot bags, legendary weapons, trophies, and more. The fish themselves can be turned into meals that improve your stamina, mana, and your diving time and ability.</p>
<h2>Prepare for Battle</h2>
<p>Lest you think&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water</em> is a peaceful and relaxing update to&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em> where you just hang out and fish all day, you’ll quickly find that the combat aspect of the game is turned up significantly. There are over 60 new weapons, most notably an entire new class of weapons called greatswords. Seven new armor sets and over 10 new fighting skills are unveiled in&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The combat overhaul with this update also rebalances the fighting statistics — elemental weapons now always inflict elemental damage, gem slots are increased in importance, and the fighting user interface has been overhauled and improved. You’ll need to obtain and master these new weapons and skills quickly, because the danger from the Drak and other enemies is an ever-present peril in this new world.</p>

<h2>A Great Game Redefined</h2>
<p>Gamers know that an “update” can mean anything from a virtually undetectable patch to a complete teardown and rebuild that can either make a middling game incredible or ruin a favorite game for good. <em>Wake of the Water</em> is the rare update that takes an already great game and adds elements and layers and features that create immersive new experiences while keeping in place the features that drew you to it in the first place.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000642188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642188"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642188">© Enshrouded Wake of the Water</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/">The November 10 drop of <em>Wake of the Water</em></a> fully redefines how you’ll play&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, with features like fully submerged bases, new skills like swimming and fishing, and lethal new enemies and the all-new weapons you use against them. It’s an exciting new era of&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, leading into 2026 when the game makes the jump from Steam and PC Early Access to a console and PC launch in 1.0. The possibilities are endless as the realm of Embervale is transformed by the engrossing aquatic elements of <em>Wake of the Water</em>.</p>
