              <p><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> is the best-selling game ever, so it’s naturally <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">inspired dozens of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft </em>clones </a></span><span>and similar-looking, voxel-based crafting sims over the past 15 or so years. Many have survived without any complaint from Microsoft. But earlier this week, an upcoming Steam game called <i>Allumeria</i> was briefly taken down over a single screenshot</span><span>.</span></p> <p><span>On Tuesday, the developer behind the </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-looking, dungeon-raiding sandbox </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/unomelon.bsky.social/post/3meiiaowb7c2c"><span>announced</span></a><span> that their game had been taken down from Valve’s storefront due to a DMCA copyright notice issued by Microsoft. The notice, shared by developer Unomelon in the game’s Discord server, accused </span><i><span>Allumeria</span></i><span> of using “</span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> content, including but not limited to gameplay and assets.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The takedown was apparently issued over one specific screenshot from the game’s Steam page. It shows a vaguely </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-esque world with birch trees, tall grass, a blue sky, and pumpkins: all things that are in </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> but also in real life and lots of other games. The game </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>look pretty similar to </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>, but it doesn’t appear to be reusing any of its actual assets or crossing some arbitrary line between homage and copycat that dozens of other </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-inspired games haven’t crossed before.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3/app.bsky.feed.post/3meiiaowb7c2c" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihzaqogg3lmmgtadc4wy5nvetzo3e5xez6vjdfyombnnj7wrtqt6i"> <p lang="en">Hey everyone. The Allumeria Steam page is currently down because Microsoft has filed a false DMCA claim on it. They sent an email earlier today claiming that this screenshot infringes on their copyright. I am taking a moment to figure out what my path is going forward, will update soon. #gamedev</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3?ref_src=embed">Unomelon (@unomelon.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3/post/3meiiaowb7c2c?ref_src=embed">2026-02-10T07:53:32.655Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>A look at the game’s Steam page</span><span> shows a pretty charming crafting sim that makes clear attempts to differentiate itself from </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>: its trailer, screenshots, and description all emphasize a focus on boss fights, loot, an in-depth cave system, and more customizable decorations. It’s also surprising that <em>Allumeria</em> was hit when the recently released</span><span>&nbsp;</span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, which literally grew out of a <em>Minecraft</em> server and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-minecraft-hypixel-crafting-workbench-quests-2000660135">looks like a super polished texture pack</a></span><span>, has been allowed to thrive seemingly without issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>Letting AI automate takedown claims</h2> <p><span>Developer Unomelon told me via Discord that the claim was issued via </span><a href="http://tracer.ai/"><span>Tracer.AI</span></a><span>, an AI platform used to automatically detect and remove copyright infringements. Microsoft and Mojang have previously used the platform to take down other voxel games, like a Roblox tech demo </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RTFpl0tLGc"><span>whose developer later spoke out about the takedown</span></a><span>, as well as </span><a href="https://youtu.be/psxiC2hewKI?si=pqMxF9SVBytAhB_j"><span>YouTube videos about </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> itself</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While it’s unclear if the claim was issued automatically or intentionally, Mojang Chief Creative Officer Jens Bergensten (known to most </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> players as Jeb) </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jebox.bsky.social/post/3mejmlz7nss2h"><span>responded to a comment about the takedown on Bluesky</span></a><span>, stating that he was not aware and is now “investigating.” Roughly 12 hours later,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><i><span>Allumeria</span></i><span>‘s Steam page has been </span><span>reinstated.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3/app.bsky.feed.post/3mekpz2kras2t" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidmp4sbkfhg3ssdjoiujhkpm4o2hpg3uxujwlra4if7gnsx3s74oa"> <p lang="en">Microsoft has withdrawn their DMCA claim! The game is back up on Steam! Allumeria is back! Thank you EVERYONE for your support. It's hard to comprehend that a single post in my discord would lead to so many people expressing support. Thank you &lt;3 #gamedev #indiedev</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3?ref_src=embed">Unomelon (@unomelon.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3/post/3mekpz2kras2t?ref_src=embed">2026-02-11T05:17:45.843Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>“Microsoft has withdrawn their DMCA claim!” <span>Unomelon <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/unomelon.bsky.social/post/3mekpz2kras2t">posted earlier today</a>. “</span>The game is back up on Steam! <em>Allumeria</em> is back! Thank you EVERYONE for your support. It’s hard to comprehend that a single post in my discord would lead to so many people expressing support.”</p>

 <p>Despite the fix, a demo for the game is running into some licensing issues as players try to download it, though that’s a better outcome than trying to counter-claim the DMCA during the February 2026 Steam Next Fest which <span>Unomelon was preparing the game for.&nbsp;</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“[The takedown] may help boost the game’s popularity but it also comes with significant risk,” they told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Filing a counter claim opens me up to a lawsuit which could be potentially devastating. So even if everything works out, I would still rather the DMCA takedown never have happened in the first place.”</span></p> <p><span>Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p><span>As rumors </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-dlc-zerrikania-expansion-rumor-2000658222"><span>continue to swirl</span></a><span> about the possibility of a new mystery DLC for </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span>, modders have </span><span>beaten CD Projekt RED to the punch with a new fan-made Ciri story quest. It’s even set in the same region as </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>: the mountainous kingdom of Kovir and Poviss. “We got </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> before</span><i><span> The Witcher 4,” </span></i><span>as one Nexus Mods user puts it.</span></p> <p>As fans wait for news of CD Projekt Red’s next open-world RPG, <span>modder Alexander Fandera-Maslov was able to finish the unofficial </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> tie-in project called </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11831?tab=description"><i><span>Dawn over Kovir</span></i></a> (via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-extra-dlc-chat-lingers-the-witcher-3-gets-a-witcher-4-inspired-quest-mod-designed-to-give-you-a-taste-of-ciris-adventures-in-kovir"><em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em></a>). The <span>mod was “inspired by </span><i><span>The Witcher 4’s</span></i><span> Cinematic Reveal Trailer” and thus puts players into the shoes of Geralt’s surrogate daughter as she embarks on her own world-weary monster-hunting journey.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>According to Fandera, the mod will take roughly “between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours to complete,” and tasks players with a new custom-made quest in the mountainous Northern kingdom full of mines. </span><i><span>Dawn over Kovir</span></i><span> doesn’t feature English voice acting, but English subtitles are available. Fandera says that an upcoming 1.0 update “will refine animations and gameplay components, and add voice acting.” Hopefully it doesn’t use generative AI to make that happen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It could be a nice distraction to tide fans over until CD Projekt Red releases something new in the world of <em>The Witcher</em>. </span><span>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski claimed on January 7 via </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a> <span>that he is “100 percent certain CDPR will release significant new content this year” in order to close the gap in its current sales incentive program. Speculation based on those claims and other alleged leads have suggested that a DLC, if it ends up existing, could serve as a sort of bridge between the events of the last game and </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p>That game doesn’t sound set to come out for <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310">another year or two at the earliest</a>. Meanwhile, CD Projekt Red is currently working on bringing mods to the console versions of<em> The Witcher 3</em>. Even if the alleged mystery DLC doesn’t turn out to be real, players will still be able to give <em>Dawn over Kovir</em> a try for themselves on console soon enough.</p>
