However, multiplayer spin-off <em>Nightreign</em> features fixed character classes and progress that resets after every run, so you won’t be finding any sick armor to wear in this one. Instead, you’ll need to purchase and change full outfits for each character if you want to look different. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,195755" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h706521"><a id=""></a>How to change outfits in <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em></h2><p><strong>To change your outfit in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>,</strong> <strong>you’ll first need to complete two full expeditions</strong>. This could take quite a few hours, depending on your skill level, luck, and access to a decent group. This is a brutally challenging game, after all, so nothing comes quickly. Give it time.</p><p>After completing two full expeditions of your choosing, you’ll unlock the “Change Garb” feature in your menu, which you can select to instantly access the outfit-changing menu. However, you can also manually access a mirror on the east side of the Roundtable Hold to access the same menu—though that generally sounds like a bit of unnecessary work.</p><figure id="" data-id="bfbdf7916ead28a0b206b02bd35f8709" data-recommend-id="image://bfbdf7916ead28a0b206b02bd35f8709" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player chooses an option to change their outfit in the menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player chooses an option to change their outfit in the menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bfbdf7916ead28a0b206b02bd35f8709" data-recommend-id="image://bfbdf7916ead28a0b206b02bd35f8709" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player chooses an option to change their outfit in the menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you first unlock the ability to change garbs, you’ll find that you only have access to a total of three outfits per character. You’ll have the default skin automatically, of course, and you can purchase two additional skins, Dawn and Darkness, for each character using Murk (currency).</p><p>If you don’t like either of the extra outfits available in the beginning, don’t worry about it. You can purchase additional outfits much later in the game, so keep at it. It’s an ultra-hard game, but practice makes perfect. </p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This one is an ice dragon that specializes in AOE attacks, which can be annoying. However, there’s a special in-game event that could help you out immensely if you’re lucky.</p><h2 id="h1475116"><a id="1"></a>Preparation</h2><p>Being made of ice, Caligo’s weakness is fire, so it’s important to find a fire elemental weapon during your expedition. Just look for structures on the map with the fire icon and defeat the bosses there for a chance at earning a corresponding elemental weapon..</p><p>If the Mountaintop Shifting Earth event is active, trekking up the mountain to get the bonus at the end is worth it. Shifting Earth events are random occurrences in the game that will change a part of Limveld’s map. </p><p>If you reach the top of Mountaintop, you’ll earn a passive buff that will greatly increase your frost resistance as well as increase your damage against dragons. Since we’re going up against an ice dragon, Mountaintop is definitely worth tackling on Day Two where you’ll have more of a fighting chance against the monsters there.</p><p>Ranged classes like Ironeye are helpful too as you can aim for Caligo’s head.</p><h2 id="h1475117"><a id="2"></a>Strategies for fighting Caligo</h2><figure id="" data-id="225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-recommend-id="image://225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-recommend-id="image://225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caligo is gigantic, even by Nightlord standards. As such, it doesn’t move nearly as often as others and that can make for an easy target. It’ll typically swipe with its claws, but that attack is easily telegraphed and dodged by rolling forward.</p><p>Caligo will start incorporating ice into its attacks, such as its freezing breath. This attack spreads out in a cone, so be sure to dodge roll <em>behind </em>Caligo. There is another breath attack where Caligo will stand on its hind legs and breathe fog directly down in front of it. The same strategy as before applies here—get behind Caligo. This attack can also form icicles on the ground that will inflict damage and build up frostbite should you touch them. Avoid these.</p><figure id="" data-id="2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-recommend-id="image://2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-recommend-id="image://2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Eventually, Caligo will cover the entire screen with fog. You’ll also sometimes see a gust of black wind heading in a specific direction at the same time. Follow it until you find a pillar of ice to hide behind. This will shield you from Caligo’s upcoming huge ice wave attack. </p><figure id="" data-id="6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-recommend-id="image://6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-recommend-id="image://6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a variation of this attack, Caligo will summon a gigantic sheet of ice to come crashing down into the ground. The sound of ice cracking signals this attack. Unfortunately, right now it seems like the only way to avoid this attack is to run as fast as you can away from the noise and pray that you’re out of the ice sheet’s range before the fog lifts and the sheet comes crashing down.</p><figure id="" data-id="01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-recommend-id="image://01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-recommend-id="image://01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caligo will also fly around and summon meteors to hit you. This is the most mobile it’ll be through the entire fight. Fortunately, this move is rather rare and easier to dodge than Caligo’s other ones.</p><p>Arguably, Caligo is a more annoying boss battle than it is a hard one, especially due to how much space its attacks cover. Timing your expedition with the Mountaintop event will make the fight significantly easier, so make sure you get every advantage you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
