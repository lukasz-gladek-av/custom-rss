              <p>Here’s something that doesn’t happen often: a LEGO Harry Potter set on sale. These sets are among the most popular in the entire LEGO catalog and discounts are rare. When you find one with stellar reviews like this <strong>Hagrid’s Hut set</strong> (which boasts an impressive 4.9 out of 5 stars), it’s even more unusual.</p>
<p>Right now, during the final hours of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/">this popular set has dropped to $41 on Amazon, down from $74 (44% off) which marks an all-time low price</a>. This<strong> deal is exclusively for Prime members</strong>, and there’s no guarantee it’ll return before the holidays roll around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Hagrid’s Hut is one of the most emotive locations in the Wizarding World, the site of Harry’s initial revelations about his magical parentage and the setting of many indelible scenes across the series. For collectors and fans, recreating these scenes is one way that the magic can be brought home in tangible form. This is a masterful capture of the barely-tamed feel of Hagrid’s mountain hut with incredible attention to every little detail.</p>
<h2>Seven Characters and a Dragon Bring the Scene to Life</h2>
<p>The real magic is the character list. You get the complete roster of <strong>seven characters: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Rubeus Hagrid as mini-figures</strong>, plus LEGO interpretations of Norbert,<strong> the baby dragon, and Fang, the loyal boarhound of Hagrid</strong>. With these, kids can reproduce the iconic scene in The Philosopher’s Stone when Harry and his pals discover Hagrid openly incubating a dragon’s egg in secret.</p>



<p>The hut itself is a happy size for play and has beautifully considered design elements that make the building experience all the more fun. It’s easy to access the inside without becoming frustrated <strong>thanks to the removable roof</strong> and the building opens wide to show the detailed interior. Hagrid’s trademark oversized furniture consists of his foldout chair that are beautifully proportioned to his half-giant frame. There is an umbrella stand on which his noted pink umbrella (which actually contains his broken wand) would sit, and the key dragon egg element waits to crack open. <strong>Fang’s doghouse sits separate</strong>&nbsp;and provides depth to the scene as well as the possibility of play scenarios outdoors.</p>



<p>One particularly nice touch is the random inclusion of <strong>two gold-plated portrait elements</strong>: They are among a group of 14 collectible Hogwarts portraits that extend across multiple LEGO Harry Potter sets.</p>
<p>The <strong>collection is made up of 465 pieces</strong> and offers multiple hours of fun building time suitable for children aged 8 and above. Complexity falls just in that golden zone between challenging enough that it is rewarding without being tough enough that little builders get stuck.</p>
<p>At this all-time low price, you’re getting incredible value. Those seven characters, two buildings, and the collectible portrait pieces individually would easily merit the whole $74 price. For parents searching for a Halloween special, birthday, or early holiday gift, the deal is the best chance this year to acquire this specific set without breaking the budget.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, Nintendo released an animated short called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-animated-close-to-you-mario-pikmin-theory-2000632576"><span>“Close to You”</span></a><span> on its YouTube and social media channels. The video was posted with no context, no description, and even its comments were turned off, so no one could speculate about its meaning in the comments. Today, Nintendo uploaded an updated version of the short on the Nintendo Today app that sheds some light on the mystery by revealing Pikmin, the titular little plant-like creatures from Nintendo’s strategy game series, were behind the original video’s shenanigans all along.</span></p> <p><span>Some fans clocked this yesterday, as the video had some </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>musical motifs in its score, and it looked like one of these plant guys was carrying items in the background of one shot. But there was also a fair bit of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-shared-a-4-minute-pixar-like-animated-short-with-no-explanation-2000632524"><span>speculation that it could have been a clip from the upcoming </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a><span>, depicting what could have been a baby Rosalina taking her first steps. But now we know for sure, because the updated video shows all the weird floating items in the baby’s room were actually being moved by Pikmin the whole time. The video hasn’t been uploaded outside of the Nintendo Today app at the moment, but the updated version is almost exactly the same, but it’s like someone flipped a switch and enabled a whole other layer in the rendering process, showing dozens of Pikmin crawling around the baby’s room. We’ll update this story when the video is uploaded on YouTube or any platform we can actually embed.</span></p> <p><span>The question remains, however: what is this teasing? Is it a new </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>game? A movie? The return of the </span><a href="https://pikmin.nintendo.com/en/short-movies/"><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>short movies</span></a><span>? Maybe we’ll find out more tomorrow if a third version drops? Or maybe it’s just a fun one-off thing some animators wanted to put together? Whatever the case, it’s a cute short. I hope to be able to watch it on something other than my phone before the day’s end.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-is-going-all-in-its-iconic-hair-dryer-is-now-selling-for-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000633160</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-is-going-all-in-its-iconic-hair-dryer-is-now-selling-for-a-new-record-low-on-amazon.1319665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hair dryers have existed for decades without meaningful innovation, essentially just blowing hot air at varying intensities until your hair eventually dries. Dyson revolutionized this category by applying aerospace engineering principles to airflow dynamics, and created a dryer that uses intelligent heat control and concentrated air velocity rather than extreme temperatures to dry hair faster.</p>
<p>The <em>Supersonic</em> and its sibling the <em>Airwrap</em> (hair dryer and styler) never see discounts throughout the year, with price drops limited exclusively to Prime Day and Black Friday events. Right now, on the final day of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">the Supersonic Origin has hit a record low at $299, down from its standard $419 price</a>. This 29% discount represents the <strong>best pricing Prime members will see</strong> on Dyson’s hair dryer until Black Friday arrives months from now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tech that Changes the Functionality of Drying the Hair</h2>
<p>The Dyson Supersonic addresses the root issue with ordinary dryers: they use intensive heat to break down the water quickly and damage the cuticles on the hair and causing the brittle and fried quality that results from everyday heat styling. Dyson’s design is focused on the V9 digital motor, a very tiny, very powerful motor found in the handle – not the head. It <strong>rotates at as many as 110,000 rpm and creates high-velocity airflow reaching as high as 13 liters per second</strong>. This focused stream of air works through the exterior layers of the hair down into the interior to dry from the inside out, saving time that the hair is exposed to heat.</p>
<p>The air multiplier technology boosts this flow by <strong>sucking up ambient air into the stream, tripling the initial amount</strong> without the need for increased motor power. This produces a high-pressure and high-velocity stream of air that’s robust enough to instantly dry hair and stable enough to style accurately. It is quite a distinct experience compared to the typical dryers that blow out the hot air everywhere on the surface of your skull.</p>



<p>Intelligent heat control is the biggest technological break-through in the history of healthy-looking hair: A glass bead thermistor is located in the airflow stream and senses the temperature of the air every 40 times per second and reporting back to the microprocessor. Heating element output is varied continuously by the system as needed to hold the desired temperature under very tight tolerances and suppresses the temperature glitches that occur in ordinary dryers when airflow diminishes or ceases.</p>



<p>The magnetic attachments also feature a styling concentrator, producing a narrow, focused blade of air that is ideal for precise styling, such as smoothng out areas when blow-drying or making sleek styles. The diffuser gently disperses airflow all around the curls to dry them without breaking curl patterns or causing frizz. They attach magnetically and spin 360 degrees, angling airflow precisely where you want, without the uncomfortable wrist work needed on dryers with stationary attachments.</p>
<p><strong>Three speed settings and four heat settings</strong> provide flexibility for different hair types and styling needs. The cold shot button delivers unheated air to set styles or cool down after drying. Fast drying mode combines maximum airflow with high heat for thick hair that takes forever to dry, while regular drying balances speed with gentler treatment. Styling mode reduces both airflow and heat for detailed work on specific sections.</p>
<p>For just $299, you’re saving $120 on technology that seriously takes care of the health of your hair and still gives you professional-level drying. Deals like these on Prime Big Deal Day are gone after tonight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Credit-Card Sized, Our Favorite 10,000mAh 45W Power Bank Is Going for Pennies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/credit-card-sized-our-favorite-10000mah-45w-power-bank-is-going-for-pennies-2000633165</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/credit-card-sized-our-favorite-10-000mah-45w-power-bank-is-going-for-pennies.1319662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of battery in the middle of your day is one of those modern frustrations that can derail plans or leave you anxiously watching your phone percentage tick down. A portable charger solves that anxiety but most options are bulky bricks that take up valuable bag space. The <em>INIU</em> 10,000mAh power bank breaks that mold as one of the smallest portable chargers on the market and makes it easy to slip into any pocket or bag compartment. During Amazon’s <strong>Prime Big Deal Days</strong>, this model dropped to $21 on day one, but now on the final day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/">there’s an additional coupon bringing it down to $19, down from the original $29</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The true innovation is INIU’s TinyCell which is <strong>high-density battery cells that cram 10,000mAh of capability into a package that is just 30% smaller and 15% lighter than rival packages</strong> that deliver the same output. That translates to shouldering serious charging capability without the weight and mass that all too frequently accompanies high-capability power banks.</p>

<h2>Speed That Really Saves Your Day</h2>
<p>The 45W Power Delivery chip on board provides truly fast charging times. INIU can <strong>get an iPhone 17 up to 60% in a mere 25 minutes</strong>, the difference between sitting at home waiting on your phone to charge versus walking out the door with enough power left over to get the rest of your day done. That 45W output also translates to being able to support the <strong>more power-hungry devices like iPads or be able, in a pinch, to charge some laptops</strong>, putting this power bank above the abilities of typical 18W or 20W portable chargers.</p>
<p>The <strong>twin USB-C port design</strong> distinguishes this from virtually all other power banks available. Both the USB-C ports are dual-purpose as you can charge the power bank itself via either one and as a second output charge devices via either one as well. This is convenient when one is dealing with multiple USB-C device and doesn’t need separate cables that have separate uses. With the <strong>addition of the USB-A port</strong>, one ends up with three combined outputs that are able to charge the phone, the earbuds, and the smartwatch all at the same time when one is needed.</p>



<p>That <strong>10,000mAh battery is equivalent to approximately two full charges on most smartphones</strong> or one full charge on the larger phones with some juice left over. For tablets such as iPads, you can expect about 70-80% of a full charge on the model dependent. The size is balanced between being portable and useful, enough to get through prolonged airplane days or multiple days away from outlets without being too much on everyday carry.</p>
<p>INIU arrives with protection like <strong>temperature control, surge protection, and short-circuit protection</strong>, aided by their three-year warranty and lifetime tech support. Included is the USB-C to USB-C cable with lanyard, which makes it easy to clip the power bank on packs or have the power bank easily kept close at hand. At $19 after the coupon, this power bank is less expensive than two movie tickets but solves an issue you face every day.</p>
