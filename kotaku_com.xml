              <p>Video game backlogs vary wildly from person to person. Some folks have massively long lists of games they want to play. Others might only have a few that they are dedicated to crossing off. But one thing I find true across all gaming backlogs is that there’s always one game that, for whatever reason, remains stuck on the list and seems unlikely to ever be finished.</p> <p>So we at <em>Kotaku, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">in honor of our ongoing Backlog Week</a>, want to know what game or games are forever trapped in your backlog and why? Maybe its because you love it and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-how-long-to-beat-2000657800">can’t bear to watch credits roll</a>, or maybe it has an excruciating <a href="https://kotaku.com/13-bad-boss-fights-zelda-mass-effect-kingdom-hearts-1850334686">difficulty spike or story twist</a> that made you completely bounce off it.</p>

 <p>For me, I have two games that remain permanently stuck on my backlog like tiny splinters unable to be removed. The first is a more recent-ish title: <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em></p> <p>I’ve now tried on three separate occasions to start playing <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</em> And each time I get about two to three hours in and reach the moment when the game goes fully “open world,” I quickly fall off.&nbsp; There’s something about <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s city and world that just feels lifeless and dull. Walking around it doesn’t do much for me. Then I try to explore and find quests and I just get bored and stop. This annoys me a lot. There are people whose opinion I trust a lot who love<em> Cyberpunk 2077.</em> They adore it. They’ve played it more than once. And yet I can’t even get past the opening hours. Perhaps I’ll never cross this one off my list.</p>

 <p>The other game in my backlog is an old one: <em>Daggerfall</em>. I’m a big fan of the<em> Elder Scrolls</em> games, but I started with <em>Morrowind</em>. Each time I’ve tried to play <em>Daggerfall</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-daggerfall-unity-oblivion-remastered-1851779519">even the great Unity port,</a> I’m just unable to push through the ancient mechanics, menus, and design ideas. But again, I know people who love this game and find it super special. And as a big <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fan, I want to experience it. Sadly, that hasn’t happened yet, despite trying a few times in recent years.</p>

 <p>Anyway, leave your backlog games that won’t leave in the comments below, and tell us why they’re stuck forever on your list.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ex-BioWare Dev Disputes The Idea That It Shouldn’t Have Made Anthem]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s servers have been shut down</span></a><span> for a week now, marking the end of a pretty tragic chapter in developer BioWare’s history. The live-service looter shooter’s crash and burn reportedly nudged publisher EA to let the studio strip out the reported multiplayer elements from the game that would go on to become </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, which signaled to some that the studio was “returning” to its roots. However, as </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> has been dropped down into an abyss, ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah is disputing the notion that the game was </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> far out of left field for the studio.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y65eoBVF0Y"><span>YouTuber Destin Legarie</span></a><span>, Darrah talked at length about the life and death of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>, and in the closing minutes, Legarie asks if there’s anything Darrah wants to “set the record straight” on regarding the game. Darrah replies that while many people want to point fingers solely at EA for mandating that the historically single-player RPG studio shift into making an ill-advised cooperative loot shooter, it wasn’t “all their fault.” He also said that, at the time, the prospect of making </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>seemed like just the latest evolution for a studio that had evolved many times before, so he says he is less swayed by arguments stating that the company shouldn’t have even tried.</span></p>

  <p><span>“My feeling is that BioWare has always been changing,” he said. “I mean, by that argument, we should never have made </span><i><span>Neverwinter Nights</span></i><span> because we were a 2D RPG maker. We should never have made </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> because we were a tactical RPG maker, not an action RPG maker. So I don’t know that that argument holds a lot of weight for me. To me, it’s like, yeah, your studios evolve, and they try new things, and was </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> too big of a reach? Yeah, for sure. But could you tell at the time? I don’t know. I don’t know that you could.”</span></p> <p><span>In a perfect world, developers would be able to make mistakes like </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>without risking going under, but reports about </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s development indicate that it did some seismic damage to BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>internally that it’s still recovering from</span></a><span>. The company was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>downsized last year</span></a><span> as a small team works on the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game. We’ll see if it’s enough to get the studio back on track after a decade of strife.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Life Is Strange: Reunion Leaks Early, Coming Sooner Than We Thought]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-reunion-chloe-announcement-release-date-2000661323</link>
            <guid>1411138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-5-reunion-chloe-max-summary-plot-leak-2000658198">The rumors were true</a>. <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion</em> is coming, and it’s bringing Chloe Price back into the fold after 2024’s <em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>hinted at her return. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it’s coming out in just two months.</p> <p>The official announcement is <a href="https://x.com/LifeIsStrange/status/2011829955592585531?s=20">set to go live at 1 p.m. Eastern</a>, but Xbox Wire posted <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/">its announcement blog a bit early</a>.&nbsp;<em>Reunion&nbsp;</em>will star both Max Caulfield and Chloe as co-protagonists, with both having different gameplay mechanics. Max is able to rewind time as she did in the first&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, while Chloe will use her argumentative “Backtalk” mechanic from the prequel&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>.</p>

 <p>The big question is how Chloe is able to return despite her possibly dying at the end of the original&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, a choice that&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>made a point to import. Based on this line in the blog post, it seems like it may be as a result of the timeline jumping Max did in&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure</em>, though I expect the minutiae of this to be affected by which choice you made way back in 2015.</p> <blockquote><p>Chloe’s return may be due to Max’s power, in particular, the power Max gained in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>&nbsp;to Shift between parallel timelines — a power Max subsequently lost when she merged those timelines back together and recovered her ability to Rewind.</p></blockquote> <p>Whatever the case, it does seem like&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is not undoing either choice, as the blog says “Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the&nbsp;<em>past</em>&nbsp;you’ll confirm as you play, but to the&nbsp;<em>future&nbsp;</em>you’ll fight for the chance to build.” So I will hold judgement for the time being, and I won’t have to wait long, as&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27.</p>

  <p><b data-stringify-type="bold">Update: 1/20/26, 1:00 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</b>Okay, now that the actual announcement livestream is up, we know how&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> will handle both endings of the original.</p> <h2>How&nbsp;<em>Reunion&nbsp;</em>handles both&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em> endings</h2> <p>As expected, Max’s merging of the timelines at the end of&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure</em> is at the heart of Chloe’s appearance. Rhianna DeVries, who voiced the character in&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>, is reprising the role in&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em>, and the version of her we meet seems to have contradictory memories from both timelines, though where she truly originates from will seemingly be affected by the decision you made at the end of <em>Life Is Strange</em>. You can see an example of two exchanges between Max and Chloe in <em>Reunion </em>that play out differently depending on which choice you made in the original game at the 37-minute mark of the reveal stream above.</p>
