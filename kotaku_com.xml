              <p>If your regular days involve running demanding creative software or playing high-end gaming titles, an average laptop isn’t going to cut it. You need a high-performing processor that’s specifically built keeping these use cases in mind, and today is a great time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/">The ultra-powerful, 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 9950X desktop processor, which usually goes for $649, is available for $530, after a nice 18% discount.</a> It’s a straightforward $119 drop, meaning there are no long coupon codes to remember or complicated checkout steps to follow. This is the lowest it’s dropped to in the last 30 days, and we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon. Place your orders before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smooth Performance for Demanding Tasks</h2>
<p>This processor is made keeping creatives and gamers in mind. The 16 Cores and 32 processing threads are based on AMD’s Zen 5 architecture that evolves with your needs, letting you push all creative and entertainment limits without holding back. It’s packed with the power you need to level up with its 5.7 GHz Max Boost clock speed during demanding tasks, plus offers features like AMD Expo tech, one-touch memory overclocking for instant lift when it’s showtime. In simple words, the processor is more than capable of handling tasks like heavier video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming. Need even more power for a larger project? It offers that too, helping you stay on top of your game, regardless of what the day requires.</p>



<p>DDR5-5600 support lets you multitask faster, which can especially come in handy when you’re trying to manage a bunch of things at the same time. There’s PCIe 5.0 support on select motherboards just as well. This makes your system future-proof, plus lets you enjoy quicker transfer and boot times. Even better, AMD Ryzen 5 offers built-in AI acceleration and enhanced AI capabilities for unmatched productivity. For an even smoother experience, it’s best to pair the processor with the Radeon RX 7000 Series graphics card for a complete, ultra-fast setup.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a way to perform heavy-duty creative tasks like video editing and modeling more efficiently, or game like a pro, having the right processor in your setup can make all the difference. This one, in particular, offers incredible performance for all your tasks, no matter how demanding they get. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/">On a regular day, it would run you around $649, but this deal lets you grab it for $530.</a> It’s still a bit of an investment, sure, but one that’s going to be worth it. The offer is selling out fast, though. At this rate, the stock could run dry sooner than you anticipate, which is why we highly recommend grabbing yours without wasting time. Ordering now will also help you get it before Christmas; great if you’re planning to surprise a loved one with it this holiday season.</p>

              <p>Looking to game better this holiday season? The right controller can make playtime a lot more fun. If your current controller no longer feels comfortable to hold, and you’re dealing with stick drift or weak triggers, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/">We just spotted the PlayStation DualSense wireless controller in Chroma Teal going for just $60 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed 25% off its $80 price tag. Is Green not your vibe? There are several other color options going for less, too. The stunning black version, for instance, is sitting at $54 after a 28% drop, while the bold Volcanic Red color can be yours for $59, at a sweet 26% discount. There’s quite a lot to choose from, but there’s a catch. These deals are selling out fast, and the stock is likely to run out soon. If you’ve been looking to enjoy your favorite titles to the fullest during the holidays, now is the time to act.</p>

<h2>Immersive Gaming Experience</h2>
<p>It’s made to feel comfortable in the hands with an evolved design, featuring responsive sticks and a familiar layout. The integrated touch pad, accelerometer, and gyroscope come together to provide motion controls for tracking movement and rotation. In-game actions will be felt physically with dual actuators, and in select titles, these vibrations can simulate even the feeling of the digital environment for a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>There’s a built-in microphone to chat with friends during the games, record your own voice to save your reaction, plus use voice search for apps or the console’s menu. The 3.5mm jack lets you connect a headset to the console for a private listening experience, meaning you won’t have to rely on your TV speakers or face audio delays. The dedicated mute button makes it easy to switch voice capture on or off with a single push without having to go through a complicated settings menu.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, it works primarily with the PS5, but you can also connect it via Bluetooth or USB to other devices like Windows, PCs, Macs, iOS, Android, select tablets, and Apple TV. That means you don’t limit yourself to a single device. Maybe use it with the console during a solo session, and switch to a bigger screen when playing with friends!</p>
<p>All things considered, if you have been looking to play your favorite titles in a more immersive way and need a new controller without stretching your budget, now is the time to act. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/">This deal takes 25% off this responsive controller that typically goes for $80.</a> There are multiple colors available, so there are quite a lot of options to pick from. This also makes it a good time to pick a couple of options, if you’re also looking to gift one to a loved one, or just want to have a spare one lying around for when friends come over. That said, there are plenty of other tech gadgets going for less, too, so now is a great time to stock up on other essentials like laptops, chargers, and consoles if you missed grabbing something during Black Friday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bose SoundLink Max Speaker Restock Drops Cheaper Than Black Friday in a December Clearance Move]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-soundlink-max-speaker-restock-drops-cheaper-than-black-friday-in-a-december-clearance-move-2000651067</link>
            <guid>1376986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re already a week into December. The clock is ticking to secure your holiday gifts for all your friends, family, and loved ones. Luckily, even though both Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come to pass, you can still find some sweet deals still lingering. Take this Bluetooth Bose speaker for instance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6301/">The Bose SoundLink Max is normally priced at $399, but has come down to just $279 for a limited time. The 30% discount ends up saving you a whole $120.</a> This Bose speaker can deliver rich audio performance, rugged portability, and all-day battery life. Anyone can appreciate a good portable speaker, so if you’re out of ideas for what to get someone, this might just be your answer.</p>
<p>This Bose SoundLink Max Bluetooth party speaker is capable of producing big stereo sound with a deep bass that can carry your next party. You can perfectly dial in the sound exactly how you want it when using the Bose app. Control EQ settings like bass, mid-range, and treble for the best sound wherever you take the party to.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6301/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Pairing is east. Just press and hold the Bluetooth buttons until the light blinks blue, then choose the Bose SoundLink Max in your device’s Bluetooth settings and voila! The speaker can even be connected to up to two deices at once. You’ll only be able to play audio from one at a time, but two people can have their phones connected to be able to queue up music. In addition to Bluetooth, the speaker includes a built-in 3.5mm AUX input, making it easy to connect turntables, CD players, MP3 players, or any device you prefer to run wired.</p>
<p>Nothing kills the mood like a dying battery. With up to 20 hours of battery life, the SoundLink Max ensures your music lasts from sunrise gatherings to late-night sessions. And thanks to its USB-C charging port, you can even power your phone or other devices directly from the speaker. A Bluetooth speaker doesn’t do you any good if you don’t have a working source to play the tunes from. If the SoundLink Max has juice, your phone does too.</p>



<h2>Rugged Portability</h2>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">Accidents happen. Drinks spill, rain comes out of nowhere, stuff gets dropped. That’s why the SoundLink Max is built with an IP67 rating, meaning it’s waterproof and dustproof. It’s also resistant to shocks and rust. You can toss it in the sand, use it poolside, or let it ride shotgun on a rugged camping trip without worrying about damage. This is a speaker designed to thrive where others fail.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">Portability meets style with the speaker’s soft, removable climbing-rope handle. Grab it and go to the beach, a backyard hangout, a rooftop gathering, or your favorite hiking spot. You can upgrade to custom colored handles that are fun and eye-catching or a carrying strap your can throw over your shoulder.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">The Bose SoundLink Max Bluetooth speaker comes in three awesome color options. Choose between blue dusk, citrus yellow, or the classic black. All three choices are currently discounted, but the steepest price change is on the blue dusk and citrus yellow versions.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-clears-out-playstation-vr2-at-its-lowest-price-as-holiday-stock-dump-begins-while-meta-quest-stays-full-price-2000651622</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re looking for a more immersive way to play your favorite titles, where the digital world becomes your reality in every sense, you need a VR set in your setup. These not only offer better visuals, but also unique sensations based on whatever’s happening in the game, pulling you into action.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">PlayStation owners should consider grabbing the PSVR2, especially now that it’s going at a 25% discount at Amazon.</a> This brings its usual $400 price down to $299, which, while not the lowest price ever, is still not bad considering all the features the bundle comes packed with. It’s open to all shoppers, and you don’t have to worry about any delivery charges either. Just be sure to grab it quick. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for this one, but we’re not expecting it to stick around for more than a couple of days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Visuals and Sound</h2>
<p>The bundle includes the PlayStation VR2 headset and a pair of Sense controllers. The headset is comfortable to wear, featuring a rear band that sits a bit low on the back of your head for stability. Once on, the two 2000 x 2040 OLED displays push incredibly sharp and vibrant 4K HDR visuals, which are four times better than the original PSVR. There’s support for eye tracking that simulates emotional responses from the version of you in the game for a better sense of realism, especially when playing with friends. The headset is also designed to be responsive with vibrations, meaning in-game sensations can be felt like they’re happening right in your living room.</p>
<p>For instance, when cars race past, you’ll feel a burst of movement around through the headset. But of course, visuals alone can’t offer a truly immersive experience, and for that, there’s 3D audio that surrounds you and adapts to your position with head movements. Everything from whispers to footsteps, gunfire, and screams will be heard as if you’re right in the middle of the battlefield. Best of all, you can still keep an eye on what’s happening in the real world with the See-through View function.</p>



<p>As for the controllers – these offer haptic feedback for you to physically feel your in-game responses in the form of vibrations, intense pulses, and more. Finger touch detection lets you feel elements of the virtual world even when you’re not pressing any buttons, while adaptive triggers make it easy to sense the digital tension and resistance. The latter is great for feeling that bowstring pull when you’re just about to hit a bad guy, or sensing objects crumple as you crush them in your hand just before delivering an Oscar-worthy line.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to play your favorite titles in a way that makes you feel like you’re a part of the action, a VR bundle can deliver exactly that and more. This one, in particular, offers immersive, 4K visuals that show every in-game detail in a lifelike manner, plus let you feel all that’s happening in the digital world with unique sensations through the controllers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">The bundle typically retails for $400, but you can now snap it up for $299 after a sweet 25% discount.</a> Amazon won’t be this generous for long, and considering how there are no major sales lined up, it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>
