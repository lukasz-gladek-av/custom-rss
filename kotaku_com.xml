While playing with some friends, the group encountered some “rando” players. </p><p>About 3 minutes [later] a video appeared on my screen,” claimed Tado422. “I have never seen this before but it took up the whole screen. It was a Russian pop video or something that played for 20 seconds or so. Most of us were talking in chat about what the heck was happening.”</p><p>Tado422 further explained that, shortly after the first video, a second video appeared. This one showed a man entering a store and shooting people in the head. </p><p>“At this moment I freaked out and hard closed out of <em>StarCraft 2</em>. My 5 year old daughter was in the room with me, half paying attention to me playing a video game. This is beyond unacceptable. I should never have to worry about seeing people murdered or porn while playing a <em>SC2 </em>game.”</p><p>Tad0422's post blew up on Reddit and led to many other <em>SC2 </em>players sharing their stories about similar hackers injecting annoying or graphic videos while people are playing the game. I reached out to Tado422 and they shared with me a replay of the match that was hacked by someone. They also made it clear that this isn’t an issue with the Arcade map they were playing or the creator of that mode. It appears to be a larger exploit within <em>StarCraft 2</em>'s Arcade Mode. You can find others reporting similar incidents with screenshots, too. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/hackers-are-injecting-mass-shooting-videos-into-random-starcraft-2-matches/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/hackers-are-injecting-mass-shooting-videos-into-random-starcraft-2-matches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>404Media</em></a></span>, some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k3rd1y/sc2_homepage_replaced_with_nazi_imagery/?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k3rd1y/sc2_homepage_replaced_with_nazi_imagery/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players shared stories</a></span> of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/sc2/t/lobby-injection-hack/30494?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/sc2/t/lobby-injection-hack/30494?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing swastikas</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k3scsm/comment/mo4ww8g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k3scsm/comment/mo4ww8g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">while playing</a></span>.

Peni Parker and Mr. Fantastic are also better in this patch, shoring up the weaknesses in Peni’s health pool and Reed’s ultimate, respectively. </p><p>Although I always knew he was good, the recent Human Torch buffs have also turned him into a meta pick, countering powerful new characters like Emma even if he still has the same ‘cheaper townhome’ problems the rest of us do with the new and improved Iron Fist. Hulk got some love, too, which is nice, but it doesn’t bring him back into ‘hard meta’ just yet, partially because he has well-known and easy counterplay, and there are simpler or more robust, ‘just-as-powerful’ options in Thing and Emma.</p><p>Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Human Torch have also been buffed, and Hela got some tweaks to reduce her survivability slightly, which amounts to a slap on the wrist for the always-meta character. Winter Soldier also got some slight nerfs to his ultimate, and with the Rocket team-up removed he is weaker, but don’t let that fool you. Expert players will still run circles around opponents with his kit. </p><hr><p>Overall, the meta is in a good spot, with opportunities for all kinds of characters, and counterplay for almost everyone. Get out there, pick your favorite character, and make some plays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, there are some pretty standard things you can do to help improve your chances of being one of the lucky people who gets their preorder locked in before all of the online retailer checkout webpages crash. Those include:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Have each store’s Switch 2 preorder page opened simultaneously, ideally on different browser instances or, even better, different devices</li><li>Make sure you’re already logged in to your store account</li><li>Have your credit card and shipping info pre-loaded or ready to go</li><li>Be ready to start refreshing tabs at midnight until you’re queued </li><li>Try to secure a preorder from more than one store in case one of them sells more preorders than they have stock for (an issue I’ve had with Walmart in the past)</li><li>Make an offering of spicy Italian meatballs and bright yellow bananas to the gaming gods for good luck﻿</li></ol></blockquote><h2 id="h542997"><a id=""></a>Can I preorder the Switch 2 from Nintendo too?</h2><p>Like other console manufacturers, Nintendo is also selling some Switch 2 stock direct to its fans, though the process is a bit convoluted and will have people waiting until well into May. Back when the Switch 2 Direct aired on April 2, Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let players “register” their interest</a></span> in the new console with invites going out on a case-by-case basis to those who have at least 50 hours of play time and over 12 months of Switch Online, including an active membership at the time of preordering (you’ll also have to have opted into sharing your gameplay data in your Nintendo account’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy settings</a></span>). </p><p>Those who are chosen this method will get an email directly from Nintendo on or after May 8 and have just 72 hours to accept the preorder offer for whatever they selected <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back when registering</a></span>. It’s a good idea to do that too, even if you’re also getting a retail preorder, in case one of them ends up falling through, or a close friend or family member ends up missing out. </p><h2 id="h542998"><a id=""></a>Is Amazon doing Switch 2 preorders?</h2><p>Weirdly, no one knows what’s going on with Amazon and the Switch 2 right now. The online seller hasn’t announced any information about Switch 2 preorders and doesn’t even have store listings for it or the console’s first-party games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Maybe Amazon is just waiting until April 24 hits to put all of those pages live, or maybe Nintendo has cut Amazon out of the preorder process following a few years now of some weird behavior between the two companies. Either way, it’s safe to assume that you won’t be able to preorder the Switch 2 from Amazon, at least not yet, but also it’s worth double-checking on April 24.</p><h2 id="h542999"><a id=""></a>Where should I buy a Switch 2 from?</h2><p>Good question! The short answer is: wherever you manage to secure a preorder from. The somewhat more complicated answer depends on things like existing memberships and midnight launch plans. Select Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop stores will be open at midnight on June 5 so if you want to get your Switch 2 as soon as possible, you’ll want to preorder from one of those places. </p><p>Best Buy is also running a special promotion for My Best Buy Total  subscribers who can get a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/pljsgm8sovnzv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/pljsgm8sovnzv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 certificate for every $150 they spend</a></span> on games and accessories, so if you are already a member and/or are planning to load up on extra controllers or games, that might be the way to go. Alternatively, GameStop is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1k4fx8g/switch_2_trade_in_deal/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1k4fx8g/switch_2_trade_in_deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently offering</a></span> people up to $175 in store credit toward their Switch 2 purchase when they trade in their current Switch consoles (the company is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-xbox-4-20-bds-boycott-1851777098&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-xbox-4-20-bds-boycott-1851777098">giving a bonkers amount</a></span> for Xbox Series X trade-ins through April 26). <br></p><hr><p>And that’s pretty much it. Console launches tend to be a bit of a mess in the modern era. Hopefully, Switch 2 preorders don’t turn into a debacle like last year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-preorder-ps1-controller-playstatio-1851658626?_gl=1*k8c8ws*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTM0MzkwOC4xMjIuMS4xNzQ1MzQ3MzExLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-preorder-ps1-controller-playstatio-1851658626?_gl=1*k8c8ws*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTM0MzkwOC4xMjIuMS4xNzQ1MzQ3MzExLjYwLjAuMA..">PlayStation 5 30th anniversary set did</a></span> and we’re not in for another pandemic-fueled next-gen shortage like 2020.
