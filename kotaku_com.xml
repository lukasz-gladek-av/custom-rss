Just before the test period began, Blizzard released the first footage of Hazard in action and a breakdown of the Scottish hero’s kit. In some ways, Hazard feels like an amalgamation of other characters’ abilities, similar to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-juno-support-trial-period-space-ranger-1851599766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-juno-support-trial-period-space-ranger-1851599766">Juno</a></span>. However, there’s enough variation here that I can see him feeling fairly distinct, and not just like a copy of the heroes he borrows from.<br></p><p>Like most other tanks in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, Hazard’s kit is about claiming space and disrupting the enemy team. His primary fire is a medium-range, shotgun-like burst of spikes from the gatling gun on his right hand, which compliments the rest of his playstyle as a mobile, scrappy tank along the lines of Winston or Doomfist. Hazard can leap like Winston, and follow it up with a powerful melee attack using the purple spikes that grow from his armor. His mobility doesn’t end there, though, as he can also climb up walls like Hanzo and Genji. Both these abilities help him reach the high ground with ease and chase down foes that would otherwise give a more stationary tank trouble.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197298" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When Hazard actually reaches enemies in close range, he can also brawl and claim space with his Spike Guard ability that heavily reduces incoming damage, regenerates ammo, and fires spikes from his back a short distance in front of him. This is good for both pushing forward against enemies as well as retreating, but unlike Ramattra’s guarding ability, it has a time limit and can’t be used indefinitely.</p><p>Probably the most interesting tool in Hazard’s arsenal is the Jagged Wall ability. Similar to Mei with her Ice Wall, Hazard is able to build a wall that can block incoming attacks, but it’s not quite as wide as Mei’s. It makes up for this with some additional perks, including its spiky exterior that damages and repels foes who touch it, and that it can be built onto the side of walls. This gives him the opportunity to erect a wall in some spaces Mei can’t, and maybe even knock an enemy off the side of the map if you can time it right.</p><p>Rounding all this out is his ultimate, Downpour. This ability rains down purple spikes a decent distance in front of Hazard, holding enemies caught in the, er, downpour in place. Those affected can still fire their weapons, but they will be immobile for a short time, leaving them open for a killing shot.</p><p>Overall, Hazard seems like he thrives when he’s claiming space and squishy heroes will probably hate to see him coming. But I’m curious to actually see how players react to him after playing, as every time an <em>Overwatch 2 </em>hero is released, there are weeks of discourse about how they have ruined the game or aren’t good enough to move the needle. Where will Hazard fall? We’ll see in the coming days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s perfectly fine too. Keep following us and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year.”</p><p>What might those surprises be? Current fan speculation points to upcoming DLC and a potential Xbox Series X/S port. Daniel Wu, the CEO of Hero Games, Game Science’s biggest investor, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansion-release-date-1851649348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansion-release-date-1851649348">previously claimed</a></span> an expansion was already in development, with some analysts guessing the DLC might arrive in time for the Chinese New Year at the end of January 2025. More recently, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1frwxmk/gs_ceo_feng_ji_formally_answered_on_the_matter_of/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1frwxmk/gs_ceo_feng_ji_formally_answered_on_the_matter_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feng Ji said</a></span> that if fans expect an expansion to be of the same quality as the base game, it could take a while. </p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Xbox next month seems like a more sure bet. After much back-and-forth about whether the Chinese blockbuster was an unofficial PlayStation 5 exclusive, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-black-myth-wukong-leaked-phil-spencer-confirmed-1851697689?_gl=1*18spot8*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI4Njg2My4xMi4xLjE3MzIyODc5MTQuNTIuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-black-myth-wukong-leaked-phil-spencer-confirmed-1851697689?_gl=1*18spot8*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI4Njg2My4xMi4xLjE3MzIyODc5MTQuNTIuMC4w">recently told <em>Game File</em></a></span> that he knew whether or not the game would arrive on his platform but wouldn’t spill the beans. </p><p>One possibility is that we’ll get an announcement at Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards on December 12 revealing that <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has just been shadow-dropped on Xbox Series X/S. That’s what happened last year with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. <em>Wukong </em>is also nominated for Best Game at the TGAs, where it could continue its current winning streak. </p><p>Feng Ji does say “surprises” plural, so maybe Game Science has something else planned as well. While <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>reportedly runs better on the recently released PS5 Pro thanks to its beefier specs, it would also be nice to see the visually impressive game get an official Pro enhanced mode. That patch could be another thing the studio is planning before the end of 2024. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
