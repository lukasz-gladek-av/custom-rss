              <p><span>We here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> have…complicated, multifaceted feelings on Mega Starmie. The Mega Evolved starfish started out being seen as one of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>silliest new transformations</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, then turned out to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>one of the MVPs of the RPG</span></a><span>. Despite all the endearment I feel toward Mega Starmie and its weird long legs and arms now, seeing the thing in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime series has reawakened my innermost disgust reflex. I have many questions about this creature, but as far as the show goes, one comes to the forefront: Why does it look like Mega Starmie has been oiled up?</span></p> <p><span>The latest episode of </span><i><span>Pokémon Horizons</span></i><span>, titled “The Catcher in the Sky,” premiered in Japan last week, and in it, one the new series’ main characters, Friede, was revealed to have captured a Starmie that is capable of undergoing Mega Evolution. When the starfish is in this state, it stands as tall as its trainer and moves its arms and legs in a very uncomfortably human-like manner. Friede seems to be hamming up the human characteristics of Mega Starmie by calling it “Instructor Starmie,” though it’s unclear just what instructing it’s supposed to be doing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Anyway, the creature is shiny, as if Friede oiled it up before he reunited with the rest of the cast, and </span><i><span>Horizons</span></i><span> does a great job of exaggerating its animations to make it unnerving. Put it all together, and you’ve got a Pokémon that is just awful to look at. Way to go, team. You nailed it.</span></p>   <p><span>I haven’t been keeping current with </span><i><span>Horizons</span></i><span>, but I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504"><span>really enjoyed what I saw of the show when it made its English debut</span></a><span>. The series’ storylines have more of an arc compared to those in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>previous series</span></a><span> which was led by Ash Ketchum and kind of written for the series to have no real end goal and for episodes to stand alone. It seems like </span><i><span>Horizons </span></i><span>has been sticking with that storytelling approach as it enters its third season. The episodes that have been dubbed in English are streaming on Netflix.</span></p>

              <p><span>Fresh off its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>Game of the Year</span></a><span> win, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> has a new, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-free-dlc-patch-notes-photo-mode-2000653032"><span>free update</span></a><span> that adds additional levels, upgrades, and boss fights to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-rpgs-2025-clair-obscur-avowed-assassins-creed-2000654194"><span>the RPG</span></a><span>. If it’s been a while since you checked in with Verso, Maelle, and the rest of the expedition, maybe, I dunno, go practice your parrying before you head into the new content, because even the sickos who were already dodging the game’s most elaborate onslaughts are having trouble with these challenging fights.</span></p> <p><span>The “Thank You Update,” as Sandfall Interactive is calling it, includes an Endless Tower, which features revamped boss battles from the base game for an extra challenge. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s late-game boss fights and secret battles were already daunting tasks, and now the game has added a plethora of new fights that are exhausting just to watch. Look at how long this combo goes on in the new Duollistes fight:</span></p>

   <p><span>Some of the update’s challenges come from a seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks, but a lot of its fights are pretty standard </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>fare in that they </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-parry-sakapetate-chromatic-troubadour-1851781507"><span>trick you with multiple fakeout attacks</span></a><span>, baiting you into dodging and parrying before an enemy actually strikes, throwing off your rhythm and leaving you open to attack.</span></p>

   <p><span>Oh, and one boss will just straight up nuke your team. Good luck parrying that one.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> fans are no strangers to challenging boss fights, but some feel that the Thank You Update’s boss run is too much. This account from </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pnn1se/im_officially_done_with_this_update/"><span>Reddit user Maggot_6661</span></a><span> sums it up:</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love this game, truly,” they wrote. “This update is great, but these bosses are too much. Unless I spend a full 9 to 5 learning the reaction times only a robot can reach, I will never beat them. I already have to spend the day searching for a job and going disappointment after disappointment, I’m not mentally strong enough to suffer through these bosses afterwards, all it’s doing is making me not like the game… which is something I don’t want to happen.”</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes walking away from the biggest challenges a game has to offer is the right call. To this day, I’ve never played through some of the secret bosses in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy X</span></i><span>, and I have art from that game tattooed on my arm. I think I’d rather just enjoy the game I played than bang my head against a wall on some of its more challenging fights, so I won’t judge anyone who walks away from </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s Endless Tower. To those of you who do beat them, thank you for your service. “For those who come after.”</span></p>
