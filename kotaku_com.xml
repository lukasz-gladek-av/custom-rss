            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-new-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-is-already-cheaper-on-amazon-a-subtle-pre-black-friday-surprise.1339060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When the&nbsp;<em>really</em> big sales events of the year get close — Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, etc., one of the big questions is always “What’s Apple going to do?” If this new Amazon deal on the brand-new M5 iPad Pro is any indication, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">Apple’s going to be dipping at least a toe in the Black Friday pond in the weeks to come. For the first time, the 11-inch M5 iPad Pro is taking a price drop — it’s $949 right now, down by $50.</a></p>
<p>Apple fans and creative pros in particular are going to be all over this one, because the new M5 iPad Pro comes closer to full high-end laptop power than any tablet yet. The M5 chip is a game changer in terms of speed and pure power, and the newly released iPadOS 26 is a massive leap forward. The two combine with Apple Intelligence to create a tablet that can do nearly everything a powerful laptop can, especially if you add the Magic Keyboard to complete the experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Faster, Thinner, Better</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the new IPad Pro is lighter than the iPad Air — 0.98 pounds, which speaks to just how much size and weight Apple has cut from their latest tablet design while amping up its power and ability. The M5 chip gets the lion’s share of attention, and deservedly so, but don’t sleep on the N1 wireless chip that’s also in the new iPad Pro, because it makes Wi-Fi 7, Thread, and Bluetooth 6 connections happen.</p>
<p>As with all things Apple, the screen on the M5 iPad Pro is best-in-class. It’s an Ultra Retina XDR tandem OLED screen with anti-glare treatment and an oleophobic coating that cuts down on fingerprints — an essential feature for an elite tablet. The ProMotion adaptive refresh rate ranges from 10Hz to a blistering 120Hz, and the peak performance of 1,600 nits delivers all of the exceptional quality of the screen in its full glory.</p>



<h2>All About the Images</h2>
<p>The M5 iPad Pro’s cameras and what it can do with the images are where this tablet really shines. The 12MP Wide camera at the rear of the tablet can shoot 4K ProRes video, and also be used as a powerful document scanner and AR code unlocking device. The front of the tablet has a powerhouse 12MP landscape Center Stage camera for pristine video calls and conferencing. When you shoot your videos or stills, Apple Intelligence takes over to deliver the best and most powerful range of editing and creative options of any tablet on the market.’</p>
<p>The first price break on this brand-new tablet is definitely an occasion, even if it’s just 5%. That might not be the case with other tablets, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">but the M5 iPad Pro was a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of tablet at its full $999 price, and now that it’s down to $949 at Amazon, it’s a more impressive deal yet.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>Budget earbuds often disappoint with tinny sound and uncomfortable fits, leaving people wondering if they should have spent more on premium brands. The Soundcore P20i by Anker changes that calculus entirely, delivering features and sound quality that rival earbuds costing ten times more while earning an impressive 4.4-star rating from nearly 80,000 reviews. Amazon has slashed the price from $39 to just $19, hitting an all-time low that makes these earbuds an absolute steal for anyone who needs reliable wireless audio without breaking the bank. This deal has already attracted over 10,000 buyers in the past month alone, speaking to the value proposition these earbuds represent.</p>

<h2>Oversized Drivers Deliver Surprising Bass Performance</h2>
<p>The 10mm drivers in these compact earbuds outperform expectations and <strong>deliver bass that rivals earbuds priced at $100 or more</strong>. The size of the drivers affects bass reproduction because larger diaphragms move more air and it creates low-frequency sounds that make music feel immersive instead of flat. The larger drivers follow the 16-ohm impedance specification for efficient power use. The sound signature highlights bass without drowning out mids and highs: You get a satisfying thump in hip-hop and electronic music, while vocals remain clear and instruments distinct. <strong>Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity provides stable audio transmission</strong> with minimal delay and prevents annoying audio-video sync issues that come with cheaper wireless earbuds.</p>



<p>The Soundcore app takes these earbuds from good to exceptional: <strong>It includes 22 preset EQ profiles</strong> designed for various music genres and listening preferences. Presets for rock, classical, jazz, podcasts and bass boost adjust frequency response to enhance sound for different types of content. You can customize tap gestures to control functions, such as skipping tracks, adjusting volume or activating voice assistants based on how you like to use them.</p>
<p>Battery performance is impressive as it offers <strong>10 hours of continuous playback on a single charge</strong> which is enough for multiple workdays or long flights without needing the case. The<strong> charging case extends total playtime to 30 hours</strong>, and gives you nearly a week of typical use before you have to charge it again. Fast charging technology provides 2 hours of listening from just 10 minutes in the case which is helpful if you forgot to charge overnight.</p>



<p>The compact design, complete with an attached lanyard, makes these earbuds extremely portable: They are <strong>small enough to fit in pockets or clip onto bags and keys</strong> without taking up much space. Their lightweight design keeps you comfortable even during extended use and prevents ear fatigue that heavier earbuds can cause. Water resistance protects against sweat during workouts and light rain while commuting but they are not rated for swimming or heavy water exposure.</p>
<p>Call quality is enhanced by <strong>dual microphones that work with AI to isolate your voice from background noise</strong> in phone conversations. The system filters out distracting sounds, such as traffic, wind, or office chatter, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly. This AI processing occurs in real-time without creating the robotic voice quality typical of simpler noise reduction systems. The microphone placement captures your voice naturally while minimizing wind noise during outdoor calls.</p>
<p>At $19, this is one of the best deals you can get.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-is-dumping-its-512gb-microsd-memory-card-now-selling-for-mere-pennies-on-the-dollar.1338880/</guid>

              <p>Running out of storage space on your phone, Nintendo Switch, or camera creates that frustrating moment where you have to delete old memories to capture new ones. MicroSD cards solve this problem by expanding your device’s capacity and let you hoard thousands of photos or hours of 4K video without compromise.</p>
<p>The Samsung EVO Select with 512GB capacity provides enough room for approximately 124,000 photos or 60 hours of 4K footage, essentially future-proofing your device against storage anxiety. And Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/">just dropped the price from $46 to just $37, hitting a new all-time low</a> just before Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed Meets Capacity for Real-World Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>160 MB/s read speed makes file transfers fast and smooth</strong>: Copying a full 4K movie to your card takes less than a minute, unlike slower cards that can take five to ten minutes. Good news is, <strong>write speeds match the demands of continuous 4K video recording</strong>. This prevents dropped frames and stuttering that can ruin important footage when slower cards can’t keep up with the data. The UHS-I interface offers the bandwidth these speeds need and connects through the standard microSD slot found in nearly all modern devices.</p>



<p>The A2 application performance class means <strong>this card can run apps and games directly from its storage:</strong> This avoids the lag that older microSD standards often had. The rating shows minimum random read speeds of 4000 IOPS and write speeds of 2000 IOPS, which results in quick app launches and smooth gameplay on devices like the Nintendo Switch. Games load faster, transitions between levels are smooth, and you bypass the frustrating delays that come from using slower storage.</p>



<p>The i<strong>ncluded SD adapter increases compatibility</strong>: It works with laptops, desktop card readers, cameras and the original Nintendo Switch dock. This simple adapter <strong>changes the tiny microSD size to standard SD</strong> so you don’t need to buy separate adapters or search for specific readers. You can easily insert the card into your computer’s SD slot to transfer files without needing cables or wireless connections that use up battery.</p>
<p>Samsung’s six-proof protection guards <strong>against water, extreme temperatures, X-rays, magnets, drops, and wear from repeated insertion and removal</strong>. These durability features mean the card can survive an accidental trip through the washing machine, withstand desert heat or winter cold outdoors, and pass through airport security scanners without corrupting data. The <strong>10-year limited warranty</strong> supports these protection claims with reliable manufacturer backing that goes beyond standard consumer electronics coverage</p>
<p>At $37, the card costs about seven cents per gigabyte, which is great value for Samsung’s premium EVO Select line.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[London Skyline LEGO Set Is Nearly Free, Amazon Slashes Price on 4.8-Rated Build]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build-2000640003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build.1338877/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO Architecture sets rarely go on sale which makes this London Skyline deal something special. The 4.8-star rating (across more than 13,000 reviews) speaks to the quality and satisfaction <strong>this 468-piece set</strong> delivers to builders who want an iconic city skyline on their desk or shelf. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/">has dropped the price from $39 to just $31, which marks an all-time low</a> that won’t last long given how quickly these sets disappear during promotional windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Iconic Landmarks Come Together in Miniature Form</h2>
<p>The set captures<strong> five of London’s most recognizable structures</strong> in carefully scaled brick form. It starts with the National Gallery’s neoclassical facade which anchors Trafalgar Square, then Nelson’s Column rises with its distinctive proportions (honoring the admiral who secured British naval dominance at Trafalgar in 1805). The London Eye appears as a functional rotating observation wheel made from transparent and gray elements that showcase its modern engineering style. Big Ben’s clock tower displays the Gothic Revival architecture that makes it easily recognizable in photographs and films worldwide. Last but not least, Tower Bridge completes the collection with its twin towers and suspended walkways.</p>



<p>The Thames river flows through the scene, and uses transparent blue baseplate tiles to create a convincing water effect beneath the landmarks. This smart design choice grounds the buildings in their geographic setting while adding visual depth to the display. The transparent elements catch and reflect light in various ways throughout the day. This gives the model a dynamic quality that shifts with your viewing angle and the ambient light. The <strong>baseplate measures about 11 inches wide</strong> and provides a stable foundation that keeps all elements securely connected during transport or dusting.</p>



<p>The<strong> set includes 468 pieces</strong> and hits the sweet spot between being challenging enough to feel rewarding and manageable enough to complete in one satisfying evening or weekend session. LEGO Architecture sets differ from standard LEGO builds by focusing on architectural accuracy and the proportions between structures rather than play features: Each landmark uses specialized pieces and smart building techniques to replicate distinctive architectural elements at this smaller scale.</p>
<p>Display potential makes this set especially appealing for offices, home libraries or anywhere you want decor that sparks conversation and reflects sophisticated interests. The monochromatic color scheme, using mainly gray, black, and tan bricks, creates a cohesive look that appears professional rather than toy-like in adult spaces. Its compact size means it fits on crowded bookshelves, desks, or window sills without overpowering the area.</p>
<p>The <strong>recommended age of 12 and up</strong> reflects the patience and fine motor skills needed for smaller pieces and detailed assembly steps. However, younger builders with LEGO experience can succeed with adult guidance. This set makes an excellent gift for Anglophiles, architecture enthusiasts, travel lovers reminiscing about London visits.</p>
<p>At $31, it offers great value given the piece count, display quality, and lasting appeal of the Architecture series.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/philips-clears-hue-bulb-starter-kit-stock-now-selling-at-all-time-low-for-early-black-friday-2000639968</link>

              <p>Smart lighting transforms how you experience your home, <strong>turning ordinary rooms into spaces that adapt to your mood, schedule, and activities</strong> with just a tap or voice command. The<em> Philips Hue</em> starter kit delivers this transformation in minutes and requires nothing more than screwing in bulbs and plugging in the bridge to unlock millions of colors and automated lighting scenes. This bundle includes the <strong>essential Hue brige and two 60W A19 color-changing bulbs</strong> that work in standard E26 fixtures throughout your house. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/">has slashed the price from $142 to just $99 for early Black Friday</a>, which marks a new all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Bridge Makes Everything Possible</h2>
<p>The Hue bridge acts as <strong>the main hub for your smart lighting system</strong>: It connects your bulbs to your home network and offers features that standard Bluetooth bulbs can’t. This hub creates a special Zigbee network and keeps your smart lights responsive without slowing down your Wi-Fi or hurting connection quality. The bridge also allows for automations: You can set your lights to turn on before you wake up or turn off automatically when you leave home.</p>



<p>The two included A19 bulbs deliver 800 lumens each: This provides <strong>brightness similar to traditional 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong> while using much less energy. These <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs cover a range from warm candlelight tones at around 2000K to cool daylight at 6500K,<strong> plus offer access to 16 million colors for fun lighting effects</strong>. The <strong>E26 base fits standard lamp sockets</strong> and ceiling fixtures: You can install them in table lamps, floor lamps, or overhead lights without needing adapters. Dimming is smooth through the app or voice commands, and gives you fine control over brightness levels that wall switches can’t achieve.</p>



<p>Preset scenes take the hassle out of choosing colors: They provide <strong>ready-made lighting combinations tailored for different activities and moods</strong>. The 24-hour natural light scene mimics the sun’s movement throughout the day. It begins with energizing cool tones in the morning and shifts to calming warm hues as evening approaches. <em>Focus</em> modes provide bright, clear lighting to help you concentrate during work hours, while reading scenes offer comfortable light that reduces eye strain. <em>Relaxation</em> and sleep scenes gradually dim to warm amber tones, signaling to your body that it’s time to unwind.</p>
<p>Voice control with Alexa and Google Assistant lets you <strong>adjust your lights without reaching for your phone</strong> or getting off the couch. Simple commands like <em>“turn on the living room lights”</em> or <em>“set bedroom to 50 percent”</em> become routine after a few days. The Hue app guides you through setting up voice control with easy instructions that take only a few minutes. You can also create custom voice commands for specific scenes, like saying <em>“movie time”</em> to automatically dim your lights to theater mode.</p>
<p>At $99, this starter kit is an easy way to enter the Philips Hue ecosystem. It provides everything you need to experience smart lighting in two rooms right out of the box.</p>
