Notably, Cox hasn’t been that present in promoting the game, with Starr, English, and others in the cast making more appearances in trailers and panels. This isn’t too surprising, as Cox has been a bit preoccupied with his role in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637"><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em></a></span>, but as <em>Clair Obscur </em>has risen in popularity, it seems Cox has been caught off guard by all the hype.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,197585,197583" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This weekend, Cox was a guest at the Washington State Summer Con in Puyallup, where he took part in a <em>Daredevil </em>panel alongside co-stars Elden Henson, Vincent D’Onofrio, and Wilson Bethel. While the group primarily talked about their time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Cox was asked about his work on <em>Clair Obscur</em>.t The actor admitted he hasn’t actually played the game himself, and seemed a bit frazzled talking about the game, given his knowledge of it is limited to the four hours he spent in the booth recording Gustave’s dialogue.</p><p>“I don’t mean to minimize it in any way, and it’s so cool [that] apparently the game’s awesome,” Cox said to the audience. “I’m not a gamer. I have no idea. I haven’t played it. My agent asked me if I wanted to go and do a voiceover. I was in the studio for four hours, maybe? People keep saying how amazing it is and ‘congratulations,’ and I feel like a total fraud. But I’m so thrilled for the company, and I’m so thrilled it did really well. That was it. Just FYI. Ask someone else a question, I feel uncomfortable.”</p><p>It was an endearing moment. Sometimes, a voice acting role is just something you hop into a booth for one day, and it doesn’t become a months-long gig. Given how quickly Cox was in and out, it’s amazing his performance is as good as it is. Gustave is one of the most endearing characters in <em>Clair Obscur</em>, with a ton of emotional range. Cox may be surprised that Sandfall Interactive’s RPG has blown up the way it has, but I hope he also realizes how much his character played a part in its success. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-charlie-cox-gustave-voice-1851784940]]></content:encoded>

For modern Pixar, that’s abysmal. Overseas, <em>Elio </em>racked up just $14 million. That means the new Pixar movie ended its opener at just $35 million. For comparison, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pro.imdb.com/boxoffice/brand/bn3530750466?rf=mojo_rl_cta_brand&amp;sort=releaseDate&amp;ref_=bo_bn__resort#table&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pro.imdb.com/boxoffice/brand/bn3530750466?rf=mojo_rl_cta_brand&amp;sort=releaseDate&amp;ref_=bo_bn__resort#table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most Pixar films earn around $50 million</a></span> or more domestically alone during their first weekend. In fact, the last time a Pixar film stumbled this badly out of the gate was 2023's <em>Elemental</em>, which previously held the record. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/film/news/pixar-elemental-box-office-rebound-1235691248/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/pixar-elemental-box-office-rebound-1235691248/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">However, <em>Elemental </em>had a happy ending</a></span>. Despite only earning $44 million globally after its first weekend and being called a bomb or flop by many online, the animated rom-com kept on earning money. By the end of its run, thanks largely to positive word of mouth and solid reviews, <em>Elemental </em>earned $496 million globally. That could happen with <em>Elio</em>, too. The movie is receiving rave reviews from both audiences and critics. However, <em>Elio</em> does have to compete with the live-action <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> film, which was the number one film at the box office over the weekend for a second week in a row, so it might struggle to turn things around. We shall see. </p><h2 id="h284"><a id=""></a>Pixar might be forced to crank out sequels</h2><p>Regardless of what happens, <em>Elio </em>and <em>Elemental’s </em>lackluster opening weekend likely isn’t good for Pixar. While the studio can still produce big box office hits, like 2024's <em>Inside Out 2</em> and 2019's <em>Toy Story 4,</em> a problematic pattern is forming.</p><p>It appears Pixar is struggling to create new, original hit films that blow up and become pop culture icons like <em>The Incredibles </em>or <em>Monsters Inc</em>. If Disney sees sequels as solid money earners and original films, like <em>Elio</em>, as risky bets that have to rely on long theatrical runs to become profitable, it could lead to the Mickey Mouse empire changing up Pixar’s output. The studio might become entirely focused on sequels, with its few original projects sent to Disney+ to appease the content gods. It would be a sad fate for a studio that once had one of the best original film track records in Hollywood. And this seems to already be happening, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with only two of Pixar’s six announced movies being original projects</a></span>.</p><p>But in 2025, it really does seem like kids want stuff they know, l<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-box-office-opening-weekend-300-million-1851775046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-box-office-opening-weekend-300-million-1851775046">ike <em>Minecraft </em>and live-action remakes</a></span>, and aren’t screaming to see original animated movies. <em>Or </em>their parents don’t want to risk spending $20+ on seeing a new movie, instead bringing their kids to Hollywood’s latest reheated leftovers. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elio-worst-box-office-bad-pixar-disney-dragon-weekend-1851784926]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hot off the conclusion of <em>Andor</em>’s incredible Rebel Alliance origin story, fans have been clamoring for a great <em>Star Wars</em> game to play. The most unlikely candidate of all is now filling the void: <em>Star Wars: Battlefront 2</em>. Once a lightning rod for controversy around <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-our-loot-boxes-are-actually-surprise-mechanics-that-1835662012&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-our-loot-boxes-are-actually-surprise-mechanics-that-1835662012">pay-to-win loot boxes</a></span> that escalated all the way from subreddit outrage to the halls of Congress, eight years later EA DICE’s multiplayer galactic battlegrounds sim has come roaring back to chart on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and break records on Steam. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195928,195371" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Battlefront 2 </em>had just 1,500 concurrent players in April.

However, the community has been slowly ramping back up ever since <em>Andor</em>’s season two series finale in May. It peaked at around 18,000 concurrent players that month. Then over the past weekend it doubled to an all-time record of 35,321. <br></p><p>The caveat there is that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-the-kotaku-review-1820477183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-the-kotaku-review-1820477183"><em>Battlefront 2</em> wasn’t</a></span> on Steam back during its initial launch, only arriving years later after beginning life on PC as an EA Origin launcher exclusive.

The drama-fueled, high-stakes thriller ends just before the biggest <em>Star Wars</em> battles kick off in<em> Rogue One </em>and <em>A New Hope</em>. A true feeling of catharsis to the galactic conflict only existed off screen, leaving fans looking for ways to reenact the showdowns for which <em>Andor</em> lays the groundwork.<br></p><p>It helped that one of the show’s actors, Muhannad Ben Amor, used the spotlight to share his <em>Battlefront 2</em> love in an Instagram story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that subsequently went viral</a></span>. He said he played almost 500 hours of the game when he was younger (he was only 12 when it released) and called for a sequel.  “Grew up with <em>Battlefront 2</em>—been a veteran since day one,” Amor said. “Let’s HOPE <em>Battlefront 3</em> happens.” He wasn’t the only one trying to manifest <em>Battlefront</em>’s return on social media. </p><p>The Reels and TikTok algorithms were full of <em>Star Wars </em>memes after <em>Andor</em> wrapped, and they instantly became a pipeline to nostalgia-bait of people playing and talking about <em>Battlefront 2</em> like it was a lost treasure from a bygone era. The flood of content was a mix of players reliving the game’s greatest hits, like transforming into Yoda or Darth Vader and demolishing opponents on the battlefield, or putting life on hold to finish Supremacy matches like school had just let out for the summer  in the late, pre-pandemic 2010s.</p><p>Social media platforms convincing you that everyone else is doing a thing can be a powerful incentive. FOMO is a hell of a drug. It also helps that<em> Battlefront 2 </em>is currently dirt cheap. The game is on sale for just $4 on PC and disc copies are still bargain bin fodder at places like GameStop. But I think another major dynamic to the <em>Battlefront</em> renaissance is a recent frenzy of <em>Titanfall</em> rumors <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">that culminated in the news</a></span> that a mech-based multiplayer incubation project had just been canned at EA. Amid fresh layoffs even as the<em> Madden</em> publisher lavishes shareholders with stock buybacks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtoqfhz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtoqfhz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the calls for <em>Battlefront 3</em></a></span><em> </em>have reached a fever pitch at the exact moment when it seems the least likely to ever become a reality.</p><p>The role of <em>Battlefront 2</em> as a “throwback” to a better time is an ironic one considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefront-2s-complete-history-from-launch-to-its-fin-1843248296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefront-2s-complete-history-from-launch-to-its-fin-1843248296">its greatest legacy remains a pay-to-win loot box cash grab so brazen</a></span> it forced the entire gaming industry to back off of the microtransaction trend. But with that controversy no longer shading every aspect of the conversation around the game, the parts of <em>Battlefront 2</em> that were fun have been able to shine more than ever. Unburdened by the hype and new release expectations of a $60 game, <em>Battlefront 2</em> can just be that multiplayer distraction that hits all of the <em>Star Wars</em> fanservice sweet spots. <em>Battlefront 3</em> might never happen, but the dream of one has never been more alive. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-andor-sequel-steam-ps5-cheap-1851784922]]></content:encoded>
