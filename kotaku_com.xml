Quickly, this story spread online, with many wondering why <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-unboxing-day-one-patch-nintendo-youtube-review-1851782563&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-unboxing-day-one-patch-nintendo-youtube-review-1851782563">Nintendo packaged the Switch 2 with the screen right at the top</a></span> of the box, and others confused as to why GameStop would staple a receipt to a box containing a very pricey item in the first place.

And now you can own a piece of very strange and soon-to-be-obscure video game history. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/gamestop/status/1943008910073303421/photo/1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1943008910073303421/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 9, GameStop announced</a></span> that it was auctioning off the actual stapler that damaged the screen, the staple itself that was embedded in the console, the Switch 2 that was damaged, and even the box that it came in as part of a charity auction. A certificate of Authenticity signed by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen is also included.</p><p>  “The items are being auctioned as a set to raise funds for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals,” said GameStop. “While the incident itself was unfortunate, we hope its legacy serves a greater purpose.” <br></p><p>Here’s how GameStop describes the stapler that did the damage: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The black stapler used by a GameStop associate who, in a moment of launch night excitement and misjudged enthusiasm, stapled a receipt directly to a customer’s new Nintendo Switch 2 box—puncturing both cardboard and screen in one swift motion. Features authentic field-use wear throughout and retired immediately from service, the stapler now stands as a retail legend born from a half-second decision.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, this is all a big publicity stunt, but as of 4:15 PM EST, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the stapler, staple, box, and Switch 2 have already hit $16,000+ on eBay</a></span>. That’s a very expensive stapler. All of this is very silly, but at least it seems some good will come out of it. And that’s more than I usually expect from news in 2025. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-staten-island-switch-2-stapler-auction-charity-1851785951]]></content:encoded>
