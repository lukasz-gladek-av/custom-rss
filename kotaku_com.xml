Given just 30 minutes’ notice before the news was announced by EA in an internal meeting, the studio had apparently just recently successfully passed one of its development milestones and was working toward a vertical slice that would show a chunk of the game in action. </p><p>The story reportedly revolved around playing as T’Challa, Killmonger, or Shuri as each vied for the mantle of Black Panther which would grant them superhuman powers. The game would also feature fights with the shapeshifting Skrull showcased in Marvel’s popular <em>Secret Invasion</em> comic-book crossover event. The gameplay was also aiming to incorporate elements of the Nemesis system from <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> such that enemies might remember past encounters with the player and relationships with aspiring Black Panther rivals might evolve. </p><p>It appears the most likely reason EA may have decided to walk away from the project was the lack of progress after several years of prototyping, even as some of those laid off in Cliffhanger Games’ closure had only just arrived at the studio earlier this year as it scaled up its development capabilities. Several developers spoke up about the project online this week following its cancelation. </p><p>“Well, it was a good run while it lasted,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ted-snook-9235602_well-it-was-a-good-run-while-it-lasted-activity-7333598980263624704-tG2t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB9jAJMBKn6avI14nm0RQ2Himw8u2luEWC0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ted-snook-9235602_well-it-was-a-good-run-while-it-lasted-activity-7333598980263624704-tG2t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB9jAJMBKn6avI14nm0RQ2Himw8u2luEWC0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> software engineer Ted Snook. “Found out today that Cliffhanger Games is shut down by EA.

This obviously applies to Stonesword Keys as well, meaning your chances of grabbing one in an expedition can feel like a stroke of luck. </p><p>However, the good news is that there are a few locations you can aim for that have a higher drop rate for this coveted item. We’re not talking a 100-percent drop rate here, but they drop frequently enough from these points of interest to be worth visiting.</p><figure id="" data-id="0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-recommend-id="image://0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-recommend-id="image://0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here are some good locations to find Stonesword Keys:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Small Castles</strong>: There are usually a few small castles on the map that can be cleared easily. They’ll sometimes have an Abductor Virgin enemy on the base level, but will more often have a quick and simple fight against a knight boss at the top. Behind the boss will be a chest that you can open, which has a good chance of containing a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Medium Castles</strong>: You’ll also sometimes find medium-sized castles that are gated off and require you to enter via the sewers at the very bottom of the structure. Here, you can make your way up the wooden stairs inside to find a room halfway up containing a group of enemies. A side room here has a chest that may contain a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Ruined Cathedrals</strong>: Not to be confused with the small cathedrals where you find flask upgrades, ruined cathedrals are large, broken structures that are hard to miss. You’ll encounter basic enemies here, as well as a boss located either near the altar or by dropping down a hole in the center. Bosses aside, just defeat any nearby foes and check behind the altar in the center of the cathedral for a chest that has a solid chance of dropping a Stonesword Key for you.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to track down some extra Stonesword Keys, get out there and beat some ass at the gaols. Just don’t be surprised if one day you open up a gaol and get a whole lot more than you bargained for…ut that’s a discussion for another day!</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s not clear how exactly, and Benzies is cagey about the details in his<em> GamesIndustry.biz </em>interview, but it sounds an awful lot like Roblox-style exploitation is part of the model.</p><p>“We have plans to add multiplayer, [and] we have plans to make a full open world,” he said. “And of course, we’ve also got to look at what players are creating, and incorporate that into our plans. Given the ease of the tools, we think there’s going to be a high percentage of players who will jump in and give it a pop, see how it feels. Hopefully some will create compelling content we can then promote and make that part of our plans to push to other players.”</p><p>I, too, hope “some will create compelling content,” and by “some” I mean the team at Build A Rocket Boy, which is selling a $60 game and a paid premium pass required to access some of the additional post-launch content. Elsewhere in the interview, Benzies talks about the spectrum of crafting in games, saying he hopes the building tools will be somewhere in the middle between <em>Roblox </em>(hard but expansive) and <em>Minecraft</em> (easy but simple). Epic recently announced it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/epic-games-fortnite-based-roblox-killer-still-has-a-way-to-go&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/epic-games-fortnite-based-roblox-killer-still-has-a-way-to-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paid out over $300 million</a></span> to people making stuff in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>“The dream from the building side is to allow players the opportunity to create their own multiplayer open world games with ease,” Benzies told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. “So anyone could pick up the game, jump in, drive around, stop at a point where they see something of interest, build a little mission, jump back in the car, drive again, build another mission. Once you’ve built a couple of hundred of these, you’ve built your own open world game. So, that’s the build side.”</p><p>Those are lofty goals for a brand-new game from a first-time studio. If the underlying game can deliver something solid, maybe there’s a chance, but if not, I don’t think the promise of user-generated content will be enough to bail <em>MindsEye</em> out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
