              <p>Usually Ubisoft is delaying <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">its upcoming games</a>. Sometimes it delays <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/assassins-creed-valhallas-first-expansion-is-delayed-by-a-couple-of-weeks/">big updates to ones that are already out</a>. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it delay its official quarterly earnings report and certainly not minutes after it was already due to be released. Did someone accidentally delete a spreadsheet or is the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> publisher getting ready to break some major news?</p> <p>Like every other publicly traded video game company, Ubisoft regularly releases quarterly updates on its financials and takes questions from investors and analysts on an earnings call. The latest round was supposed to go live today at around 12:00 p.m. ET, only it didn’t. Instead, minutes passed with no update as people prepared to join the conference call that’s traditionally helmed by CEO and cofounder Yves Guillemot.</p>

 <p>Then Ubisoft released its weirdest emergency press release ever. “Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26,” <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2A1sQVfdyeqe6FVBzu564u/1210887eef5e1047803696e934f993f0/Ubisoft_press_release_13_11_2025_EN_vF.pdf">it read</a>. “Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.”</p>

 <p>That’s a big last-minute change with no clear details on when things will be back to normal.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, this could imply an acquisition of sorts. Could also imply some accounting / financial issue. </p> <p>Just remember to freak the fuck out for the next few days and speculate as much as possible until they announce something.</p> <p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989023907932717437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company,” wrote Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989019828938764642">on X</a>. He noted that this could be a prelude to some big acquisition announcement, or it could signal a financial or accounting issue that requires extra time to address before accurate data can be supplied to the public.</p>

 <p>It might be easier to assume the latter if not for what a weird time this is in general for Ubisoft. The long-time publisher recently entered into <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">a $1.25 billion bailout</a> with Chinese conglomerate Tencent. It used that money to spin off a new entity run by the CEO’s son. After a slew of recent delays, there are no major new blockbuster releases for the company on the immediate horizon. The stock price is at its lowest point in over a decade.</p>

 <p>It certainly wouldn’t be shocking if Tencent, another big game company, or a “consortium” of various other investors used this opportunity to swoop in and try to buy the struggling publisher, or at least some big chunks of it. With its most lucrative franchises—<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>,<em> Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>—all snugly nestled within a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios, Ubisoft is trying to find a way to offload other big chunks to outside groups. Anybody interested in <em>Splinter Cell</em> or <em>Prince of Persia</em>?</p> <p>The company recently announced voluntary layoffs across its Swedish studios, which include Massive, the lead studio on the<em> Division</em> franchise. With Activision Blizzard gobbled up by Microsoft and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA sold to Saudi Arabia</a>, who can say what will happen next? I just hope <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> somehow survives.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Many Nintendo Switch 2 owners who use third-party docks were in for a rude surprise after updating their consoles earlier this week to the latest firmware. It seems the Switch 2 is no longer compatible with these devices, leaving many players frustrated and fearful of the future.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-system-update-2100-available-here-are-the-patch-notes">On November 11, Nintendo released Switch 2 update 21.0.0</a>, which added some nice quality-of-life features, including the ability to turn off autoplaying videos in the eShop and some helpful tweaks to GameChat and new icons that indicate if a game is digital or physical. All good stuff. However, not long after the patch, players began reporting that many third-party docks were no longer working with the updated Switch 2.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ouoalk/some_third_party_switch_2_docks_stopped_working/">On Reddit,</a> <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/507478-nintendo-switch-2/81068963">GameFAQs</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/160110789401691/posts/1089183309827763/">other places online</a>, you can find many, <em>many&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 owners complaining that after the new update, their third-party docks no longer transmit video to their TVs or are now far more finicky and require restarts to function again. “Can confirm my 2nd (3rd party) dock in our living room just stopped working as well right after today’s update. A full power cycle did not fix it for me,” posted one Reddit user. “I finally got around to ordering a dock cable for travel, it arrived today. Plugged it in, happy it worked right out of the box. Launched a game, update alert, update, cable’s borked,” said another Reddit poster. “I’m using the GuileKeys folding dock, and the new update broke compatibility with it. I am not sure if this dock can be updated. I have messaged the seller,” claimed another Redditor.</p>

 <p>YouTuber AustinJohnPlays <a href="https://youtu.be/QrBCQTmb9SU">tested out two different Switch 2 dock dongles</a> and found that once he updated Nintendo’s console, both stopped working.</p>  <p>So it seems clear that this new Switch 2 update did <em>something</em>, and now a ton of third-party docks that worked before are no longer compatible. We’ve known since the Switch 2 launched earlier this year that Nintendo was going to be more restrictive with the Switch 2’s USB-C connection, with <a href="https://nsaneforums.com/news/technology-news/how-nintendo-locked-down-the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-usb-c-port-and-broke-third-party-docking-r30020/">testing showing that it isn’t quite as open and universal as you’d expect</a> from a USB connection. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">This caused headaches for third-party manufacturers</a>, but they did eventually figure out how to get their docks working with Switch 2’s odd USB-C restrictions. But it now seems like Nintendo has, intentionally or by accident, changed something and, in the process, broken many of these devices.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Nintendo about the Switch 2 update.</p> <p>Regardless of intent, for many Switch 2 users who relied on a third-party dock for various reasons or who liked having one set up on a second TV, this situation has made them nervous to buy another dock. It also means that if your Switch 2 dock breaks, you have to rely on Nintendo for a new one. Sure, your existing third-party dock might work for a bit, but there’s no telling how long it will be before another Nintendo update bricks it. And in the end, it works out for Nintendo as it means people are forced to buy their dock. That’s not a huge problem in 2025. But in 10 years or so, it could become a hassle.</p>
