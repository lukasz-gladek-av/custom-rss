            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brings a 2021 PlayStation 5 upgrade of a 2020 PS4 game to a 2025 gaming handheld hybrid in 2026. It’s a good port of a great game and suggests a bright future for third-party blockbusters on Switch 2 from publishers willing to invest the time and resources into doing it right.</p> <p>I played the new version, out January 22, for around four hours, racing back through the early section of the game in time to meet back up with Aerith and stroll through some of the more taxing areas in the early game. I was struck by two things during my brief return to the slums of Midgar. The first was just how linear, focused, and cinematic the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is compared to its sprawling successor, <em>Rebirth</em>. It was fun, refreshing, and nostalgic—all the things that made the 2020 game worth its long wait.</p>

 <p>The second was how rarely it felt like I was playing a nerfed version <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, one compromised for a portable device (I played almost exclusively in handheld mode). It’s locked at 30fps instead of something higher but that never felt like a drag. The textures, lighting, and particle effects never drew attention for the wrong reasons. I never sat there in a boss fight or cutscene thinking, “This is fine but I wished it looked better.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000662353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662353"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662353">Digital Foundry / Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s a vibe check backed up by technical analyses from the experts. A very thorough review of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>‘s performance on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUjYGy7cqog">by <em>Digital Foundry</em></a> finds that it’s weaker than the PS5 version in some areas but generally better than the PS4 one across the board. There is no infamously low-res texture eternally waiting to load on Cloud’s 7th Heaven apartment door. Pop-in is mostly a non-issue. The lighting in many scenes is more detailed than in the PS4 version as well.</p>

 <p>The only real place the Switch 2 port falters is when it comes to hair in handheld mode. It’s a small issue but a noticeable one for a game whose hero’s most defining feature is a Chocobo’s nest of spikey blond hair. From Tifa’s long ponytail to Aerith’s brunette braids, there’s often dithering and fuzziness. Some of the UI elements occasionally feel especially small or hard to read in handheld mode as well. It didn’t shatter my immersion but the game isn’t completely free of small downgrades here or there that remind you you aren’t playing on one of the high-end home consoles (the Switch 2 version arrived alongside the Xbox Series X/S ports).</p>

 <p>If you’re someone who never owned a PS4, PS5, or PC that could play <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, I’d recommend the Switch 2 version without hesitation. If the Switch 2 is the only console you’ve ever owned, I might even call it a “must buy” relative to the rest of the console’s library right now. PlayStation owners take access to games like this for granted. For Nintendo fans, it’s still a special treat, and hopefully the first of many.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Took An Xbox Showcase To Get A Rare Look Inside The Makers Of Pokémon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-freak-xbox-showcase-beast-of-reincarnation-pokemon-2000662351</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We live in a post-platform world. Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo are no longer treating each other like they’re adversaries of the “he who must not be named” variety in their marketing material. Though console warriors are still fighting that battle in comments sections like soldiers who don’t know the war has ended, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>is coming to PlayStation</span></a><span>, so the war is over. Not only does that mean we get games on more platforms than we once did, but we also get some brainbreaking moments, like today when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer Game Freak was featured </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>in an Xbox showcase</span></a><span>, and we got a rare look into the studio that made Pikachu.</span></p>  <p><span>The Tokyo office Game Freak operates out of has been the company’s home </span><a href="https://officesnapshots.com/2020/11/09/game-freak-offices-tokyo/"><span>since 2020</span></a><span> when it moved to be closer to Nintendo’s own offices in the same building, called Kanda Square. It’s been about as long since we last got a good look inside the company’s office, whose decor is based on the Kanto region of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i> <i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green</span></i><span>. While the studio was showing off its upcoming action RPG </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>in today’s video presentation, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>got namedropped several times over footage of the team working on the game in its Kanda Square office. The clips we see show an office that, in some rooms, looks like any other video game developer’s space, with concept art on the walls and computers in cubicles. But some rooms look much different, like one that is covered in trees to look like Kanto’s Viridian Forest.</span></p>

 <p><span>While </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s name was said a few times in the showcase and this room is an homage to one of its most iconic early “dungeons,” as far as I can tell there’s no sign of a Pikachu or Poké Ball in these brief glimpses into Game Freak’s inner sanctum. I understand why they wouldn’t show us shots of the team working on upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, but I am surprised that there’s not even a frame of iconography in these shots. That feels like a deliberate choice, perhaps to not distract from </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>The Viridian Forest backdrop does work for the upcoming Xbox/PC/PS5 game, though, as it takes place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy Japan in which nature has reclaimed much of the land. Still, it’s odd to get an intimate look inside the historically secretive studio from an Xbox showcase. It’s a shame Pikachu didn’t get to make a cameo appearance, but I sincerely doubt we’ll be seeing a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game on Xbox, even as the console barriers are falling down.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game Freak Addresses Your Valid Concern About How Its Non-Pokémon RPG Will Run]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-pokemon-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000662327</link>
            <guid>1413742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak showed a pretty lengthy look at its new action-RPG </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> during today’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>Xbox Developer Direct</span></a><span>. The studio is primarily known for its work on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, though. Given that recent entries like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span> were notorious for being pretty ugly and running very poorly on the original Switch, you might be wondering how </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>looks as good as it does. Will it end up having similar technical troubles? Well, we won’t know for sure until the game launches in the summer, but Game Freak was recently asked this exact question.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking with game director Kota Furushima, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game"><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>asked</span></a><span> about </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>’s ambitions after games like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> struggled with performance despite not chasing nearly the same level of same fidelity or scope. Furushima’s answer might sound encouraging for </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>, but it also feels like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is catching strays.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><b>IGN: </b><span>Game Freak has received some criticism in the past few years for the performance and look of some of its 3D open world games. </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> looks to be fairly ambitious. What would you say to those who are concerned that it might struggle in the same ways?</span></p> <p><b>Furushima:</b><span> I think when it comes to </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>, and I guess we would regard it as the scale and the ambition of the title, when we approach game design, we’re not looking to make, say, a title of a certain level of quality. We’re looking to deliver a very specific game experience, and visual fidelity and graphics, this is something that supports that game experience, everything that goes into that. That includes things like bug fixing, optimization. Everything is there to serve the gameplay and the experience. Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>The unspoken implication here is that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games are not the type of “specific game experience” that requires the aforementioned bug fixes and optimization. It feels like an offshoot of the argument people who run defense for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games make by saying “people don’t play these games for the graphics,” as if that means they shouldn’t still aspire to not look like GameCube games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>asks about the size of the team working on </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> since Game Freak is a relatively small developer that is also working on </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>projects year-round. Furushima says the multi-studio headcount is “quite large,” but the actual internal Game Freak team working on </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>is “relatively small” and mostly leading the project through direction and management.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realize the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we’re lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well,” Furushima says.</span></p>

 <p><span>It sounds like </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> might not suffer the same technical troubles as Game Freak’s </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games since it’s not being developed primarily internally like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and the upcoming Gen X games. Will any of </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>’s fidelity end up rubbing off on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>? Who knows. </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this summer.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ubisoft has confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that it is still working on the long-in-development sci-fi sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-release-michel-ancel-1849992412"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em></a>. This follows previous reporting that the game survived Wednesday’s massive restructuring, which saw seven games canceled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">including a <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>&nbsp;remake</a>.</p> <p>On January 22, Ubisoft told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email that <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2,</em> which was first announced back in 2008 and has popped up multiple times since then, is still in development and wasn’t canceled. The company behind <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em> also reconfirmed that the<em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> franchise is still a part of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">newly restructured Ubisoft</a>. Here’s the company’s full statement:</p>

 <p>“As mentioned in yesterday’s press release,<em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> will be part of Creative House 4, dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes. <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> remains a priority for us in the context of our strategy centered around Open World Adventures,” said a Ubisoft spokesperson.</p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Uyw5x2TIuaQ"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> was first teased all the way back in 2008</a> via a trailer that seemed to feature some early gameplay. That version of the game is long gone. In 2017, <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-lives-and-its-a-prequel-1796032984?_gl=1*1dmrw0u*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcxMDMxMy4yMDYuMS4xNzI5NzEyODE5LjYwLjAuMA..">Ubisoft reannounced</a> <em>BG&amp;E2,</em> revealing that it was now a large-scale open-world sci-fi game and a prequel to the events of the 2003 action-platformer. Since then, the game has seemed trapped in development hell, <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-montpellier-assassins-creed-1850164420">losing its creative director in 2023</a>. But apparently the game is still happening. <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744">One day. Probably.</a></p>

 <p>Ubisoft didn’t share any information on when <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> will launch or what platforms to expect the open-world game on. So the wait continues.</p>

              <p>One of Nintendo’s “old guard” appears to be retiring.<em> Spare Marine 2</em>‘s new multiplayer class is almost here. And fans are expected to shell out $685 for a gaming chair that looks like it was made out of Pikachu’s skin. It’s another edition of Moring Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Hey, it’s morning somewhere, right? Here’s what an early, third-person prototype of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/2014370210115948828">supposedly looked like</a>.</p> <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was Kensuke Tanabe’s last game</h2> <p>That’s according to a new interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/">Japanese magazine <em>Nintendo Dream</em></a> that was uploaded to <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574">Weibo</a>. “Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward,” he said, according <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">to <em>VGC</em></a>. “Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms. Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.” “Ms. Tabata” refers to fellow veteran Risa Tabata, who will likely succeed him. Tanabe is 62 and his time at the <em>Mario</em> maker dates back to directing <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> escapes another round of cancellations</h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that it’s one of the ongoing projects at Ubisoft that remains safe, even if it still might not ship for a couple more years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Kotaku</em> previously reported</a> that the project had a new creative lead back in 2024. The <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> remake, meanwhile, might show up a year later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/">than previously planned</a>.</p> <h2><em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>‘s developer admits it’s confusing as hell</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">👉 Discover your ideal DLC with this flowchart and find what fits your playstyle best! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DBXV2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DBXV2</a> <a href="https://t.co/fvmPZcK2of">pic.twitter.com/fvmPZcK2of</a></p> <p>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2014260786068148303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“<em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em> has a massive selection of DLC, and choosing the right one can be overwhelming,” the game’s official X account acknowledged yesterday (via<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-dlc-overwhelming/"><em> TheGamer</em></a>). The post-launch content roadmap is so convoluted, publisher Bandai Namco even released a flowchart to guide fans on what to purchase based on what part of <em>Dragon Ball</em> they actually care about.</p>

 <h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em> reveals its next playable class</h2> <p>Techmarines will join the game in Patch 12 later this winter. “Like all classes, the Techmarine comes with a unique Combat Skill (an ‘ult,’ so to speak) and his own perk tree with 25 levels to unlock,” reads a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/21/space-marine-2-techmarine/">new post on <em>Xbox Wire</em></a>. “But more than anything, what makes him special are the mechanical arms and automatic turret bolted directly onto his Power Pack.”</p>

 <h2>The latest <em>Helldivers 2</em> update adds a new mission type</h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731129453?l=english">Patch 5.0.2 is live today</a> and brings Commando missions that place players “deep behind enemy lines where their normal reliance on air superiority is no longer an option.” The description notes that “reinforcements have to be deployed in advance and destroyer support is a risky business with limited time.” Other changes include an overhaul of suppressed weapons to make stealth more effective. There’s a new Warbond, too.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>‘s next set adds more Mega Evolution ex cards</h2> <p>After almost a year away I’m curious to come back. Maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cfNZ_qLeOc">the Fantastical Parade expansion</a> is what will make it happen. It goes live on January 29 alongside a new messaging feature and random battles mode.</p>

 <h2>Gamer chairs are so back</h2> <p>Speaking of Pokémon, Back Pain, Inc., otherwise known as Secret Lab, has revealed three <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJVbw?object_uuid=273a257b-602c-4933-a6e7-1e998d30970f&amp;t=article">new Pokémon-themed chairs</a> based on Pikachu, Gengar, and Eevee.
