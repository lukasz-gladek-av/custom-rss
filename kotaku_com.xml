              <p>Premium brands love charging $100, $200, even $300 for Bluetooth speakers but a lot of the time, you’re paying for the label more than the performance. If you want real bang for your buck, the <strong>Anker Soundcore 2</strong> is a fantastic choice. Now, with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/">Amazon dropping the price from $45 to just $29, this deal is too good to pass up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Pocket Powerhouse That Delivers Where It Counts</h2>
<p>The Soundcore 2 isn’t your average small speaker: Inside its <strong>compact body hides a powerful 12W output</strong>, delivered through dual neodymium drivers engineered to produce rich sound even at higher volumes. One of its standout features is the BassUp technology which selectively boosts low frequencies in real time and makes bass tones punchier without causing distortion.</p>
<p>One of the big concerns when buying a portable speaker is durability and resistance to weather conditions: The <strong>Soundcore 2 handles that with an IPX7 rating of waterproofing</strong>. It’s a level of protection that can keep it underwater for full submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. It also makes it easy to clean it up—just wash off and go.</p>



<p>Anker’s famed power management combined with a 5,200mAh lithium-ion battery<strong> lets this speaker run for up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong>. That’s enough to last a full day of work or travel without constantly hunting for an outlet. Plus, <strong>fast charge technology</strong> means you’re back to full power quickly and makes it ready for your next adventure.</p>
<p>Portability is never sacrificed: Tipping the scales at <strong>about half a pound </strong>and measuring small enough to fit into backpacks, purses, or big pockets with ease, it fits easily in your pocket. The looks are clean and minimalist, and the controls are uncomplicated enough that anyone can become familiar with them quickly. And talking of Bluetooth, the new <strong>Bluetooth 5.0 standard ensures reliable and low-latency connections</strong> with your device and improved range.</p>
<p>If expensive Bluetooth speakers are out of your budget, then this Anker Soundcore 2 deal shows you don’t have to take out a second mortgage on a quality portable speaker that’s rugged, sounds great, and plays all day on one battery charge.</p>

              <p>Avast is one of the true giants in cybersecurity today, trusted by over 435 million users worldwide. As a core part of Gen Digital (which also owns Norton, AVG and Ccleaner), the company has long been synonymous with free antivirus software. However, in the face of increasingly aggressive and sophisticated cyber threats, Avast has evolved: The days of relying on freeware antivirus are numbered; Avast is now leading the way with robust pay-for security solutions that are <strong>designed to guard all devices and every corner of a user’s online life</strong>.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity landscape in 2025 is overwhelming. Microsoft and Identity Theft Resource Center data show that more than 600 million cyberattacks took place globally per day throughout last year. Nearly two billion people had data exposed in breaches. The bad guys aren’t even just going after big business: the primary targets are regular folk, with cyber thieves going far beyond mere viruses to steal identities, bank account data, and more using sophisticated malware and fraud.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Identity</h2>
<p>With insight into the reality of rising threats, Avast has grown beyond mere status as the free antivirus pioneer to an all-out defender of PCs, Macs, Androids, and iOS devices through advanced protection that keeps up with the cybercrime tools of the modern age. Paid subscriptions include a smarter and more comprehensive solution, way beyond yesteryear malware scanning.</p>
<p>A premium choice is <strong>Avast Premium Security</strong>. At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">a massive 60% discount dropping the first year down to a mere $31 (previous price being $78)</a>, it’s an affordable option that secures one device with premium features. Members are provided with virus, ransomware and phishing protection. It scans Wi-Fi networks to detect vulnerabilities and ensures your digital life remains unscratched by bandits looking to exploit your system. Regardless if you’re a PC, Mac, Android, or Apple user, this offer gives you the essential and robust security.</p>

<p>Add more, and <strong>Avast Ultimate</strong> has it all from Premium Security with extras such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/avast-vpn-vs-nordvpn">the Avast SecureLine VPN</a>, which encrypts your internet connection to shield your surfing and keep it private. For $43 after a discount of 60% compared to $109, you get Cleanup Premium as well which maintains your devices in smoother operation by clearing out garbage and streamlining their performance. AntiTrack technology silently in the background prevents trackers and conceals your online identity from snoopers’ view, an essential privacy feature in today’s data-driven world.</p>
<p>In a world where hacks and scams get increasingly formidable by the minute and the consequences of compromised data pile up,<strong> Avast’s premium security subscriptions are basic insurance</strong>. They give you so much more than traditional antivirus solutions: <strong>they safeguard your entire digital existence</strong> and provide you with the comfort of mind not just for yourself but for your family and devices as well.</p>
