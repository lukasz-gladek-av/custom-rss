One of these features is the bigger Joy-Con controllers which now connect to the screen via magnetic attachments. A brief clip on the company’s website gives us a better look at how it works, but it’s an innovation that Nintendo  first teased over eight years ago. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The current Switch has its Joy-Con controllers attach by sliding through a railing on the side until a locking mechanism clicks them into place. Owners then press a very (very) small black button on the back to release the mechanism to slide them back out again. With the Switch 2 there’s no sliding and seemingly a whole lot less friction overall, as the Joy-Con merely click into place and hold on through the force of magnets alone.</p><p>A short snippet recently published on Nintendo’s website shows this all happening in slow motion, including how the (much) bigger triggers on the back of the Joy-Con are held to release the magnets and pull the controllers back away from the screen. It’s a much more elegant solution and, if combined with other Joy-Con features like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported anti-drift Hall Effect joysticks</a></span>, mouse-like optical sensors, and a mysterious new C button, could make the Switch 2 feel like a bigger upgrade than it initially appears. </p><p>But it turns out that magnetic Joy-Con, one of the primary points of speculation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">throughout months of Switch 2 leaks</a></span>, weren’t actually a secret at all. Nintendo revealed it was exploring the feature as early as its pre-release breakdown of the original Switch back in 2017. Here is Nintendo executive and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> producer Yoshiaki Koizumi teasing the design possibility to Nintendo of America’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang</a></span>, all the way back then:</p><p>“We tried a lot of different things in terms of connecting the Joy-Con to the console and one that I was particularly excited about at the time was using magnets where you would just snap it right to the console, but as you would play sometimes it would just fall into your lap,” he said at the time. “But because we still wanted to have something that was sturdy enough for you to hold onto the console but also gave you that sort of satisfying snap that the magnets did that’s how we came up with the mechanical rails that give you a click.”</p><p>Nintendo has a way of making its inventions, whether in hardware or the games themselves, feel like they magically appeared out of nowhere, but often it turns out  that they were leftover ideas from long and arduous trial and error processes, later repurposed when the moment is right or newer tech makes them more feasible. So it seems to be with the Switch 2's magnets. I’m super-eager to try them myself and see how they hold up. Hopefully, Nintendo worked out all the kinks this time around. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ahead of the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, the organization behind the event released its latest annual survey of creators on the state of the industry. The feedback showed that gaming has been rocked by layoffs over the last 12 months, but also pointed to some silver linings for its growth and future heading into 2025. </p><p>This year is expected to be a massive one for gaming between the launch of Nintendo’s highly-anticipated new Switch 2 console and the long-awaited arrival of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, the sequel to the second-best-selling game ever made. But 2025 is also expected to be another year full of potential upheaval as the video game industry tries to figure its shit out amid both audience stagnation and record competition between the hundreds of high-quality new games released every month. </p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2025?_mc=edit_gdcsf_gdcsf_le_x_10_x_2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2025?_mc=edit_gdcsf_gdcsf_le_x_10_x_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025 GDC State of the Game Industry report</a></span>, whose data was compiled from the responses of over 3,000 developers, showed game makers are still reeling from cuts across publishers and studios both big and small (NYU associate professor Laine Nooney discussed some of the limits of the data <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/lainenooney.bsky.social/post/3lgbfp7nmdk2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/lainenooney.bsky.social/post/3lgbfp7nmdk2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>). Eleven percent of respondents said they were laid off in 2025, with over 40 percent of developers feeling the immediate impact of those departures. They’re also feeling the effects of generative AI, with over 50 percent of respondents saying their companies use the tools and roughly one third saying they have personally used them to make games. </p><p>Live-service games are another area in which developers are increasingly skeptical. Amid major flops like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League </em>and <em>Concord</em>, roughly one-third of developers at big-budget studios said they’re currently working on an online multiplayer game, but 41 percent of all developers said they’d rather be working on anything but a live-service project. That sentiment comes alongside conflicting signals from players, with Sony cutting even more live-service projects even as hero shooter <em>Marvel Rivals</em> explodes as one of the most successful new online games in years (for the time being, anyway).</p><p>One area for optimism? PC gaming. The 2025 GDC State of the Game Industry survey found that more developers than ever are planning their games for the open platform. The number of developers who said they’re working on a PC game grew from 66 percent in 2024 to 80 percent this year. The report speculates that this could be due in part to the popularity of Valve’s Steam Deck, which combines the convenience of a Nintendo Switch with the vast library of Steam games. (PC gaming has also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/new-report-says-pc-games-are-outselling-console-games-calling-pc-gaming-a-bright-spot-in-a-troubled-industry/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/new-report-says-pc-games-are-outselling-console-games-calling-pc-gaming-a-bright-spot-in-a-troubled-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grown by 20 percent since 2021 according to some estimates</a></span>, even as console gaming has stalled.)</p><p>GDC, which runs March 17-21 this year, includes curated video game history installations, award shows, and talks in which developers share stories and insights from their experiences making hugely successful and/or historically significant games  (GDC 2025 includes presentations on <em>Astro Bot</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and more). But it’s also a place where funding deals for new releases, from small indie games to bigger projects, get hatched. How to secure development funding while the industry is in flux is one of the big topics the conference plans to focus on this year.</p><p>  “The lack of opportunities in the game industry spills into funding opportunities,” one anonymous developer said in the survey. “Unless you have something that will be live-service or the potential to be super viral, it’s not easy to find a publisher.”</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d069670ac0f04af574f0c285b9554d42" data-recommend-id="image://d069670ac0f04af574f0c285b9554d42" data-format="png" data-width="1304" data-height="734" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the breakdown of what platforms developers are creating games for.

That’s followed next by PS5 at a rate of 38 percent and Xbox Series X/S at 34 percent. (Games can come to multiple platforms, of course, hence the total here far exceeding 100 percent.) Developers were also surveyed about their upcoming projects, and that data shows the console numbers going just slightly down, with 37 percent of these upcoming projects targeting PS5 and 33 percent coming to Xbox Series X/S. Switch 2, meanwhile, is trending the other way, leaping from an 8-percent target rate for developers’ current projects to 20 percent for their next ones. Meanwhile, despite PlayStation edging out Xbox as a development target, when it comes to subscription services,  Game Pass is still more popular to develop for than PS Plus. Thirteen percent of developers are working on games for Microsoft’s service while only nine percent are targeting Sony’s rival one. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="52e5853c94eae704ce19fdd70bab900e" data-recommend-id="image://52e5853c94eae704ce19fdd70bab900e" data-format="png" data-width="1295" data-height="727" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A chart shows developer interest in various VR/AR platforms.
