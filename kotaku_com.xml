Whether that pans out remains to be seen, but given that <em>Digimon</em>, arguably the most notable competition <em>Pokémon </em>had in the 90s and early 2000s, has been quietly running circles around Pikachu and friends on the video game side for years, I’m not holding my breath. I played about half an hour of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>at Summer Game Fest earlier this month, and though my time with the RPG was brief, it was a succinct reminder that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digimon-con-2025-story-card-game-app-alysion-new-anime-1851771263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-con-2025-story-card-game-app-alysion-new-anime-1851771263"><em>Digimon </em>has been cooking up some excellent, polished RPGs</a></span> in its own lane.

The titular critters live in a digital world that humans are able to enter via virtual reality. <em>Time Stranger </em>focuses on a different “server” than the one where previous <em>Story </em>games took place and is set in the digital world of Iliad, managed by a powerful pantheon of Digimon called the Olympos XII. </p><p>As a longtime <em>Digimon </em>fan, I’ve always been drawn to how the games riff on the lore by finding new ways to implement old characters and mythological figures into new iterations of the Digital World, and <em>Time Stranger </em>already has me intrigued. Recent <em>Story </em>games were set in a somewhat barren cyberspace world that was aesthetically compelling in a minimalist way, but weren’t that stimulating to walk around in. <em>Time Stranger</em>’s shift to Iliad not only opens up the visual identity of these games to include lush environments and lively towns filled with Digimon living in harmony; it’s also paving the way for new stories with different major players. <em>Cyber Sleuth </em>was a sort of <em>Avengers </em>moment for some of the series’ mainstays, so <em>Time Stranger</em> putting the focus on the Olympos XII for the first time in several years is an exciting prospect.</p><figure id="" data-id="ebad4016c5f9d6253b359155b66cab3c" data-recommend-id="image://ebad4016c5f9d6253b359155b66cab3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player walking through a crowded bar of Digimon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player walking through a crowded bar of Digimon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebad4016c5f9d6253b359155b66cab3c" data-recommend-id="image://ebad4016c5f9d6253b359155b66cab3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player walking through a crowded bar of Digimon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the short time I was able to spend in Iliad’s Central Town hub, I was excited to explore and meet all the Digimon living there as civilians, unbothered by the petty squabbles of humanity in the real world. There’s so much character to this little town that even as the game pans over it in a cutscene, so many lively details catch your eye. Little touches like seeing Zudomon using its hammer to pound away on an anvil as a blacksmith and Etemon hanging off the signage on the buildings make the town feel lived in, and nearly every inch of the town is covered in Digimon interacting with the world and each other like this.</p><p>I didn’t plan to spend most of my time playing <em>Time Stranger </em>comparing it to <em>Pokemon</em>, but the stark difference between it and Game Freak’s RPGs is top of mind for me right now after playing a bit of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>on Switch 2. Yeah, the games finally run at a smooth 60 frames-per-second, but the world still looks and feels like a GameCube-era tech demo, whereas <em>Time Stranger</em>, and <em>Digimon </em>games more broadly, feel like childhood dreams realized. They take risks, change up the formula constantly, and most importantly, they feel like fully realized worlds visually, narratively, and systemically. Whether it’s been in the <em>Story </em>series, the <em>World</em> games, or more off-the-wall spin-offs like the the visual novel tactics RPG <em>Digimon Survive</em>, this franchise has never stopped swinging for the fences, even after it was deemed the “loser” of the ‘90s and ‘00s monster tamer race. Maybe that’s what happens when you still feel like you’ve got something to prove and can’t rest on your guaranteed millions of sales. There’s some freedom in not being beholden to the same machine your rival is, and it makes for more interesting games.</p><figure id="" data-id="6fe0a657b735a9a16c7d8fd662ce453c" data-recommend-id="image://6fe0a657b735a9a16c7d8fd662ce453c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle between the protagonist and Parrotmon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle between the protagonist and Parrotmon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fe0a657b735a9a16c7d8fd662ce453c" data-recommend-id="image://6fe0a657b735a9a16c7d8fd662ce453c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle between the protagonist and Parrotmon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While exploration is much more of a priority this time around, <em>Time Stranger</em> is still focused on the monster taming aspect above all else. With more than 450 Digimon available to you, there’s a lot of room for experimentation in what might look, at a glance, like a pretty straightforward turn-based battle system. <em>Time Stranger</em> still utilizes the rock-paper-scissors structure <em>Digimon </em>always has, but it also has a <em>Final Fantasy X</em>-style swapping system that lets you adjust your strategies on the fly by switching between your active party and your benched teammates without penalty. Some of the battles I took part in were your standard random fight affair, but the boss fight against a super-powered Parrotmon really showed the potential of its turn-based battles. This clash felt more like a raid battle that required a lot more setup with support abilities, pushing me to prioritize defense rather than just bulldozing through with my most powerful attacks, and demonstrating that <em>Time Stranger</em> could be more dynamic than its predecessors.</p><p><em>Cyber Sleuth</em>’s story and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773"><em>Persona</em>-esque</a></span> vibe were the draw above all else, with some critics arguing that the battle system was generic and uninvolving. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-the-kotaku-review-1760797607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-the-kotaku-review-1760797607"><em>Kotaku</em>’s Mike Fahey</a></span> called them“a mindless chore.”) <em>Time Stranger</em>, by contrast, is certainly not reaching the elaborate, systems-heavy turn-based play of something like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span>, but what I played of it suggests developer Media.Vision is taking that criticism to heart, and I”m interested to see just how far it can take these systems when the game launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 3.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-1851784723<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo’s <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct went out June 18, revealing a vast amount of new information about the forthcoming Switch 2 exclusive, and the more it went on, the more we found ourselves absolutely pumped for the game. You can watch the entire 15-minute video below.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,196055,196766" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While we already knew that <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> was going to be a 3D open-world action adventure starring Mario’s first-ever enemy and that nearly everything in every level is destructible, it was hard to get a sense of exactly how the game would play. After fifteen minutes in its company, that feels completely different. This looks like it could be very special. (Jump to 29:30.)</p><p>DK is accompanied on Ingot Isle by Pauline, who, it seems, was trapped inside that purple rock we saw in earlier glimpses of <em>Bananza</em>? Who knows. But the important thing is, the two of them are then free to smash their way around layer after layer of adventure, each level set below the last, until you reach the core of the planet.</p><p>As the video goes on, we learn that DK can pretty much go anywhere at any point, climbing anything, and then also smash through or down any part of the level. It seems you really can bash down just about anything, which will&nbsp;hopefully lead to some excellent videos as people attempt to destroy entire levels. Oh, and he can turn into a zebra and an ostrich?! Amazing. He’s doing all this with the goal of finding Banandium, a precious banana-shaped gem, while also trying to help Pauline return to her non-ape-based reality.</p><p>As <em>Kotaku</em> watched the video, one by one we all declared our astonishment at how much is going on in this game, and how much we want to be playing it. However, like everyone else, we’re going to have to wait a month. The game is out on July 17, with pre-orders open now. Remember, this is a Switch 2 exclusive, and there’s no version for the original Switch. Presumably this was once intended to be a launch title, but needed an extra couple of months.</p><p>This really does look like the big title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">the Switch 2 is desperately lacking</a></span>. This definitely doesn’t look like it’s some sort of stop-gap before the proper <em>Super Mario</em> title, but rather a full-fledged&nbsp;<em>Super Donkey Kong</em> action game to occupy our summer. You know, if it plays as good as it looks. We’ll find out soon.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
