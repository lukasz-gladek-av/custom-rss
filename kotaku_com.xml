            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-qa="message_content" role="presentation"> <p>Former EA developer and <em>Dead Space</em> creator Glen Schofield really wants to make a new game in the sci-fi horror series, and is apparently already calling Electronic Arts <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">following the news that Saudi Arabia</a>, with some help from private equity firms, is planning to buy up the <em>Battlefield</em> and <em>Madden</em> publisher.</p> <p>Schofield’s last big game was 2022’s <em>Dead Space</em>-like <a href="https://kotaku.com/callisto-protocol-review-dead-space-pc-ps5-goty-1849848054"><em>The Callisto Protocol</em>.</a> It wasn’t a smash hit, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-leaves-the-callisto-protocols-striking-distance-studios">he left the studio he helped found</a> to build the game less than a year after shipping it<em>.</em> But he’s not done making games. He’s currently the director at Pinstripe Games, a studio that hasn’t announced what it’s working on, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners">and he also told<em> IGN</em></a> in a recent interview that he’s got “quite a few” ideas for more games, including<em> Dead Space 4</em>. But the last time Schofield went to the publisher to talk <em>Dead Space</em>, it wasn’t interested.</p> <p>“I went to [EA] recently and they’re like no, we’re not interested anymore,” Schofield told <em>IGN</em>. “I said, ‘I can get back the leadership team.’ I need the models from [<em>Dead Space</em> remake developer] EA Motive, and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they’re like, ‘no.'”</p> <p>But now that EA is set to be bought up by Saudi Arabia, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-deal-senate-union-banking-interest-rates-2000636023">assuming the United States government doesn’t get involved and block the deal</a>, Schofield thinks there’s a chance for <em>Dead Space 4</em> to happen, or at least for the franchise to be sold off and expanded into new media.</p> </div><p>“The fact that EA just got bought, I think there’s an opportunity. I’m already making calls. I don’t know where EA’s head is right now. I don’t think they made money on [the remake]. <em>Dead Space</em> needs to be adapted to different mediums — movies, TV series, it would be great. But I am more optimistic [since the sale of EA], because somebody new could buy [IP].”</p></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-space-creator-sees-chance-make-dead-space-4-ea-saudi-deal-2000636125]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-expansion-cheap-sale-bundle-star-wars-2000636124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/get-every-destiny-2-expansion-including-the-new-star-wars-one-for-just-35-right-now.1326835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The<em> Destiny 2</em> 2025 Charity Bundle is almost too good to pass up. I say almost because the actual state of the sci-fi MMO right now is so rough that this might be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927">worst time to hop into Bungie’s loot shooter in years</a>. At the same time, the bundle includes every paid piece of content for the game, including the upcoming <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion, for half the price of a new game.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.greenmangamingbundles.com/bundles/destiny-2-expansion-bundle-2025/">charity bundle</a> is being sold in partnership with Green Man Gaming and is only for the PC version of the game, but the majority of the $35 price tag all goes to the Bungie Foundation which uses gaming to help children in need. Here’s everything included in the bundle:</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Destiny 2 </em>base game</li> <li><em>Forsaken Pack</em></li> <li><em>Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Light</em></li> <li><em>Shadowkeep</em></li> <li><em>Witch Queen</em></li> <li><em>Lightfall</em></li> <li><em>The Final Shape</em></li> <li><em>The Edge of Fate</em></li> <li><em>Renegades</em></li> </ul> <p>That’s everything there is to play currently (the original story campaign and other content were sunset years ago). It’s a great deal, and the only thing stopping me from recommending it to everyone I know is that <em>Destiny 2</em> tends to live and die by the most recent expansion, and 2025’s <em>The Edge of Fate</em> is one of its worst. That’s infected the rest of the loot shooter with changes to the grind, gear, and progression that make the entire game <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-power-reset-2000632488">a drag right now</a>. Bungie responded with a series of fixes, including promises to roll back some of the most controversial changes, but that requires placing a bet on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future rather than investing in its present.</p> <p>The addition of <em>Renegades</em> is the one big silver lining for this bundle. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed expansion</a> is teasing some interesting ideas and new modes. At the very least, there will be a lightsaber sword everyone can obtain and mess around with. And if <em>Renegades</em> doesn’t help right the ship, well, I’m not sure anything will. So if nothing else, consider the charity bundle a super-cheap ticket to witness the rebirth of <em>Destiny 2</em>. Or, if things don’t turn around, its eventual end.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029"><i>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</i></a> is getting a free demo for anyone who hasn’t already played one of the best shooters of 2025. It’ll give players access to a couple of story missions and almost the full suite of multiplayer activities before they decide if they want to buy it or not.</p> <p>The free demo will be available from October 16-20 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and until October 23 on PC via Steam. It’ll include the intro and first mission of the story campaign as well as unlimited multiplayer for the Inferno, Decapitation and Vox Liberatis Operations (online co-op missions) as well as all Eternal War modes except for the recently added Helbrute Onslaught which is basically the game’s horde mode.</p>

 <p><em>Space Marine 2</em> is a sequel to the cult-favorite Xbox 360-era third-person shooter that delivers an old-school emphasis on meat and potatoes gunplay but with the impressive visuals of a modern blockbuster. It takes place during the Fourth Tyrannic War and is steeped in the lore and politics of the Warhammer 40K universe but doesn’t require you to have any working knowledge of the tabletop source material to enjoy the great art direction and <a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-saber-ceo-asmongold-youtube-comment-1851650858">old-school, AA charm</a>.</p> <p>If you choose to take the plunge, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is currently half-off on console ($35) and 55 percent off on PC ($30). The DLC is all discounted as well. But don’t forget, you’ll need a Game Pass or PS Plus subscription to play multiplayer on Xbox and PlayStation, even with the free demo, unfortunately.</p>

              <p>Quantic Dream, responsible for just&nbsp;<em>so</em> many over-hyped, anticlimactic, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-fans-of-detroit-become-human-hate-most-of-th-1828260985">faintly</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/heavy-rains-most-gruesome-scene-is-still-gut-wrenching-1796855768">racist</a> games, is back with some big news! Not only is it still, allegedly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-biggest-gaming-disappointments-of-2021-1848249172">developing a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> game</a>, but the studio known for single-player story-focused games is now also working on a competitive multiplayer game called <em>Spellcasters</em>.</p> <p>David Cage’s Quantic Dream is world-renowned for its cinematic story-driven games that promise extraordinary levels of interaction and choice and sometimes instead deliver <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/quantic-dream/david-cages-writing-has-a-message-but-its-not-what">badly written nonsense</a> about ninjas or something. So who better than the developers of&nbsp;<em>Indigo Prophesy</em> and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em> to pick up the endlessly dropped baton of the next great <em>Overwatch</em>-like? That’s the plan according to Cage who, in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">a blog post on the company’s site</a>, explained the much-expanded studio is working on a “competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.”</p>

 <p>“This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far,” Cage continues. “But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.”</p>

  <p>It’s honestly hard to see any of this innovative originality in the trailer that dropped as I was writing this.&nbsp;<em>Spellcasters</em> might end up being completely brilliant for all I know, but the 3×3 hero shooter looks astonishingly generic to my eyes, indistinguishable from a dozen other wannabes.</p>

 <p>Quantic Dream has had quite the odd last few years, perhaps driving its desire for radical change. <a href="https://kotaku.com/david-cages-quantic-dreams-accused-of-being-a-toxic-wor-1822068440#_ga=2.116815942.1198361688.1524304403-255961593.1515548411">The studio was accused by multiple former and current staff of being a “toxic workplace”</a> that featured homophobia, racism and punishing crunch; claims which were furiously refuted by the two bosses, Cage and Guillaume de Fondaumière. So angered were the pair that in 2018 <a href="https://kotaku.com/detroit-developer-quantic-dream-sues-french-media-over-1825453518">they sued the French media outlets that published the claims</a>, which led to <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-quantic-dream-executives-cry-ask-if-they-can-l-1847036252">astonishing scenes in a 2021 court case</a> where de Fondaumière asked if they were allowed to lie because they weren’t under oath, while Cage was reported to have cried, stamped, screamed and eventually stormed out of the court room. Then, for one final surreal twist, <a href="https://kotaku.com/detroit-dev-quantic-dreams-wins-lawsuit-without-actuall-1847716375">Quantic Dream won part of this case but without ever disproving the allegations</a>. (It’s even weirder, because despite&nbsp;<em>Le Monde</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mediapart</em> collaborating on its reporting about the studio, QD somehow won against one and lost against the other. Meanwhile, the third outlet involved,&nbsp;<em>Canard PC</em>, wasn’t sued at all.) However, given it lost another part, it means much of the reporting was upheld by the courts.</p>

 <h2>But what about&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>?</h2> <p>So anyway, it’s that lot making the next hopeful to enter the live-service multiplayer arena. And that’s also, we are led to believe, still making <em>Star Wars: Eclipse.</em> The game was&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-quantic-dreams-dramatic-new-star-war-1848176894"> announced in 2021</a> (following <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-ve-heard-about-a-quantic-dream-star-wars-game-1847708431">widespread rumors</a>), before going extremely quiet for a couple of years. Then in 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-eclipse-quantic-dream-game-delayed-anyone-die-1850865409">we learned it would not feature any “game overs” and that any character could die</a>. But then, another two years of silence. So is it dead? Apparently not. Cage makes a&nbsp;<em>very</em> brief reference to the game in his post, stating, “Of course, development of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future.”</p>

  <p>But literally nothing else. It doesn’t bode well, honestly, given it’s been four years and you have to think Disney would like something to show off. It has in fact been over seven years since the developer released a game, with its focus seemingly shifted toward publishing in the interim. It published last year’s&nbsp;<em>Dustborn</em>&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;<em>Under the Waves</em>, in addition to helping out with motion capture for <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p> <p>Now the company is splitting its focus, clearly hoping to do what Sony and so many others couldn’t, and release a hit hero shooter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever tried transferring a batch of 4K videos to an external hard drive and ended up waiting forever, you know how crucial a good SSD can be. <strong>Speed, reliability, and toughness</strong>: that’s what really matters when you’re juggling files between your laptop or camera. The SanDisk 2TB <em>Extreme</em> portable SSD checks all those boxes while hitting its lowest price ever on Amazon. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">it’s down to $149 from $209 which is the cheapest it’s ever been for this storage powerhouse</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable Power, Tough Build, And Lightning Speed</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with speed, since that’s where this SSD really boasts its strongest performance: The SanDisk Extreme SSD employs <strong>NVMe technology and up to 1050 MB/s read and 1000 MB/s write speeds are possible with it</strong>. That’s about ten times the speed of the run-of-the-mill external hard drive (HDD) so you can transfer massive video projects or backup your laptop in minutes, not hours.</p>



<p>Apart from its ruggedness and light weight, the reason for the popularity of this drive is consistency: You plug it in a Mac, PC, or tablet and the performance is rock steady. It <strong>plugs in via USB‑C and comes with USB 3.2 Gen 2 for full bandwidth</strong> and also operates with older USB‑A with the cable included.</p>
<p>On top of the existing 29% discount, it’s probably the lowest price-to-performance ratio available from SanDisk in years.</p>
