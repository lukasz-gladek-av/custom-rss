            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The fighting game lineup for Evo 2026 has been revealed and there’s a notable absence: <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></a>. Just three years after it launched, the content-complete sequel is not getting invited back to the world’s biggest annual fighting game event. Johnny Cage and Subzero will instead be making way for <a href="https://x.com/InvincibleVS/status/1996640662255816844"><em>Invincible Vs</em></a> and the <em>League of Legends</em> fighter <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882"><em>2XKO</em></a>.</p> <p>The Evolution Championship Series, another piece of gaming culture that was recently sold in part <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">to Saudi Arabia</a>, brings fighting game pros and fans to Las Vegas every summer for several days of <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2025-viral-moment-fatal-fury-meme-kog-go1-2000614619">big stage face-offs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025-2000614410">passion-fueled side-tournaments</a>. While<em> Street Fighter</em> remains king, other fighting games vie for top billing and occasionally circulate out of the main event. Despite having one of the wildest grassroots fandoms around, Nintendo’s <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-ultimate-melee-nintendo-switch-evo-2022-sony-1848598680">was a no-show</a> at Evo 2022 back when the event was owned by competitor Sony.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">EVO Las Vegas 2026 lineup:<br>-SF6<br>-Tekken 8<br>-Fatal Fury CotW<br>-Under Night In-Birth Sys:Celes<br>-Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising<br>-Rivals of Aether 2<br>-2XKO<br>-Guilty Gear Strive<br>-BlazBlue Centralfiction<br>-Virtua Fighter 5 REVO World Stage<br>-Vampire Savior<br>-Invincible Vs <a href="https://t.co/Ar5In2RCNn">pic.twitter.com/Ar5In2RCNn</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1998566054268907575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This year’s big changes see <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> dropped from the lineup while games like <em>BlazBlue Centralfiction</em>, released a decade ago, get called back up to the majors. Some fans are wondering if it will be a wake-up call for NetherRealms, whose reboot of the franchise wasn’t bad but never quite hit the “we’re so back” vibes many were hoping for.</p>

 <p>Other notable swap-ins include the new <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>, which despite some issues and a content-lite launch has marshaled a passionate community around it, and <em>Rivals of Aether II</em>, the 2024 2D platform fighter that some fans argue still feels like an Early Access sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em> is also MIA</h2> <p>Even more notable than what was ditched is what wasn’t added. The Sony-published comic book fighting game <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384"><em>Marvel Tōkon</em></a> has a 2026 release window but won’t be on tap for Evo 2026. That suggests the heir apparent to <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> won’t be out until late in the year. <em>Marvel</em> <em>Tōkon</em> feels like the only recent new fighting game reveal to break through to a more casual audience and gin up excitement outside of the hardcore crowd, so it would have been a neat pick-up for next year’s event.</p> <p>Developer Arc System Works has been using Evo to reveal new bits about the 4v4 fighting game, so it seems likely it’ll still be involved with the tournament series in some way, just not as an esport. The game’s continued to run closed betas that have garnered lots of positive buzz so far. Hopefully it doesn’t get delayed to 2027.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-nintendo-asus-rog-xbox-ally-drops-to-a-record-low-despite-being-a-new-release-with-3-months-of-xbox-game-pass-premium-included-2000651842</link>
            <guid>1378357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="517">As much as some of us wish for an official handheld Xbox console, I wouldn’t recommending holding your breath. However, Asus is giving us something very close. In partnership with Microsoft, Asus has updated the ROG Ally, adding official Xbox branding. Enter the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, a new handheld gaming device aimed to rival the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/">Released less than two months ago, the device is already seeing a solid discount. Originally priced at $600, it’s now 18% off, dropping to $490—a savings of $110 this soon after launch.</a></p>
<p data-start="519" data-end="803">So what makes this model stand out from the previous Asus ROG Ally? For starters, it now features an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and runs on a redesigned Windows OS, both of which promise to deliver a smoother, more seamless experience both while gaming and navigating the interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="805" data-end="837"><strong data-start="805" data-end="837">Play Xbox Games Anywhere</strong></h2>
<p data-start="839" data-end="1315">With the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, your entire PC game library is at your fingertips, and you can boot straight into them from the new Xbox App UI. This handheld lets you stream Xbox games from your console or from Microsoft’s cloud service, and the Xbox Game Bar can be accessed with a press of the dedicated Xbox button on the left side. Beyond just Xbox titles, the device supports Steam, the Epic Games Store, and other platforms, so you’re not limited to Xbox-exclusive content.</p>
<p data-start="1317" data-end="1557">In terms of hardware, the ROG Xbox Ally comes equipped with 16GB of dual-channel RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD. If that storage doesn’t quite cut it for your game library, the storage is upgradeable, giving you room to expand as needed.</p>


<p data-start="1559" data-end="2051">The device features a 7-inch display with 1080p HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, putting it on par with other high-end handhelds like the Steam Deck. At just under 1.5 lbs, it’s roughly the same weight too. The redesigned chassis pulls inspiration from the Xbox wireless core controllers, with contoured grips for better comfort during long gaming sessions. You can play on the go or connect to your TV via the dual USB-C ports, giving you plenty of flexibility.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">To keep you gaming longer, the handheld includes a 60Wh battery that can recharge quickly. Just half an hour of charging gets you back up to 50% battery life.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">With these upgrades, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally series is shaping up to be a strong contender in the portable gaming market, offering versatility, performance, and a solid gaming experience. And right now, it’s down $110 for the holiday season.</p>
<p data-start="2233" data-end="2544">For those seeking more power, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is also available, offering an upgraded processor, additional RAM, and a 1TB SSD—doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery for even longer playtime, making it a solid option for those who want a premium handheld experience.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-12-in-1-docking-station-returns-at-black-friday-pricing-after-selling-out-doubles-as-a-monitor-stand-2000651854</link>
            <guid>1378315</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re well into December now. If you still haven’t secured all your gifts for the holidays, the clock’s a-tickin’. Though, you’re not out of luck just yet. We’re well past the big deals days of the season like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but some deals are still holding strong so you can save big.</p>
<p>Take a moment to check out this Anker USB-C docking station, a device that does far more than simply expand the number of ports available on your computer. Anker designed it to function as both a powerful connectivity hub and a practical monitor stand, giving you two essential workspace upgrades in a single piece of equipment.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/"> At the moment, Amazon is still offering a notable 32% discount, dropping the usual $250 price tag down to about $170</a> — a savings of roughly $80 for anyone looking to upgrade their desk setup without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="543" data-end="1179">This model is a 12-in-1 docking station intended to transform a cluttered, cable-ridden desk into a space that feels polished, intentional, and comfortable to work at for long stretches. Its shelf-style construction is sturdy enough to support your external monitor, raising it just high enough to improve your viewing angle while simultaneously freeing up valuable desk real estate. Beneath the stand, there’s plenty of room to slide your keyboard out of the way when it’s not needed—ideal for keeping things tidy when stepping away from your desk or when you want extra space for meals or note-taking.</p>
<p data-start="1181" data-end="1512">Even a slight elevation of your monitor can have real benefits for your posture. By bringing the screen closer to eye level, the stand reduces the temptation to lean forward or slouch, encouraging a more ergonomic sitting position. This can help lessen neck and shoulder tension, especially for those who spend hours at a computer.</p>


<h2>Charge Everything at Once</h2>
<p data-start="1514" data-end="2163">Along the right side of the unit, Anker incorporated an array of ports and connectors that should satisfy anyone who regularly juggles multiple accessories. The Anker 675 includes a 100W-max USB-C upstream port for powering and linking your laptop, three USB-A ports, two additional USB-C ports, a full-size SD card slot, a MicroSD slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, an ethernet port for wired internet, and an HDMI output capable of supporting 4K resolution at 60Hz. Whether you need to transfer files, plug in peripherals, or connect an external display, the station provides instinctive access to almost every type of connection you might need.</p>
<p data-start="2165" data-end="2522">On the top surface, you’ll find a built-in wireless charging pad. This allows you to place your smartphone on the dock and have it recharge while you work, eliminating the need to keep an extra charging cable on your desk. The USB-A and USB-C ports each support data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, which is especially handy for moving large files quickly.</p>
<p data-start="2524" data-end="3047" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Underneath the stand is a spacious cable-management compartment designed to hide excess cords and keep your workspace looking clean and intentional. The entire structure is built from durable aircraft-grade aluminum, giving it a premium feel and solid longevity. Anti-slip silicone pads on the feet prevent shifting or wobbling. With dimensions of 21.26 inches by 8.66 inches by 3.54 inches, the station is broad enough to accommodate most monitors currently on the market while still fitting comfortably on standard desks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-m5-hits-new-record-low-amazon-goes-zero-profit-play-for-christmas-clearance-2000652112</link>
            <guid>1378312</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock earned its reputation as the premium standard in robot vacuums, essentially <strong>becoming the “Dyson” of automated floor cleaning</strong> with advanced engineering. The company’s newest flagship models command prices between $1,000 and $2,000 and target buyers who want the absolute best regardless of cost.</p>
<p>However, Roborock still produces more affordable models that deliver excellent cleaning performance without the premium price tag, and the Q7 M5+ represents this value-focused approach perfectly: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">Amazon has dropped this model to a record low of $219, down from its usual $359</a>, which makes premium automated cleaning accessible at a price that competes with basic robot vacuums offering far fewer features.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Suction</h2>
<p>The <strong>10,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> is strong enough to pull dirt out of carpet fibers and pick up pet hair that other vacuums leave behind: This vacuum has a lot of suction power, similar to what you would get from many upright vacuums which means that the robot doesn’t just move dirt around but it actually lifts it up and takes it away. The robot makes several passes over high-traffic areas and pulls dirt from deep within the pile where it builds up over time. This strong suction is especially good for carpets.</p>



<p>The dual anti-tangle system solves the most annoying problem with robot vacuums: hair getting stuck in the brushes and needing to be removed by hand. The main brush on the <em>JawScraper</em> actively cuts and channels hair into the dustbin instead of letting it wind around the roller. The <strong>side brush has a zero-tangle structure</strong> that works even in homes with long-haired pets or family members. This design lets you use the vacuum every day without having to flip it over and cut away matted hair every few days.</p>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus station lets the robot empty itself, so it can run for 7 to 9 weeks</strong> without needing any help: The 2.7-liter dust bag collects dirt from dozens of cleaning cycles and after each cleaning session, the robot automatically goes back to the dock to empty its dustbin. Then it goes back out to finish its scheduled tasks. You can almost forget about the vacuum for almost two months because of this longer maintenance period.</p>



<p><em>PreciSense</em> LiDAR navigation makes <strong>detailed maps of your home by bouncing laser beams off of walls</strong> and furniture to measure distances with millimeter accuracy. The robot uses these maps to figure out the best ways to clean that cover every area that can be reached without going over the same spot more than once which lets it finish jobs faster than robots that just bump around. With multi-floor mapping, the vacuum can learn the layout of each level in your home and automatically load the right map for the floor it’s on. You can set up no-go zones around pet bowls, fragile furniture, or places where cables might get caught in the brushes. This will keep the robot from getting into trouble without having to use physical barrier tape.</p>
<p>The <strong>hybrid vacuum and mop feature</strong> lets you remove dry debris and mop up wet areas in one pass: You can change the water flow from light dampening for hardwood to more aggressive mopping for tile and laminate. The <em>VibraRise 2.0</em> technology adds sound vibrations to the mop pad to help it remove stains better and it also automatically lifts the mop when the robot sees carpet, so the pads don’t soak your rugs.</p>
<p>In a market where basic models without docking stations often cost more, paying $219 for a robot vacuum that can empty itself and has 10,000Pa suction is a great deal. Roborock’s usual price of $359 already made this model a good deal, but the 39% discount makes it an impulse buy for families who are tired of vacuuming every day.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Goes Full Clearance on Its Gaming Laptop as the TUF F16 With RTX 4050 Hits a New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-full-clearance-on-its-gaming-laptop-as-the-tuf-f16-with-rtx-4050-hits-a-new-record-low-2000651800</link>
            <guid>1378267</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not all laptops qualify as gaming laptops. Gaming machines should have a powerful processor, sufficient memory, better graphics, and spacious storage – for starters. Models offering this and more, however, sit well over $1,000. If a not-so-friendly price tag has been holding you back from picking one, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">Amazon just slashed 27% off the 16-inch ASUS TUF F16, bringing its price down to $800.</a> You’re saving a whopping $300 on a machine that makes working on resource-intensive tasks during the day and gaming at night a lot more efficient and, honestly, fun. Just note that orders placed now are likely going to arrive after Christmas, so you’ll want to plan accordingly if you’re planning to pick it up as a gift.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Performance With Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a tough laptop with a lot of muscle, and that shows. Looks-wise, it maintains a classic design, featuring a subtle embossed TUF logo on its sleek cover. Open the thing up, and you’re greeted with a massive 16-inch Full HD display with 90% screen-to-body ratio, pushing vibrant, detailed visuals that bring all your favorite content and titles to life. The 100% sRGB color coverage delivers every color in a more realistic manner, which can especially help creatives ensure excellent accuracy consistently. Its 144Hz refresh rate, alongside Adaptive-Sync technology, actively reduces lag and eliminates visual tearing for a smoother experience; great for those fast-paced, action-filled games where everything moves quickly. Basically, your screen won’t struggle to keep up.</p>
<p>Immersive, studio-quality sound comes from Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res audio support, while the two-way AI noise cancellation allows for sharp, clear communication. As for the keyboard, a 1.7mm key travel distance makes for responsive controls. There’s a white backlight on the board that makes it easy to hit both deadlines and the bad guys in all lighting situations.</p>



<p>Power-wise, you’re covered with an Intel Core 5 210H processor, paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 laptop GPU with a Max TGP of 115W and NVIDIA Advanced Optimus. Translation? Ultra-smooth, fast gameplay, even during those intense sessions. The 512 GB SSD isn’t massive, but enough to house your favorite titles, plus some heavy programs, without throwing a fit. Despite the power, F16 keeps cool and calm as it works. That’s thanks to its 84-blade arc flow fans that draw in more air to maximize airflow, as well as up to 4 dedicated exhaust vents that let warm air out efficiently. The machine has also been rigorously tested to meet the Military Grade testing standard, MIL-STD-810H, letting you enjoy peak performance even in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. This laptop comes with a 56Wh battery that can help you get through an entire day without worrying about plugging it in. Recharging doesn’t take forever either, as the machine can hit 50% in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about it, but to wrap it up, if you’ve been after a reliable, strong work and play machine, we highly recommend grabbing the ASUS TUF F16 laptop, which is made keeping both creatives and gamers in mind. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">On a regular day, it would run you around $1,100, but you can pick it up for just $800 if you act fast.</a> There are no delivery charges to worry about either. If the post-Christmas shipping time is not a problem, get your orders in quick, though, as discounts this good tend to expire sooner.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-8tb-external-hard-drive-at-under-0-02-per-gb-is-practically-the-cheapest-data-storage-available-2000651777</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage problems aren’t just annoying; they also keep you from delivering your best. Constantly deleting old files to make room for new ones, or spreading essential files across multiple devices, is not fun. Thankfully, there’s a way to resolve the issue, and right now, it doesn’t cost a lot either.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6319/">We just spotted the 8TB Seagate external hard drive sitting at $150 at Amazon, after the retailer took 12% off its $170 tag.</a> Shipping is free for both Prime and non-Prime members, so you’re saving a bit on that front too, which brings the total down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6319/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredibly Spacious</h2>
<p>The drive itself is not massive. At just 2.5 inches, it fits nicely into any desktop setup without demanding too much space or attention. It’s also quite lightweight, which makes it easy to take your entire library with you on the go; just plug the drive into another laptop or PC, and access all your important files just like you would on your everyday computer.</p>
<p>As for the storage – it’s truly massive. The drive’s 8GB capacity is spacious enough for you to house all important data, whether it’s media content or work documents. You will be able to throw in thousands of images, hundreds of high-quality videos, a ton of movies (both the latest releases and some classics), long research papers, never-ending spreadsheets, your favorite gaming titles, and still have space for more. Basically, it can hold all that you currently own, plus all your future downloads. This capacity makes it great for creatives looking to keep all their heavy projects in one place, work professionals with years’ worth of data, and even students. You really won’t need to invest in another storage solution anytime soon.</p>



<p>Setting things up and getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is connect the USB hard drive to Windows or a Mac. There are no software or driver installations to worry about, but Apple users might need to reformat the drive to proceed. Once it’s connected to your device, moving files around takes minutes. That’s thanks to USB 3.0, plus the drag-and-drop functionality. Simply pick what you need to transfer and drop it in the drive; no need to click endless buttons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Over the past year,&nbsp; I have spent at least three individual nights yelling over the din of a loud New York City bar to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games-to-play-with-friends-multiplayer-how-to-sell-1851576183"><span>try and sell someone</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i><span>. Too Kyo Games’ passion project visual novel/tactics RPG hybrid is the kind of thing that you can easily convince someone is impressive, but getting anyone to get over the hump of its magnitude and actually play it is something that still eludes me as we approach the end of the year. I think at a certain point, I accepted that as long as I could get someone to respect </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>, that was enough for me. If anything, I consider the fact that it’s such a hard sell to some people a testament to its accomplishments.</span></p> <p><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i><span> might sound like too large an undertaking for the average person, even someone who might be interested in its bold premise. But even if you don’t get around to it, know that even the most celebrated games will never be as daring as Too Kyo Games’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-too-kyo-bankrupt-1851786150"><span>incredible Hail Mary</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Like most works by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-danganronpa-game-is-getting-an-enhanced-remake-with-a-twist-2000625415"><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i></a> <span>lead Kazutaka Kodaka, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>follows a group of high school students trapped within the walls of an academy. Though they’re not in a killing game like the unfortunate stars of Kodaka’s signature series (at least, not initially), the group of oddballs, freaks, and like, one or two normal teenagers are caught up in a violent scheme against their will. These kids are told that they’re here to defend the titular school from waves of alien invaders because </span><i><span>something</span></i><span> within its walls is a key to saving humanity, but before they can inquire further, their captor, Sirei, a ghost-like mascot character who’s obviously taking notes from </span><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i><span>’s Monokuma, is found sliced up in a trash can just off campus.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now these kids are stuck defending this school for 100 days and without any clarity. The three months and change pass with them all having to find the strength to fight for something they don’t know if they truly believe in, as they instead find belief in one another to get them through.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Hundred Line’s </span></i><span>100 days are filled with silly antics, tragic breakdowns, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/shuten-order-review-kodaka-danganronpa-hundred-line-2000621052"><span>compelling mysteries</span></a><span>. This is every signature pillar Kodaka has skillfully mastered over the years of creating high school whodunnits, all wrapped into a three-month timespan. Each day as the clock ticks down, a new clue to what actually brought these kids to the Last Defense Academy is unearthed, and with every passing night, a sense of dread lingers over even the smallest interactions. Is everyone here trustworthy? Is everything as simple as it seems? If you know Kodaka’s work, you know the answer is “no,” but even a knowledge of murder mysteries like </span><i><span>Danganronpa </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code </span></i><span>as well as the cyberpunk dystopian anime </span><i><span>Akaduma Drive </span></i><span>couldn’t prepare me for what I’d find on the other side of </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s tactical battles.</span></p>

 <p><span>As the “Last Defense Squad” grows in combatants over the course of 100 days, each member takes on different, highly specialized roles in combat. All of their big personalities manifest in different fighting styles and weapons only they can use, all spawning from a force called hemoanima within them. This is why these particular kids are fighting on behalf of humanity; they’re the only ones who can.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651797" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651797"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651797">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That specialization is why </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s combat</span> <span>doesn’t quite match the strategic play of something like </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, as it makes each battle feel like a puzzle to solve. Most characters have only one or two attack patterns; Kako, for instance, a meek younger sister in the group, uses a sniper rifle to avoid the scrap, and thus excels at long range. Then there are bolder heroes like the main protagonist, Takumi, who wields a sword that puts him on the front lines as he seeks to lead the group.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some might find these rigid roles limiting. </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s battles don’t feel like free-for-all scenarios in which you’re meant to move pieces around a board to your whim. Battles often spawn your heroes on different sides of the school, and those characters might not have great synergies with each other, so it’s up to you to figure out how best to defend the Last Defense Academy from incoming alien forces with the mini team comps you’re given on each side. The greatest strategy in </span><i><span>Hundred Line </span></i><span>is improvising, and sometimes that means making a big play that will take some of your own team members off the board in favor of giving the survivors an opening.</span></p> <p><span>Each battle is divided into waves, and your characters are all revived at the beginning of a round, so it’s perfectly viable to sacrifice a character knowing they will come back shortly. Some of my favorite plays involved using a character’s ultimate ability, a high-impact attack your unit can perform when low on health in exchange for their life. Killing certain enemies grants your team more actions before the opposition’s turn, so using a self-sacrificing ultimate to take out some of my foes and let one of my other combatants whale on a boss a few more times is a sacrifice I’m willing to make. Those decisions aren’t something you typically strategize around; they’re just making the most of what you have in the moment.</span></p> <p><span>After all, those spur-of-the-moment plays and intricate synergies are in service of taking down a mindless horde of aliens that mean to harm humanity, right? We should feel nothing tearing through them to save all our friends and family waiting to return to Earth after they’ve been given the all clear…right?</span></p>

  <p><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s 100 days come to a close pretty quickly, all things considered. The average player will hit that deadline in about 30 hours. But there’s a reason, even after having seen the end of those 100 days, that I never reviewed </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>when it launched in April</span></a><span>, and still wasn’t ready to when I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>declared it an easy contender for 2025’s Game of the Year</span></a><span> the following month. It’s what happens after you reach that final day that makes it one of the most ambitious and important games of the year.</span></p> <p><span>By the time Takumi and the rest of the Last Defense Squad reach the 100th day, pretty much everything has gone wrong. You’ve lost members of your team in the war, one of your own has betrayed the mission, and the thing you sought to protect has been destroyed, but what you’ve lost may be your only hope to make things right.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Deep in the depths of the Last Defense Academy, the team has found what they were recruited to protect: a baby swaddled in flame who has spent these three months gathering power to cover the planet in undying fire, killing the rest of the invaders and allowing humanity to finally return and rebuild. This baby, like the rest of the crew, is able to use hemoanima, and since he’s been storing up his power for all this time, he is far more powerful than any of the others who are capable of using it.</span></p> <p><span>However, when one of your crew betrays the mission and kills this fire-covered baby, they’re able to absorb his charged-up power and wield it in what seems like a final boss fight. In this fight, the ex-party member’s “Specialist Skill,” or an ability that only they have, is upgraded. When Takumi defeats them, he absorbs all this energy. Typically, his power is to rewind turns in battle, but now that gift is more far-reaching than it has been in the last 100 days. Now, Takumi can rewind much farther. In fact, he’s now able to go back all 100 days, and that’s what he does, hoping that maybe this time, he’ll be able to save humanity.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000002145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002145"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002145">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At this point, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>puts a </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>on its title screen, and Takumi must relive the 100 days and try to salvage the mission. Using the knowledge you have from the first time you saw this whole thing go south, you can get it right this time…maybe. This is where Kotaro Uchikoshi, </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s co-director, known for his work on the </span><i><span>Zero Escape </span></i><span>series, grabs the wheel. You don’t just watch the 100 days play out again as Takumi makes all the right decisions this time; you have to make calls that will drastically change the course of events. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>has over 20 routes, with each branching into one of several endings, all culminating in 100 possible conclusions. You can jump around the timeline as many times as you need to until you’ve either seen them all or you’re satisfied with the conclusion you received, but it’s up to you to use all you learned from the first route to try and find a better conclusion than the dire one you found the first time.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s many routes range in quality. Some of them are gags, like one that abandons all the stakes to make the story a slice-of-life comedy or a harem anime arc; others are genuine tactical challenges, like one that requires you to engage in long battles almost every other day in the three-month run. Broadly, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s many routes are chances for its writing team to morph and mold its core premise into different genre stories. There’s a route that turns into a slasher story, another that riffs on zombie fiction, and there’s even one that turns into a </span><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i><span>-like killing game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yes, there is arguably a “true” route that solves the broader mysteries, but the degree to which </span><i><span>Hundred Line </span></i><span>is willing to remix everything you think you know about this story to deliver something entirely unrecognizable is such an incredible swing that I can’t believe Too Kyo Games pulled it off. Giving you the reins to steer the story in one of its many directions is a bold move that can easily lead to moments of incredible discovery but also to frustration as you reach what feel like dead ends or time-wasting conclusions.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651798" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651798"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651798">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some of these storylines will tell you things you won’t find out elsewhere, and so playing through all 100 routes isn’t just something for the sickest of completionists; it does genuinely help fill out everything you do and don’t understand about the world you spent 100 days defending with blinders on. All 22 routes and 100 endings are equal parts supplementary reading and fully curricular. The real choice to make, then, is how long you want to spend with your hand on a wall, walking down the dark hallways of the Last Defense Academy to see every corner.</span></p> <p><span>I have only seen a handful of endings myself, and I told myself I’d go back to see more of them as the year went on, but I didn’t get around to as many as I wanted. In that way, I also recognize what an undertaking it is to play </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>, and I am arguably its target audience.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote: </p>                 <p>“The world’s most ambitious choose-your-own-adventure book.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Too Kyo Games</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p> Visual novel/Tactics RPG with 100 endings</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>The staggering breadth of genres represented in its multiple routes, the engaging, puzzle-y nature of its tactical battles, the incredible ambition.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Some routes aren’t great.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms: </p>                 <p>PC, Switch (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>April 24, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p> ~70 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>That’s why I can’t judge anyone too much who doesn’t get around to what is essentially Kodaka and Uchikoshi’s final form. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>is perhaps one of the clearest examples of a creative team making something for themselves, even when their back was against the wall. Too Kyo Games was in danger of financial ruin before </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>launched, and it still made something utterly unwieldy to the average person, rather than aiming for a general audience that might lap up something more palatable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So when I get a “Wow, that sounds cool, I’m definitely not going to play it!” when I’m shouting about </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span> in a loud bar, I get it. The most ambitious choose-your-own adventure experience in all of video games, full of annoying characters, a few dud routes, and a lot of trial and error as you jump around its branching timeline in search of a glimmer of hope, is a hard sell that even the most impassioned advocacy can’t always overcome. But</span><i><span> The Hundred Line</span></i><span> is still an achievement that most developers wouldn’t even entertain in a pitch, and Too Kyo Games made it when the studio had everything to lose.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651799" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651799"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651799">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Too Kyo Games easily could have set its niche obsessions of killing games, branching narratives, and mind-bending twists aside and created something that aimed for the widest personal audience in hopes that it would save the studio. Instead, it committed to what it knows, leaning into what has always made its leads’ work so memorable. Where others might have pumped the brakes on their ambitions, Too Kyo slammed its foot on the gas and hoped there would still be another route to follow when it reached the end. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy </span></i><span>may not be for everyone, but anyone can see what it’s done and know that it’s earned their respect.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792]]></content:encoded>
