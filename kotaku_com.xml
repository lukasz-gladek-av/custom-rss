              <p>The Fall semester has already started for college students, so why haven’t you gotten yourself a laptop yet? You may not need it for Syllabus week, but soon you’ll be sent home with more homework than you can imagine. Get a computer that can handle it without completely depleting your monthly budget.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/"> Right now, this HP student laptop is down 77% at Amazon. It’s list price is $2,800, but the deal is bringing the price to just $645. That’s a difference of $2,154.</a></p>
<p>Okay, hey now. That over two thousand dollar discount can’t be real right? Well, kind of. If we take a look at the price history of this item, we’ll see it’s only existed on Amazon since June of this year. After a couple weeks, it immediately shot down in price by roughly as much as it has now (mostly around $800). Since then, it’s been back and forth from a crazy discount like this and its full price, but never back up for more than several days at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Looking at the specs, the laptop is pretty good—but not nearly-three-thousand-dollars-good. It’s rocking an Intel Core i3 processor, which is fine. It does come with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage which is really good, but not pushing the starting price up&nbsp;<em>that much</em>.</p>
<p>So what gives? I’ll tell you. Some Amazon sellers will try to give the illusion you’re getting a better deal than you are. That starting price is just made up. The discounted rate is the real value of the laptop. But now if we’re looking at that, this laptop had spent most of the Summer at around $800. Now that school has started, it’s come down to its new lowest price of $646. For this reason, really we can say this HP laptop is on sale for $2,154 off. That’s not bad!</p>



<p>The HP laptop has a nice and large 17.3-inch display. This is great not just for getting schoolwork done, but if you’re in the dorms, you might end up watching a lot of your shows and movies from it too. Good to have a sizeable screen for that. Of course, you can always connect it to a TV or larger display using the HDMI 1.4 port.</p>
<h2>What Else Your Getting</h2>
<p>Other ports include two USB-A slots, one USB-C, and a good ol’ headphone/mic jack. The HP laptop also supports Wi-Fi 6 as well as Bluetooth 5.0 to easily pair wirelessly to some of your accessories.</p>
<p>Speaking of accessories, the laptop comes with a number of them as a bonus. You get a wireless mouse, and external CD/DVD drive, a full 1TB external hard drive, along with some webcam covers, dust plugs, and a cleaning cloth. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/">All that plus an HP laptop that comes preinstalled with Windows 11 Pro for $646?</a> Sounds like a pretty good deal after all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Considering we already had a Pokémon Presents just a month ago, I wasn’t expecting to see a new <em>Pokémon</em> game at today’s Nintendo Direct. Yet here we are, learning about a new game called <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, and it looks like a cross between <em>Animal Crossing</em> and a farming sim.</p> <p>In this Switch 2 game, you play as a Ditto who takes on a human form and helps build a space for the local ‘mons. It’s kind of a strange concept, and I actually hate seeing the little beady-eyed Ditto person’s face, but I’m down for more <em>Pokémon</em> games that show this world in a different light. The game will launch in 2026. Check out the reveal trailer here:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Play as a Ditto transformed into a human and shape an empty land into a beautiful home for Pokémon in Pokémon Pokopia, releasing on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> in 2026. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> <a href="https://t.co/zTiVcLHAgJ">pic.twitter.com/zTiVcLHAgJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1966500993593405711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Visually, the game employs something pretty similar to the minimalist, chibi style of <em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</em> and <em>Shining Pearl</em>, but really Ditto is the only character that it’s super noticeable with, as the Pokémon just kinda look like they always have. The one advantage of playing as Ditto, however, is that you’ll be able to talk to your fellow Pokémon, so they seem to function like <em>Animal Crossing</em> villagers with their own personalities, desires, wants, and dreams. The trailer shows a lot of different looks for your Ditto human, so you can probably customize them to your liking. There’s also one shot of two players walking around in the same area, so it looks like you’ll be able to visit your friends’ villages, too.</p> <p>Overall, it looks pretty neat.&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-style life sims don’t usually hold my attention for very long, but the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon </em>framing might keep my interest a little bit longer. I’m just a goal-oriented player so games that are just about maintaining something are harder for me to get into. But if you’re looking for something a bit cozier in the world of <em>Pokémon</em>, it looks like&nbsp;<em>Pokopia</em> will deliver that.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-screenshots-release-date-trailer-planet-1851772753"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> finally has a release date. The sci-fi shooter arrives on December 4, more than eight years after it was first announced at E3 in the original Switch’s launch year. Also Samus has a motorcycle. What?!</p> <p>The latest trailer opened with the bounty hunter tearing across the dunes of an alien planet on a <em>Tron</em>-like speeder. Will these be isolated parts of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> or is the sequel going more open world just like all of Nintendo’s other big franchises? What parts of the map will be locked behind doing a wheelie off a space ramp?</p> <p>Here’s a look:</p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697">As previous footage revealed</a>, the game will feature a new red suit for Samus and psychic powers she must use to navigate ancient alien ruins and solve puzzles. The game’s main antagonist appears to be Sylux, a rival bounty hunter first introduced in <i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i> who hates the Galactic Federation.</p> <p>Samus is also getting new <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> amiibo, including one with her on her motorcycle, on November 6, followed by a Sylux amiibo on release date.</p>

              <p>Yes, seriously! In a move absolutely no one was expecting, the all-time classic 3D gaming device Virtual Boy is coming to Nintendo Switch, via what looks like the ultimate Labo experiment. Via either a faithful plastic replica of the original device, or even a cardboard version, Nintendo is planning to bring 14 Virtual Boy games back to its systems. The 1995 device wasn’t exactly a break-out success, so it’s fantastic to see it begin given a brand new, deeply bizarre second chance some 30 years later.</p>  <p>As the subscription service feature that’s now called Nintendo Classics rapidly expands, perhaps there was hope that we might start to see some Wii games getting emulated, and the woefully missing DS category getting added, but it’s safe to say few had Virtual Boy on their bingo card. The three-decade-old device rendered 3D games in a red-on-black format, played by pressing your face into the massive goggles balanced on a stand. When it came out in 1995, it launched with <em>Mario’s Tennis</em>,&nbsp;<em>Red Alarm</em>,&nbsp;<em>Teleroboxer</em> and&nbsp;<em>Galactic Pinball</em>, all of which are set to appear in this new version.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000625330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625330"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625330">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What’s so extraordinary about this is that it obviously can’t just run on your Switch or Switch 2, because the consoles have no means of being a 3D device. Hence the brand new peripheral which recreates the original look, complete with far-too-spindly legs. But there’s also a cardboard version that will likely cost significantly less, and hopefully still recreate the same effect.</p>

 <p>The original Virtual Boy did not sell well, partly because it was very expensive for the time, and partly because it rendered games as crude red lines in 1995 when 3D graphics cards were just becoming a big deal. Clearly nostalgia makes all of that irrelevant, and this the most bizarrely appealing idea 30 years on.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000625329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625329"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625329">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There’s no clear date when it will be arriving in the still awfully-named Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, but we know it’ll coincide with the launch of the physical peripherals. 14 games will be added to the collection “over time,” including two versions if&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, and the almost forgotten&nbsp;<em>Mario Clash</em>.</p>
