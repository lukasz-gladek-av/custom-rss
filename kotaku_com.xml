And if you somehow haven’t given <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> a try yet, it’s worth the trip, at least if you’re on PS5. There’s an entire subway system now and a great (paid) <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion which is practically a second standalone game. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-july-2025-cyberpunk-2077-twisted-metal-1851785914]]></content:encoded>

Developer Funcom recently nerfed the endgame area’s PVP potential, turning almost half of it into PVE-only territory. That has unintentionally now resulted in the land covered in a bunch of giant boxes.

The natural progression system is harvesting stuff to build stuff to harvest more stuff to build bigger stuff.

Some fans have suggested making resource nodes no-build zones, while others wonder if there is a way to simply have the resources spawn outside of the structure. Others have called for the spawn points to be randomized each wipe, giving non-griefers a fighting chance to get some resources before the dust settles. Then there are those who think resources like  Titanium and Stravidium should just spawn back in Hagga Basin, <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s newb-friendly starting area. </p><p>In the meantime, PVE and PVP players are facing another stalemate in the Deep Desert and even some griefers are getting bored. “We found and downed another guy, landed by him and he tells us that it was his 4th lost Thopter today, he didn’t know how to pocket or something,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a PVP raider on the subreddit. “We gave him a ride back, gave him more melange than his small refinery could dream of making in a day’s worth of grinding and our old mk5 assault. After that, we realised that we aren’t built for Funcom’s creative vision of the endgame.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-t6-resource-node-base-patch-notes-1851785897]]></content:encoded>
