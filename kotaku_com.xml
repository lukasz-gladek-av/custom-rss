That’s one of the selling points behind <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, a new RPG from some of the masterminds behind <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Rebel Wolves, formed in 2022 by a bunch of ex-CD Projekt Red developers, revealed the game this week in a new teaser trailer. It looks pretty legit. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196626" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The first game in what the studio hopes will be an entire new RPG saga, <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em> is a narrative-driven, single-player, open-world, dark fantasy action-RPG. It’s being made in Unreal Engine 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S, and PC. The game is currently in alpha with more updates promised later in the year. That’s another way of saying it probably won’t be out for a while. </p><p>Players will step into the shoes of a young warrior-turned-vampire named Coen who uses otherworldly powers, including teleporting around like Nightcrawler, to fight off enemies and navigate a world where monsters come in all different forms. Like I said,<em> The Witcher </em>with vampire powers. Here’s the cinematic trailer with a quick look at gameplay near the end:</p><p>Rebel Wolves was originally formed by <em>Witcher 3</em> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz after he left CDPR following an investigation into workplace bullying, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/top-director-leaves-embattled-game-developer-cd-projekt&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/top-director-leaves-embattled-game-developer-cd-projekt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> ultimately found him not guilty of the charges. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-03/former-cd-projekt-developers-take-lessons-from-cyberpunk-debacle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-03/former-cd-projekt-developers-take-lessons-from-cyberpunk-debacle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to the same outlet last year</a></span>, he said he started the new studio out of a desire to go back to working in smaller teams where developers aren’t as pigeonholed into specific roles. He also said he’d be working on his empathy and prioritizing the well-being of the team. </p><p>Alongside its game announcement, Rebel Wolves also announced the hire of <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>’s creative director: Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz. The CDPR veteran was a quest designer on multiple <em>Witcher</em> games, including the card-based spinoffs<em> Gwent</em> and <em>Thronebreaker</em>. He was also in charge of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s quests before later departing after the game released to do narrative consulting for other companies. </p><p>  “Throughout all my years in game development, story-driven role-playing adventures have always been something I was most passionate about,” Tomaszkiewicz said in a press release. “For me, nothing beats being able to fully immerse myself and discover handcrafted stories and worlds. There are so many fantastic RPGs out there today, however, I feel that there’s not only enough space but also a hunger among players for more captivating stories.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Geralt, exhausted and ornery from his latest fallout with the sorcerer Yennifer, embarks on a little side-quest with the bard Dandelion to try to prevent all-out war between land dwellers and Merpeople. Lots of grunting, grim quips, and bloody fights ensue.</p><p>I’m still not sold on the animation style, and hopefully there are more twists than meet the eye in the full movie, but any chance to watch Doug Cockle, Geralt’s voice actor from the video game trilogy, reprise his role is welcome. The actor is also set to return in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322">some form for <em>The Witcher 4</em></a></span>, but that sequel, possibly still years away, will focus primarily on his mentee, Ciri. </p><p><em>Sirens of The Deep</em> is set in the middle of season 1 of Netflix’s live-action <em>Witcher</em> series. That show wrapped season three in 2023 and has been MIA ever since.

Since it launched, the game has received numerous updates  improving the mode, introducing new features, and adding new songs. And now Epic has added what might be the best feature yet.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/virtual-artist-hatsune-miku-beams-into-fortnite-festival-season-7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/virtual-artist-hatsune-miku-beams-into-fortnite-festival-season-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On January 13, Epic Games released Season 7</a></span> of <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. The new season is headlined by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/yPuI4l0jK7s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/yPuI4l0jK7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hatsune Miku</a></span> and includes music from the digital pop star as well as items based on her design. But this season also added local multiplayer. Yes, you can  finally invite your friends over and (sort of) recreate the magic of <em>Rock Band</em> in <em>Fortnite </em>via 4 player same screen co-op.</p><p>Even better,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-festival-season-3-guitar-controller-support-pc-1851429714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-festival-season-3-guitar-controller-support-pc-1851429714"> back in Season 3</a></span>, Epic added plastic guitar support for <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. So you might be able to pull out that old Xbox or PlayStation guitar from the closet and hook it up and jam together with players using controllers.</p><p>Now there are some restrictions on <em>Festival </em>local play. A small one is that this co-op mode is only available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.  The bigger restriction is that each player needs to have an Epic Games account and be signed into the console and <em>Fortnite</em>. Epic specifically says you can’t use guest accounts on either console. That’s annoying, but to get around this you could just create a few free Epic Game accounts and tie them to some free PSN or Xbox accounts. Then, when people come over to jam, just log each controller into those dummy accounts before playing.</p><p> Sadly, <em>Fortnite </em>has yet to add plastic drum support or the ability to use a microphone, so it ain’t quite a full <em>Rock Band</em> replacement yet. But hey, we’re getting there!</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
