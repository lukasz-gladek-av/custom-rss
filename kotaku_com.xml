              <p>Just two years after winning Game of the Year for <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, Larian Studios is wasting no time showing off its next project to the world. It teased its next RPG at the Game Awards and it can’t come soon enough. It’s called <em>Divinity&nbsp;</em>and it promises to be “even larger” than <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p> <p>We didn’t get any real details beyond that, or even a glimpse of gameplay, but we did get a pretty gnarly cinematic trailer that showed a man being tortured at the center of a bacchanalian ritual until hellspawn literally poured out of his body:</p>

  <p>The reveal follows a <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">multi-week guessing game</a> linked to a mysterious statue that recently appeared in the California desert. While fans speculated about possible connections to <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, others discovered a recent <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">trademark application</a> for long-running Larian series <em>Divinity</em> that included a strikingly similar-looking symbol.</p>

 <p>The <em>Divinity</em> franchise began back in 2002 with <i>Divine Divinity</i>, only the second game Larian ever shipped. It was a hack-and-slash action-RPG in the vein of <em>Diablo</em>, set in a world that revolved around magic and demonic cults The Belgium-based studio went on to release multiple sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, eventually culminating in <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> and <em>Original Sin II</em>, isometric RPGs which won acclaim with their shift to turn-based combat and focus on story and characters.</p>

 <p>None of those games were as successful as <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, however. Many fans expected the studio to move onto a sequel in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based IP, but the studio decided to move onto new challenges instead. “It’s going to be up to Wizards of the Coast, because it’s their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch,” director Swen Vincke <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964">said back in 2024</a>. “We think we did our job and so, for us, it’s time to get a new puppy.”</p> <p>There was six years between <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. Hopefully it’s not six more before we can play <em>Divinity</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Knights Of The Old Republic’s Director Is Making A New Star Wars RPG]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first big reveal of the Game Awards 2025 was <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic,</em> a new single-player S<em>tar Wars</em> RPG from <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>KOTOR</em> director Casey Hudson.</p> <p>Check out the trailer below, which doesn’t reveal much but does have some immaculate <em>Star Wars</em> vibes. No release date was shared.</p>  <p>According to publisher Lucasfilm Games, <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is set in the universe of the Old Republic and is a “spiritual successor” to <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Casey Hudson’s previous project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-scifi-bioware-1851707754">a sci-fi game being developed by his studio Humanoid Origin, fell through in 2024</a> due to a lack of funding. Meaning this new Star Wars RPG hasn’t been in development for long, I’d suspect.</p>

 <p>Here’s the game’s official description:</p> <blockquote><p>Led by Casey Hudson, Game director of the original <em>Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic</em> and the<em> Mass Effect</em> trilogy, the team of veteran game developers and storytellers at Arcanaut Studios is crafting an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness.</p></blockquote> <p dir="ltr">“Working on <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> was one of the defining experiences of my career,” said Hudson in a press release.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“With <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em>, we’re telling a completely new and different story with everything we’ve learned since – crafting an adventure about choice, destiny, and the timeless struggle between light and dark. It’s a dream come true to once again collaborate with Lucasfilm Games.”</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&nbsp;</em>was developed by BioWare and released in 2003 on Xbox and later that year on PC. The turn-based RPG was set thousands of years before the events of the movies and told its own unique story set in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;universe. It received critical acclaim, and a year later, a sequel developed by Obsidian was released.&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic 2: Lords of the Sith</em>&nbsp;wasn’t quite as beloved as the first game, with some feeling it launched in an unfinished state, but it has many ardent admirers.</p>

 <p>But regardless, the two games have remained incredibly popular parts of the franchise. They’ve been referenced frequently in other&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;media, with recent shows like&nbsp;<em>Andor</em>&nbsp;directly including elements from&nbsp;<em>KOTOR</em>. The games, as well as the spin-off MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>, aren’t considered canon in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>, but some elements have found their way into the main universe.</p> <p>And now it seems we are getting a new story set in this popular slice of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise.</p>
