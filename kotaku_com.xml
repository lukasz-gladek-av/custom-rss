              <p><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><span>getting Switch ports on Friday, February 27</span></a><span>. The 22-year-old Game Boy Advance remakes are widely considered the “definitive” editions of the original games thanks to quality-of-life changes and added areas and quest lines. The games aren’t readily available right now, so you’d think this announcement would have been met with universal excitement. But that wasn’t the case, as the $20 ports were deemed too expensive by some. Nevertheless, the games are </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html"><span>topping the eShop charts</span></a><span> already.</span></p> <p><span>I gotta admit, I do find the pearl clutching about the $20 price tag a bit surprising, but in my experience, it’s impossible to have discussions about video game pricing because everyone’s perception of what a dollar is worth is so different. As the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pricing-indie-steam-peak-content-warning-2000658886"><i><span>Peak </span></i><span>devs explained</span></a><span>, video game pricing is all weird, vibes-based psychology that some companies have figured out and others just kind of ignore.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>$20 is what you might pay for a nice meal that you’ll eat and then forget about, and here it gets you a 30+-hour game. But hey, I don’t know your economic situation, so I can’t speak to what $20 in your bank account means. I’m not here to judge anyone’s perception of money, I’m more concerned about how these conversations don’t seem to take that economic disparity into account.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">i lowkey dgaf them pokemon game ports cost 20 dollars i have a job why should i care</p> <p>— lil (@adifying) <a href="https://twitter.com/adifying/status/2024824271076233711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qst" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/L4e7BSIGOL">https://t.co/L4e7BSIGOL</a></p> <p>— TAHK0 ☕️ (@TAHK0) <a href="https://twitter.com/TAHK0/status/2025167322160529765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">How are both sides of this argument so fucking annoying <a href="https://t.co/moOgMlk9tT">https://t.co/moOgMlk9tT</a></p> <p>— Lost Levels Fan (@LostLevelsFan) <a href="https://twitter.com/LostLevelsFan/status/2025016667923730885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">whispers: *i actually think $20 for firered is pretty reasonable* 😬</p> <p>— Bob Wulff (@BobWulff) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobWulff/status/2024920916556185689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is literally all you are getting with Pokémon Fire Red and Pokémon Leaf Green.</p> <p>No changes, no online support.</p> <p>This is easily emulated on extremely low powered machines.</p> <p>$20 for a 20 year old Rom and Emulator is a wild price, buy what you want but don't defend it please. <a href="https://t.co/l3OfqiUz00">pic.twitter.com/l3OfqiUz00</a></p> <p>— Protomario (@Protomario) <a href="https://twitter.com/Protomario/status/2025614936450150869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">People would have complained if FireRed and LeafGreen was put on NSO because they would have wanted to buy it separately. </p> <p>Even if they were $5, people still would have complained.</p> <p>Free or nothing</p> <p>— Johniibo (@johniibo) <a href="https://twitter.com/johniibo/status/2025702770762793441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokemon Fire Red costs 13 Costco hot dogs.</p> <p>Hard decisions man.</p> <p>— Pory (@pory_leeks) <a href="https://twitter.com/pory_leeks/status/2025737366540009950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I remember once talking to someone about the </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition </span></i><span>remasters, and they flatly said the collection’s $60 price point placed it out of their budget…but $50? That could be the sweet spot. A mere $10 could be the difference between them playing some of their favorite games again on modern hardware and not doing so.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>were $40 when they launched in 2004, but now if they’re anything short of free on Nintendo Switch Online, it’s the type of greed they talk about in the Bible. The irreconcilable way conflicting people talk about video game prices is born from those economic discrepancies, not everyone makes the same money, but also some people will just view any old game that costs money as a ripoff. It’s an unwinnable, unsolvable problem because everyone’s economic background is different, influenced by factors beyond their control, and is all based in a society that is wringing every cent out of all of us at any given moment. But that truth won’t stop the arguments from continuing, with anyone willing to pay $20 for an old game being deemed a shill and anyone unwilling being called poor. Whatever the case, many people are clearly willing to pay $20 to go back to Kanto again.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-rob-robot-trailer-2000669425"><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em></a>arrives in theaters in April. We know <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-yoshi-birdo-baby-2000662854">Yoshi, Bowser Jr., and Rosalina</a> will be joining the sequel alongside the main returning characters, Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Peach. But according to a new leak courtesy of a theater chain’s website, another new face is set to show up in the animated sequel.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-description-appears-to-spoil-a-major-unannounced-character">As spotted by <em>IGN</em></a>, United Kingdom-based fancy movie theater chain Everyman recently posted a new text description for the upcoming blockbuster that just straight up lists Wario. The totally new, not-yet-announced-to-be-in-this-movie villain who is seemingly going to be a part of <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> hasn’t shown up in any of Nintendo’s past marketing beats or trailers. <a href="https://www.everymancinema.com/film-listing/327878-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/#coming-soon:~:text=After%20defeating%20Bowser%20and%20saving%20Brooklyn%2C%20Mario%20faces%20Wario%20and%20Bowser%20Jr.%27s%20evil%20alliance.%20Now%2C%20alongside%20his%20friends%20and%20Yoshi%2C%20he%20must%20stop%20their%20plans%20for%20world%20domination.">Here’s the description</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“After defeating Bowser and saving Brooklyn, Mario faces <strong>Wario</strong> and Bowser Jr.’s evil alliance. Now, alongside his friends and Yoshi, he must stop their plans for world domination.”</p></blockquote> <p>Well, that sure sounds like Wario is going to be in this movie! Of course, calling this a spoiler is probably inaccurate as it’s likely to be revealed in Nintendo and Universal’s own pre-release marketing rollout via a new teaser or something before the movie’s April 1 debut. But at least for now, Wario’s inclusion in the <em>Mario</em> movie sequel has yet to be announced. We do know that Chris Pratt, who voices Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/chris-pratt-supposedly-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">has hinted that there are more unannounced characters left to be revealed</a>. So he’s likely referencing Wario, assuming this leaked description is accurate. And if it is, it sounds like Wario will play a big role in the film alongside Bowser Jr.</p> <p>Now, what I’m really excited about is that if Wario is in this movie, that means I can raise the chance of <a href="https://kotaku.com/waluigi-debuted-20-years-ago-today-and-i-respect-him-a-1844460557">Nintendo’s horrible affront to nature, Waluigi,</a> showing up in this flick from 1 percent to a solid 10 percent. Maybe more! How exciting.</p>

              <p>After <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084">the shock resignation of Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond from Xbox last week</a>, the gaming world is attempting to piece together exactly <a href="https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114">what will happen next to Microsoft’s gaming brand</a>, especially under the auspices of new leader Asha Sharma. Why has someone with a background in AI and not gaming been put at the helm? And wait, she said <em>what</em> about birthrates and AI?</p> <p>Big tech’s obsession with birthrate figures is something that should certainly make you feel uncomfortable, given it’s usually about half a step removed from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-are-elon-musk-and-marc-andreesen-obsessed-with-birth-rates/">matters far more sinister</a>. Which is why it’s so disappointing to hear Asha Sharma, in an interview on a podcast from five months ago, saying that the thing she thinks about the most—other than GPUs—is whether her son “will have classmates in the future.” (Thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samred.com/post/3mfdstcvges2c">Sam Machkovech</a>.) This is because, she says, “fertility rates are declining, the average birthrate in the ’90s when we were growing up was, like, 3, and now it’s 2.3, and in 2050 it’s estimated to be below replacement.” This is strange on its own, and also completely wrong, but her next words make it far weirder. “I think that AI can have such a big effect on it, and already is.”</p>

 <p>Sharma goes on to give examples of this, like how she’s heard about a hospital in London that’s using AI to improve the fertility success rate of IVF, the “amazing story” of how ChatGPT 5 is “helping in healthcare,” and how Stanford was a big customer of hers, using AI for “tumor reviews.”</p>  <p>Of course, the reason for the declining birthrate in the U.S. is multifactorial, but almost certainly primarily about income. In the affluent ’90s, people felt confident about being able to afford two or three children, but in the 2020s that’s a far more costly prospect. If people in big tech were genuinely concerned about the number of children being born, their attention would be wholly focused on <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2026/is-the-us-birth-rate-declining">making American lives more affordable, providing better benefits and support, and increasing wages</a>. And not, say, on replacing workers with ineffectual AI while driving industries that rely on paying low incomes.</p>

 <p>Sharma’s numbers are <em>way</em> off, as it happens. The fertility rate wavered between 1.9 and 2.0 in the 1990s, and hasn’t been close to her claimed 3 since the mid-60s. It dipped as low as 1.6 after steady decline following the financial crash of 2008, but in recent years has begun to recover: it was back up to 1.8 in 2025. So in fact a difference of 0.1 since Sharma’s heyday of baby births.</p>

 <p>But to put everyone’s minds at rest regarding those empty classrooms: As it turns out, we don’t just distribute however many children are around into the current number of classrooms. That would be a weird system. So even if birthrates were to suddenly halve, we’d just have…fewer schools. Am I really explaining this to the head of Xbox?</p>
