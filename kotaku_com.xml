But while many players have spent the opening weekend of the game’s release bleeding out on cosmic shores, some have been making the game look trivially easy. </p><p>YouTuber Youwy decided to take on Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow solo and—most importantly—without gaining a single level (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/someones-already-completed-a-solo-elden-ring-nightreign-run-at-level-1-and-as-is-tradition-the-power-of-status-effects-pulled-through/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/someones-already-completed-a-solo-elden-ring-nightreign-run-at-level-1-and-as-is-tradition-the-power-of-status-effects-pulled-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>). He played Executor, the dexterity-based Nightfarer who can parry attacks. The fights revolve around jumping, dodging, and managing stamina consumption like a farmer in a drought. Even more crucial was a starting build that included the Night of Miasma and Night of the Wise relics, giving a base weapon with tons of starting status ailments that can just be upgraded through the run. “I sometimes can’t beat the 1st night and bro is out here doing this solo and level 1...WP,” one fan wrote in the comments.</p><p>Then there was YouTuber Ongbal, who used the Executor class to take out the <em>Nightreign</em>’s final boss without any outside help (so spoilers, obviously, if you don’t want to know anything before playing it for yourself). Ongbal is well-known for <em>Elden Ring </em>hitless runs, but he hasn’t gotten there just yet with Heolstor, a boss you can really tell FromSoftware had fun designing. Once again making use of Executor’s parry, which lets players treat <em>Nightreign </em>more like <em>Sekiro</em>, he takes the final boss down in less than six minutes. And this was before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-102-solo-changes-runes-ps5-1851783188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-102-solo-changes-runes-ps5-1851783188">a new patch making solo play easier</a></span> went live on Monday (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l1ejiu/playing_solo_mode_on_the_new_patch_rn_and_wow/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l1ejiu/playing_solo_mode_on_the_new_patch_rn_and_wow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is already making a big difference for some players</a></span>). </p><p>One thing that makes N<em>ightreig</em>n’s boss fights so tough is the work players have to do to get to them. Unlike past games, where you can beeline for the encounter and practice over and over until you’ve mastered it, <em>Nightreign</em> requires players to engage in a 40-minute open-world farming session beforehand. As a result, most players probably only spend about a ninth of their playtime actually learning how each Nightlord works. Some have already called for a practice mode to make training easier. That’s one request I don’t see FromSoftware’s granting anytime soon though. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And no, you’re right, that’s not a Mega Charizard in that mind-blowing piece of food art—Megas are blue and gray—but that’s because you’re not looking at it <em>through an app.</em></p><p>Look, forgive my overexcitement—I live in the UK, where we’re lucky if a cafe sells something that even vaguely resembles food, let alone something as visually impressive as these meals. Sad, floppy, undercooked bacon and a fried egg that’s inexplicably grey? I’m covered. But look at this! Look at the care! I mean, who knows, maybe it tastes awful, but it’s so pretty.</p><p>Apparently, that stone you see in the corner of the plate determines whether your meal is going to become a Mega Charizard X or Y when viewed through an app on your phone.

The cafes are also serving a Mega Ampharos-themed caramel ice cream cake, and it looks just as intricate.</p><p>I mean, I assume it does. I’m working on faith here, just assuming that what you actually get at a Japanese Pokémon Cafe would be faithful to the images released for publicity, and not the equivalent of the difference between a picture of a MacDonald’s burger and the depressingly congealed dollop of indistinguishable foodstuffs you’re served.

Is the ‘Zard so perfectly crafted that it can come to life in the app, climb off the plate, attack the salt and pepper? And why can’t <em>we</em> have food that looks like this?!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
