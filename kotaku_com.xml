              <p><span>Huntr/x may be a fictional K-pop group, but Netflix has managed to capture one part of real-world K-pop stardom in its official </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> merchandise: photocards. These little pieces of cardboard usually depict fans’ favorite K-pop idols in anything from professional headshots to candid photos you might find on their camera roll. While Netflix is only now really hitting the merchandise angle hard after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-derpy-artist-kids-all-ages-animation-2000621394"><span>animated musical’s runaway success</span></a><span>, one thing it planned ahead for was that fans might want photocards of their favorite members. I even got one of the lead singer, Rumi, when I saw the film at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>sing-along showings last month</span></a><span>. Now, the film’s soundtrack CD is out, and each disc comes with one random photocard of one of the members sealed inside. And since fans love to collect things, the random photocard inside the album has got people buying multiple copies, reselling, and trading like they’re prized </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards.</span></p> <p><span>Because the photocard is randomized, the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack is basically a blind box. Huntr/x has three members, so there’s a 33 percent pull rate for each card. So it’s entirely possible you could buy three copies of the album and get the same photocard each time, like this TikTok user did:</span></p>   <p><span>That’s how the dice fall sometimes. All these collection crazes are essentially gambling, and while the odds of getting all three Huntr/x photo cards are better than those in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>TCG pull, you can still end up spending a pretty penny on multiple copies of the album trying to complete the set. This has made unboxings a new trend within the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>community, much like you see in most TCG fandoms.&nbsp;</span></p>

         <p><span>Unfortunately, this also means that we’re starting to see resellers </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/226950263213?_skw=kpop+demon+hunters+cd+photocard&amp;itmmeta=01K459CDHAKAXC06RYPMFCKCVQ&amp;hash=item34d74a31ad:g:nEQAAeSw6INos~Fc&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1e00N5FWhjTc9V9pI53JjABq5WC9KmiL4ZgdVBpZUY8teNZwcWWlaL7vBKUzypUdUm1F1n55tsaNWQlkEr6eMb2qB9PLELWiX%2Beb1wk%2FfK4tvlegg3QrdH%2BDTltwkDUUMFH%2BCXYQ%2BnFikC0lzc5LRm5ETHV%2Bd0sLdohWpqEbMOMKJLOGb9Ttw%2B%2BwlpTWgIxzGq2i3jGzKtQimfQu3U6o8rh24%2Bzp3Guisao6hcJMx0Ioyycy%2BsUEdsaimtBaRcOU5tGmaPnlsjQWEHnBLZ3efAF%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_TYsamhZg"><span>upcharging for opened copies that have a confirmed photocard</span></a><span>.

Even as a pretty big fan of the movie and its fictional girl group, I can’t stomach the thought of spending that much to try and complete the set. Y’all stay safe out there, though.</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is officially the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>most-watched English film in Netflix’s history</span></a><span>, and the company is reportedly in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>early talks about working with Sony Animation on a sequel</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>Roborock is celebrating its 11th birthday and instead of just blowing out the candles, the company is going to be giving the gifts to its customers. For a limited time, the entire line of smart robot vacuums is available with massive discounts and the discounts are so good that <strong>most of the models have reached their record low prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Among these, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3842/">Roborock Q8 Max is our favorite, and it’s currently on sale at $179, down from $599</a>. It’s not the newest model in the series but in<strong> terms of value for money it’s unbeatable</strong>, which is also why it’s the company’s best-selling unit in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3842/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<h2>Perfect for Everyday</h2>
<p>The powerful suction, <strong>which is 5500 Pa</strong>, is one of the first things you notice and it gives it the cleaning capability that’s usually reserved for high-end devices. Dust, crumbs, tiny particles and embedded dirt in carpets all disappear just as easily as lighter material resting on hardwood. Supporting this power is <strong>Roborock’s DuoRoller brush system</strong> that’s a smart twin roller design that’s resistant to hair tangling and rolls easily across a range of surfaces. For pet owners, this is peace of mind that the vacuum won’t be choked after a single pass through a hairy patch in the living room.</p>
<p>But a robot vacuum is more than just brute force, because if it doesn’t clean intelligently, performance quickly becomes frustrating: That’s where the Q8 Max differs from bargain-class machines. With Roborock’s PreciSense LiDAR navigation system, <strong>it accurately scans and maps the home</strong>, and builds a detailed layout that allows it to map routes logically. Combined with obstacle detection technology, the Roborock Q8 Max neatly avoids cords, toys, and table legs, so it gets stuck less and has more time actually cleaning.</p>



<p>Another reason this model has been so popular is that it does not just vacuum,<strong> it also mops and it does both in a single pass</strong>. The onboard electronic water tank has thirty levels of flow control so you can adjust the mop output to clean anything from sensitive hardwood to tile. This means beyond a surface touch-up, you get a deeper clean without needing to switch devices or start multiple cycles.</p>
<p>Battery life and independence are also crucial to the experience: The <strong>5200 mAh battery offers up to four hours of runtime from a single charge</strong>, and covers areas as large as 300 square meters in one go. To further simplify upkeep, the automatic dust-emptying dock holds weeks’ worth of debris in its 2.5-liter sealed bag. For most households, that means quite literally <strong>not needing to consider bin emptying for nearly two months</strong> as your robot does the lion’s share of the floor cleaning quietly in the background. Add in Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri compatibility, and it is a home companion that responds to voice commands without demanding attention in return.</p>
<p>That’s why the Q8 Max has been the best-seller for Roborock.</p>
<p>With Roborock celebrating its 11 years of innovation, getting the opportunity to grab the Q8 Max at this all-time low&nbsp; price point makes it a no-brainer.</p>
