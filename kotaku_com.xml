              <p>Who remembers<a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661"><em> Spectre Divide</em></a>? It was a 2024 tactical first-person multiplayer shooter with eye-catching stylized art style and a novel gameplay hook: you could swap between clones during matches as you hunted enemies and defended objectives. It came out around the same time as <em>Concord</em> and briefly seemed like an antidote to its excesses and shortcomings. Instead, it just failed more slowly and less spectacularly.</p> <p>It was made by Mountaintop Studios, which was founded in 2020 by ex-Oculus guys Nate Mitchell and Matt Hansen, who had the ears of investors. Seizing on gaming’s boom during the early pandemic, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/mountaintop-studios-30m-funding-shoud-zedd/">they turned $5.5 million in seed money into a $30 million early funding round</a>. They continued raising tens of millions as the game approached launch and tried to make a splash with contributions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0wXIu-HUq0">high-profile streamers like Shroud</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Spectre Divide</em> came out in September 2024 and peaked at over 30,000 concurrents on Steam, only to instantly begin its long and painful descent. A barrage of complaints about server issues and latency immediately tanked the Steam rating, followed by frustrations over matchmaking fairness and the lack of common features like a battle pass. It was a free-to-play game, so the barrier to entry was low, but some cosmetic bundles were absurdly overpriced.</p> <p>“That fucking killed us,” Hansen <a href="https://80.lv/articles/nate-mitchell-and-matt-hansen-on-the-death-of-spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios">told <em>80.lv</em></a> last year. “It killed our early momentum, which is critical for any new game.” By they time they addressed all of the early problems, the player counts were too low on PC to get fast and fair matchmaking, let alone generate meaningful post-launch revenue to keep the game afloat. Mountaintop pivoted to releasing a console version as soon as possible but it was already too late. <em>Spectre Divide</em> was in a death spiral.</p>

 <h2>The dead game death sentence</h2> <p>It made a bad first impression, with intrigue over the innovative take on what was essentially <em>Counter-Strike</em> in a bubblegum wrapper overshadowed by review-bombing over legitimate but temporary issues. Most players quickly popped back to their existing online games of choice. Anyone new who came along found a much slower, more lopsided matchmaking pool to introduce them to the game.</p>

 <p>Who wants to be caught buying a ticket for the Titanic after it’s already hit the iceberg? Who wants to be seen eating at a restaurant that’s almost entirely empty, no matter how good their tacos or smash burger are? A month after launch,<em> Spectre Divide</em> had a peak concurrent count of just under 3,000 players and was already battling the “dead game” stench wafting around its subreddit and Steam review comments.</p> <p>“The player count is such a self-fulfilling prophecy in and of itself,” Mitchell told me at the time. He called Steam concurrents the new Metacritic scores, a metric to batter games around with in service of competing agendas and narratives. “If people see the player count going up, then their articles get written about it, and then people come in, if it’s going down, people write articles, they’re like, this game’s not going to be around so I’m not going to invest my time in it. And it’s such a tough thing. I don’t think we expected that [back when we started development].”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000668229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668229"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668229">Mountaintop Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>He continued, “‘Dead game’ is not the most constructive feedback. So I much prefer when someone writes online, ‘Hey, the gunplay is not for me, and here’s why, and here’s how I think they should change it.’ But ultimately, it’s okay, you know, it’s on us…we deserve some of those, you know, sort of dead game memes at the end of the day.” In hindsight a year later, Hansen told <em>80.lv</em>, “Some players were saying it was a dead game within one day of release but we always felt like we were one update away from turning things around.”</p> <p>The Mountaintop founders have tried to Monday-morning-quarterback what might have turned things around for <em>Spectre Divide</em>. Delaying development to launch in a better place? Saving the marketing and media blitz for day-one instead of a closed beta? Mountaintop took a $65 million shot and missed. Some players looked at <em>Spectre Divide</em> and immediately felt it was destined to fail. Even months after the game shut down in early 2025, Mitchell believed that wasn’t the case. “In a parallel universe where we didn’t have the server issues, where the community wasn’t frustrated with our early pricing that rankled people, where maybe we had a bit more money for marketing, we could have gotten the critical mass going,” he said.</p> <p>I’m sure all of these questions are similar to the ones currently facing Wildlight Entertainment’s developers, the majority of whom <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">were laid off</a> this week, less than a month after <em>Highguard</em>‘s launch. When online multiplayer projects get such a small window to make their mark and find a foothold in an ever more competitive landscape that’s already crowded with too many games, how can you not begin to second-guess every little choice, from where to allocate resources early in development to how many heroes and modes to debut at launch?</p>

 <h2><em>Highguard</em>‘s race against time</h2> <p>Would deciding against revealing <em>Highguard</em> at the Game Awards 2025 have saved it weeks and weeks of bad online buzz, or would it have just made it that much harder to get anyone to pay attention once the game was out? Would a 5v5 mode on day one have kept more players around than the more boring 3v3 it started with? Would better performance on PC for less powerful gaming rigs have spared <em>Highguard</em> an immediate onslaught of negative drive-by Steam reviews? Would pitching its launch as an open beta or early access period have lowered the expectations it got graded against?</p> <p>No one knows the answers to these questions, or whether magically knowing them would matter in the scheme of a game that, at the end of the day, many agree can be interesting and fun but just isn’t as fully baked as its mountain of competition, from <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Deathlock</em> to <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>. What has become increasingly clear, however, is that once caught in a live-service death spiral, you need more than good ideas and some extra runway to escape it.</p>

 <p>It seems absurd to launch a multiplayer game and lay most of its creators off before the one-month anniversary, but short of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, it’s hard to imagine momentum ever meaningfully shifting back in a game like <em>Highguard</em>‘s favor. Comeback stories like those around <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> are still extremely rare in the live-service space. When it works, it’s usually because you have massive publishers with huge franchises on the line–<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>,<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Fallout 76</em>–and even then it takes tons of money, years of scrambling, and more than a little luck to pull off a miracle.</p> <p>Most multiplayer games have none of those things, and sometimes even when they check all the boxes it’s still not enough. Wildlight wanted to create a game that “people love and [that] becomes a part of them,” studio head and game director Chad Grenier <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-wildlight-interactive-interview/">told <em>Polygon</em></a> a week before<em> Highguard</em>‘s launch. “Whether it gets a thousand people or a hundred million people, it doesn’t matter. What matters most is that the game is loved by the people who played it.” It might have mattered most, but it didn’t matter enough.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First Trailer For Nicolas Cage’s Spider-Man Series Has Me Cautiously Optimistic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/spider-noir-amazon-episodes-premiere-date-nicolas-cage-2000668226</link>
            <guid>1433749</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nicolas Cage’s Spider-Man Noir was one of the surprise fan favorites from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-beyond-the-spiderverse-release-date-images-1851774004"><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span>. The actor used his Massive Talent and put on one of the more memorable performances in a movie full of them, even though he didn’t have as much screentime as Miles, Gwen, and Peter. The idea of a broody, monochromatic detective Spider-Man was a new concept to some fans, but Spider-Man Noir was introduced long before he showed up in the multiversal animated movies. Now, he’s getting his own live-action show, but not as Peter Parker; instead as Ben Reilly, and that name carries a lot more questions than answers. We have the first trailer for the series, and it looks pretty cool.</span></p> <p><span>The eight-episode series stars Cage as an older version of Spider-Man who is a detective in New York during the 1930s. Ben is a bit of a burnout, which is refreshing after every Spider-Man being a standup citizen who saves the day because it’s right. But if you’re unfamiliar with Ben, this might not be the best introduction to him, as Cage’s character seems to be a composite character of Spider-Man Noir and the Scarlet Spider. In the comics, Ben Reilly is a clone of Peter Parker who has taken on different roles and aliases as the years have gone on. It’s unclear if naming Cage’s character Ben is a nod to another </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>story, or if it’s going to actually play into some twist down the line.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Spider-Noir </span></i><span>will premiere on Amazon on May 27, and will be available in both color and black-and-white to capture the character and comic’s original black-and-white color scheme. Based on the views of the YouTube trailers, it looks like folks might be gravitating toward the monochromatic filter. That feels fitting.</span></p>  <p><span>Though it’s being released on Amazon, this show is technically part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709"><span>Sony’s extended </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>universe</span></a><span>, which has mostly bombed with absolute stinkers like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/madame-web-movie-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-reaction-1851264337"><i><span>Madame Web</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-jared-leto-movie-theaters-marvel-sony-bom-1849024089"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. The </span><i><span>Venom </span></i><span>movies were kind of okay, sometimes. Really, </span><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>is the best thing Sony has done as it’s held onto the movie license, other than partnering with Marvel to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-trailer-leaks-avengers-doomsday-2000654144"><span>bring Peter Parker to the MCU</span></a><span>, and hopefully some of the brilliance of those animated movies has rubbed off on </span><i><span>Spider-Noir</span></i><span>. If not, Cage is usually still worth tuning in for, just to see what he does with bad material.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[High On Life 2′s Intro Is One Of The Best Video Game Openings Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-intro-start-epstein-files-fps-sci-fi-montage-2000668195</link>
            <guid>1433668</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some games start slow, taking their time to teach you the controls and establish the world. <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-trailer-teaser-xbox-game-pass-sgf-2025-1851783996"><em>High On Life 2</em></a> takes a very different approach. It tosses you into the world at 1,000 MPH, cracking jokes and having a blast. And you know what, it’s a great way to start a video game.</p> <p><em>High On Life 2</em> doesn’t assume that you’ve played its <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-review-rick-and-morty-justin-roiland-1849888587">2022 predecessor</a>. Instead, the intro to this <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-squanch-games-rick-and-morty-justin-roilan-1849949995">comedy-filled sci-fi FPS</a> about humans being turned into drugs provides a crash course on what happened in the last game. It does this via an intro that is structured as a series of vignettes and moments seamlessly stitched together into one extended opening montage.</p>

 <p>At one point you’re fighting a giant monster, then you’re on a talk show, a second later you’re back in a limo with your mentor-turned-agent from the original game, then back to the monster fight. A quick cut later, you’re doing a commercial, then you’re zipped away to an obstacle course, back to the talk show, and so on.</p> <p>This introduction sequence isn’t just fun and funny; it also does a great job of teaching you the basics of <em>High On Life 2</em>. You know, how to jump, move, shoot, grapple stuff, melee people, etc. Learning how to jump and run on a <em>Wipeout</em>-like televised obstacle course and then seconds later, though possibly years later in-game, using those skills to climb across buildings as you chase a giant monster not only taught me the controls, it also quickly established what the main character has been doing since the first game. On top of that, it’s all technically impressive and fun to behold as the game hops between wildly different scenes in a few frames without hitching up or breaking.</p>

  <p>And yes, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/high-on-life-2-jeffrey-epstein-joke/">as already pointed out by <em>Polygon</em></a>, there is a joke about deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the intro sequence. It happens during a bit in which you kill a bunch of different targets in a hyper-fast murder montage that teaches you how to melee while also showing how bored the main character has become with their life as a celebrity bounty hunter. You can kill these people instantly, or let them ramble on for a bit and learn more about why they are marked for death. In the case of one character, they trafficked humans, but not for “sex stuff” like Epstein. They just sold humans to be smoked as a drug by aliens. They want to be clear; they are bad, but not as bad as Epstein.</p>

 <p>This is when I’d show you a clip from this awesome intro, but I can’t do that. <em>High On Life 2</em> has a lot of embargoed content that I’m unable to talk about ahead of its February 13 launch. And we aren’t able to share video or record clips of the introduction sequence at all. It’s a shame, because I don’t think it spoils much, and it’s one of the best parts of <em>High On Life 2.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <p><span>Pokémon Day, the series’ annual anniversary celebration that typically includes a live stream about upcoming projects, is just two weeks away. Rumors and leaks are circulating, and while the new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-wind-wave-open-world-images-screens-2000666444"><span>Generation X games seem imminent</span></a><span>, leakers claim that a pair of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-best-worst-games-ranked-red-blue-scarlet-violet-1849984595"><span>old games may also be announced for the Switch 2</span></a><span>&nbsp;on February 27: </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The Game Boy Advance games originally launched in 2004, and are remakes of the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>RPGs on the Game Boy that kickstarted the franchise. The rumor of their impending rerelease began when Khu, a leaker in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, claimed that the games would “return soon” on </span><a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331"><span>X</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">They will return soon~ <a href="https://t.co/hwB2Ntsn8H">pic.twitter.com/hwB2Ntsn8H</a></p> <p>— Khu Beating Around The Bush (@Riddler_Khu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/2021595272967528833?s=20"><span>Centro Leaks</span></a><span>, a prominent leak account, has also posted saying that a separate source tells them these RPGs won’t be part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, and will instead be paid games on the eShop. They also claim they will be compatible with </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span>, which allows you to transfer your Pokémon to a storage app that can be traded to other games in the series.</span></p> <p><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> are easily the best versions of the first-generation games, but fans have gotten a bit weary of going back to the Kanto region after years of perceived favoritism for those original 151 Pokémon. So while there’s plenty of excitement about the possibility, some folks are rolling their eyes at the thought that these games might be ported over while&nbsp; plenty of the other games continue missing from the Switch’s line-up. Especially if they end up being pricey, standalone games.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Big news for Kantoids,” wrote one </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r1ut4f/khu_hints_pok%C3%A9mon_fire_red_and_leaf_green_will/"><span>Redditor</span></a><span>. “Just give me </span><i><span>HGSS</span></i><span>,” wrote another. “</span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> will return in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span>,” is the top comment on the GamingLeaksAndRumors subreddit thread about the leak, indicating that a lot of folks feel like they’re being subjected to some MCU-style nostalgia-baiting here and aren’t thrilled at the prospect of going back to Kanto. So some folks might be skipping this if it comes to pass.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is all just a rumor right now, but it would make some sense considering 2026 is </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s 30th anniversary. It doesn’t seem out of the question that The Pokémon Company would want to give folks a way to play that first adventure. The original </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Blue</span></i><span> were last available on the 3DS, but now that the eShop on that device has been shut down, you can only download them if you’ve previously purchased them.</span></p> <p><span>For a series with as much continuity as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> has through intergenerational trading and </span><i><span>Home </span></i><span>support, it’s really shitty that all these games aren’t readily accessible on modern hardware, but Nintendo has a way of making it hard to play old games without some kind of (usually expensive) port or subscription service on its current platforms. So if this does turn out to be true, I wouldn’t be surprised if </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> end up costing something like $30 a piece. But we’ll know for sure on Pokémon Day.</span></p>
