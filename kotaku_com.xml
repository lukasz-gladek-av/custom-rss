The massive deal allows the founding Guillemot family to remain in control of the publisher despite its recent struggles and cratering share price. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196566" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The details of the agreement are complex and it’s not immediately clear how it will all hash out in practice. The new entity doesn’t have a name yet but will have its own board of supervisors and include Ubisoft studios Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Those teams will be in charge of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> franchises moving forward, as well as their back catalogs. But all of it will still report up to Ubisoft proper and its current CEO, Yves Guillemot.<br></p><p> “With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success,” Guillemot said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> on Thursday. “With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.” </p><p>On a call with investors following the announcement, however, the company’s leadership clarified that Ubisoft 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will still report up to Guillemot. “There will be a dedicated management under the supervision of a board that will be controlled by Ubisoft,” CFO Frederick Duguet told investors. “So Ubisoft will continue controlling and consolidating this entity.”</p><p>The major deal comes after months of speculation about a possible sale of the French publisher following a year of poor sales for some of its biggest recent blockbusters, including <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as well as delays and cancellations of other big releases, including free-to-play shooter&nbsp;<em>The Division Heartland</em>. Those rumors included a shareholder report that Ubisoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was even exploring a sale</a></span> of some of its franchises to Microsoft and others. Under the new structure, series like <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Rayman</em> will remain under the broader Ubisoft umbrella. <br></p><p>Ubisoft is a sprawling organization with studios and employees spread out all over the world. The complex web facilitates a co-development process that the company uses to ship massive games in shorter time periods. But that also means that there’s no clean delineation between who works on what. While The Montreal and Quebec studios lead development on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, many employees within those offices still work on other franchises as needed. </p><p>Asked by investors how many of Ubisoft’s over 17,000 employees would be moving to the new group, the company said it was still too early to tell. That sentiment was echoed in an email sent to staff today from Ubisoft head of studios Marie-Sophie de Waubert. This brings some uncertainty and questions,” she wrote in an email obtained by<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>. “Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly.”</p><p>Two key provisions of the new agreement are that Tencent cannot sell its 25 percent equity stake for at least five years and Ubisoft “may not cease to hold a majority of New subsidiary voting rights and share capital for a 2-year period.” In the near term at least, the $1.25 billion deal sounds more like a financial instrument than anything else, and one that provides Ubisoft’s current ownership with more time to try to improve the company’s financial outlook. Prior to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadow</em>’s launch, many asked if it would be enough to save the company from being broken up and sold for parts. For now at least, it seems like it won’t need to. </p><p><em>Update 3/27/2025 2:35 p.m. ET: Added more context from the investor call and internal emails. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During one point in the Direct, Nintendo announced that it is changing how digital games work on Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706">Now players will buy Virtual Game Cards</a></span> that can be digitally shared between consoles and other players with some restrictions. This new system will go live in late April and will be compatible with Switch 2 at launch. And on a new website Nintendo created explaining Virtual Game Cards, there’s some fine print hinting at enhanced Switch 2 ports of past games. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lles54qmv527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lles54qmv527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by video game deals and news sharer Wario64</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/#:~:text=*Available%20on%20Nintendo,title%20is%20ejected.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/#:~:text=*Available%20on%20Nintendo,title%20is%20ejected." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some fine print at the bottom of this webpage</a></span> mentions something we’ve not heard about before: “Switch 2 Edition” games. These will only be playable on Switch 2 and will likely be enhanced native ports of older titles. </p><p>Here’s the full text with the important bits bolded: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and<strong> Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</strong> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system. To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting! While we’ve known for a while now that Switch games will be mostly backward compatible with Switch 2, this is the first official mention of the possibility that some older games might get native ports to Switch 2. This will likely work similarly to PS4 games on PS5: most of them play just fine (or even better) on the more powerful hardware, but there are some titles that have received separate, native PS5 ports. For example, <em>Death Stranding</em> on PS4 plays great on PS5.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But you can spend $10 to upgrade to the PS5 version which unlocks new visual features and options</a></span>.</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Nintendo about this fine print and what it means. </p><p>For now, we can only speculate as to what “Switch 2 Edition” means. One possibility is that some of these Switch 2 Edition games will run at a higher framerate. Recently, dataminers discovered unused 60FPS code in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a></span>. Many are theorizing that the game will run at a higher FPS on Switch 2. And that might be true, but perhaps only while playing a theoretical Switch 2 Edition of it. </p><p>Will you have to pay for these native ports? Maybe. Will they support cross-save and crossplay with older versions? Possibly. We don’t know yet, but hopefully we’ll learn more on April 2 during the announced Switch 2-focused Direct. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/ai-limit-soulslike-how-long-to-beat-short-hard-1851772663<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is an abundance of soulslike titles these days, giving fans of the brutal genre plenty of options for where to spend their time exploring, making builds, and taking down extremely challenging bosses. If you’re an anime enthusiast as well, you may have had your eye on <em>AI Limit</em>, which costs only $35. This may leave you wondering how long of a journey the game offers and whether it’s worth investing in. So let’s get into it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196773" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196773,196922,195502" data-current="196773"><div><p>This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22330.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h65257"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to finish <em>AI Limit</em>?</h2><p><em>AI Limit</em> is a surprisingly meaty experience for about half the price of a standard game. Yes, this is partially because it poses a hell of a challenge (meaning you’ll die a lot), but it’s also packed with just as many locations and bosses as many far more expensive games in the soulslike genre. </p><p>Because of the difficulty, especially in regards to the many bosses you’ll encounter, how long it takes you to finish the game will be somewhat skill-dependent. However, <strong>an average playthrough is likely to take around 20 hours</strong>. This includes reaching the final boss without completing every side-quest or searching every nook and cranny.</p><p>But completionists can certainly get more from the game, especially those looking to score every achievement it has to offer. You’ll need to complete a rather large selection of cryptic NPC quests, including some that interweave and are dependent on one another. Additionally, you’ll have to obtain every weapon and spell, as well as see all three unique endings. </p><p>With all of that in mind<strong>, fully completing <em>AI Limit</em> absolutely requires multiple playthroughs via NG+, which allows you to carry over your level and weapons to a fresh run of the game</strong>. By doing this, you’ll be able to go back through and grab any missed weapons, spells, NPC quests, and so on. More importantly, you’ll be able to set yourself up for different endings. <strong>Doing all of this can easily net you upwards of 40 hours worth of gameplay in <em>AI Limit</em></strong>. </p><p>Again, how much time you ultimately get out of <em>AI Limit</em> will depend at least partially on your skill level and whether you reference any guides for helping you find any particularly well-hidden secrets. But either way, there’s quite a lot of soulslike goodness to enjoy in this anime-infused adventure!</p><hr><p><br><em>AI Limit</em> is available now for PS5 and PC.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
