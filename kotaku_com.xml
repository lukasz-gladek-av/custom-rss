            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops can cost a pretty penny. The exact price depends on what you’re looking for, but generally, most powerful options from known brands sit well over $1,000, with some even touching $2,500 and above. If a scary price tag has been holding you back from upgrading, we come bearing good news.</p>
<p>Black Friday technically starts tomorrow, but early sales are going in full swing already. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Thanks to that, Amazon has dropped the price of the 16-inch Alienware Aurora gaming laptop to just $900.</a> You’re saving a straightforward $350 on its retail price of $1,250, and the sale is open to all shoppers. Even better, there are no coupon codes required to score the drop. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p>Plus, you can also enjoy the Xbox Game Pass new-user bonus if you’re new to the platform with your purchase. To claim it, click on the “Shop items” option on the deal page. On the following page, add the laptop to your cart. Both the discount and the bonus will apply automatically at checkout. Both deals, however, are expected to expire soon. Act fast before that happens because once it does, there’s no guarantee they’ll return.</p>

<h2>Designed for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>The build is sturdy, flaunting premium materials inside out. Its smaller profile makes it easy to fit into any bag and take it with you on the go, while smoother contours make the laptop comfortable to hold. The 16-inch WQXGA display offers plenty of screen space to play your favorite titles and push creative boundaries, plus delivers bright, sharp visuals consistently. Color accuracy is just as great; greens won’t turn into neon, and yellows won’t feel orange. ComfortView+ integration rounds it all up nicely by actively reducing blue light emission for a more comfortable viewing experience. You won’t be left with eye strain after a single gaming session.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a series 2, 10-core Intel Core 7 processor that’s capable of handling all your demanding day-to-day tasks without throwing a fit. The chip is thoughtfully paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 card. This one balances performance and efficiency like a pro, which makes it an excellent option for gaming at 1080p resolution and performing creative tasks. Multi-frame generation&nbsp;and enhanced Ray Reconstruction support make ultra-smooth frame rates possible, while the Frame Warp reduces the latency even further based on your game’s latest mouse input. The result? A smooth, fluid gaming experience for both the classic titles and the latest releases.</p>



<p>Multitaskers will appreciate the modest 16GB DDR5 RAM. It’s not massive, but still enough to let you work on at least a few different programs at the same time. Spacious capacity comes from the built-in 1TB SSD, which not only lets you house all that you own, but also enjoy fast load and boot times that make it easy to get on with your day without much delay. Despite all this, the laptop stays calm and cool as you go about your day. That’s thanks to its new Cryo-Chamber design that promotes airflow in a quieter way. Another feature that deserves a mention is the backlit keyboard, which lets you use the laptop comfortably even after the shadows fall.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">All in all, it’s a solid gaming laptop, especially at this price. You are currently saving $350 on it, which brings the price down to $900.</a> Considering how most entry-level everyday laptops fall in this range, this one is a steal at under $1,000.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Sends Millions of MacBook Air to Amazon for Black Friday, M4 Model at Zero-Profit Pricing Defies Logic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-sends-millions-of-macbook-air-to-amazon-for-black-friday-m4-model-at-zero-profit-pricing-defies-logic-2000648128</link>
            <guid>1366681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple releases new MacBook iterations almost annually with more powerful custom silicon that pushes performance boundaries forward. <strong>March brought the MacBook Air with M4 chip</strong>, succeeding the previous M3 generation through enhanced efficiency and AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Each year follows the same pattern where Apple maintains strict full pricing across official channels to preserve premium brand positioning. But today, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">at $749, down from $999, this marks the first time Apple has authorized Amazon to sell the 256GB MacBook Air M4</a> at razor-thin or potentially zero profit margins for Black Friday. The <strong>25% discount</strong> represents unprecedented accessibility to current-generation MacBooks that typically resist price reductions for years after launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Portable Computing</h2>
<p>The <strong>M4 processor has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU</strong> architecture that can handle professional workflows while being fanless and weighing less than 3 pounds. The improved Neural Engine processes Apple Intelligence features on the device which keeps data private because it doesn’t send it to cloud servers where third parties could get to sensitive information. The fanless cooling works well enough because the processor doesn’t get too hot even when it’s under a lot of stress: This makes it quiet, which professionals like when they’re working with clients or in the library.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB unified memory is a big improvement</strong> over the old 8GB base configurations which made it hard for users to run more than one program at a time. This memory architecture lets<strong> the CPU and GPU share RAM</strong> which gets rid of the performance problems that happen when separate components copy data between different memory pools. The memory bandwidth sends data to processors quickly enough to keep them running at their best, instead of waiting for slow memory access that slows down less powerful systems.</p>
<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has great picture quality thanks to mini-LED backlighting</strong> that lets it reach 500 nits brightness and supports the P3 wide color gamut. This level of brightness makes it easy to see outside in direct sunlight, where regular laptop screens wash out completely. The color accuracy is also good enough for professional photo and video editing without needing extra monitors<strong>. True Tone technology changes the white balance based on the light around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>



<p>The <strong>M4 chip and optimized macOS power management</strong> that changes performance based on workload demands make the battery last 15 to 18 hours during normal mixed use. <strong>Video playback can last up to 20 hours</strong> but tasks that use a lot of power, like rendering video, drain batteries faster but still give you a lot of time to use them without plugging them in. This long battery life lets you work on the go instead of just using a laptop that is tethered to a power source and covers full workdays and evenings without having to worry about running out of battery.</p>
<p>The <strong>integration of the ecosystem with the iPhone</strong> makes workflows easier with features like Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy text or images from your iPhone and paste them directly into your Mac. Handoff lets you switch between devices in the middle of a task, and FaceTime and Messages keep conversations going no matter which device you pick up. And AirDrop lets you send files between Apple devices right away.</p>
<p>For $749, the MacBook Air M4 with 256GB has the latest Apple Silicon, a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and a battery that lasts all day. This Black Friday, it’s 25% off the regular price. Apple’s authorization for Amazon to sell at minimal margins creates exceptional value that rarely occurs on current MacBooks. If you want Apple’s latest ultra-portable without paying full premium pricing, <strong>this record-low deal is the best MacBook value available</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Breaks Its Own Pricing Logic as Pixel Watch 4 (2025) Drops to an All-Time Low Despite Being Its Latest Smartwatch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/googles-newest-and-best-pixel-watch-is-100-off-for-the-first-time-this-black-friday-at-amazon-2000647344</link>
            <guid>1366678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of 2025’s best Android smartwatches has just become one of the best Black Friday deals of the week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">The 41mm version of the outstanding Google Pixel Watch 4 is 22% off at Amazon, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $350.</a> The best-in-class display jumps out at you immediately, being 50% brighter than the previous model of the Pixel Watch, and its Gemini AI integration comes into play early and often to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>As a fitness watch, the Pixel Watch 4 is among the very best, with amazing accuracy in measuring and evaluating your exercise. It’s also an elite-level health and sleep tracker, easily in the same class as the best Apple Watches and Samsung Galaxy Watches. All of its features are bolstered by the outstanding battery life of the Pixel Watch 4 — 40 hours per charge in standard mode and 72 hours in low-power mode, with the ability to get back to 50% strength after just 15 minutes on Google’s new side charger, and all the way from 0 to 100% in roughly 45 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy on the Eyes</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to look past the face of the Google Pixel Watch 4, which is an enormous upgrade from previous models. The first-of-its-kind Actua 360 display lives beneath a dome of sturdy scratch-resistant 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5, and is 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3 — up to 3,000 brilliant nits, which can be lowered to as little as a single nit when you need to keep things dark. It’s a 320 ppi AMOLED screen that’s remarkably easy to see even in bright sun, and highly reactive as a touchscreen for ease of control.</p>
<p>Beneath the Actua 360 display lives the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 processor and Cortex M55 co-processor, which drives all of the Pixel Watch 4’s many features and keeps them moving with smooth, seamless, pro-level speed. That’s handy whether you’re using any of the 40+ exercise modes for a workout, the dual-frequency GPS for accurate location, or the Gemini AI as a hands-free assistant for pretty much anything you ask of it.</p>



<h2>An Actual Fixable Smartwatch</h2>
<p>What do you do when your smartwatch’s battery fails, or when its display gets cracked or damaged? Most likely you shop for a new one while hoping against hope for a semi-reasonable trade-in deal to lessen the blow. The Google Pixel Watch 4’s battery is replaceable, as it its display. You can’t do it yourself at home, but it can be shipped to Google or taken to a certified Google repair technician for a fix. Of course, with its robust battery and Gorilla Glass-encased display combined with IP68 water and dust resistance, the odds are low you’ll need to seek service, but it does provide peace of mind.</p>
<p>Need a Cliff’s Notes rundown of the Pixel Watch 4’s many fitness features? How about Daily Readiness score, real-time run guidance, Morning Brief, Heart Zone Training, Cardio fitness score, Calorie Tracking, and Floors Climbed? That’s maybe a third of them, just to give you an idea of how impressive the Pixel Watch 4 is if you’re thinking about a new workout watch. And now’s the time to make that upgrade, thanks to the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">22% off Black Friday sale at Amazon that makes the Google Pixel Watch 4 a total steal at just $350.</a></p>

But it was actually the obligatory <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> performance that stole the show. And if you see the Labubu float break containment, well, please call 911. Meanwhile, I’m jealously checking in on everyone else’s <a href="https://x.com/i/lists/1460694648381448196">Black Friday gaming haul</a>. Now let me go check on my candied yams before they burn.</p>

 <h2><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is a $37 million flop</h2> <p>Paradox Interactive announced the write-down <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262">to investors yesterday</a>. It takes full responsibility for the game’s troubled reception following years of development hell and multiple studios at the helm. The RPG is currently sitting below a 60 percent positive rating on Steam.</p>

 <p><em>“</em>A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future,” CEO Fredrik Wester said.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> won’t get a second expansion</h2> <p>“As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently,” associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>. “We’re still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it’s not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years. And whether or not this is the the right way to go, I think it’s more an experience we’re trying, to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it.”</p>

 <p>He suggests that the game’s original delay and resources spent on improving the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> engine are the reason a second big DLC felt out of <em>Shadows</em> post-launch roadmap, rather than soft sales or a lack of player interest.</p>

 <h2><em>The Witcher 4</em> won’t be at The Game Awards 2025</h2> <p>“I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards,” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski wrote <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">on X</a>. “Thanks to everyone who has already voted – your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p>

 <h2>The backlash to OpenAI’s war on anime continues</h2> <p>The Japan Commercial Broadcasters’ Association released a new statement pushing back on AI plagiarism machines. The group is “strongly urging generative AI developers,” <a href="https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASTCV2RG1TCVUCVL06NM.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><u>Asahi Shimbun</u></a> reports (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/openai-and-sora-2s-use-of-anime-ips-could-destroy-japans-content-production-culture-and-ecosystem-says-japans-biggest-broadcasting-association"><em>IGN</em></a>). The association also called on OpenAI to “respond sincerely to claims made by member companies in regard to copyright infringement caused by generative AI.” I’m sure that will happen any day now.</p> <h2>The great <em>Pokémon</em> vs <em>Digimon</em> debate</h2> <p>“Digimon and Pokémon are fundamentally different in their core concepts and appeal,”&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> producer Ryosuke Hara said in a <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/issue-1005-of-mcv-develop-is-online-now-inside-ryosuke-hara-on-digimon-story-time-stranger-paul-sulyok-on-the-disappearing-public-gaming-sector-the-game-kitchen-on-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-and-mor/">recent interview</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/digimon-story-time-stranger-producer-says-he-hopes-it-shows-players-the-difference-between-digimon-and-pokemon/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “Each has its own unique strengths. We believe that these differences will naturally become apparent as players experience this title.” He doesn’t go into detail about what those differences are, though they’ll be obvious to anyone who has played both <em>Time Stranger</em> and <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> this fall.</p> <p>He said <em>Time Stranger</em> is trying to be less insular than past Digimon games by easing players into the world. “Simply delving into the appeal of powerful Digimon like the Olympos XII would only resonate with existing Digimon fans, so we made sure to introduce several mysteries at the beginning of the narrative—designed to spark curiosity and encourage all players to move forward with interest,” Hara explaioned.</p>

 <h2><em>Splitgate 2</em> will re-launch next month</h2> <p>The portal shooter came and went in the blink of an eye earlier this year is headed back to a soft launch beta on December 4. CEO Ian Proulx is confident things will be different this time, and no, he wont’ be back at the Game Award <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">with a new hat</a>.</p> <p>“The thing that has me most optimistic is the results from the playtests,” he wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1p5pwa5/comment/nqm368w/">on Reddit</a>. “Even though the numbers aren’t crazy big, we have seen them grow every time both in terms of player count and in terms of Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our NPS score is the highest it has ever been by far (which basically in the survey measures how likely people are to recommend<em> Splitgate</em> to a friend). This has been our most important metric to improve, and we have done just that.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-pc-port-sony-ps5-kojima-2000647534">The wait for <em>Death Stranding 2</em> on PC might not be as long as we think&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/another-long-time-game-studio-is-on-the-chopping-block-2000647684">Splash Damage faces studio-wide layoffs after a private equity buyout&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">EA explores AI that can upsell players on sports game card packs&nbsp;</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-pocket-sized-mini-pc-dropped-to-a-miraculously-low-150-2000620777</link>
            <guid>1366633</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How big does a computer need to be? Custom PC towers can be enormous. Heck, we even call them “towers” after all to really call attention to how much space they take up. But do you really need that? I mean, our phones are pretty small and they can provide a shocking amount of processing power. Maybe a mini PC is all you need. You can save some cash going that route too. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">Take for instance this KAMRUI Essenx E2 Mini PC. It’s normally priced affordably at just $230. However, right now it’s part of a limited time Black Friday deal taking the price down even further.</a> You’ll saving nearly 20%, paying only $190 for this tiny computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Can It Game?</h2>
<p>Now, is this a replacement for a custom-built PC tower? No. How do the graphics stack up against an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090? Like ass. Of course, this is not for those with unlimited budget trying to play<em> Grand Theft Auto VI</em> at the highest settings when it eventually (probably) releases on PC. This is the gaming PC for someone who has neither much cash nor space to spare who is looking to start a new file in <em>Stardew Valley</em><em>.&nbsp;</em>This is the gaming PC for those who want to be able to access&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> from every TV from every room in their house. It’s for running ROMs of all your favorite NES and SNES-era games (so long as you own the games outright. Emulation is naughty otherwise).</p>



<p>Let’s talk specs. What we’re actually working with is pretty surprising given the KAMRUI Essenx E2 Mini’s size. This thing packs a 12th generation Alder Lake N95 processor capable of boosting up to a max of 3.4GHz. Memory-wise, we have 16GB of RAM. It’s got built-in storage in the form of its 512GB solid state drive. Plus, you can expand the storage up to 2TB with separately-purchased SSDs. It supports 4K graphics at 60Hz and with its two HDMI slots and VGA connector, you can feasibly display on up to three monitors at once.</p>
<p>The real show here is just how small this PC is. It measures in at roughly five by five inches long and wide. Comes in at two inches high. This little square computer can practically fit in your pocket.</p>
<p>In actuality, it’s unlikely this will be you end-all, be-all place to play games. Really this PC is designed for those who have basic computer needs like web browsing, word processing, and streaming TV shows, but it can do it in a tight form factor without taking up any space on your desk.</p>

              <p>Organized workstations don’t just look better, they make you more productive too. If you use a bunch of devices to get your busy work and play days (multiple monitors, laptop, keyboard, mouse, external storage), you need something that ties the entire setup together with a single unit. A docking station does that job well, and if you’ve been on the lookout for one, we just spotted a great deal to pick a highly-rated option for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Thanks to Black Friday, Amazon is offering the 14-in-1 160W Anker Prime docking station for $161.</a> That’s after a nice 40% discount on the retail price of $270. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in 90 days, which means it didn’t even go this low during the October Prime Day. It’s selling out fast, though, so it’s best to snap it up as soon as you can.</p>

<h2>Multiple Ports to Connect and Charge</h2>
<p>The dock gets you 14 ports in total. The front panel offers you two USB-C (10Gbps), two USB-C (100W Max), one USB-A (10Gbps), one USB-A (12W Max), and one 3.5mm audio jack. On the back, there’s an Ethernet (1Gbps), three USB-A (480Mbps), one HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), one USB-C upstream port, and an LED indicator. The three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max are capable of juicing your essentials up with 160W of total output. It’s great to power your laptop as you work without looking for another outlet, and even quickly top your smartphone or headphones up. Four charging ports mean you can charge multiple devices at the same time. The station even makes custom power allocation possible with its dedicated app, so you can always prioritize important devices. Need to head out for a meeting in a few minutes? Prioritize your laptop while still keeping your AirPods topped up.</p>
<p>Support for bigger workstations comes from the dual HDMI ports that let you stream or mirror across two additional displays at the same time, but only on Windows. You’ll get up to 2K@60Hz on a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 machine. Those using macOS will only be able to mirror their main display. It’s not ideal, but can come in handy when you need to share your screen with others. Otherwise, compatibility is impressive. The station works nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. It’s not made for Linux, though.</p>



<p>You will always be kept in the loop with the smart display, which shows total wattage and interface status, plus gives visuals and overheat alerts when needed. And finally, despite all the power, the docking station remains portable and lightweight; enough to carry around easily with you on the go. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’ll be able to create an efficient workstation anywhere you want. Overheating won’t be a concern either, thanks to the built-in airflow system, paired with ActiveSheild temperature monitoring. The latter monitors the temperature of the docking station 3,000,000 times per day, and instantly notifies you if something feels off.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been wanting to make your workstation cleaner, Anker Prime does a great job at that. You’ll still be able to use all your devices, just in a more efficient, smartly-managed way.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/"> It’s now down to $161, so you’re saving a nice $109 on it right now. Grab the deal fast before it expires for good, or the stock runs out.</a></p>
