              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660"><i><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></i></a><span> may soon get a mod that supports multiplayer gameplay. Modder Speclizer </span><a href="https://x.com/speclizer_/status/2010075024838013235"><span>shared</span></a><span> recent test gameplay of their work-in-progress that showcased two Ellies bounding through a field together. As the PC mod is still in development, the Ellies aren’t currently able to do much other than hang out and run around but it’s already making fans pine for a proper multiplayer mode.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The mod aims to eventually add PvP combat to </span><i><span>TLOU2</span></i><span>, and would not feature multiplayer support for the game’s story mode or any interactions with NPCs. Speclizer also </span><a href="https://x.com/Speclizer_/status/2010121847032123734"><span>implied</span></a><span> that the mod is exploratory, and not guaranteed to be completed. It might become the unofficial version of the online mode fans have wanted for the sequel, or might just end up another failed fan project.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our first test of our multiplayer mod for The Last of Us 2 on PC, very broken and not a lot has been implemented yet.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheLastofUsPartII?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheLastofUsPartII</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Factions?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Factions</a> <a href="https://t.co/mTwLSjhDV8">pic.twitter.com/mTwLSjhDV8</a></p> <p>— Speclizer (@Speclizer_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Speclizer_/status/2010075024838013235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Many fans are still mourning </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434"><span>the cancellation of </span><i><span>The Last of Us Online</span></i></a><span>, an official multiplayer spinoff of the beloved franchise which Naughty Dog terminated two years ago. The decision to cancel </span><i><span>The Last of Us Online</span></i><span>—previously known by fans as </span><i><span>Factions</span></i><span> based on the original 2013 PlayStation 3 game’s multiplayer mode—was made in order to prioritize developing future single-player titles, such as the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022"><i><span>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</span></i></a><span>. Speclizer’s mod is an exciting peek into what could’ve been.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other </span><i><span>The Last of Us Part II </span></i><span>mods from Speclizer include a battle mode mod that allows players to design their own encounters; a “Spare or Kill” ending that lets players choose to murder Abby; restorations of deleted game features like a Listen Mode alternative; and a dog companion mod. Speclizer also modded </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> to make Kratos gigantic.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Speclizer’s latest mod may not necessarily contain robust features—let alone ever be completed—it’s a notable step forward in the </span><i><span>TLOU2</span></i><span> modding community. It could even potentially provide the groundwork for future multiplayer mods, or at least inspire future development. Perhaps </span><i><span>The Last of Us Online</span></i><span> will one day exist as an entirely fan-made project.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/rockstar-wins-initial-ruling-against-fired-gta-6-devs-we-regret-that-we-were-put-in-a-position-where-dismissals-were-necessary-2000658984</link>
            <guid>1403980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-union-busting-firing-keir-starmer-2000652135">30 fired Rockstar Games employees</a> have lost a request for interim relief following an ongoing fight with the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker. A UK employment tribunal ruling read that it “was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB,” meaning the legal battle will continue with no immediate back pay for the fired developers. The union representing them says it’s undeterred while a spokesperson for Rockstar said the company regrets being put in this situation and maintains the employees were fired for leaking confidential information.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">The dispute revolves around a Discord</a> set up by the IWGB to help organize union video game developers. Rockstar says it fired 31 UK developers last year for disclosing company secrets in the channel, including information related to development schedules and game features. IWGB has denied that any sensitive info was leaked and claims the firings infringed on employees’ labor rights and are tantamount to union-busting.</p>

 <p>According to employment Judge Frances Eccles’ initial ruling, the Discord channel included around 350 members, including former Rockstar employees, at least one of whom had <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761">previously published articles</a> about the company online. A spokesperson for Rockstar pointed out that there were current employees who shared support for unionizing in the Discord and who weren’t fired, stressing that the terminations were specifically for mishandling of company information.</p>

 <p>“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union’s application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout,” a spokesperson for Rockstar told <em>Kotaku</em> in an emailed statement. “We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing.”</p>

 <h2>Rockstar accused of spying on fired devs</h2> <p>But the IWGB says the ruling highlights that Rockstar failed to follow procedural guidelines when firing the employees, with no disciplinary meetings, investigations, or chances to appeal the company’s findings internally. It also accused Rockstar of “covertly monitoring” employees on the Discord by “impersonating” a union staff member. And the organization points to a part of the judge’s ruling that reads “There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings” as evidence that Rockstar overreacted.</p>

 <p>“Despite being refused interim relief today, we’ve come out of last week’s hearing more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar’s calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in a statement emailed to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “The fact that we were granted this hearing speaks to the strength of our case and, over the course of the two-day hearing, Rockstar consistently failed to back up claims made in the press or to refute that they acted unfairly, maliciously, and in breach of their own procedures.”</p>

 <p>The case will now continue to be argued before the tribunal for a full finding which could have important implications for whether the studio behind one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world becomes unionized. Whatever the outcome, it seems likely to be decided before<em> Grand Theft Auto 6</em> ships later this year in November.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Steam Sale’s Background Art Was Filled With Hidden Free Game Codes]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-team-17-hidden-codes-free-games-deal-secret-artwork-2000658974</link>
            <guid>1403869</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>At any given point in time, there are at least two or three different sales happening on Steam. Most of them include some background art that you aren’t really meant to notice. But Team 17’s new sale did something I’ve not seen before. It hid free game codes in the sale artwork for those observant enough to spot them.</p> <p>On January 12, <a href="https://go.bsky.app/redirect?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbuff.ly%2Fxu8nST3">Team 17 launched its big Hidden Treasures Sale on Steam</a>, featuring discounts on over 50 different games, ranging from recent hits like <em>Dredge</em> to older titles like <em>Golf With Friends</em> and<em> Worms Reloaded</em>. There’s some great stuff on sale from today until January 19.</p>

 <p>But the best deals were hidden in plain sight. Over on the Hidden Treasures Steam event page, you can spot a pirate-themed background filled with gold and treasure. If you scroll down and look past the game deals, <a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/32941731/c454af314fa3cb448a7a4012aa50e6bf78b8c507.png">you’ll spot faint writing on what looks like parchment paper</a>. And it’s buried in these words that you’ll also notice some alphanumeric codes, which are in fact keys for different Team 17 games.</p>

 <p>Shortly after the sale went live, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcamwhbmpq2g">this neat detail was shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media</a>, but even by then, it seems like most of it not all of the codes had already been redeemed. And at this point, it seems all but certain that every code has been grabbed and used.</p>

 <p>Even if you didn’t get a free game, you can still take advantage of the sale. Here are some of the best deals I spotted in the Team 17 Steam sale. These offers may not be as good as free, but they still beat paying full price.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>Dredge</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Heavenly Bodies</em> – $9 ($25)</li> <li><em>Hell Let Loose</em> – $21 ($60)</li> <li><em>Golf With Friends</em> – $1.50 ($15)</li> <li><em>Killer Frequency</em> – $5 ($25)</li> <li><em>Moving Out</em> – $2.50 ($25)</li> <li><em>Conscript: Director’s Cut</em> – $8 ($24)</li> <li><em>The Escapists 2</em> – $4 ($27)</li> <li><em>Overcooked 2</em> – $1.70 ($17)</li> <li><em>Sworn</em> – $20 ($40)</li> </ul> <p>If you were one of the lucky ones to snag a code, let us know in the comments below and tell us what game you got!</p>

              <p>The latest of Steam’s creative weekly sales has just gone live, and this time it’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/detective">Detective Fest</a>. But rather than become entangled in red string as you try to pin all the available games to your enormous pinboard, we’ve inspected the selection through our microscope, whittled down the suspects, and then performed yet another detective cliche, to select the most suspicious(ly good) games for you to interrogate.</p>  <p>Investigative games have become a rather big deal in recent years, with many indie titles having broken through to the mainstream to enormous success. And, so of course, you’ve got the likes of&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em> and <em>Rise of the Golden Idol </em>in the sale, alongside less recent classics like <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> and&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. But you already know about all of those, so where’s the good in my suggesting those? Nope, let’s dive a little deeper with a selection of games that won’t be appearing at the top of all the store’s lists.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756940/The_Ratline/"><em>The Ratline</em></a></h2>  <p>You know who was making amazing family-tree-like detective games long before&nbsp;<em>The Roottrees Are</em> <em>Dead</em>? <a href="https://owlskip-games.itch.io/">Owlskip</a>. Titles like <a href="https://kotaku.com/riley-rochelle-musical-music-pc-steam-sheinman-games-1849676247"><em>Riley &amp; Rochelle</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/07/family/">Family,</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/09/rivals/"><em>Rivals</em></a> were years ahead on the format, and definitely deserve to be discovered in light of <em>Roottrees</em>‘ breakout success. Anything else is frankly unfair. <em>The Ratline</em> is the latest from the studio, due out in March, once again asking you to piece together a mystery from an array of clues and documents. This time things are set in 1971 and have you hunt down Nazi fugitives after the murder of a priest, and who doesn’t need a little Nazi hunting just now? There’s a demo out for Detective Fest.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781420/Surradia_An_Art_Retrospective/"><em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em></a></h2>  <p>There’s also a demo for the upcoming <em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em>, a detective game about investigating the disappearance of three magical artists who vanished during World War II. That means scouring photographs, reading letters, and of course paying close attention to artworks, all found in a museum, as you try to unpick the mystery. There’s no official release date for the game yet, but the demo’s here right now.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618570/The_Detectives_Apprentice/"><em>The Detective’s Apprentice</em></a></h2>  <p>This is a tremendous trailer! You’re Cleo, working for world-renowned detective Maya Lynch, learning the ropes in this unbelievably lovely-looking game. There’s a demo out for Detective Fest, which features Cleo’s first three cases, with the full game due later.</p>

 <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3627210/Mansion_of_a_Million_Monsters/">Mansion of a Million Monsters</a></em></h2>  <p><em>Mansion of a Million Monsters</em> takes a decidedly different approach to the detective genre, combining its investigative ways with dungeon-crawling action. It has the vibes of one of those classic Amiga games that everyone still raves about today. The developers say they’ll hopefully have a demo up for this one in the next day or so.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060960/Sleuth_Saga_Under_Starless_Skies/"><em>Sleuth Saga: Under Starless Skies</em></a></h2>  <p>This detective sim is based on all the right names, like&nbsp;<em>Phoenix Wright</em> and&nbsp;<em><i>Danganronpa</i></em>. Set in the year 780 Quattuoris 32nd (which I&nbsp;<em>cannot</em> find on my calendar), this is the tale of the daughter of investigative journalist Frederick Emery. Her father is found dead, a staged suicide, and she sets out to disprove the police’s claims. It’s to be five episodes long, with the first now playable via a free demo. Also, later this week developers Arboreal Interactive hopes to update with&nbsp;<em>another</em> free chapter, Chapter 0.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3485220/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Murder_Otaku/"><em>Murder Is Game Over: Murder Otaku</em></a></h2>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Murder Is Game Over</em> series of pixel point-n-clickers started in 2022, and&nbsp;<em>Murder Otaku</em> is already the fourth! It came out toward the end of last year, and if you click with its tale of solving the murder of a J-pop singer at an anime convention, that means you’ve now got another three games that are sure things. You can pick up the whole lot in the Cleo’s Complete Casefile bundle, on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/33733/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Cleos_Complete_Casefile/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://hitheryongames.itch.io/murder-is-game-over-cleos-complete-casefile">Itch</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2739630/of_the_Devil/"><em>of the Devil</em></a></h2>  <p><em>of the Devil </em>is a six-part episodic detective game inspired by the likes of <em>Ace Attorney</em> and <em>Danganronpa</em>. Its first free episode was released last year, and two more paid episodes have already been released since then! The game, which features amazing art, is set in the cyberpunk future of 2086 and has you playing a criminal defense attorney. So yeah, grab the first episode for nothing, and then see if you want to pick up the next two, with releases seeming to come nice and quickly.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131660/Call_of_the_Golden_Valley/"><em>Call of the Golden Valley</em></a></h2>  <p>Australian detective sim&nbsp;<em>Call of the Golden Valley</em> came out last October and still offers a free demo. You play Danielle, an American tourist who arrives in the country to visit a friend, Marisa, only to find she’s gone missing. So you begin investigating the small town, piecing together evidence, and finding out why Golden Valley is the sight of so many disappearing hikers.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919600/Paper_Perjury/"><em>Paper Perjury</em></a></h2>  <p>Another game you can play right now,&nbsp;<em>Paper Perjury</em> is a visual novel series from Paper Cat Games where new Azure City Police Department clerk Justina Smith begins investigating some peculiar crimes. Case 1 of the game is available as a free demo, and a sixth case is due to be added pretty soon.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689930/Detective_Instinct_Farewell_My_Beloved/"><em>Detective Instinct: Farewell, My Beloved</em></a></h2>  <p>A few of the games mentioned above were inspired to some degree by <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, but few wear it on their sleeve so much as&nbsp;<em>Detective Instinct</em>. It looks like it could have come from Capcom, and this is high praise. The mystery adventure is all about trying to track down a woman who disappears from a train, only no one on board but you can remember her. It came out late last year, and is celebrating Detective Fest with a discount and a free demo.</p>
