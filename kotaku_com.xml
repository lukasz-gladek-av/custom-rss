              <p><span>You know what they say: “Rule 34: If it exists, there is porn of it.” This internet rule posits that every fictional character has lewd art of them somewhere online, and there’s a website called Rule 34 that curates it and lets you search by character. But are you internet poisoned enough to be able to guess which characters have the most entries on that site? I thought I was, but I was very wrong.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.rule34dle.org/"><span>Rule34dle</span></a><span> is a browser game that pits two characters or franchises against one another and asks you to guess which of the pair has been the subject of more smutty art on the internet. I figured this would be easy. I know who the sickos are on the internet, and I also know which fandoms have the most artistically inclined community members. Or so I thought. But even after being a fan for nearly 30 years and writing about the series almost every day here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, I underestimated the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-official-forums-moderation-ban-rules-nintendo-1850605719"><span>depravity of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fandom</span></a><span>. What do you mean Snivy, the sassy little snake guy from </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>,</span> <span>has more entries than Kitana from </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>In just a few minutes of guessing, I was repeatedly taken aback by the gaps between some characters. Sometimes they were as wide as the ocean, and at other times they were too close for comfort. Leavanny from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>being just a couple of hundred entries away from the frost giant heartthrob Loki? That didn’t sound right, so I went investigating, and lo and behold, it was true. Do with that information what you will.</span></p> <p><span>The surprising answers do make Rule34dle a really fun game to play with friends or on stream. I’ve started seeing streamers play the game, and they’re also shocked at some of the results, so maybe some of us have just never quite peered into the abyss long enough.</span></p>         <p><span>If you want to try it out, none of the NSFW stuff is shown in the game itself, so you’re safe on that front. You can also try </span><a href="https://ao3dle.org/"><span>AO3dle</span></a><span>, which is the same concept but specifically pulling from fanfiction site Archive of Our Own. That one at least offers some plausible deniability because not everything on there is porn.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve had some remarkably long gaming sessions in my time. At least, I thought they were remarkably long. Turns out, I’m an amateur when compared to the likes of Szabolcs Csépe, also known as GrassHopper, a Hungarian gamer who now lays claim to the Guinness World Records’ title of “longest videogame marathon” for playing <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> for 144 hours, or six straight days.</p>

 <p>Dancing to more than 3,000 songs, and apparently burning 22,000 calories in the process, GrassHopper soared past the previous world record of 138 hours, which was set by Carrie Swidecki in 2015 while playing <i>Just Dance</i> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/challenging-but-comfortable-hungarian-breaks-game-marathon-world-record-by-playing-ddr-for-144-hours/">h/t <i>VGC</i></a>). In fact, the previous record was an inspiration for GrassHopper who said, “Ever since I learned about [Swidecki’s] achievements in marathon gaming, I often caught myself thinking about how she pulled the all-time longest session off almost a decade ago.</p>

 <p>Though Grasshopper certainly sweated the most and burned the most calories during the six-day marathon, it was a team effort. As Grasshopper said,</p> <p>This attempt was the most physically demanding experience, where the arms and shoulders expressed fatigue for extended hours without stretching. Apart from physically training for marathon gaming sessions, I prepared with the two most important keys to succeed: doing serious practice attempts with a small staff, and also coming up with a plan for supporting your body with sufficient food and water intake.</p>

 <p>This isn’t GrassHopper’s first rodeo when it comes to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/challenging-but-comfortable-hungarian-breaks-game-marathon-world-record-by-playing-ddr-for-144-hours/">marathoning games and setting records</a>. He previously broke the world record for the longest time spent playing a racing game, the game being <i>Gran Turismo 7</i>, and the time being 90 friggin’ hours. He also holds the world record for the longest video game marathon spent playing a puzzle game, with 32 straight hours of <i>Tetris</i>.</p> <p>Well, the next time I’m miserably powering through a metcon, I’ll be sure to remind myself it could be worse; I could be playing <i>DDR</i> for 144 hours. Bravo, sir. Bravo.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-1-1-0-patch-notes-t-rex-fix-juveniles-2000642549</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/t-rex-no-longer-a-shitty-dad-after-new-jurassic-world-evolution-3-update.1349260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Being a dad is hard. You have to take care of your child. Protect it from dangers. Make sure it gets plenty of food, water, and sleep. Oh and yeah, not eat it. Unfortunately for juvenile Tyrannosaurs in<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-best-jurassic-park-game-ever-pc-park-sim-baby-dinosaurs-2000639737"><em> Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a>, dad was forgetting that last rule. But that’s been fixed in the game’s latest update, available now on all platforms.</p>

 <p>Released last month, <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3 i</em>s a fantastic dinosaur-park-building simulation that lets you live out the fantasy of opening your very own <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757">Jurassic Park</a> and hopefully not screwing it all up in the process, as seen in nearly every film. This latest entry in the series, which is also the best one yet, added a highly requested fan feature: juvenile dinos. But apparently, according to new patch notes from developer Frontier, male T. Rexes were being jerks and attacking their offspring.</p>

 <p>On November 10, <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/3/updates/1-1-0">in the lengthy patch notes for <em>JWE3</em> update 1.1.0</a>, there’s this odd bug fix:</p> <blockquote><p>&nbsp;– Adult male Tyrannosaurus Rex no longer attack their juvenile offspring</p></blockquote> <p>Yeah, it looks like T. Rex was being a shitty dad before the update and had a tendency to attack juvenile T-rexes. This doesn’t shock me, as in my experience with the large carnivorous dinos, they are quick to attack basically anything that enters their enclosure. At least now, baby Rexes won’t be attacked by their own fathers anymore.</p> <hr> <p><em>Here are the full patch notes for 1.1.0:&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Updates</h2> <ul> <li>Introduced a new family unit to the game – the Kentrosaurus</li> <li>Adjusted navigation rules so that dinosaurs can travel beneath and around scenery items more freely</li> <li>Added further keyboard shortcuts to in-game control hints when placing or moving scenery</li> <li>Improvements to LODs on PC: <ul> <li>Added ‘Very High’ setting to Foliage detail</li> <li>Updated the ‘Very High’ quality preset to correctly use the ‘Very High’ settings for foliage and geo detail</li> <li>Improved level of detail for feathered dinosaurs on lower spec hardware</li> </ul> </li> <li>Revised sandbox settings for preventing juveniles from being hunted in sandbox maps: <ul> <li>The ‘Aggressive Animals’ setting is now changed to ‘Vulnerable Juveniles’ (this new setting will inherit the setup from the previous ‘Aggressive Animal’ setting from current saves)</li> <li>It now disables all juvenile attacks instead of just disabling attacks against juveniles of the same species</li> <li>Setting the fight frequency sandbox setting to ‘None’ now prevents juveniles from being attacked</li> <li>Setting the cohabitation sandbox setting to ‘All Like’ now prevents juveniles from being attacked</li> </ul> </li> <li>Path and Fence building modes now default ‘Replace Mode’ to ‘Off’ when opened</li> <li>Pylons can now be placed between Islands on maps made with Island Generator</li> <li>Added guest food scattering animation for Dinosaur Encounter attraction</li> <li>Adjusted frequency of Dinosaurs present in Dinosaur Encounter attraction</li> <li>Added group edit shortcut when playing with mouse.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/goodnight-universe-review-before-your-eyes-webcam-baby-2000642517</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-team-behind-my-2021-game-of-the-year-is-back-and-i%E2%80%99m-conflicted.1349161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There aren’t many games I recommend as wholeheartedly as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><span>2021’s </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i></a><span>. GoodbyeWorld Games’ brisk, beautiful narrative adventure game is a devastating, cathartic, and clever project that rolls a lifetime’s worth of ups and downs into its quick 90-minute play time. Its eye-tracking control scheme is one of the most meaningfully frustrating ones I’ve experienced, as it skips through entire segments of its story every time your webcam sees you blink. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>, the follow-up from Nice Dream Games, extrapolates this idea into a 3-and-a-half-hour experience, and it feels like turning a really tight Pixar short into a feature film, for good and ill.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>has the same sentimentality running through its veins that made </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>an incredibly heartwarming story despite the tragedy at its center, but it’s far less introspective. The new release</span> <span>is the story of a baby named Isaac who, somehow, has adult-level intelligence, though he can’t communicate that to his frazzled mother, spritely sister, and suspiciously chill father. But because he has an adult’s intuition, he can observe all the chaos of their lives and try his best to be a helpful son and brother. Sometimes that takes the form of just being a chill baby who isn’t causing trouble; at other times, he gets a bit more hands-on. What can a baby who can barely crawl do as his family navigates all their adult bullshit? A lot, actually, because Isaac has psychic powers.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>was entirely built around eye-tracking tech as a bit of narrative design, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s implementation of a webcam is far more mechanical in the traditional sense. Blinking activates Isaac’s psychic abilities in a way that often changes depending on the situation. It can shut down machinery, help you clean up a mess in your bedroom, and if you close your eyes and turn your head, you can listen in on your family’s worried thoughts. In this game, blinking is basically an extra button that certainly still feels novel, but it’s not quite as effective in what it communicates. </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>made an entire mechanic out of “blink and you’ll miss it,” but when </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>uses the same webcam-based control scheme, it feels like something that could have just as easily been communicated by pressing a different button on your controller. In a way, it feels more like a reference to the team’s previous history than it does something truly integrated into everything </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>seeks to explore.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the later game sequences, in which </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>sheds some of its focus on its supernatural family story in favor of some surprisingly dark science fiction and espionage twists, have you blinking as Isaac navigates mazes of obstacles and threats to his safety, and the game registers these inputs based on where your cursor is if you’re playing with a mouse and keyboard. I played through all of </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>with headphones to listen in on my family’s thoughts and a webcam to blink my psychic will onto the world around me, but in its effort to stretch out </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>’ concise ideas into something longer,&nbsp; </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>fails to develop as strong of a grasp on why it’s implementing these ideas, beyond the team wanting this approach to gameplay to feel like a signature facet of their work.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642520"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642520">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to keep comparing </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, but the contrast between the two is one of the most interesting things about Isaac’s journey. It’s about twice as long, but doesn’t feel like it overstays its welcome, even if it’s lacking the same singular vision. The game’s psychic set pieces are more mechanical, but they’re doused in a childlike mischief and naivete that is delightful, and that makes the moments when reality intervenes as devastating as any slap on the wrist you received as a kid. Despite Isaac’s adult-level intellect and grown-ass voiceover from </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span>*</span> <span>actor Lewis Pullman, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>hits at childhood shame, embarrassment, and familial resentment like they’re all raw nerves. Then it gradually becomes about so many other things that even gesturing at its many twists and turns risks spoiling it entirely.</span></p> <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>runs with every idea it has with a childlike confidence, but it’s also such a different story by the end than it is at the start that I wouldn’t be surprised if people find that one half of its tale resonates with them, while the other falls flat. When it’s at its best, it feels like being cradled and read your favorite story; then come moments when it’s as if the reader got bored with one story and picked up an altogether different one. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for in a heartwarming message at the end, but it’s a bit of a rollercoaster getting there. At least it’s worth riding for the highs.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 9‘s Vivi Has Finally Been Banned From Magic: The Gathering]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/vivi-ornitier-cauldron-ban-mtg-final-fantasy-2000642504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9%E2%80%98s-vivi-has-finally-been-banned-from-magic-the-gathering.1349158/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vivi is a small and unassuming Black Mage caught in an existential crisis in<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy IX</em> and an absolute wrecking ball <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-more-gorgeous-final-fantasy-mtg-cards-are-coming-and-theyre-already-selling-out-again-2000630364">in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The clever, lovable riff on a classic RPG archetype was responsible for what many considered the most busted deck in the card game’s current format. Fans have been waiting for him to be banned from Edge of Eternities Standard for months. Today, it finally happened.</p>

 <p>Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-november-10-2025">revealed</a> its updated banned and restricted list on November 10 as promised and, sure enough, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</a> was on it. The 0/3 Wizard gets a +1/+1 counter and deals 1 damage to each opponent every time you cast a noncreature spell, but that’s not all. Once per turn, players also get to use Vivi to generate red and blue mana equal to his power.</p>

 <p>At just three mana to play, Vivi’s a very powerful, very versatile card. Pair it with <a href="https://aetherhub.com/Metagame/Traditional-Standard/Deck/ur-soul-cauldron-1348701">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>, which stacks more +1/+1 counters and gives creatures access to all exiled creatures’ abilities, and you have a recipe for the most dominant and annoying deck of the year.</p>

 <p>“God, Vivi-Cauldron decks make for miserable games,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1nbwgh6/rant_god_vivicauldron_decks_make_for_miserable/">wrote</a> one player months ago. “The worst part are repetitive, monotonous play patterns and waiting for my opponent to take 5-minute turns when they had lethal on board after 30 seconds.”</p>

Some players were looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1mj8va3/the_vivi_cauldron_deck_is_8001000_in_paper/">prices of over $400</a> to build competitive decks with Vivi Ornitier, only falling <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631015/magic-final-fantasy-vivi-ornitier?srsltid=AfmBOooPpIF-JpPxhFkm4z1dPrbgI3gTepv91SKyFS8973Cjz2PhqdFp">below $30 apiece</a> once the autumn hit. Things got so bad in competitive <em>MtG </em>that Wizards of the Coast stepped in back in September to try and quell frustrations.</p>

 <p>“With the results of the latest Spotlight Series arriving on the heels of several high-profile Standard events, the conversation around the cards <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span>, and speculations on ’emergency’&nbsp; bans in Standard, we thought now would be a good time to check in,” read a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/standard-and-moving-ban-announcement">blog post from September</a>.</p>

 <p>While Wizards didn’t act then, it took the unusual step of bumping up its normal ban date by two weeks and promised a stricter crackdown on broken cards in 2026. The saga of Vivi Ornitier, while great for <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans happy to see one of the series’ unsung heroes shine, reinforced skepticism that many <em>MtG</em> players have had for <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">the Beyond Universes sets,</a> which some feel prioritize flashy fan service at the expense of obvious power creep.</p> <p>“To open up the Standard format for innovation and a wider variety of decks, it’s clear we need to disrupt the <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span> combo,” Wizards wrote in today’s banned card update. “That interaction is too much stronger than the rest of the format. We are opting to ban Vivi Ornitier as it is the card that’s more likely to create future balance problems if allowed to remain in the format. We believe Standard will be more fun and diverse without Vivi Ornitier in it.”</p>
