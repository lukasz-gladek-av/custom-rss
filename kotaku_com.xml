            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, everyone. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447">Have you seen that new <em>Mario</em> movie trailer?</a> I hope it’s good, unlike the last one. Anyway, welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, your daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. In this fine installment, we have info on the new <em>Avatar</em> sequel, rumors of legendary loot flooding<em> Borderlands 4</em>, a big patch for <em>Outer Worlds 2</em>, and some rare good news from the games industry.</p>

 <h2><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> gets a massive patch with over 300+ changes</h2> <p>Xbox and Obsidian’s well-reviewed <em>Fallout</em>-like RPG <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> just got a big ol’ update, and the patch notes for it are massive. Like huge! The patch notes list over 300+ bug fixes, tweaks, and changes to nearly every part of the game. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/huge-outer-worlds-2-patch-includes-over-350-fixes-and-changes-including-a-niche-addition-that-may-be-a-direct-response-to-a-disappointed-player-on-reddit-really-cool-they-did-that/">One particular highlight, as spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a>, includes a change that seems to be inspired by a single Reddit user who found a creative way to complete a quest, but was denied.</p>

   <p>According to newly <a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/avatar-fire-and-ash-53700">updated theater websites,</a> James Cameron’s next <em>Avatar</em> movie is going to be over three hours long. That’s not surprising. Specifically, the upcoming<em> Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> will be three hours and 15 minutes long. As an <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I’m ready and will be there day one. I’ll just make sure to empty my bladder first.</p>

 <h2>Vending machines in <em>Borderlands 4</em> seem to be giving out more legendary items</h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> is filled with vending machines. Usually, these aren’t very exciting and are just used to sell loot you don’t want. But recently, players have started spotting more and more legendary items popping up in vending machines. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-vending-machine-filled-with-more-legendary-weapons/">As reported by <em>The Gamer</em></a>, players on Reddit seem to think<em> Borderlands 4</em> is being more generous on purpose by shoving more legendary items into vending machines. Maybe! But I also think it’s possible that people are just documenting this phenomenon more, and it seems like an increase as a result. Still, if you have been hunting for legendary weapons, check out some vending machines in<em> Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Sega will raise employee pay again in 2026</h2> <p>Usually, when reporting on the game industry, it can be depressing. So it’s nice to see that Sega is doing something not terrible and is raising wages. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">As spotted by <em>Automaton</em></a>, starting in April 2026, Sega will raise the base salary for all full-time employees by around 10%. It’s also upping the pay for new hires, too.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101">Here’s your first look at next month’s <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> DLC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-story-melinoe-chronos-hecate-is-it-good-2000642943"><em>Hades II</em> isn’t a story — it’s maintenance&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/proceeds-from-battlefield-6s-veterans-day-pack-dont-directly-benefit-vets-2000643014"><em>BF6</em> charity bundle isn’t actually a charity bundle</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-loot-boxes-gambling-roblox-2000642980"><em>Fortnite</em> will let users add loot boxes to custom games</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-union-rockstar-court-legal-developers-2000643478</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Almost two weeks after <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">31 developers were fired</a> from Rockstar Games, the union representing the former employees says the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker has refused to meet with it to discuss what it alleges was an act of union busting aimed at disrupting ongoing organizing efforts at the UK-based studios. The IWGB now plans to move forward with legal claims against the company asserting that the firings “constitute trade union victimization and blacklisting.”</p>

 <p>A spokesperson for the union said legal claims were submitted to the country’s Employment Tribunal last Thursday and the date for an initial hearing will depend on the court’s backlog. Take-Two and Rockstar have denied allegations of mishandling the firings, claiming the employees were released for “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">gross misconduct</a>” related to allegedly sharing company secrets online. The union claims discussions only took&nbsp; place in private Discord channels.</p>

 <p>In the meantime, an ongoing pressure campaign, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030">including picketing outside Rockstar and Take-Two’s offices</a> in the UK, has apparently failed to bring the company back to the table to discuss getting the fired developers their jobs back so they can continue working on the recently delayed blockbuster.</p>

 <p>“Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful,” lawyers for the union wrote in a statement. “Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants.”</p> <p>The core of the legal fight could come down to whether individual employment contracts with the fired employees trump broader labor protections for union organizing. “We are confident that what we’ve seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in a statement. “Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.”</p>

              <p>Despite it’s name. there’s no need to have your desktop take up all the space on the top of your desk. You can reduce the footprint your PC takes up by downsizing to a small but powerful mini PC. The Blackview MP100 Mini PC is a wonderful solution for any of your school, business, or personal needs, plus right now Amazon happens to have it on sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5479/">That’s right.

<h2>Do It All Without Giving Up Desk Space</h2>
<p>The mini PC is damn-near pocket-sized, measuring at just five by five inches and coming in under two inches high.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-stella-montis-community-shredder-matriarch-2000643465</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-is-getting-a-new-map-but-players-have-to-work-to-unlock-it.1351195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since the game launched on October 30, one map on <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ rotation has remained locked. That’s about to change. The mysterious “Stella Montis” map will soon be available following a community event to unlock it. And when players arrive, there’ll be new Arc to contend with. They don’t sound friendly. The new community event kicks off tomorrow, November 13, 2025. Here’s everything you need to know.</p>

 <p>Developer Embark Studios has revealed what’s in store for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first major post-launch content update and community event (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-first-major-update-north-line-goes-live-tomorrow-heres-what-to-expect">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). But before anyone can step foot on the new frontier of Stella Montis, players will have to work for it via “Breaking New Ground,” described as a “multi-phase community event leading to a Stella Montis unlock.”</p>

 <p>There aren’t too many details about what, exactly, players will be doing during the event. But the developer has promised “rare resources, new gameplay items, and potential weapon blueprints.” The event will feature its own currency, “Merits,” and will only be available until December.</p> <p>Once accessible, Stella Montis will be home to an exclusive Arc, the Shredder. Embark describes the threat as something that will force “Raiders to stay sharp in close-quarters encounters.” Good news for those tired of shooting drones and rolly things that go pop. Other than that, the “Matriarch” Arc is being described as a “hulking Arc that makes the Queen look friendly.”</p> <p>Oh. How joyous.</p> <p>The new community event goes live on November 13 at 10:30 A.M. EST.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-skins-cosmetics-decks-battle-pass-duos-2000643456</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-lowering-skin-prices-and-issuing-refunds-after-backlash.1351192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>While <i>Arc Raiders</i> certainly isn’t alone in featuring paid cosmetics and, soon, battle passes, the game has come under fire from fans since launch for its pricey skins and concerns that some items in the upcoming premium battle passes will be “pay-to-win.” In a blog post outlining some pricing changes, however, developer Embark Studios is responding to player feedback and concern, lowering prices on existing cosmetics and clarifying what fans can expect when premium battle passes arrive.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gifts-premium-currency-after-server-struggles-2000640888">Backlash against expensive skin pricing</a> in <i>Arc Raiders</i> swiftly followed the game’s release on October 30. With the game selling for $40 rather than being free-to-play, fans weren’t too happy about skins in the premium store costing half that. Meanwhile, the limited customization options associated with cheaper items like face paints have seemed to discourage folks from getting too excited over them.</p>

 <p>But <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/">according to an official blog post</a> today, Embark Studios is lowering prices on skins and refunding folks (in premium currency) who purchased them at the older, more expensive price. Furthermore, the studio has clarified that any usable gameplay items found in upcoming battle passes will be in the free versions available to all players. “The focus for premium [battle passes] are based on cosmetics and convenience,” the developer wrote.</p>

 <p>As some fans have pointed out, since you can lose gear in an extraction shooter just as easily as you can find it, gameplay items in a premium battle pass wouldn’t be locked to a player and thus wouldn’t be as unfair in theory, but it’s still nice to see the game avoid any accusations of being pay-to-win.</p>

 <h2>Duo matchmaking was secretly enabled</h2> <p>Since launch, players have asked for duo-only matchmaking, allowing pairs of folks to venture out into games populated by other pairs. Embark Studios confirmed that it has “silently tested and enabled Duo prioritized matchmaking” earlier this week. While it cautioned that “you may [still] run into differing constellations of players other than your own,” the developer described the matchmaking system like this:</p> <blockquote><p>First, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios.</p></blockquote> <p>As a solo player, I haven’t been too bothered by mismatched player counts in squads out there, but hopefully this will help balance out PvP skirmishes in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/snag-the-top-rated-11-inch-samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-for-under-150-with-this-deal-2000643098</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-just-hit-a-price-apple-would-never-offer-selling-out-fast-after-10k-units-sold.1351138/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A tablet can come in handy when your phone feels too small, but you don’t want to carry your laptop around. These screens are great for being productive on the go, and even keeping your kids entertained (for a while at least). That said, you don’t always have to spend $300+ to get something that’s powerful enough to get through your busy days, yet easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Thankfully, early Black Friday deals are already rolling in, making it easy to grab a high-end option without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">Amazon has now dropped the price of the 11-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ to just $149, after a massive 32% off its regular price of $220.</a> This deal applies to the Graphite model, but if you prefer the Silver version, that one’s just a dollar more at $150. The only catch? It’s already selling fast, and stock might run out before the deal ends. It’s best to grab it while it’s still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Portable, Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>This sleek tablet comes with an 11-inch screen that’s big enough to open multiple windows side-by-side without feeling cramped. The WUXGA display (1920 x 1200) pushes vibrant, detailed visuals that bring content to life, whether you’re playing a game or watching a TV show. The 90Hz refresh rate keeps everything running smoothly, while the 480 nits of brightness ensure you experience exceptional clarity in both bright and dim settings.</p>
<p>Of course, good visuals are only half the experience. You will also enjoy quality sound with the tablet’s quad-speaker setup with Dolby Atmos support. Every movie dialog (even the whispers) will come through clearly, kids’ songs are going to sound better, and even video calls will feel more natural. Speaking of video calls, there’s a solid front camera as well, which makes you look your best while catching up with family and friends.</p>



<p>For power, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ packs a Snapdragon 695 processor, paired with <strong>4GB of RAM </strong>and<strong> 64GB of internal storage</strong>. That’s enough for some light multitasking, plus storing all your important files or media content in one place. If you ever need more space, you can always expand it up to 1TB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>It supports Smart View, which means you can cast your screen to a Samsung TV whenever you want to enjoy a bigger viewing experience, easily. And finally, the battery also lasts all day, plus charges back up quickly when you need it.</p>
