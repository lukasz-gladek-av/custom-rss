There are still many titles being released, but I feel that the era of games where the volume is the selling point is coming to an end.”</p><p> Nagoshi left the<em> Like a Dragon</em> publisher three years ago to set up his own studio, and is currently working on a new project with NetEase Games. As the new game enters full production, he said the team is currently deciding on the final estimate of how much content will be in it. It sounds like he’s steering away from just making it big for the sake of an impressive-sounding interview soundbite or back-of-the-box quote </p><p>“Of course we have the map, but the current version is so large that it’s almost too large,” he told Famitsu. “This time, while researching existing games, we started by making a fairly large map with roads and highways. Now we are gradually shrinking it down and exploring the best balance for the game.”</p><p>The size of a game’s map, the total length of its script, and the average runtime for players are often deployed in pre-release marketing campaigns to bolster the sense that a game is worth its asking price. Value is reduced to how long it will keep a player busy, rather than whether any of the stuff they are doing feels meaningful or fun. That might be a plus for people who just want two or three games that will occupy them all year long, but for everyone else it can make getting to the “good” parts of a game feel like working a second job. </p><p>We’ll see how much that philosophy ends up impacting Nagoshi’s next project. The last <em>Like a Dragon</em> he oversaw as an executive at Sega, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473">2020's <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em></a></span>, ran 45 hours on average, or over 100 for those seeking a completionist playthrough.

Once there, the team splits into two groups as they make their way through the mission. Rook leads one group while you have to make the call between whether Davrin or Harding will lead the second team. This will take them out of your party selection for the duration of the mission and you’ll see them throughout the assault guiding the rest of your party and helping you from time to time.

This isn’t a <em>Mass Effect 2</em> Suicide Mission moment, it’s an original <em>Mass Effect </em>Virmire decision. Harding and Davrin’s lives are mutually exclusive and whichever one you choose to lead the team will die by the end of the assault…presumably. When you return to the Lighthouse base, you can go to their respective rooms and examine some of their belongings. Rook will mention that there was “no trace” of whoever sacrificed themself for the cause, which could give BioWare an out to bring either character back in a future game. But whatever <em>Dragon Age </em>does in the future, <strong>you will lose Harding or Davrin for the remainder of the game</strong>, and if you romanced them you won’t see the culmination of that relationship.</p><p>There’s also another similar decision you make between Bellara and Neve that results in the character you choose getting captured by the elven gods. To be as spoiler-light as I can, I’ll just say you will be able to save them later in the game, but they will not rejoin your active party. So it’s not all bad!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This will also include a return to the 6v6 rule set, two-tank role queue player compositions, and the no-limit mode that lets you play whatever characters you want without any restriction. This will also bring some old maps like the two-point capture maps Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, and Volskaya Industries back into rotation. Check out the trailer below:</p><p>According to Blizzard’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post on the event</a></span>, this is “separate” from the team’s broader 6v6 plans, as it will focus primarily on the original hero roster, rather than all the characters who have been added since. I didn’t start playing <em>Overwatch </em>until 2019, so some of this will be new to me, such as there being four roles instead of the current three. Some of the abilities seen in the trailer, like Symettra having six turrets, are things I only know by reputation, so this will be a way to fill a hole in my <em>Overwatch </em>experience.</p><p>Admittedly, I don’t think this does much for me, given that my big problems with <em>Overwatch 2 </em>are largely about its failure to deliver things like the story missions and generate any plot momentum, rather than about pining for the <em>Overwatch </em>of old. But if this gives me a reason to play the game with some regularity over the next few weeks and brings friends who won’t play <em>Overwatch 2 </em>with me back, that’s a net win, I suppose.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> is currently in its 13th season, which features a Halloween-themed battle pass and a Widowmaker mythic skin. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
