It’ll be a nice dose of 2006 nostalgia hitting right in the middle of the summer showcase hangover, so given this, why isn’t Microsoft making the whole thing free for players across PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,196909" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Reloaded</em> is a 4K remaster of the grizzly cover-based shooter originally released on Xbox 360. Making the occasion extra special is the fact that the cinematic sci-fi war epic is now coming for the first time to PlayStation. It would therefore seem like a no-brainer to make these two beta weekends free for anyone who wants to hop in and discover<em> Gears of Wa</em>r’s unique (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/three-words-i-said-to-the-man-i-defeated-in-gears-of-wa-5914348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/three-words-i-said-to-the-man-i-defeated-in-gears-of-wa-5914348">and sometimes toxic</a></span>) flavor of online deathmatch for themselves. Instead, the beta will be exclusive to players who have already ponied up money.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do to qualify for<em> Reloaded</em>’s two-weekend, cross-platform, cross-play multiplayer beta running June 13-15 and June 20-22:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pre-order <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> digitally for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Steam or PlayStation 5   </li><li>Have an active Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass membership  </li><li>Own a digital copy of <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Note that Xbox Series X/S players won’t just need to have an active Game Pass subscription to play, they’ll need to have the more expensive Game Pass Ultimate tier. On PS5, meanwhile, players will have to have pre-ordered the entire $40 remaster. The only ones really lucking out here are those on PC or Xbox who already own the previous <em>Ultimate Edition </em>remaster which nets them an upgrade to Reloaded, and access to the beta, for free. </p><p>It’s a shame the entire beta isn’t free for everyone across all platforms. It would act as an invitation back into the brutal but unique world of classic <em>Gears</em> multiplayer, where the slow movement, snappy dodge rolls, and OP shotguns are unlike anything else in the modern  shooter landscape (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1ct0ybz/gears_12_and_3_multiplayer_are_getting_more/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1ct0ybz/gears_12_and_3_multiplayer_are_getting_more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and still has an active community in the original trilogy</a></span>). It would also be a neat moment of multiplatform camaraderie as Microsoft pushes its new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">post-console war, play anywhere, everything is an Xbox-approach to gaming</a></span>. Instead, it’s demanding a cover charge. </p><p>“Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business,” Microsoft Gaming CEO said on the Xbox podcast at Summer Game Fest last week. “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line.” It’s hard not to see a combination of small things like this, and big things like charging $80 for<em> The Outer Worlds 2 </em>(<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-the-outer-worlds-2-hits-usd80-director-says-we-dont-set-the-prices-for-our-games-and-wishes-everybody-could-play-obsidians-new-rpg/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-the-outer-worlds-2-hits-usd80-director-says-we-dont-set-the-prices-for-our-games-and-wishes-everybody-could-play-obsidians-new-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which Obsidian pointed out was Microsoft’s decision</a></span>), as part of a renewed focus on that growth. </p><p>“That’s kind of a foundation for us,” Spencer continued. “And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade-offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because it is kind of we are the business that we are, but the business is having really good success.” Good enough to eventually decide to make the second beta weekend free? We’ll see. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mode director Yu Sahara, who’s worked on <em>Metal Gear </em>in the past, distinguished it from <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, a multiplayer spin-off of <em>Metal Gear Solid 4 </em>that featured tactical stealth takes on traditional scenarios like team deathmatch and capture the flag.</p><p>“The landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot,” he said during the livestream. Indeed it has, but the most appealing about Metal Gear getting multiplayer again is how old-school it might end up feeling compared to the current glut of extraction shooters, battle royales,and battle passes. Here’s a quick teaser from the showcase:</p><p>Instead of bringing that back, Sahara and the team at Konami worked on updating what <em>Metal Gear Online </em>might look like decades later. The focus will still be on camouflage and staying hidden before choosing the right time to go after an objective or surprise an opponent, and footage in a brief teaser showed characters getting into what look like small D-Walker-type mechs on the battlefield. Also lots of operatives crawling around in leaf shrouds. </p><p>Konami didn’t have anything else to reveal about the mode other than it will be arriving with the rest of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> at launch on August 28. In addition to Fox Hunt, the remake also features a Snake vs. Bomberman mode and one where he has to round-up monkeys from Ape Escape. Despite the new content, however, much of the base game appears to be an exceedingly faithful retread of the 2000s-era stealth thriller, just with modern controls and other tweaks to make it more approachable for new audiences. The original is still available to play as part of the <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection</em> released back in 2023. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
