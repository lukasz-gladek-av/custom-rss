It just might mean you need to have two versions of the game installed depending on who you are playing with, which sounds kind of silly even if I understand why.</p><p>Regardless of that hang-up, its nice to see Rockstar Games finally getting around to updating the PC port of<em> GTA V</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">even if we are likely less than a year away from the release of <em>GTA 6</em></a></span>.
