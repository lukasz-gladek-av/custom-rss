              <p>Last month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6’s</em> open beta</a> on PC and consoles quickly became one of the most-played games of 2025. But like any modern game hitting Xbox in 2025, <em>BF6</em> is launching on both the Series X and the weaker Series S. And according to the devs behind the game, getting <em>BF6</em> to run on the less powerful console was a “challenge.”</p> <p>Earlier this week, <em>Kotaku</em> sat down with two <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ttk-shotgun-jumping-sliding-nerf-changes-open-beta-ea-patch-notes-2000619184"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> devs to discuss the game’s console ports, and I asked if the team struggled while trying to get such a big and complicated game to run well on Xbox Series S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-release-delay-1851731006">We’ve heard stories</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-devs-xbox-series-s-x-performance-60fps-mode-1851674405">that the Series S</a> <a href="https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/">can cause devs headaches</a>. And despite Frostbite, <em>BF6</em>‘s engine, being very “scalable,” the Series S was still proven a tricky beast to conquer.</p> <p><span>“I will say that the biggest thing we did that was a challenge for us was [dealing with the console’s limited] memory,” explained Christian Buhl, technical director on <em>Battlefield 6.</em> “Xbox Series S does have less memory than even our mid-spec PC. And so there was a point…Oh, I want to say, like, 6 to 12 months ago where we kind of realized that a lot of our levels were crashing on Xbox Series S.”</span></p>

 <p>As a result, the team focused on “optimizing” memory usage in<em> Battlefield 6</em>. And these improvements weren’t just felt on Series S. According to Buhl, this process made the “whole game better and more stable.” However, the devs also worked on “specific optimizations” for Xbox Series S, too.</p> <p><span>“We were doing so much testing…we were collecting all this data,” explained Buhl. “Once we kind of started running all our levels through it, and were able to see where the problems were, after a month or two, we had kind of resolved all of our memory issues on Series S.” </span></p>

 <p><span>Buhl says <em>Battlefield 6</em> is now “super solid” and “performant” on Xbox Series S and will run at a “smooth 60 frames per second.” And <a href="https://youtu.be/m3nUC1dUFy8">footage of the game’s open beta running on Series S</a> seems to back that up.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>EA Won’t Talk About <em>Battlefield 6</em> On Switch 2</h2> <p>Of course, with Frostbite being so scalable and the studio working hard to make <em>BF6</em> super optimized, I wanted to ask if, theoretically, the game could run on a Switch 2. The studio is even i<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-controversial-quick-turn-flick-console-why-cheating-2000625445">mplementing gyro controls on PS5 and PS5 Pro</a> to let players flick around quickly or reload with the simple waggle of the gamepad.</p>

 <p>However, when I asked if it would be possible for <em>Battlefield 6</em> and Frostbite to run on a Switch 2 based on the specs, an EA rep stepped in and cut off Buhl right as he began to say something.</p> <p><span>“Sorry, I have to step in here,” said the EA rep. “We can’t talk anything beyond, sort of, like, the consoles that <em>Battlefield’s</em> coming to, which is Xbox Series X/S and PS5, and PS5 Pro.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Later on, when the team was talking about gyro controls, I brought up how the Switch 2 has excellent gyro sensors in its Joy-Con.</p>

 <p><span>“Exactly, yeah,” was the response. So, at least I can confirm the devs working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> think the Switch 2 has great <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaming-controllers-gyro-trackpad-scuf-mouse-keyboard-2000624503">gyro controls. </a>Beyond that, nothing.</span></p> <p>I’m very excited to play <em>Battlefield 6</em> once it launches on October 10 on my PS5 Pro and high-end gaming PC. But not everyone has access to those devices, and some players are gaming on the aging and weaker Xbox Series S. So I’m happy to hear that the devs behind the game worked so hard on optimizing it and making sure all platforms get a great version of <em>Battlefield 6.</em> And hey, maybe Switch 2 owners will get their own solid version of <em>BF6</em> in the future?</p>
