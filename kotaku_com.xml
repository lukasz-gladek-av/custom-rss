              <p>It can be such a pain to run out of battery, whether that’s on your phone, computer, or otherwise. If you find yourself in that predicament more often than is practical, you should have a portable charger to help make sure you’re juiced up whenever you need to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">The Anker Prime Charger, 160W is up for grabs at Amazon for a limited time at a discounted price of $105.99 compared to its original retail price of $150.</a> That’s a discount of $44.01, or about 29% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful yet compact portable charger</h2>
<p>This is a powerful and compact portable charger that lets you charge several electronic devices simultaneously. That makes it a great pick for cell phones, tablets, game consoles, and more. It provides up to 160W of power through each of its USB-C ports, so it can safely and rapidly fast-charge a USB-C laptop while charging two additional devices (phone and/or tablet) at the same time.</p>
<p>The USB-C ports are ideal for providing high-power charging to newer laptops, tablets and smartphones, while the USB-A ports are ideal for charging older phones, Bluetooth speakers and/or other smaller electronic devices. Additionally, the Anker Prime Charger has Power Delivery (PD) capability, enabling it to supply power to your electronic devices at the fastest possible rate, allowing you to charge your devices quicker and more efficiently.</p>



<p>Although the Anker Prime Charger has the potential to deliver a significant amount of power, it’s still super small. You can put it on a desktop surface, nightstand, or kitchen counter without taking up too much valuable real estate. It’s also super lightweight and easily storable in a backpack or travel case, making it ideal for use during business trips, vacations, or work-from-home/coworking days, when users would prefer a single charger to replace a tangled mess of individual chargers and cables.</p>
<p>Built-in safety features enable you to feel confident when connecting expensive electronic devices. The Anker Prime Charger constantly monitors temperature and power consumption to ensure that it protects against heat damage (overheating), excessive voltage, and/or electrical shock due to short circuit conditions. Although these protective mechanisms operate transparently, they offer considerable peace-of-mind benefits when you need to charge multiple high-value devices at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">This Anker Prime Charger is absolutely perfect for its size, capacity, and performance.</a> It eliminates clutter, enables fast-charging capabilities for newer devices, and is compatible with both home and travel-based environments. Bottom line? You should get one and keep it in your bag, car, or somewhere else that you use often in case of emergencies. You never know when you might get struck with a charging emergency.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I’m Begging For A Sequel After Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Ships 1 Million Copies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-sales-sequel-2000657141</link>
            <guid>1398481</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How many more copies does <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> need to sell before Square Enix greenlights a new grid-based strategy RPG? Almost three years later, physical versions of<em> Hi-Fi Rush</em> are finally up for pre-order. And how long will it take for Netflix to turn <em>Arc Raiders</em> into its next streaming hit?</p> <p>It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Depending on what you’re into, January will probably feel like a slow month for big new game releases, at least compared to last year. But I’m getting lowkey hyped for <a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><em>Code Vein 2</em></a>, the follow-up to the messy 2019 action-RPG anime soulslike. This one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJLfjZd78hw">has a motorcycle</a>.</p>

 <h2>Even<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ original director can’t believe how well the remaster is selling</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I underestimated the sales figures by too much.😂😂😂</p> <p>— 松野泰己🐈‍⬛ (@YasumiMatsuno) <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/2008464271731257715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Square Enix revealed that<em> Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> has sold over 1 million copies. That might be “below expectations” for the infamously disappointed Japanese publisher, but it was enough to take Yasumi Matsuno by surprise. It also prompted a fresh message to fans from the remaster’s director.</p>

 <p>“The entire development team is not only grateful to you, but, in order to spread the joy, create a better experience, and encourage more people to play, we are looking at updating the game in the future!” Kazutoyo Maehiro wrote, according to a translation <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/og-final-fantasy-tactics-director-admits-he-underestimated-how-popular-the-ivalice-chronicles-would-be-as-it-passes-1-million-copies-sold-with-the-remakes-lead-teasing-future-updates/">from <em>Gamesradar</em></a>. What does updating the game in the future entail, exactly? Could the missing War of the Lions content be officially restored? Could we get fresh end-game modes?</p>

 <p>“Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">told<em>&nbsp;Wired</em></a> last year. “If [<em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>] were to become a success,” he continued, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.”</p>

 <p>Let the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics 2</em> summoning circle commence.</p> <h2>You can finally pre-order a physical copy of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></h2> <p>The 2023 GOTY contender from Tango Gameworks, a studio that Microsoft closed in 2024 but which was later re-opened under Krafton, is finally getting a physical version that you can start pre-ordering <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/2008192175138299918">from Limited Run Games on January 23</a>. That includes a PS5 version. This is one game everyone should have in their collection, even if it could still be a year before it actually starts shipping.</p>

 <h2>We could end up getting an<em> Arc Raiders</em> TV show</h2> <p>Embark studio head Patrick Söderlund <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w">told <em>GamesBeat</em></a> that Hollywood is interested and so is he. “We [wouldn’t] mind doing that. It would be fun, but it needs to be done in the right way. I hope that we will do that. I think the IP fits quite well with something like that.” Nothing is set in stone yet, however, and Embark doesn’t “have anyone working on a TV or film adaptation yet.” Maybe we’ll see it on Netflix in time for <em>Arc Raiders 2</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Game of Thrones</em> star Sophie Turner was fine with her ending</h2> <p>She acknowledges that the rest of the cast was disappointed with their characters’ fates. “But I feel that I was very happy with the way Sansa ended her story in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and no one else was really happy with their ending,” Turner <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/sophie-turner-game-of-thrones-sequel-return">told <em>The Direct</em></a><em>.</em> “I feel like I got a good one, and so I don’t know if I could revisit it.” Would she come back to do more <em>Game of Thrones</em>? “Show me the money,” she joked. She might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">too busy with</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> anyway.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy 9</em>‘s character artist says goodbye</h2> <p>Toshiyuki Itahana left Square Enix at the end of last year. “Last year marked a major milestone with the 25th anniversary of FINAL FANTASY IX, a truly significant event, and I was deeply grateful to see so many people celebrating FFIX,” he <a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">wrote</a> in a message to fans. He’ll continue to produce art as a freelance illustrator.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mudang-two-hearts-splinter-cell-layoffs-shut-down-release-date-2000656736">The Korean <em>Splinter Cell</em> revealed at last year’s Xbox summer showcase could be in trouble</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/guy-behind-viral-focus-m-gaming-meme-never-expected-it-to-spread-so-fast-2000656706">The guy behind the viral AAA <em>Mario</em> meme is as surprised as you are</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><em>Stranger Things</em> fans need to let go</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-practically-gives-away-the-kindle-colorsoft-to-clear-out-last-years-remaining-e-reader-stock-2000657124</link>
            <guid>1398442</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to get back into reading in 2026, or just read more? Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>I love my paperbacks, but over time, I have realized how much more convenient digital copies are for reading on the go. You also get more variety, instead of feeling stuck with that one book you grabbed in a hurry and aren’t really in the mood for anymore – coming from someone who often picks a classic when all that the brain needs is some Murakami.</p>
<p>If you’re not a fan of reading on your phone or tablet, a Kindle can be an excellent investment. There are multiple versions available, but right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">Amazon is offering a chance to pick the latest Kindle Colorsoft at a nice 20% discount, for just $200.</a> You’re saving a sweet $50 on a reading solution that makes it easy to have all your favorite titles accessible at all times, wherever you go. Note that this deal ends soon, so it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep All Your Favorite Titles Close</h2>
<p>For $200, you’re getting a modest 7-inch, high-contrast Colorsoft display that’s easy on the eyes. Unlike the Kindle Paperwhite display, which is optimized for black and white reading, this version brings all the colors to life. It’s great for stories that include illustrations and maps – think The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Wheel of Time – plus comics where color really enhances the overall experience. You can even highlight your favorite scenes in yellow, orange, blue, or pink, and come back to revisit the moments later.</p>
<p>The brightness is adjustable. You can tweak the display from white to amber, depending on your environment. Switch to white light when you’re catching up on the latest Arundhati Roy book while soaking up some sun, and move to a warmer setting for bedtime reading. Even better, the Page Color feature inverts the black text and white background of pages of the books for an even more comfortable experience. It’s different from Dark Mode, and still offers colorful images and covers.</p>



<p>Kindle Colorsoft is also waterproof, which means you can take your favorite titles with you by the pool and to the beach, and even in the bathroom! The battery life is another strong selling point, as a single charge via USB-C gets you up to 8 weeks of reading – you read that right. That means you go up to two months without worrying about plugging the device in. This makes it great to take with you on your off-road adventures and long trips.</p>
<p>The Kindle Store lets you browse through more than 15 million titles from authors around the world, while the Kindle Unlimited subscription offers an all-you-can-read access to a wide catalog that includes best sellers. Prime members can read from a selection of eBooks, magazines, comics, manga, and audiobooks with their Prime membership. If you have young readers at home, you can even create a kid’s profile for unlimited access to a kid-friendly library with an Amazon Kids+ subscription.</p>
<p>All things considered, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">we highly recommend the latest Kindle Colorsoft to anyone looking to read more in 2026, especially at its current price of $200.</a> This deal saves you a nice $50 on this device, plus there are no delivery charges to worry about, either. Grab the deal before the price goes back up to $250.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Garmin Forerunner 165 Hits Record Low as a Running Smartwatch Alternative to Apple Watch, Perfect for Your New Year’s Fitness Goals]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-forerunner-165-hits-record-low-as-a-running-smartwatch-alternative-to-apple-watch-perfect-for-your-new-years-fitness-goals-2000656782</link>
            <guid>1398403</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="487">Data plays a crucial role in improving your performance as an athlete. To enhance your speed, boost your endurance, and maintain a consistent training routine, investing in a top-notch running watch is key. Whether you’re preparing for a marathon, gearing up for a local 5K, or simply running a couple times a week, having a reliable running watch is essential to measuring your efforts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">Right now, Amazon is offering a limited-time discount on the Garmin Forerunner 165, slashing its price by $50—down to just $200.</a></p>
<p data-start="489" data-end="801">The Garmin Forerunner 165 is tailored for individuals leading active lifestyles and those focused on fitness. It boasts a 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen that offers crystal-clear visibility, whether you’re running in direct sunlight or during nighttime.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="803" data-end="830">Your Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="832" data-end="1301">The Garmin Forerunner 165’s built-in GPS lets you track your running routes and it provides accurate data on your distance, pace, and other essential metrics. The watch also includes wrist-based heart rate monitoring, making it perfect for athletes who train according to specific heart rate zones. With over 25 pre-loaded activity profiles, it supports a broad range of sports, including running, HIIT, cycling, strength training, and more.</p>
<p data-start="1303" data-end="1670">In addition to its advanced tracking capabilities, the Garmin Forerunner 165 can serve as a personal fitness coach. Using the Garmin Connect app, you can access free adaptive training plans from expert coaches, which can be synced directly to your watch. This takes the guesswork out of your training, ensuring a more efficient approach to improving your performance.</p>
<p data-start="1672" data-end="2095">Beyond workouts, the Garmin Forerunner 165 continues to monitor your overall health throughout the rest of your day. It keeps track of your heart rate, both during physical activities and while at rest. A favorite of mine is the Body Battery score, which evaluates your energy levels based on factors like heart rate and activity. This helps you identify the optimal times to train or rest, ensuring you stay at your peak performance.</p>


<p data-start="2097" data-end="2447">Battery life is impressive on the Forerunner 165. With GPS active, the watch can last up to 19 hours, which is perfect for long runs. When GPS isn’t in use, the battery can last for up to 11 days. Someone who is running multiple times a week will likely find themselves only need to charge the watch once a week. This makes it far superior to other smartwatches, such as the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch, which typically require daily charging.</p>
<p data-start="2449" data-end="2827">The Garmin Forerunner 165 also offers smart features similar to those found on more expensive smartwatches. When connected to a compatible smartphone, the watch allows you to receive notifications for emails, texts, and alerts directly on your wrist. This means you can keep your phone tucked away while staying connected and informed during your workouts or throughout the day.</p>
<p data-start="2829" data-end="3118" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">Typically priced at $250, it’s currently available for just $200 with a 20% discount</a>. You can select between two stylish band colors: black or white, depending on your preference.</p>
