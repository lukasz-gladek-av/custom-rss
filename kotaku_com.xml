The card game features many famous and obscure Disney characters from movies like <em>Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Snow White</em>, and more. I’ve been playing since last year and have had a great time with it. But I also know that getting into <em>Lorcana </em>can seem overwhelming and confusing at first. </p><p>However, there’s actually a really simple, cheap, and easy way to get into Disney’s hit card game. All you need to do is buy the <em>Lorcana </em>Gateway kit. That’s it. </p><h2 id="h358047"><a id=""></a>Buy A <em>Lorcana </em>Gateway Kit!</h2><p>No, seriously, if you and a friend, spouse, or sibling want to start learning and playing <em>Lorcana</em>, just buy the Gateway kit. That’s all you need! This starter kit contains two decks, four booster packs, a playing mat, damage tokens, a handy rule book, and a guide that walks both players through learning <em>Lorcana</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://go.skimresources.com?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgames%2Ffamily-games%2Fdisney-lorcana-tcg-gateway-11098399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgames%2Ffamily-games%2Fdisney-lorcana-tcg-gateway-11098399" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">While the retail price of this kit is $25</a></span> or more, its regularly marked down for half that or less at places like Walmart and Best Buy.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-lorcana-gateway-trading-card-game%2F-%2FA-90178605%23lnk%3Dsametab&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-lorcana-gateway-trading-card-game%2F-%2FA-90178605%23lnk%3Dsametab" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"> I found a copy at Target recently for $12 and that deal is available online</a></span> as of this writing. At that price, the Gateway kit is one of the best deals in card games. </p><p>Just make sure you buy a Gateway kit specifically, and not a Treasure Trove or Starter Deck box. These can sometimes cost around the same price and offer some of what’s found in the Gateway box, but they aren’t the same.</p><figure id="" data-id="363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-recommend-id="image://363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ravensburger / Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-recommend-id="image://363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Lorcana</em> Gateway kit’s cover has Mickey Mouse, Elsa, Maleficent, and Stitch on the front and features a big gold sticker that says “Learn to Play!” It also says “Gateway” on the bottom of the front of the box. That’s the one you want to buy! </p><p>I’ve played a lot of card games, both physical and digital, and learning them can be a hassle. And my wife has far less experience with card games than I do. But in just a few hours, we were both playing the game without looking up rules or making mistakes. And more importantly, we were having fun.</p><h2 id="h358048"><a id=""></a>The Gateway kit is the perfect way to learn <em>Lorcana</em></h2><p>The key is that <em>Lorcana’s </em>Gateway Kit isn’t just a bunch of cards, but instead a fully developed system that slowly builds up each player’s deck and options over time. </p><p>You start with just 30 cards each containing simple, basic characters. You then play a few matches and work together to complete challenges laid out in the guidebook. These tasks are usually simple, but make you engage with the game’s mechanics. So you might have to both play five high-cost cards, or challenge and defeat seven characters, things like that. </p><p>Once you’ve completed all the challenges and feel comfortable with the rules and cards so far, you unlock new cards via reward pack boosters. In here you’ll find specific new cards that add a few more rules and options to your deck. Then you complete more challenges and repeat until you’ve unlocked all the rewards. At that point, you’ll each have a full <em>Lorcana </em>deck of over 60 cards and you’ll completely understand how the game works.</p><p>This is the best way to learn a card game in my opinion. It’s fun, cooperative, and super effective. And you can reset the Gateway kit using a guide found inside and teach other players using the same box. Nifty! </p><h2 id="h358049"><a id=""></a>What to do after you learn <em>Lorcana</em></h2><p>Okay, so after learning how to play <em>Lorcana </em>using the Gateway kit, you might want to keep playing and collect more cards. Now what? Personally, I recommend picking up a few starter decks. These contain 60 cards and a booster pack and let you quickly get your hands on a pre-built deck with some solid synergy options. </p><p>You can also start buying boosters online or in card shops. I’d avoid some retailers that sell them at full price (or more!) and instead look for places selling these 12-card packs at a discount.</p><figure id="" data-id="cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-recommend-id="image://cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ravensburger / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-recommend-id="image://cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you do start to buy booster packs and starter decks, you might also want to invest in a few deck boxes, some card sleeves, and something to hold your excess cards in when they aren’t in a deck. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://go.skimresources.com?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fdisney-lorcana%2Faccessories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fdisney-lorcana%2Faccessories" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">There are official <em>Lorcana</em>-branded products</a></span> if you want to go that route, but these tend to be a bit pricey.

They might also have weekly tournaments and <em>Lorcana</em> events where you can trade cards, play against other people, and learn more about the game. Just remember to have fun and don’t spend more than you can afford.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His family loses it and an inane argument about the iconic film ensues, eventually leading Peter to utter the enigmatic and now memed-to-death line, “It insists upon itself.” Nearly two decades later, the show’s creator, Seth McFarlane, finally explains what it means. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Since this has been trending, here’s a fun fact: ‘It insists upon itself’ was a criticism my college film history professor used to explain why he didn’t think ‘The Sound of Music’ was a great film,” McFarlane <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X this week</a></span>. “First-rate teacher, but I never quite followed that one.” The joke isn’t that Peter is all of a sudden being an erudite critic as the family prepares to drown from his latest idiotic stunt. It’s just a funny-sounding bunch of words that sounds like it should mean something but actually doesn’t. </p><p><em>Family Guy </em>superfans have been trying to decipher a deeper meaning for years, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions perennially sprouting up</a></span> on forums, subreddits, and social media. Sometimes the phrase just starts trending as users riff while passing idle moments gazing at their phones. Even now, people still maintain that Peter was on to something and they know exactly what he meant. </p><p>“This is why I did not like Jackson’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em>,” one person responded. “It slaps you in the face and shouts ‘This is an epic masterpiece! Appreciate it!’ I did not. He learned and toned it down a bit for the sequels.” What? </p><p>“My interpretation of ‘it insists upon itself’ is, when you’re watching it, you get the feeling that one of the intents behind the film was, ‘This is SUPPOSED to be good,’” wrote another. “There are many ways that you can try to be good without trying to be good, namely bucking trends. Insisting upon itself means it hit all the notes a ‘good’ movie “should.’”</p><p>The episode 77 gag ends with Peter revealing he hasn’t even finished <em>The Godfather</em> and prefers 1986's <em>The Money Pit </em>starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long instead. The punchline is that movie sucks, too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
