              <p data-start="0" data-end="392">The Xbox Core controller is widely regarded as one of the best gamepads available. Whether you’re gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or Android device, the first party Microsoft controller is always a solid choice. C<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6684/">urrently, the special edition Ice Breaker blue version is on sale for $50, down from its usual $80 price, giving you a remarkable $30 discount</a>. It’s rare to see the fancy colorways like this one go on sale for so much. It’s currently down to the same price as the basic carbon black model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6684/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="392">A Design That Just Works</h2>
<p data-start="394" data-end="948">While Sony has continually evolved its DualShock controllers each generation with new features like touchpads and adaptive triggers, Microsoft has taken a more conservative approach. The company pretty much nailed it with the Xbox 360 design. When the Xbox One controller launched in 2013, its ergonomics had been updated a bit. Now, more than a decade later, the design remains nearly identical, with only minor tweaks to keep up with modern standards. These include Bluetooth support, a switch to USB-C, and improvements in material quality. But overall, it’s the same controller that debuted alongside the console generation that first saw <em data-start="927" data-end="947">Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p data-start="950" data-end="1047">The Xbox Core controller has stuck to its tried-and-true formula because, quite simply, it works. Its super comfortable to play with, especially during long gaming sessions. I recently played <em data-start="1229" data-end="1244">Hollow Knight</em> on my PlayStation 5 in the lead up to <em data-start="1283" data-end="1293">Silksong</em>‘s launch. I decided to play the sequel upon release on PC and gifted myself a my first new Xbox controller in years. I hadn’t updated my Xbox controllers since the first couple years of the Xbox One, sticking mainly to PlayStation or third-party controllers like those from 8BitDo. It was a real “welcome home” moment. The comfort and ergonomics just feel so natural compared to other gamepads on the market.</p>


<p data-start="1655" data-end="2132">A standout but often underrated feature of the controller is its super precise D-pad. You’re in complete control as you guide Hornet throughout the world of Pharloom. The textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case are a thoughtful addition, making the controller feel secure and comfortable, especially during heated moments. It’s a small touch, but when my hands start to sweat during tough boss battles, it’s something I really appreciate.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2634">Microsoft has embraced customization options over the last decade. With the Xbox Accessories app, players can remap buttons to suit their preferences, adding a layer of accessibility that’s welcome for many. This feature is a great boon for those with specific needs to allow them to play at all, but it’s also useful for players who just want to personalize their setup. For example, someone who grew up with Nintendo consoles might struggle with the A and B button positions, and remapping can make all the difference.</p>
<p data-start="2636" data-end="3049" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Overall, the Xbox Core controller is a masterclass in simple, effective design. It may not have the flashy additions that PlayStation has introduced, but its comfort, precision, and customization options make it a gamepad that just works—no gimmicks necessary. That also keep the price down. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6684/">At just $50 for a limited time, this Ice Breaker Xbox core controller is a no brainer.</a></p>
