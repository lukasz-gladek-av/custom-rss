First as a set of BBC movies and later as an incomplete set of Hollywood blockbusters amid the <em>Harry Potter</em>-fueled YA fiction adaptation goldrush. So if it’s going to come back, it might as well be a completely different spin on the C.S. Lewis books about kids, witches, and talking lions. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>We already knew that Greta Gerwig—the director behind last year’s mega hit <em>Barbie</em>—was working on Narnia adaptations for Netflix, but thanks to an interview with the project’s producer, Amy Pascal, we now have a bit more color on what exactly those will consist of. The first of the movies will begin filming in 2025 and is “a very new take on Narnia,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/video/amy-pascal-interview-challengers-venom/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/video/amy-pascal-interview-challengers-venom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Deadline</em></a></span> this week<em>.</em> “It’s all about rock and roll.”</p><p>Come again?</p><p>For anyone unacquainted with the seven-book series, Lewis’ Narnia is a fantastical world children can occasionally access where time moves differently and the mundanities and horrors of normal life are replaced by magic, monsters, and a lion as Jesus allegory called Aslan. There is no rock and roll in Narnia, at least as we currently know it, or even much music. </p><p>So does this mean Gerwig’s take on the famous series will be a musical? Or will it be more subtle than that, like Sofia Coppola’s pop music-laced <em>Marie Antoinette</em> from 2006. We did get more than that in last year’s <em>Barbie</em>, which despite some full-blown numbers like “I’m Just Ken” sung by Ryan Gosling, stopped short of being a traditional musical. </p><p> “I don’t know,” Gerwig <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/greta-gerwig-interview-narnia-movies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/greta-gerwig-interview-narnia-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Gamesradar</em> last year</a></span> on the subject of the upcoming Narnia movies. “I haven’t even really started wrapping my arms around it. But I’m properly scared of it, which feels like a good place to start. I think when I’m scared, it’s always a good sign. Maybe when I stop being scared, it’ll be like, ‘Okay. Maybe I shouldn’t do that one.’ No, I’m terrified of it. It’s extraordinary. And so we’ll see, I don’t know.” </p><p>If 2024's <em>Wicked</em> is any indication, a rock and roll musical adaptation of one of the Narnia books is probably just what the century-old books need to get people reading them again. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It turned out that the 2022 agreement wasn’t binding, but the 2023 one was, and yet we’ve nearly run out of 2024 and still nothing’s started! We’ve now learned that the intervening time was spent agreeing to “creative guidelines,” which is actually more fun than it sounds—see below. I hope it was done over a game, GW playing Space Marines, Amazon playing Cultists, and Henry Cavill running around the room going “Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”</p><p>Back in 2022, poor, lovely Henry Cavill announced he was leaving Netflix’s adaptation of <em>The Witcher</em> to reprise his role as  Superman, moments before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-warhammer-40k-witcher-superman-amazon-1849903568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-warhammer-40k-witcher-superman-amazon-1849903568"><em>Black Adam</em> bombed so hard</a></span> that it destroyed the entire DC cinematic universe. James Gunn took over the franchise and made clear Cavill wasn’t part of his vision, and the actor was left standing at the altar, droopy flowers in his hands, his former fiancée now hooked up with Liam Hemsworth.</p><p>But then in swooped <em>Warhammer 40K</em> to sweep him off his feet, although it’s been a very drawn-out engagement. While today’s announcement at least confirms that projects can finally go ahead, the GW statement concludes, “Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years.”</p><p>Meanwhile, over on the less corporate face of the company, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer Community</em></a></span>, there’s a story that better details what’s happening right now, and what the last year entailed. They explain,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Well, it means we now have synopsis and ordering for the stories we’re going to tell... yep, we said <em>stories</em>! It might have taken a year but it was a year well spent! And what fun - sifting through the enormity of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, debating characters, story arcs and the thematic grit that underpins it all.</p></blockquote><p>“Enormity” is probably not the right word, unless they <em>really</em> hate it, but what splendid news! It wasn’t all lawyers and eyebrows, but proper planning to get a whole bunch of different shows (and maybe movies?) out of the license. </p><p>Next up, the site says, is scripts. The average time spent in a writers’ room for a prestige streaming show at the moment is around eight months, before anyone touches a camera or a paintbrush, so it doesn’t seem likely that filming would begin before 2026.

Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though—more to come in time!”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Out June 20, 2025, the movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and a ripped Ralph Fiennes, among others.</p><p>The most effective part of the trailer is a recitation of Rudyard Kipling’s  poem “Boots,” about marching during the Second Boer War in South Africa. “Try—try—try—try—to think o’ something different—Oh—my—God—keep—me from goin’ lunatic!” the voice over goes. “(Boots—boots—boots—boots—movin’ up an’ down again!) There’s no discharge in the war!”</p><p>The biggest mystery about the movie might not be why the rage virus is back, but what Murphy’s role will be. The central protagonist of the first movie, he’s set to appear in the third film but it’s not exactly clear how. In a split-second near 1:47 in the trailer there’s an emaciated zombie body that looks like Murphy, rising out of a field of wild flowers. Maybe he’s infected. Maybe he’s found a way to overcome the virus. A Sony exec <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/05/tom-rothman-streaming-audiences-quentin-tarantino-1235920644/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/tom-rothman-streaming-audiences-quentin-tarantino-1235920644/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously teased</a></span> his return “in a surprising way and in a way that grows, let me put it that way.”</p><p>Murphy was still relatively unknown back when <em>28 Days Later</em> came out in 2002. He later appeared as Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies and the hit series <em>Peaky Blinders</em>. Murphy returns to the zombie franchise after winning an Oscar for his performance last year in <em>Oppenheimer</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
