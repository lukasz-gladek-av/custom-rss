However, when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-cutscenes-skip-watch-1851783610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-cutscenes-skip-watch-1851783610"><em>Nightreign</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>launched in May, people were confused by the lack of a duos mode. But that option is coming soon. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 25</a></span>, FromSoftware announced that <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>’s 1.02 patch will add a duos option, letting “two kindred souls” play together. The patch is set to arrive on July 30. </p><p>Currently in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign,</em> there are two ways to play.  You can either play solo, which is tough and not something our resident <em>Nightreign </em>sicko Ethan Gach recommends, or you can play with two other people.  So if you and a friend want to hop into <em>Elden Ring Nightreign,</em> you either have to deal with a random third player or convince someone you know to play with you. </p><p>It’s a bit wild that it didn’t launch with a duos option, as it seems like something obvious that players would want. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200">In fact, within 48 hours of launch</a></span>, a modder added such an option to<em> Nightreign </em>on PC. So why didn’t FromSoftware include duos right away? Turns out, they just sort of didn’t think about it. </p><p> “The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we’re very sorry about that,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> director Junya Ishizaki told <em>IGN</em></a></span>. “As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus, and it’s at the core of <em>Nightreign</em>.”</p><p>However, starting next week, you and your best buddy will be able to play online together, without a rando, and get killed by tough bosses as a power couple instead of a clunky trio. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981]]></content:encoded>
