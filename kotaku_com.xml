              <p>Winter power outages strike more frequently than most people realize with ice storms, heavy snow and equipment failures leaving homes without electricity for hours or days at critical moments. Having backup power transforms these emergencies from stressful crises into manageable inconveniences by keeping essential appliances running.</p>
<p>EcoFlow specializes in portable power stations that bridge the gap between small battery banks and expensive whole-home generators and delivers practical backup capacity without professional installation. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/">At $349, down from $699, the Delta 2 has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday while <strong>being EcoFlow’s bestselling model across several years</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 1800W Output Powers Real Appliances</h2>
<p>The<strong> constant 1800W AC power with an accompanying surge power of 2700W</strong> enables the operation of genuine household electronics such as full-sized refrigerators, microwave ovens, space heaters, and medical electronics, beyond the capability of smaller power stations. The power offered here almost competes with the power offered by conventional gas-generators whose use has long been hamstrung by the need for gas tanks, the resultant air pollution, and the lack of quiet operation.</p>



<p>In the event of power outage during the cold seasons, the Delta 2 can power a furnace blower motor, light a refrigerator in order to save the food, and recharge mobile and laptop collections all at the same time. The <strong>use of all the available 15 outlets, ranging from the AC, USB-A, USB-C, and DC ports</strong>&nbsp;enables the operation of all the needed electronics.</p>



<p>The <strong>Delta 2 takes only 50 minutes to charge from empty to 80%</strong> and this has changed the way you now prepare in advance when there are forecasts of storms and unexpected power outages. Conventional portable power stations need 6-8 hours to fully recharge, and this means you could be left in the dark when there are forecasts of storm power outages and when the brief periods offered when the power may be restored are not sufficient for recharging.</p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery chemistry, LiFePO4, has an extraordinary lifespan<strong>, boasting 3000+ charge cycles and retention levels over 80% capacity</strong>, estimated at about 10 years. Another advantage the LiFePO4 battery chemistry boasts over other lithium-ion batteries is increased safety. The battery management system constantly monitors voltage, current, and temperatures in all the cells and <strong>protects against overcharge, over-discharge, overcurrent, and short-circuit conditions.</strong></p>
<p>While the EcoFlow Delta 2 normally costs $349, you can get this power solution with 1800W, 50-minute fast charging and long-lasting LiFePO4 battery technology at an unbelievable price this Black Friday.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>looks primed to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>take several awards home at The Game Awards next month</span></a><span>. Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>several nominations across multiple categories</span></a><span>, including the big one: Game of the Year. One category it is most represented in is Best Performance, which features three members of its English voice cast, one of whom has sparked a surprising conversation about how we recognize performances in video games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Daredevil </span></i><span>actor Charlie Cox, the voice behind </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s gunslinging false protagonist, admits that he wasn’t as involved in the game as other members of the cast. He spent a few hours in the booth and was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-charlie-cox-gustave-voice-1851784940"><span>surprised to hear just how much people loved his character</span></a><span>. Back in July, he </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-cox-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-actor-1851786701"><span>admitted he still hadn’t played the game yet, either</span></a><span>. Now that his performance as Gustave has been nominated for an award, Cox seems hesitant to take any of the credit.</span></p>

 <p><span>During a Q&amp;A segment at the La Conve 64 event in Mexico, Cox said that any credit he gets for his voice performance should be given to Gustave’s motion capture actor.</span></p> <p><span>“I’m thrilled for this nomination,” Cox said. “I’ve said this before, and I think it’s important to say, there’s an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game. So any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him because I kind of believe that the performance of that character is really down to him, and my voice is just part of that process.”</span></p>

   <p><span>Cazoria has since responded to Cox’s sentiment on his </span><a href="https://x.com/maxence_cazorla/status/1993339680608465405?s=20"><span>X account</span></a><span>, saying that the actor’s words were appreciated, but bringing Gustave to life was a team effort.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for all the messages these past few days.<br>Charlie’s words were incredibly generous, and I’m truly grateful 🙏<br>Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I’m honored to have played my part in it.<br>Thank you all so much for the love and support 🌹🤍<br>Tomorrow comes ✨</p> <p>— Maxence Cazorla (@maxence_cazorla) <a href="https://twitter.com/maxence_cazorla/status/1993339680608465405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Notably, Cazoria was also the motion capture for Renoir and Verso. Ben Starr, who provided the English dub for Verso, is also nominated in the Best Performance category, as well as Jennifer English for her role as Maelle. Cazoria may not be the name many English-speaking players associate with these characters, but as Cox points out, the motion capture artists deserve credit for helping bring these characters to life.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Is there a future where The Game Awards recognizes motion capture actors separately from voice actors? Some industry professionals, like </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>performance director Aliona Baranova, sure hope so.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yup, i think we should have a motion capture category at awards shows <a href="https://t.co/6vYaLwXU7X">https://t.co/6vYaLwXU7X</a></p> <p>— Aliona Baranova (@alionabaranova1) <a href="https://twitter.com/alionabaranova1/status/1993588077508673841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I would be surprised if The Game Awards bothers to make that distinction. The show already has a propensity to imperfectly lump categories together, such as discontinuing the Best Shooter category to put those games in the Best Action Game pile. But maybe as the industry becomes more aware of how many moving parts make up a whole character like Gustave, award shows will find ways to recognize everyone involved, rather than just the person behind the voice.</span></p>
