            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) enters the news yet again as <i>Black Ops 7</i>’s devs have fully committed to an about-face on the highly debated practice of matching folks with relative skill levels in online matches with randos. Not only will matches have more variety of skill level across players, but perhaps most excitingly, randomly matched lobbies that vibe well can stick together across multiple games, much like how things used to work in the good old days of <i>Halo 3</i> and other shooters that let people party up and play together in game after game more seamlessly.</p> <p>The news broke <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes">via a blog post</a> following the game’s beta (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1976285808446537995">h/t <i>CharlieIntel</i></a><i>)</i>, and it’s music to the ears of many. In theory, grouping up people of similar skill levels in random matches sounds good. In practice, opponents of this approach argue that it leads to sweatier, more competitive matches. Its overuse effectively eliminates a more relaxed playstyle in which every match isn’t just a zero-sum game for aspiring esports competitors to rule the leaderboards.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SBMM war is over… never thought we'd see it <a href="https://t.co/nMnglDVgdv">https://t.co/nMnglDVgdv</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1976296080267719063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>SBMM isn’t being totally thrown out. The dev blog states that there’ll be “minimal skill consideration” for default <i>BLOPS 7</i> games. So hopefully that means we won’t see too many players with a pro-level skillset demolishing folks just looking to unwind after work with a few rounds of <i>COD</i>.</p> <p>I’m skeptical that this pivot will see the debate over SBMM go away. Still, it’s a great opportunity for <i>BLOPS7</i> to serve as a case study for how devs can design matchmaking features that optimize having fun without shutting out the more competitive players amongst us.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This HP Laptop Was Pricier Than a MacBook, Now It’s Nearly 90% Off and Feels Practically Free (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/your-eyes-arent-lying-this-87-off-hp-touchscreen-laptop-at-amazon-is-a-real-thing-2000629668</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The days of the touchscreen laptop living in the premium price slot may be over for good, if this Amazon post-Prime Day deal is any indicator. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Touchscreen-Processor-14-Bluetooth/dp/B0FMJJH35F/?tag=kotaku01-20">The original $2,999 price tag on this 14-inch HP touchscreen Intel laptop might verge on ridiculous, but the 87%-off deal that drops that number down to just $390 is also ridiculous, but in a good way</a>.</p>
<p>The huge leaps forward made by tablets and their keyboard attachments may have taken eyes off of the touchscreen laptop, but this HP model is proof that a solid everyday laptop with a touchscreen isn’t just a novelty. Students, creatives, and everyday users who just can’t deal with a trackpad will love how easy the touchscreen makes using this laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4672/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid Foundation</h2>
<p>The guts of this HP touchscreen laptop are right at that sweet spot between “more than you’ll ever need or use” and “so puny that I can’t do anything without lagging.” The Intel Celeron N4500 processor (up to 2.8GHz burst frequency) and Intel UHD graphics chip won’t win in a footrace against premium laptops, but they won’t slow you down at all when you get deep into your daily multitasking. They’re backed by 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, so there’s plenty of room for your files, projects, and apps.</p>
<p>Then there’s the touchscreen and all of the possibilities it presents. Pair it with an inexpensive stylus — there are literally dozens of them at Amazon — and you can annotate presentation slides or other documents, or even jot down quick notes or sketches for yourself on the fly. The touchscreen also lets you tap, scroll, and pinch to zoom in like a tablet. Soon you’ll be swiping through pages and menus and browser tabs faster than you ever could with a trackpad or mouse.</p>



<h2>Office 365 Included</h2>
<p>This deal comes with one year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal, which includes all of the premium Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, and also cloud storage and the security of Microsoft Defender. The HP True Vision 720p HD webcam with dual-array mics and HD Audio speakers make this touchscreen laptop a natural for Zoom meetings and other video calls, and two SuperSpeed USB-A ports, an HDMI 1.4b port, and a SD card reader are great expansion options.</p>
<p>We’d be pulling your leg if we told you this was a solid $2,999 laptop. But while it falls short of that impossibly high mark, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Touchscreen-Processor-14-Bluetooth/dp/B0FMJJH35F/?tag=kotaku01-20">it most definitely overdelivers on the new $390 price tag it’s rocking right now during this post-Prime Day 87%-off deal at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>Devs behind the sci-fi MMO Phil Spencer liked but canceled anyway form a new studio. More turnover at Halo Studios ahead of its big reveal for the future of the franchise. Would pricing <em>GTA 6</em> at $100 actually be a disaster for Rockstar Games? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I’m doing my best to avoid the <a href="https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1976104048010068331">dog collar conspiracy discourse</a> currently consuming the streaming world and pondering the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-earth-romulan-war-explained-2000669117">deeply mysterious Earth-Romulan war instead</a>. It’s also the <a href="https://www.thepopverse.com/the-full-schedule-for-nycc-2025-day-0-retailer-day-for-all-comics-pros">first day of NYCC 2025</a>. It’s full of toys I don’t need but <a href="https://x.com/VGArtAndTidbits/status/1976295355093340346">desperately want</a>.</p>  <p>Glenn Israel has been an artist working on<em> Halo</em> since he was at Bungie back in 2008. After more than a decade with the franchise, including time serving as a senior concept artist on <em>Halo Infinite</em>, he’s suddenly leaving the studio under mysterious circumstances. The news comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmqrY8ng2GI">amid fresh rumors of growing pains</a> at the studio getting ready to reveal the future of <em>Halo</em> at the 2025 World Championships <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384">later this month</a>.</p>

 <p>“As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe,” Israel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">wrote on LinkedIn</a> last week. “There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year. In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are *free to choose*. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values – and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Simpsons</em> are seemingly on their way to <em>Fornite&nbsp;</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE SIMPSONS GLIDER LEAKED <a href="https://t.co/UfWGDw1vrZ">pic.twitter.com/UfWGDw1vrZ</a></p> <p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A new datamine leak shows the Kang and Kodos alien ship as a glider. It seems like good timing with the battle royale’s Halloween celebrations rolling out. <em>The Simpsons</em>‘ 37th Treehouse of Horror special is scheduled to air on October 19, 2025.</p>

 <h2>Laid-off devs behind Microsoft’s cancelled sci-fi MMO launch a new studio</h2> <p>The studio’s made of developers who had been working at ZeniMax Online Studios on Project Blackbird and it’s called, fittingly enough, <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">Sackbird Studios</a>. It’s employee-owned and self-funded. “With internal funding and full creative control, the studio is focused on crafting bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises,” a post on the company website reads.</p>

 <p>“We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people,” said Lee Ridout, Sackbird Studios’ CEO. “When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.”</p>

 <h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> gets a new secret ending in a free update</h2>  <p>It drops October 10 and unlocks after players finish the just-added new game plus mode.</p> <h2><em>MTG</em> head designer pushes back against Universes Beyond “slop” accusations</h2> <p>A pro player’s rant went viral last week as he railed against what he saw as the dilution of<em> Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s identity. “There’s always a line in the sand where people say ‘this is <em>Magic</em>‘ or ‘this is not<em> Magic</em>,’ but everybody’s line is different,” head designer Mark Rosewater said earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minds-behind-magic-the-gathering-say-theyre-making-it-for-anyone-not-everyone/1100-6535324/">proactively responding to criticisms at MagicCon 2025 in Atlanta</a>. “I know your line seems like the line, because it’s so clear of a line to you, but your line is just not everybody’s line. And as the guy who has to make the game, I have to respect everybody’s line.”</p> <p>Rosewater also dunked on <em>MT</em>G’s most popular format to prove his point. “I’m not a Commander fan,” he said. “To me, <em>Magic</em> is a strategic game. I love it because I win when I’m outthinking my opponent. Commander is not a strategic game. It is a political game; you’re playing the people.”</p>

 <h2>Vaporwave love letter <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-story-tribeca-demo-devolver-digital-tony-hawk-1851541108"><em>Skate Story</em></a> finally gets a release date</h2>  <p>It’s coming December 8 to PS5, Switch 2, and PC. No Switch 1 or Xbox versions.</p> <h2>A new report warns against pricing <em>GTA 6</em> at $100</h2> <p>Despite speculation that Rockstar Games’ upcoming sequel could be the first game to break the $100 barrier, a MIDiA Research study claims that less than half of players interested in <em>GTA 6</em> would buy it at that price point.</p> <p>“Our research shows that 59 percent of consumers have some interest in purchasing<em> GTA 6</em>, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game,” analyst Brandon Sutton <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table">told <em>IGN</em></a>. “This notoriety also makes <em>GTA 6</em> the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.”</p> <p>One response to these findings might be: why not try every price for the game? The increasing popularity of Deluxe Editions shows that you can milk super-fans for all they’re worth and still sell the base version to everyone else.

              <p>Prime Big Deal Days may be over, but some of the best discounts are still alive on Amazon from brands like Samsung, SanDisk, Dyson, and, yes, even Amazon itself. Pretty much every Amazon-branded product is seeing a discount during the event and that includes the smart home hub, the Echo Dot. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">This 2022 smart speaker is still priced at just $35, the same as it was during Prime Day.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Vibrant Sound</h2>
<p>The Echo Dot is the standard Echo’s little brother. Even though its smaller, the smart speaker is still capable of producing powerful sound with a rich and deep bass with its 1.73-inch front-firing speaker You can listen to your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts with clear vocals and dialogue, even when you are rooms away.</p>
<p>Since the Echo Dot is a smart home hub, you can take control of all the other smart products in your home using just your voice. If you have smart RGB bulbs installed in you lamps, you can ask Alexa to dim them, or adjust to a spooky orange and purple glow for a Halloween party. With as smart thermostat, you can ask it to turn down the temperature when it’s starting to feel a bit warm. And you can do it from the comfort of your couch with your phone still in your pocket.</p>



<p>Echo Dots can answer questions, keep your schedule, or set timers when cooking or running laundry. I frequently find myself asking what the weather is like in the morning when getting ready as I will constantly forget where I set my phone down as I dart between the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. If you have more than one Echo device ( or just the Alexa app installed on your phones) you can connect with friends or family from different rooms of the house. Start a call from the Echo Dot in your kitchen to the Echo Dot in your basement to let the kids know dinner’s ready and it’s time to pause the game. It’s the new age version of connecting two cups together with a long string.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">The Echo Dot from Amazon is available in three different colors. Each happen to be on sale for $15 off.</a> Choose between either charcoal, glacier white, or deep sea blue, all of which are just $35 during the post-Prime Big Deals Day at Amazon.</p>
