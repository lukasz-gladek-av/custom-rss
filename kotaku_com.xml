              <p data-start="0" data-end="518">If the holidays came and went without the new gaming console you were hoping to unwrap, Amazon is offering a solid second chance to treat yourself. Right now, you can pick up the Xbox Series X and finally experience Microsoft’s most powerful console in stunning 4K. The standard retail price for the Xbox Series X has recently settled at $650, but for a limited time, Amazon is discounting it by 8%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">That price drop knocks $50 off the total, bringing the console down to $600—a meaningful savings given today’s market.</a></p>
<p data-start="520" data-end="1351">Okay, let’s pause for a moment to get a lesson on Xbox Series X’s unusual pricing history. When Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X alongside the Series S back in 2020, the flagship console carried a $500 price tag. That price held steady for years, which is typical for console generations. However, in May 2025, Microsoft announced a price increase, bumping the Series X up by $100 to $600. Just a few months later, the company raised the price again, pushing it to $650. This makes the current generation one of the rare cases where console prices have increased rather than dropped over time. With that context in mind, Amazon’s current deal effectively brings the Series X back to its 2025 spring and summer pricing.</p>

<h2 data-start="1353" data-end="1819">Xbox Series X vs. Xbox Series S</h2>
<p data-start="1353" data-end="1819">When comparing the Xbox Series X to its more budget-friendly sibling, the Xbox Series S, the reasons for the price difference become clear. One of the biggest advantages of the Series X is its ability to run games in native 4K resolution. While both consoles support high refresh rates of up to 120 frames per second and HDR visuals, the Series X is built for players who want the sharpest image quality possible on modern displays.</p>
<p data-start="1821" data-end="2145">Another major distinction is the inclusion of a disc drive on the Series X. This is a big deal for players who prefer owning physical copies of their games or who already have a collection of discs. Beyond gaming, the console can also double as a Blu-ray player, making it a useful addition to your home entertainment setup.</p>


<p data-start="2147" data-end="2690">Both the Xbox Series X and Series S rely on Microsoft’s Xbox Velocity Architecture, which is responsible for the fast load times that define this console generation. This technology also powers Quick Resume, a feature that lets you suspend and switch between multiple games. Instead of closing out a game and rebooting it to the start screen later, Quick Resume saves your exact progress and returns you to the same spot when you jump back in. It’s especially convenient if you like to bounce between different games without worrying about finding a save point every time.</p>
<p data-start="2692" data-end="2971">The Xbox Series X also functions as a complete media hub. You can download popular streaming apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, and Dropout, and enjoy supported content in full 4K with HDR.</p>
<p data-start="2973" data-end="3476" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">To get the most out of the Xbox ecosystem, Game Pass Ultimate is well worth considering. The subscription includes online multiplayer through Xbox Live and access to a massive library of games you can download and play at any time. It’s often compared to Netflix, but for video games. One standout title in the Game Pass catalog is the critically acclaimed <em data-start="3330" data-end="3359">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. With numerous awards and glowing reviews, it’s a great example of the value Game Pass offers right out of the gate. You can hit the ground running with one of the best titles to come out last year.</p>
