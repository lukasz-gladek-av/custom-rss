              <p>Need an additional Xbox controller? It’s always a good idea to have an extra in case you want to play with a friend or have one on reserve if you run out of battery. We’ve found one that you can grab right now for a great price, this close to the holidays.</p>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller is built for players who want more control, comfort, and customization from their gaming sessions. It feels great in your hands, with textured grips and a balanced design that helps you stay comfortable even during long play sessions. No matter what kind of games you like to play, you’ll find this model comfortable and easy to get used to.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hardcore Xbox controller that’ll soon become your main</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">You can get the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller right now for just $110, down from its usual price of $150.</a> That is a discount of $40 and 27% off. This is a top of the line controller for the Xbox, so you’re getting a pretty decent price here, considering you’ll usually pay nearly $50 more.</p>
<p>Right out of the box the Elite Series 2 Core feels like an upgrade from a standard controller. The thumbsticks are responsive, the buttons click with just the right amount of feedback, and the overall feel is one of quality. It connects wirelessly to your Xbox or Windows PC, so you can enjoy gaming without cords getting in your way. The Bluetooth support also means you can pair it with other compatible devices for more flexibility.</p>



<p>One of the biggest benefits of this controller is how customizable it is. You can change stick sensitivity, remap buttons, and fine tune settings to match your personal play style. Normally, core Xbox controllers aren’t so easy or versatile when it comes to personalization, so you get a lot more options here to work with. That’s especially useful if you like to change things for shooters or even fighting games to better fit the way you play.</p>
<p>The Elite Series 2 Core also includes additional components you can swap in and out. Different thumbsticks and paddle options let you tweak the feel and response of the controller, so you can tailor it to different genres.</p>
<p>With a solid mix of premium build quality, customization options, and wireless convenience, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller stands out among controllers in its class. For this price, you should go ahead and snatch one up before they raise in price again. Everything gaming-related seems to be getting a price hike, after all.</p>

              <p>Happy holidays and Merry Christmas. This is the time of the year when radio stations start playing holiday-themed music nonstop and commercials are filled with festive tunes. But not all Christmas music is good. In fact, I’d say at least 80 percent of holiday jingles are old, boring, and terrible.</p> <p>However, I won’t toss all Christmas music under the bus; some holiday tunes have a way of making you feel the warmth and merriment of the season. With that in mind, here are the 15 best tracks to play this year if you want to get into the festive spirit but don’t want to listen to boring old crap. Christmastime is a fun time of year, when people should be feeling good and enjoying time off and the company of loved ones. Or at least getting cool presents. Why ruin that with some slow, sad song from the 1930s?</p>

 <p>So here are some good, fun tracks that range from newer hits to oldies that won’t make you fall asleep. And if you work in retail, I am so sorry that you have to spend, like, five weeks listening to all of these and more over and over again, and you all deserve huge bonuses for that torture.</p> <p>Oh and let us know what your favorite Christmas songs are in the comments below. I’ll be waiting for someone to share <em>Grandma Got Ran Over by a Reindeer.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Father Christmas – The Kinks</h2>  <h2>Santa Claus Is Comin’ To Town – Bruce Springsteen</h2>  <h2>Linus And Lucy – Vince Guaraldi</h2>  <h2>Last Christmas – Wham!</h2>  <h2>Run, Rudolph, Run! – Chuck Berry</h2>  <h2>Feliz Navidad – José Feliciano</h2>  <h2>All I Want For Christmas Is You – Mariah Carey</h2>  <h2>Christmas Wrapping – The Waitresses</h2>  <h2>Christmas (Baby Please Come Home!) – Darlene Love</h2>  <h2>You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&nbsp;– Thurl Ravenscroft</h2>  <h2>Holly Jolly Christmas – Burl Ives</h2>  <h2>Santa Baby – Eartha Kitt</h2>  <h2>Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree – Brenda Lee</h2>  <h2>Underneath The Tree – Kelly Clarkson</h2>  <h2>I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus – The Jackson 5</h2>

              <p>Some gaming monitors get touted as being “ultra-wide” but this one really earns that namesake. The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor stretches an intimidating 57″ across. If you’re in the market for a monitor that is just one step shy of spanning 360 degrees around you’re head while you play, well, this might be exactly what you’re looking for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">Amazon has the Samsung monitor listed right now for a staggering $850 off. That brings it to $1,450—about 37% off its original price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="826">Performance That Extends Beyond Your Field of View</h2>
<p data-start="828" data-end="1339">Samsung proudly markets the Odyssey Neo G9 as the world’s first dual UHD gaming monitor. The screen is essentially the equivalent of two 32-inch 4K displays fused side by side, creating an ultra-wide canvas that delivers incredible clarity across an almost unfathomably wide viewing area. Thanks to Quantum Mini-LED technology paired with HDR 1000 support, the monitor reaches stunning levels of brightness, contrast, and color accuracy that make games and visuals feel strikingly lifelike.</p>
<p data-start="1341" data-end="1683">Speed is just as impressive as image quality. With an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate and full support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, the Odyssey Neo G9 minimizes screen tearing, stuttering, and frame drops. As long as your gaming PC has the horsepower to keep up, you can expect fluid motion and responsive gameplay across the entire display.</p>
<p data-start="1685" data-end="2071">The screen’s aggressive 1000R curvature is designed to match the natural curvature of the human eye, making the monitor feel as though it’s wrapping around you. When positioned at the proper viewing distance, the display stretches from the far edges of your left peripheral vision all the way across to the right, creating an incredibly immersive experience that few monitors can rival.</p>


<p data-start="2073" data-end="2353">For connectivity, Samsung includes the latest DisplayPort 2.1, ensuring access to the some of the highest bandwidth and best performance available today. The monitor also supports HDMI 2.1 and features a USB-C hub, giving you plenty of options for connecting PCs, consoles, and other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2355" data-end="2742">Because of its immense width, the Odyssey Neo G9 excels at multitasking. Picture-by-picture mode allows you to display content from two different input sources simultaneously at their native resolutions. Samsung’s Auto Source Switch+ further can automatically detect newly powered-on devices and switching to the correct input without requiring any manual adjustments.</p>
<p data-start="2744" data-end="3034">On the back of the monitor, CoreSync and Core Lighting+ add some extra flair by matching ambient RGB lighting to the colors displayed on screen. If the ultra-wide monitor doesn’t capture you’re entire vision, the area around it will be illuminated to feel as though the screen extends even further than the absurd lengths it already does.</p>
<p data-start="3036" data-end="3400" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The monitor sits on a highly flexible, ergonomic stand that supports swivel, tilt, and height adjustments. It’s easy to dial in the perfect viewing position for any desk or user.</p>

<h2>One of Nintendo’s best portable gaming consoles</h2>
<p>One of the first things people notice about the OLED model is the display.

This can make games feel more immersive and enjoyable, from exploring open worlds to playing puzzle games with friends.</p>
<p>Even though this unit is renewed, it still gives you the full Nintendo Switch experience. You can dock it to play on a TV just like a brand new model, or you can use it in handheld mode when you want gaming freedom without being tied to a screen in your living room. The joy con controllers are easy to detach for multiplayer games at a party or a family game night. You can also use the touch screen for compatible titles, which adds another layer of interaction.</p>



<p>The renewed model goes through inspection to make sure it works properly, which means you get the same game library and capabilities without paying full retail price. There may be a few cosmetic imperfections, but you’ll mostly be getting a blemish-free unit that’s been guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>With a huge library of games from all kinds of genres, the Switch is great for kids, teens, and adults who like variety in their play. From racing to role playing to fitness and rhythm games, there is stuff here for nearly everyone. It has become a go to portable console because it stays fun and fresh with new titles releasing regularly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6170/">For just $308, down from $385, the Nintendo Switch OLED Model w/ Joy-Con (Renewed) gives you plenty of value with a ton of ways to play.</a> Whether you’re giving it as a gift or keeping it for yourself, it’s a good idea to go ahead and lock yours in.</p>
