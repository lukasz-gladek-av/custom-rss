If approved, the acquisition would be one of the most expensive in the history of the video game industry and would make Electronic Arts a privately held company. Given the questionable ownership, the internet is not taking the news well.</span></p> <p><span>The Saudi Arabian government‚Äôs attempts at sportswashing away the stink of its dire human rights laws, as evidenced by its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367"><span>investments in various facets of the video game industry</span></a><span>, are well-documented at this point. Its money runs so deep that it has investments and ownerships in things like fighting game tournament EVO, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189"><span>Esports World Cup</span></a><span>, and even </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-scopely-niantic-saudi-arabia-monster-hunter-1851769360"><i><span>Pok√©mon Go</span></i></a><span>.

Beyond that, the Saudi Arabian government has been hosting events with industry figureheads like Hideo Kojima.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We may not be getting a handheld Xbox anytime soon, but this will be the next closest thing. Asus has partnered with Microsoft to create an update to the ROG Ally with official-branding for Xbox. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally enters the market as a new competitor to the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch 2 to be your go-to gaming handheld. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/">It‚Äôs set to arrive on October 16 and the pre-order window has just opened up.</a> Head on over to Amazon and reserve yours today for $600.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs talk about the core improvements on this model over the existing Asus ROG Ally. This new model is now powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and puts to use an all-new streamlined Windows OS. Both will lead to a smoother user experience both in and out of your games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Your Gaming Library, Anywhere</h2>
<p>Access your full library of PC games and boot up directly into the new Xbox App UI. Stream Xbox games from either your console or from Microsoft‚Äôs cloud streaming service. The Xbox Game bar can be accessed quickly via the Xbox button on the left side of the handheld. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally also has support for Steam, Epic Games Store and other game stores so you won‚Äôt just be locked into the Xbox architecture.</p>
<p>The gaming handheld comes with 16GB of dual channel RAM along with a 512GB PCle Gen4 M.2 2280 SSD. Storage is upgradable if you wish to download more games than the default capacity allows.</p>



<p>The screen measures in at seven inches across, same as the Steam Deck, and weighs just under 1.5 lbs. ‚Äî almost exactly the same as the Steam Deck on that front too. The display is capable of 1080p HD along with a refresh rate of 120Hz. The redesigned chassis is pulls inspiration from the model Xbox wireless core controllers, employing new contoured grips for better comfort gaming all day long. Choose to play either handheld or hooked up to your TV via the dual USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally has a 60Wh battery to your game time running long and can recharge fairly quickly. Just have it plugged in for a half hour will get it back up from zero to 50% battery life.</p>
<p>Alongside this model is the upgraded Asus ROG Xbox Ally X which features a more powerful processor, more RAM and a full 1TB SSD, doubling the base model‚Äôs storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/">Unfortunately, most storefronts appear to be sold out on the X model, but you can still pre-order the Asus ROG Xbox Ally for $600 over at Amazon.</a></p>

              <p>Lots of awesome movies that hit theaters over the summer have finally released to streaming. So if you missed them on the big screen, now‚Äôs your chance to see them on the small-to-medium screen. James Gunn‚Äôs take on<em> Superman&nbsp;</em>starring David Corenswet as the titular super-powered man arrived on HBO Max. There you can also check out Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd‚Äôs painfully awkward, intense, and hilarious <em>Friendship</em>. And Zach Cregger‚Äôs invigorating horror flick <em>Weapons&nbsp;</em>can now be rented from most places that offer digital on-demand. But in order to watch any of these, you‚Äôre gonna need something to stream to ‚Äîsomething like Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV Stick. Right now, you can get one for dirt cheap. These things normally aren‚Äôt too pricey to begin with, starting at $35. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">For a limited time, however, you can snag one for about half price at just $18.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Amazon has upgraded its line of Fire TV Sticks over the years and this is the latest model, albeit, the first in the lineup. It doesn‚Äôt support 4K, and it‚Äôs still stuck back on Wi-Fi 5. While it does only stream in Full HD 1080p, most streaming service charge extra for 4K streaming to a point where they‚Äôre not even worth it. Netflix‚Äôs premium plan is now up to $25 per month. That‚Äôs more than you‚Äôre paying for the Amazon Fire TV Stick and that‚Äôs just for a single month. You‚Äôll likely be streaming most content in regular HD anyway, so in practice, you may not even notice the difference between getting this one or shelling out for the Fire TV Stick 4K.</p>



<h2>Xbox Games Right to Your TV</h2>
<p>One big bonus of the Fire TV Stick is it now supports Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You no longer need an Xbox console to play Xbox games. Stream games from the cloud like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth Wukong</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, or even the newly released <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The first two are just part of Game Pass, but the latter does require you to purchase a copy.</p>
<p>If you are intrigued by the prospect of playing Xbox titles directly off the Fire TV Stick, you can consider picking up the unit bundled with a Luna Controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4360/">That normally goes for $105, but has also been marked down halfway to just $53</a>. You can also choose to pair a different Bluetooth controller such as the official Xbox core wireless controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">Otherwise, just go with the standard Fire TV Stick HD, now only $18.</a></p>
