              <p>Another month means another batch of <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-gaming-free-pc-steam-games-january-2025-1851736481">“free” Amazon Prime games.</a> This time around, Amazon is giving away what I (and many others) consider to be one of the best PC games ever made: <em>Civilization 4.</em> Beyond that, you can currently grab the also-excellent<em> Into The Breach</em> for nothing and over the next week weeks, even more games will be available for Amazon Prime subscribers.</p> <p><a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">If you hop over to Amazon Prime Gaming</a> and are currently subscribed to Amazon Prime, you can snag PC copies of <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 4: The Complete Edition,</em> <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ravenloft Series</em>, and<em> Into the Breach.</em> Then, throughout the rest of September, Amazon will add more free games, including <em>Spelljammer, Pixel Cafe, and Tower of Time.</em> Even better, <em>Civ4</em>, <em>Spelljammer</em>, and other PC games given away this month are delivered via GOG codes, which means once you claim them, you own them completely with no DRM. Now ain’t that nifty!</p> <p>I personally think that <em>Civilization 4</em> is the pinnacle of the series, <a href="https://kotaku.com/let-s-rank-the-civilization-games-worst-to-best-1842571299/6">even if former <em>Kotaku</em> writer Luke Plunkett prefers <em>Civ5</em> over it</a>. Yeah, some bits of it are a little tedious and annoying, but the vibes are immaculate, and most of it still holds up perfectly today. Plus, it will run easily on any modern PC. If you were let down by <em>Civ6</em> or <em>Civ7</em>, check out <em>Civilization 4</em>. Just set aside like 9 hours of your day first, as it will consume them in a flash.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games, as well as when they will be available for free on Amazon Prime and which storefronts they use. Oh, and keep in mind these are all PC games; sorry, console-only players.</p> <h3>Now available</h3> <ul> <li>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ravenloft Series (GOG Code)</li> <li>Into The Breach (Epic Games Store)</li> <li>Sid Meier’s Civilization 4: The Complete Edition (GOG Code)</li> </ul> <h3>September 11</h3> <ul> <li>Afterimage (Amazon Games App)</li> <li>Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace (GOG Code)</li> <li>Tower of Time (GOG Code)</li> <li>Subterrain: Mines of Titan [(Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <h3>September 18</h3> <ul> <li>Residual (GOG Code)</li> <li>Fate: The Cursed King (GOG Code)</li> </ul> <h3>September 25</h3> <ul> <li>Mystical Riddles: Ghostly Park Collector’s Edition (Legacy Games Code)</li> <li>Pixel Cafe (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p>Also, some games added in previous months are still floating around on Amazon Prime Gaming’s site, so if you haven’t grabbed those freebies yet and you’re a Prime subscriber, you should check out everything on the site. You may find a few hidden gems still waiting to be played.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Many, many RPG fans are patiently awaiting the <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720">next installment in the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> franchise</a>. And a lot of those people are waiting for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>‘s third and final installment, too. As you might expect, some are worried about how development is proceeding on these two massive Square Enix RPGs, and to help calm those players down, <em>FF7</em> and <em>KH4</em> director Tetsuya Nomura has attempted to reassure us all that things are going “smoothly.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-three-and-kingdom-hearts-iv-development-progressing-smoothly-tetsuya-nomura-confirms">As reported by <em>Gematsu</em></a>, during Friday’s <em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis </em>2nd Anniversary broadcast, Nomura hopped in toward the end after seemingly spotting comments in the chat asking about <em>FF7 Remake’s</em> third installment. While he didn’t have a release date to share, he wanted everyone to relax. The game is on schedule, okay?</p>  <div data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="C099JF8RR7T-1757093613.501129-thread-list-Thread_1757093654.334059" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1757093654.334059"> <div dir="auto"> <p>“Right, so, looking at the comments, I’m seeing people ask every so often about the third entry in the [<i data-stringify-type="italic">FF7</i>]&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Remake</i> series,” said Nomura. “Apparently, [<em>FF7</em> co-director Motomu] Toriyama mentioned in an interview that something might be released around the second anniversary [of <i data-stringify-type="italic">Ever Crisis</i>]. So that’s probably where those expectations are coming from. Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can’t really say more—if I suddenly went, ‘Well, actually…,’ everyone would be really surprised!”</p> </div>  <div dir="auto"> <p>He then added: “So yeah, things are moving along really smoothly, and the release timing has already been decided. We’re moving forward according to that schedule right now, so please rest assured and be patient.”</p> </div> </div>  <p>And don’t worry, fans of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, Nomura also had a small update about the Disney RPG, which was first announced back in 2022.</p>  <p>“And this has also come up in the comments here and there, but <i data-stringify-type="italic">Kingdom Hearts IV</i>&nbsp;is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.”</p>  <p>While this is good to hear, I imagine a lot of folks want a release window for one or both of these RPGs. <em>FF7 Remake’</em>s third entry will be its last, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-ff7-vii-remake-trilogy-rebirth-square-eni-1849074004">as confirmed by Square Enix in 2022</a>. We still don’t know when it’s coming, what it will be named, and what platforms it will launch on, though I expect PS5 players will be able to play it day one. Meanwhile, we’ve heard very little about <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, though we did get <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809">a new, very low-res screenshot earlier this year of Mickey Mouse in a library.</a> Hopefully, that and Nomura’s assurance that everything is progressing as planned will be enough for folks until the next update.</p>
