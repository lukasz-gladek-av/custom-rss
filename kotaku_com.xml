            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Once Superman, always Superman.</p><p>For a generation of kids too young to catch Christopher Reeve’s Superman run in the ’80s, ABC’s <em>Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</em> served as their introduction to the invincible titan. That means Dean Cain was many people’s first exposure to a live-action Superman—and he’s not too happy with James Gunn’s recent comments about the hero being an immigrant.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Gunn recently told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Sunday Times</em></a></span> that Superman’s story reflects the American experience, saying the son of Krypton is “an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country.” Well, that got Cain’s retired red trunks in a bunch. In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/09/superman-dean-cain-immigrant-controversy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/09/superman-dean-cain-immigrant-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video interview with <em>TMZ</em></a></span>, Cain didn’t hold back his criticism, claiming that labeling the hero an immigrant will prove to be a misstep.</p><p>“I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it’s an immigrant thing, and I think it’s going to hurt the numbers on the movie. I was excited for the film. I am excited to see what it is… I’m rooting for it to be a success, but I don’t like that last political comment.”</p><p>Here’s Cain’s issue: he’s tired of Disney and Hollywood retrofitting legacy characters like Superman and Snow White with modern ideologies that, in his view, align with current political trends but strip those characters of their original, innocent essence. Put simply, he’s tired of his favorite characters becoming—wait for it—“woke.”</p><p>To Cain, Superman has always stood for “truth, justice, and the American way,” but only the American way of decades past—not the modern one, which he suggests is compromised by too much immigration.</p><p>“You can’t come in saying, ‘I want to get rid of all the rules in America because I want it to be more like Somalia.’ Well, that doesn’t work, because you had to leave Somalia to come here…There have to be limits, because we can’t have everybody in the United States. We can’t have everybody—society will fail. So there have to be limits.”</p><p>But Cain seems to be ignoring a few key facts. First, Superman is <em>literally</em> an alien, and U.S. immigration law considers anyone who isn’t a citizen or national of the United States an “alien.” In fact, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has an entire section dedicated to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alien Registration Requirements</a></span>.</p><p>Secondly, <em>Smallville</em> had an entire episode in which Clark Kent (Tom Welling) confronts his mother about her hypocritical stance—wanting to report an undocumented immigrant to authorities but not doing the same when Clark crash-landed on their farm. To leave nothing open to interpretation, Clark explicitly says, “I’m an illegal immigrant, Mom.”</p><p>At the end of the day, no matter how beloved a character may be, their identity is at the discretion of whoever owns their copyright. If one day Kevin Feige decides Iron Man should be a priest, or Thor an Indian bus driver, or Doctor Doom a pediatrician, then that’s what they’ll be.</p><p>To rephrase what Jay-Z once said: If you want old Superman, watch old Superman movies.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-movie-james-gunn-dean-cain-immigrant-1851786076]]></content:encoded>

But a fresh delay of one of the most wish-listed games on Steam makes that almost impossible. Publisher Krafton, which changed the release schedule against the objections of the studio’s founders, now denies that it did so to avoid paying the bonuses while also blaming them for the highly anticipated underwater survival sim missing its original target release date. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196299,195922" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>  “This decision was based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players,” the South Korea-based company which also owns<em> PUBG </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> in a statement responding to<em> Bloomberg</em>’s report. “It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations. Additionally, the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds cofounders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill were fired last week, despite Krafton promising the studio independence when it was purchased back in 2022. Cleveland later wrote on Reddit that the game was ready to release in Early Access later this year as originally planned, calling the move from Krafton to replace the studio’s leadership a “shock.”</p><p>The publisher now says that the decision to delay <em>Subnautica 2 </em>grew out of negative feedback from playtests. “We received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game’s direction,” it wrote in its new statement. “At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release. As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience.”</p><p>Krafton was less diplomatic in a new statement published on its website Thursday afternoon which accused Cleveland and McGuire of refusing to return to their leadership roles on <em>Subnautica 2 </em>after the studio’s fantasy skirmish PVP game <em>Moonbreaker </em>struggled to find an audience last year. The publisher blamed them for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s failure to release in 2024 as originally planned:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</p><p>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them.<em> Subnautica 2</em> was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of <em>Moonbreaker</em>, Krafton  asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</p><p>Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.<br>The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.<br></p><p>We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>The statement also said Krafton was “committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s development,” though a spokesperson for the company didn’t immediately clarify what those bonuses would look like relative to the $250 million payout previously on the table (the publisher said only 10 percent of the payout was originally for developers on the studio floor).</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A developer update posted on YouTube</a></span> confirmed<em> Subnautica 2 </em>would be coming to Early Access in 2025 back in April.
