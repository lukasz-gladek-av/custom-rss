              <p><span>Earlier this month, Wildlight Entertainment invited a whole host of media and content creators to take a hands-on look at <em>Highguard</em>–a 3v3 “raid shooter” whose big reveal was the closer to last month’s Game Awards. Reaction to that trailer was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088"><span>decidedly mixed</span></a><span>. This article isn’t about my thoughts on the game itself, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">you can find here</a>, but rather what it felt like to attend an event for a game which was already being treated by some online as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>gaming’s next </span><i><span>Concord</span></i></a><span>. What’s it like to be one of the first people outside of the studio to play something that so many had already written off despite not really knowing what it was even trying to be?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137"><span>The </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i></a><span> Launch Event, as my lanyard calls it, was an all-day affair held in Los Angeles that was scheduled to run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Making the trek from Long Beach, I boarded my Lyft (paid for by Wildlight) at about 7:45 in the morning, and despite my best efforts at being punctual, didn’t arrive at the venue until about 9:15. Being stuck in a sea of cars on the I-110 gave me a lot of time to think about what the day ahead had in store.</span></p>

 <p><span>While players experiencing the game for the first time today will have an entirely different experience, myself and the other folks who experienced the game that day only had the TGAs trailer to base our expectations on, and it hardly told us anything about the game at all. None of us knew what a “PvP raid shooter” was, nor did we know anything about the moment-to-moment gameplay beyond a short description on the Steam store page: “From the creators of</span><i><span> Apex Legends</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>&nbsp;comes </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.”&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>9:16 AM – January 21 – NYA West, A Hazy Recollection, And Coffee #2 (and #3)</h2> <p><span>The first thing I noticed upon arriving was a faint feeling of deja vu. I’d been to this venue before, I thought. It took me a few moments to realize that I’d been in this same part of town for EA’s own preview event for </span><i><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></i><span> back in 2023; I wondered if the members of Wildlight in charge of picking the place had still been at Respawn back then. After checking in at reception, I walked into a lobby filled with fellow members of the press from all over the world. I grabbed my second coffee of the day, some yogurt, and an apple Danish from an assortment laid out in front of me; besides the coffee I’d grabbed earlier that morning I hadn’t yet had any breakfast, and the longer-than-expected commute had me starving.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663168"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663168">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Conversing with other members of the press, I confirmed what I’d already assumed; none of us quite knew what we were about to play. Despite this, there was a quiet hope that perhaps the trailer was a misstep, and that the game itself might impress. I spoke with </span><i><span>GameSpot</span></i><span>‘s Jordan Ramée and another L.A. native freelancer friend of mine, Luis Joshua Gutierrez, among a few others, as I scarfed down my food and coffee.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Out of the corner of my eye I noticed Geoff Keighley. The Game Awards host was the only person outside of the development team who might be able to answer our questions as to what exactly </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> is, as he’d played it the previous summer before asking the team to let him put it in his December showcase. Had he selected a surprise hit, or attached his brand to another live-service dud?. I downed Coffee #3.</span></p> <h2>9:52 AM – So, What On Earth Is A “PvP Raid Shooter,” Anyway?</h2> <p><span>The event running slightly ahead of schedule, we were shepherded into an auditorium. Once everyone had been seated, we got the whole spiel–who Wildlight are, how <em>Highguard</em> came to be, and what being a “raid shooter” actually entails. Roughly 4 years ago, when Wildlight was only about 5 members big, the team spent some time playing shooters all day in search of inspiration. As the team put it, “we were trying to figure out what the question was that we wanted our game to answer.” Inspiration itself came from the experience of riding to and raiding bases in </span><i><span>Rust</span></i><span>; the team wanted to figure out a way to distill those experiences into something repeatable, without all the busy prep work that survival crafting games require.</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, everyone wanted to know why the team had opted for radio silence since the game’s reveal; the answer to that was twofold. We were given one half of the answer there and then, with the other coming just a bit later in the day. Originally the team had intended to shadowdrop the game, much as they had done with </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> when they had still worked at Respawn. As it so happened, the Game Awards trailer only came to fruition at the eleventh hour after Geoff Keighley had offered up the spot upon being impressed by the game during his personal demo earlier in the year.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663167"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663167">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In hindsight, given how complicated the game’s systems are to explain and the TGAs’ strict runtime, it’s little surprise the trailer struggled to land. The radio silence, then, was equal parts a return to the original plan as well as an acknowledgement that the game would perhaps best speak for itself. Still, rather than being tossed in entirely blind and letting the game make its own impression, press and influencers had to watch a thorough overview of the shooter’s mechanics and systems before getting our hands on the controllers and keyboards laid out for us.</span></p> <p><span>Entering the auditorium, I saw the venue was split in two halves. On the right were groups of PCs, 6 a piece, paired with some very expensive Dell 4K OLED monitors. While by default players could play with mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse, Wildlight quickly noted that anyone who wished to play with a controller could request either a PlayStation 5 Dualsense or an Xbox Wireless Controller, and they would bring one right over. On the opposite wall was a collection of 3D models of in-game assets, heaps of concept art showcasing the game’s world and its characters, and more.</span></p>

 <h2>11:30 AM – Probing the Vibes</h2> <p><span>With lunch scheduled for noon, I only had time for a handful of matches. </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>‘s Travis Northup had his first interview with the team scheduled early, leaving myself and the other member of our impromptu group–</span><i><span>GameSpot</span></i><span>‘s Jordan Ramée–to wander over to the art that caught our eye. I wondered how the artists that had drawn these felt about the reception to the game’s reveal.</span></p> <p><span>It occurred to me at this point that the event took up a great deal of space, especially when considering the modest number of press in attendance. There were a couple dozen of us, by no means a small amount, yet the venue was so large that it bordered on feeling empty. I wondered if the team had expected or planned for a larger audience when they’d booked the location; there was certainly room for double, maybe even triple the number of attendees. Maybe the crowd during the influencer session, held a day earlier, had been a lot bigger. I grabbed Coffee #4 from a concessions table while waiting for the lunch spread to be set up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663169">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After gorging myself on sandwiches, wraps, an energy bar and at least one more cup of coffee I played a few more rounds of the game before heading off to a set of interviews with some of the game’s core designers, as well as the studio’s cofounders. As the day progressed, it was fascinating watching folks slowly come to grips with some of the intricacies of the gameplay loop. You can read my <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">hands-on impressions here,</a> or decide for yourself now that the full game is live.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>5:12 PM – Winding Down, and Cacio e Pepe Pizza</h2> <p><span>The event was set to go until 6PM, but with the memories of my agonizingly long ride to the event I had no intentions of grabbing my Lyft home right in the middle of L.A.’s notorious rush hour traffic. There were no plans for an afterparty, though we had been given per diem cards to help pay for food and other amenities and a few of us had the same idea<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></span><span>we decided on grabbing some pizza and drinks from a bar close by that came recommended.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While waiting in line to order my first drink, I witnessed what felt like a microcosm for the day’s events as a whole when the bartender tripped up and spilled a drink order for one party. She quickly adjusted, repouring their beers and bringing them over successfully with the second attempt, ultimately no worse for wear. I doubt the two gentlemen who’d ordered them even remember the spilled drinks; I get the feeling that Wildlight is banking on something similar. If </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> can ultimately speak for itself, then will it matter in the end that they messed up with the reveal trailer? No one will remember. Well, except maybe Geoff Keighley.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Scanning through the menu, my eye was drawn to an unorthodox-sounding pizza flavor; Cacio e Pepe, like the pasta dish. Evidently I was the only one at the table that was familiar with the flavor, and we ordered the pie to give it a shot. It was delicious, and I’d only wish it hadn’t been devoured so quickly–I would have loved a slice or two for the ride home. Sometimes it’s good to take a chance on something different.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">The Game Awards 2025 ended with a trailer for <em>Highguard</em></a>, a new FPS from some ex-<em>Titanfall</em> devs, it failed to wow the internet, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-breaks-radio-silence-and-the-internet-reacts-2000662650">the weeks of radio silence that followed</a> only provided a void that was quickly filled by speculation, debate, and skepticism. Now, weeks later, <em>Highguard</em> has finally launched, and everyone has a chance to play it and really figure out what this game is, likely determining if it will be a hit or <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">another short-lived multiplayer flop like <em>Concord</em>.</a> Early impressions are that it’s solid, but many are struggling to even play the game due to server queues, disconnects, and performance issues on console and PC.</p> <p><em>Highguard</em> went live on January 26 across consoles and PC to a large amount of confusion, curiosity, and, sure, some actual hype. The devs did a big deep dive on Monday, revealing that the game is a 3v3 PVP “raid shooter.” This translates into what looks like a game that mixes together <em>Rainbow Six Siege’</em>s base defense mechanics, MOBA-like clashes between teams in the field, gear upgrades, and a final big raid on one of the team’s bases to decide who wins the match.</p>

 <p>From what I’ve seen so far and played, it could be a lot of fun. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">Our preview of the new FPS is similarly positive about <em>Highguard</em></a>. But the game isn’t running well on my RTX 5070 PC, even at medium settings with DLSS. And I’m not alone in dealing with performance issues and other problems.</p>  <h2><em>Highguard’s </em>PC problems and no FOV slider on PS5</h2> <p>On the game’s subreddit, more than a few players are complaining about <em>Highguard</em> running poorly on their rigs, even those with solid specs. Other players are having issues with the game’s settings not changing despite multiple attempts to do so. Some are also running into a bug where dialogue is missing during the tutorial. On console, <em>Highguard</em> lacks an FOV slider, an issue that led to a lot of angry fans when<em> Borderlands 4</em> was missing the same popular feature on PS5 and Xbox. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823"><em>Borderlands 4</em> eventually added it</a>. I’ll be curious to see if <em>Highguard</em> does, too. Players are also complaining about the game looking blurry on consoles, which might be a quicker fix.</p>

 <p>Another issue that will likely be smoothed out over the next 24 hours is players getting stuck in server queues or getting disconnected while playing. Considering the fact that nearly 98k players all tried to play <em>Highguard</em> on Steam alone, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">according to SteamDB data,</a> I’d bet that the servers are just struggling to keep up with the demand. It’s annoying for gamers, but I can imagine the devs are thankful that so many people want to play <em>Highguard</em> that the servers are struggling to get them all in.</p>

 <p><em>Concord</em> didn’t have such high playercount numbers on Steam. In fact, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">it failed to crack 1,000 concurrent players</a>. <em>Highguard</em> has been compared many times by online commentators to that live-service flop, which shut down less than a month after its dismal launch. It seems all but certain that <em>Highguard</em> will stick around a bit longer than that. Hopefully some of the technical issues and bugs can be ironed out. The devs have confirmed they have around a year of content in development for <em>Highguard</em>, which will get regular updates like most live-service games.</p> <p>Now that it’s finally out, all the speculation can be replaced with what tends to come next when live-service games launch: People claiming it’s a dead game.</p>

              <p><em>TR-49</em> is analogy rendered in four dimensions. On a surface level, it’s a game about sorting through an archive of written works and commentary that has you identifying dozens of excerpts and documents, all with the aim of destroying a particular work. Beneath the surface, however, this is a piece of art that speaks viciously and satirically to so much of our reality.</p> <p><em>TR-49</em> casts you as Abbi, a woman who must come to grips with a peculiar computer seemingly built from salvage, in order to identify and eliminate a specific piece of writing. Something is very wrong in this alternative version of the UK, however; war is raging outside, and for some reason finding a specific digitized version of a book is going to make a difference. At the beginning of the game you will have about as much understanding of how to go about locating the essential text as you might how to fly a plane. If you’ve played <a href="https://william-rous.itch.io/type-help"><em>Type Help</em></a> or perhaps <a href="https://kotaku.com/her-story-is-a-smart-murder-mystery-that-will-keep-you-1713613148"><em>Her Story</em></a> you’ll have some instincts in place, knowing to just search the database for what you can see and keep going until its disparate aspects begin to come together. You may also find yourself troubled by a strong sense that you must have missed something. You haven’t. Keep going.</p>

 <p>I’m reluctant to talk any more about what you do in this remarkable game, because all that can do is rob you of the same sense of a slowly redeemed helplessness that I was able to experience. And not just for the sake of gaming puritanism, but because that experience is so integral to so much of what the game is about. It’s safe to say that you have a visual archive of many dozens of texts (and accompanying commentary notes) to explore, and that as you go you begin matching titles to documents as well as amassing an automatically filled in collection of sublime notes that mean you can get from start to finish without ever needing to grab a pen.</p>  <p>It is far more interesting to discuss what exists beneath <em>TR-49</em>‘s mechanics, the wealth of meaning to find if you pierce the veneer. Despite its alt-history setting, depicted in an ancient, grimy stone basement, and documents primarily from the early-to-mid 20th century, this game feels incredibly, painfully relevant in 2026. This is no simple, reductive allegory, but rather an extraordinary tangle of interwoven analogy. It’s as much a piece about the existential threat posed by the mercenary consumption of human-created works being done by gen-AI as it is the immediate danger of a government that refuses to adhere to reality, although you could equally read the work as being about the complexities of constructivism, epistemology, and linguistic relativity. Heck, it’s a giant machine that eats books. Or you could just enjoy it as big, difficult puzzle.</p>

 <p>As you explore the archives you’ll learn not only about the progression of writings by a range of fictional academics and authors, but also the family and relationships of the people who built the machine you’re using and the effects the archived texts have had upon them. The game walks an incredibly fine tightrope with enormous finesse, delicately entwining magical realism into an all-too recognizable dystopian present.. It forces you to <em>think</em>. Not think about how to solve the puzzles, although of course it does, but to explore ideas you might not have considered before.</p>

 <p>I’m not going to pretend to have read about, or even have heard of, linguistic relativity and the so-called Whorf-Sapir hypothesis before playing&nbsp;<em>TR-49</em>. But as a result of playing it, and needing to discover a vocabulary to describe ideas it&nbsp; provoked, it’s where I’ve ended up. That hypothesis is the argument, if I can oversimplify it to the point where I understand it, that it is our language that determines our cognition, rather than the other way around. Is that true? Does it get dangerously close to some sort of linguistic eugenics? A magically realized view of the concept is described in the texts of the articles and publications you uncover, and weaves a whole new fiction, a sort of linguo-punk 20th century, one that critiques and speaks to the apocalyptic reality of the game’s present. And please understand it does this with no self-importance, no ostentation, instead delivering it like the hum of a machine you only realize you were hearing once it switches off.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663130" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663130"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663130">© Inkle / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There is an irony in the fact that <em>TR-49</em>‘s greatest weakness manifests when it attempts to impose its narrative upon you far more forcefully. Alongside reading through the texts and deciphering the codes needed to unearth more, you also have the vocal company of a man called Liam, somewhat instructing the bemused Abbi as to what she needs to do (albeit mostly by telling her that her confusion (and yours) is part of the process). After Liam speaks, a button resembling a speaker glows pink, encouraging you to click it and thus have Abbi respond. Quite why you have to constantly prompt the responses is unclear, and it quickly becomes surprisingly irritating while you’re attempting to fathom connections between texts and infer information from wonderfully subtle clues. On far too many occasions I yelled at Liam to “just shut up!” while I was trying to play, feeling obliged to deliver Abbi’s responses, having to endlessly click on the button instead of the document I’m scrolling through, all for a conversation that doesn’t really add very much.</p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE</p>                 <p>"Linguo-punk mastery"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>TYPE OF GAME</p>                 <p>Alt-history dystopian document discovery</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>LIKED</p>                 <p>Extraordinary world-building (and dissembling), eventual sense of feeling awfully clever, stunning music</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>DISLIKED</p>                 <p>Liam talking when I'm trying to think</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>DEVELOPER</p>                 <p>Inkle</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>PLATFORMS</p>                 <p>PC (played), iOS</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>RELEASE DATE</p>                 <p>Out now</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>PLAYED</p>                 <p>Completed the game in about six hours, and then checked out a second ending</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p>This is no criticism of the writing and especially not of the excellent voice acting—it’s just that it’s so often so incongruous to what I’m trying to do. Liam just pipes up while I’m mid-thought, throwing me off my flow, and I began to resent him for it. There’s a moment very early on when Liam has to step away from his microphone, and Abbi panics without him but I was enjoying the peace and quiet. (It’s even more annoying that Liam’s interjections speak over the rest of the splendid voice acting of identified texts being read aloud.) It is a shame to find myself so irritated by the main characters with whom I’m supposed to relate.</p>

And for those who, like me, find themselves utterly overwhelmed by the likes of <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> and&nbsp;<em>Obra Dinn</em>, where the volume of information you’re asked to juggle becomes white noise to my ADHD-addled brain, I encountered none of this with&nbsp;<em>TR-49.</em> I credit this to the (I already called them “sublime” but there’s no better word) sublime automatically updated notes. They give&nbsp;nothing away, but they allow hundreds of disparate pieces of information to be calmly ordered.</p> <p>It is perhaps about time we stopped being surprised by just how brilliant each new game from Inkle is capable of being, but I’m still delighted by how different&nbsp;<em>TR-49</em> feels from, say,&nbsp;<em>Sorcery!</em>,&nbsp;<em>Heaven’s Vault</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Overboard!</em> Each game is an extraordinary demonstration of a mastery of language, and <em>TR-49</em> is no different. Except it’s very different, not least in its paranoia over the power of language, its potential dangers, and indeed the explicit dangers of its exploitation and censorship. 2026 is a chillingly perfect time to release a game about a machine that learns the atomistic contents of books, destroying them in the process.</p>
