How much is a game worth? What qualities or aspects of a game justify a higher price tag, or demand a lower one? Does a game that costs $70 deserve the same critical reaction as the identical game but $30? All this has gone on since time immemorial. But something that seems to rumble underneath so much of the discussion is rich people telling poor people that prices don’t matter. When asked about a potential $80 cost for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, multi-millionaire Randy Pitchford—CEO of developer Gearbox—told a potential customer, “If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196163" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Firefight’s Back In Halo!

In 1991 when he had just left high school and was working a minimum-wage job at an ice cream parlor on Pismo Beach, he was able to find a way to pay $80 for <em>Starflight</em> on the Sega Genesis. So, you know, so can everyone else. Pitchford sent the message as a reply on X last week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-its-not-my-call-if-borderlands-4-costs-usd80-but-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-buy-it-anyway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-its-not-my-call-if-borderlands-4-costs-usd80-but-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-buy-it-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by <em>GamesRadar</em> today</a></span>.</p><p>Randy Pitchford grew up in Fairfax, Virginia, then California. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190112044349/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/randy-pitchford-and-the-perfect-shuffle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190112044349/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/randy-pitchford-and-the-perfect-shuffle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His father worked in U.S. intelligence</a></span> in the 1970s, and his house was filled with all manner of technology throughout his childhood. While I cannot say for sure (although I have emailed to find out), it seems vanishingly unlikely that Pitchford was living off of his minimum wage ice cream job after he’d graduated high school, as his tweet seems to want to heavily imply. Pitchford soon after went to UCLA, so we can quite safely guess that this was a short-term job, one for earning a bit of extra spending money while still living at home with his parents.</p><p>I would suggest that to use this anecdote to explain to all living humans that if they really want a copy of <em>Borderlands 4</em>, they can easily find eighty bucks to spare is grotesque. It kind of makes me sick.</p><h2 id="h16818"><a id=""></a>Luxury viewpoints</h2><p>“Video games are a luxury.” That’s a point many people want to make in situations like this. “If you can afford the console to play the game on...” people might begin, as they argue that you can’t really be <em>that</em> poor if you can still afford entertainment. All those people living on welfare, but with those giant TVs, etc. It’s a fascinating perspective, almost exclusively proffered by those who <em>aren’t</em> living on welfare, and have rarely truly wanted for anything. Because if there’s one thing that’s pretty damned desirable when you’re living in real poverty, it’s some option for positive entertainment. For so many others, furiously working and saving and scraping together the money to be able to buy their children a games console, to give them that one thing they so desperately want when they’ve had to go without so much else, is not an act of opulence but of enormous sacrifice.</p><p>So no, this isn’t about abstract situations made up by armchair philosophers trying to justify Pitchford’s claim by arguing that any truly poor person have to choose between food or games entirely. This is about reality, where a person might go without so much extra food, or only buy the very cheapest food, so that they can pull together the $60 that year to buy the new entry in their favorite gaming franchise. That little bit of light. And then they find out it’s maybe now going to cost $80 instead.</p><h2 id="h16819"><a id=""></a>For 37 million Americans, there <em>isn’t</em> an extra $20</h2><p>In 2023 (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most recent data</a></span>), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23 percent</a></span> of Americans worked in low-wage jobs.

An example of “poverty” was given as “a family of three with income below $21,559.” In 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Department of Health and Human Services</a></span> describes poverty for an individual as living on less than $15,650 a year. This is all before the recent raids on welfare. </p><p>That breaks down to $1,300 a month. The average rental price for a one-bedroom apartment in the United States is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1,625 a month</a></span>. The average monthly household expenses for a single person <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/american-average-monthly-expenses&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/american-average-monthly-expenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">come to $4,641</a></span>, including food, insurance, rent, cell phone, internet, and personal care. Even taking into account that these are averages, it’s pretty obvious that when you’re one of the one-in-nine people living on $1,300 a month, you don’t have a lot of spare piles of $80. In 2012 (soon after the crash), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reported that the poorest people in America spent 98 percent of their income</a></span>, with one dollar per day to save. That study showed this group spends 4.8 percent of their income on “entertainment,” a broad category that even includes pets. An $80 copy of <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is 6.2 percent of $1,300.</p><p>Jump forward to the pre-covid boom in 2019, and on an annual family household income of $25,525, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total spending is measured to be $25,525</a></span>. Of that, for an average family in this bracket, a total of $1,270 is spent on “entertainment.” That’s roughly $105 a month. But, again, it’s essential to understand that “entertainment” includes all sporting activities, all children’s extra-curricular education, toys, bikes, every electronic item from a TV to a camera, and even musical instruments and pets. If you own a dog, you’ll know that $105 a month could be taken up by it alone.</p><p>For so many of us, finding another $20 to buy a favorite game means grumbling and pulling out our wallet. But for so many others, it means not buying the one game we were hoping to play this year.</p><h2 id="h16820"><a id=""></a>“But if you’re a real fan...”</h2><p>Hopefully, this context suggests why it’s just so revolting for a man <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gearbox-has-been-bought-for-1-3-billion-1846186922&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gearbox-has-been-bought-for-1-3-billion-1846186922">who sold his company for a potential $1.3 billion in 2021</a></span> to tell someone on X that “if you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.” Because, you know, when he was doing a summer job at the beach in California, he somehow pulled enough cash together for that game he wanted.</p><p>It’s gross. It sucks. I’m fed up of it. I’m sick of rich people telling poor people that they can find the money if they just try hard enough. I’ve had my fill of people who’ve never known hunger, never struggled to pay a bill, flippantly dismissing the concept that life is extremely tough for millions and millions of people. It’s the rhetoric that allows for the myth of the “welfare queen” to be so readily accepted, to assume that the poorest people just aren’t pulling their weight or working hard enough, that if these people were <em>really</em> poor, they wouldn’t be playing video games at all. It’s <em>hateful</em>.</p><p>As for whether <em>Borderlands 4</em> will cost $80, Pitchford claims it’s “not my call,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045">having previously said it’s still undecided</a></span>. Whether it will be <em>worth</em> $80—that’s entirely in the wallet of the beholder.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But you know who else appears in every one of these films, including the latest, <em>Final Reckoning</em>? Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. And I’m so happy to see him in each film. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Luther Stickell is first introduced in the original <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie as a genius computer hacker and “phone phreaker” who has been “disavowed” by the IMF for his actions, and who helps Ethan with his mission to be reinstated. In the next few films he helps Ethan over and over, often acting as the agent’s “second eyes,” someone who can help guide him during missions using hacked cameras. He often unlocks doors, shuts down security systems, or gains access to secret info using his hacking skills. Without Luther, Ethan would have likely failed some of his biggest missions or even died. And during all of this hacking and helping, Luther remains a loyal friend with a cool demeanor, slick style, and a big heart. <br></p><p>It’s not a debate that in both the fictional movie universe of<em> Mission: Impossible</em> and the franchise itself, Cruise’s Hunt is the most important person around. He’s on every poster. In every movie. He saves the day over and over again and each film is mostly focused on his struggles.  His defeats. His wins. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244">And of course, all those sick stunts he does during missions</a></span>. But I think Luther Stickell is the second most important person because without him, Ethan would have failed many times. Plus, he acts as a close friend and confidant, an important role when you have a life as stressful and full of secrets as Ethan’s. </p><h2 id="h332595"><a id=""></a>Luther is always helping, even if he’s not around</h2><p>Case in point: Luther Stickell doesn’t show up until the very end of <em>Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol</em>. But he still <em>shows up </em>at a bar, after the chaotic mission, to roast Ethan’s “corny” one-liner and share a beer with his bud. Cruise, who is heavily involved with these movies, as well as director Brad Bird, could have chosen to not include Luther. But I think Cruise understands how important it is for Luther to be around in Ethan’s life. And at this point, the audience loves him and expects him to show up over and over to save the day, make us laugh, and be the coolest person on screen. </p><p>Even when Luther isn’t around, he’s important and helping Ethan Hunt. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Stickell#:~:text=It%20is%20revealed%20in%20later%20film%20Fallout%20that%20after%20Ethan%20and%20Julia%20fake%20her%20death%2C%20Luther%20is%20responsible%20for%20teaching%20Julia%20how%20to%20be%20a%20%27ghost%27%3A%20to%20disappear%20and%20avoid%20being%20hunted%20by%20anyone%20looking%20to%20use%20her%20against%20Ethan.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Stickell#:~:text=It%20is%20revealed%20in%20later%20film%20Fallout%20that%20after%20Ethan%20and%20Julia%20fake%20her%20death%2C%20Luther%20is%20responsible%20for%20teaching%20Julia%20how%20to%20be%20a%20%27ghost%27%3A%20to%20disappear%20and%20avoid%20being%20hunted%20by%20anyone%20looking%20to%20use%20her%20against%20Ethan." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As revealed in <em>Fallout</em></a></span>, after the events of <em>Mission: Impossible 3</em>, Hunt leaves his wife to allow her to live a happy and safe life. But Luther helps train her on how to be a spy, hide from dangerous people, and how to protect herself. Luther is truly the nicest dude in the franchise. </p><p>It’s wild to think that we almost missed out on Luther appearing in every <em>Mission</em> film. Back during production on the first movie, Ving Rhames says that the original script has his character dying very early on. He pointed this out to star and producer Tom Cruise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-ving-rhames-luther-death-factoid/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-ving-rhames-luther-death-factoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as he explained in a recent interview with <em>ScreenRant</em></a></span>. </p><p>  “The first one, I died in the first 10 pages and I said, ‘Why is it the black man always dies in the first 10 pages?’ Tom said, ‘Yeah. Why is that?’ So, now, I just finished number eight, so I feel pretty fortunate,” said Rhames. </p><p>I’m so happy that Tom Cruise realized that was a silly decision and advocated for Luther to survive the first film. Since then, Luther has become a key part of the franchise, just as important and expected as big stunts, lifelike masks, secret messages, and Ethan Hunt. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
