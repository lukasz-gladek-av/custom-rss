This makes it the biggest opening weekend for a movie so far this year, and significantly, makes it the highest-grossing start for any movie based on a game, beating <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>’s opening weekend take of $146 million.</p><p>Director Jared Hess is still best known for 2004's <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em> and 2006's <em>Nacho Libre</em> which, given he’s made four other full-length movies since, is a little damning. But he’ll be hot property again now, helming what’s likely to be the biggest kids’ film of the year. And that’s despite <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>’s reviews, which have been pretty harsh.</p><p>Currently sitting at 47 percent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Rotten Tomatoes</a></span>, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-minecraft-movie/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-minecraft-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">47 on Metacritic</a></span>, critics have been negative about the movie. It’s absolutely not a great film, packed with weird pacing, Teflon characters (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-friendship-1851775031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-friendship-1851775031">bar one</a></span>), and abandoned plotlines (oh, and my son would add: “Where was the Ender Dragon?!”). But it’s a big, colorful bunch of funny jokes and recognizable references that caused all the kids in my earshot to cheer or comment in delight as they spotted them. Which is to say, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395">it succeed at what it was always setting out to do</a></span>.</p><p>With schools on or soon to be on vacation all over the world for Easter/Spring breaks, the movie could be set to have a long tail, rather than a sharp drop-off. Word of mouth probably won’t do it a <em>huge</em> amount of good, other than parents saying to each other, “It’s fine,” but  the fact that the McDonald’s near me has lines blocking nearby roads because of the tie-in Happy Meals toys suggests it’s going to keep making money on the big screen.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2017 edition has still never gotten a price drop and remains $300. The Switch OLED is even more at $350. If Nintendo continues selling them, it’s not shocking that the Switch 2, a generational leap, would be $100 more. “You want to consider pricing relative to the Switch since we still have that in distribution,” Bowser said. </p><p><em>Mario Kart World</em>’s $80 price tag <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-kart-world-physical-game-tariffs-prices-1851774317?_gl=1*1wwkjyf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDAzMzc2NS43OS4xLjE3NDQwMzY1OTQuMTAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-kart-world-physical-game-tariffs-prices-1851774317?_gl=1*1wwkjyf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDAzMzc2NS43OS4xLjE3NDQwMzY1OTQuMTAuMC4w">is arguably what’s been upsetting fans even more</a></span>, and leading them to spam Nintendo Tree House Live demos of the game on YouTube with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-mario-kart-world-nintendo-treehouse-live-1851774530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-mario-kart-world-nintendo-treehouse-live-1851774530">wall-to-wall “drop the price” comments</a></span>.

But why make <em>Mario Kart World</em> the canary in the $80 mine right at launch? “We just look at what is the experience, and what’s the content, and what’s the value?” Nintendo of America’s VP of product and player experience Bill Trinen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span>.</p><p>He also suggested that there are tons of new details about the game that haven’t been revealed yet that will win fans over. “<em>Mario Kart World</em>, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our <em>Mario Kart </em>Direct to see what, maybe you’ll be able to find out about that,” he said, referring to a deeper dive into the game slated for April 17.</p><p>He continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there’s still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they’re going to find this to be probably the richest <em>Mario Kart </em>experience they’ve ever had.</p></blockquote><p>Trinen also confirmed <em>Welcome Tour</em>, the Switch 2's <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>-style mini-game explainer for the new hardware, is a $10 digital-only download. Why not a pack-in for the console, like <em>Wii Sports</em>? “Just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, ‘Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you’re getting out of the product,’ he said. <br></p><p>The veteran Nintendo employee also weighed in on why games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> will be $80 on Switch 2 for their upgraded content, despite having been released several years ago at this point. “Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, ‘what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?’ What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you’re looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that’s the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game,” Trinen said.</p><p>Poor <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. At just $70, Nintendo must not think it’s as good or just not the same “value” as some of its other games. One big question remains, then. Is $70 the new $60 on Switch 2, or the new $50? I hope Welcome Tour has a<em> The Price is Right </em>mini-game. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
