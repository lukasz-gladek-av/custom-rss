              <p><span>Remember that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/across-the-spider-verse-spider-man-lego-teen-animate-14-1850506788"><span>scene in </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span>: </span><i><span>Across the Spider-Verse</span></i></a> <span>that showed a Lego version of Peter Parker living his best blocky life? If you didn’t know, that segment was animated entirely by then 14-year-old animator Preston Mutanga, who caught the filmmaker’s attention after he recreated the movie’s first trailer in the style of a Lego movie. It’s been two years, and the now 16-year-old Mutanga is still hard at work building scenes and trailers from Lego blocks. His recent projects include making the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaY7pJbYDy8"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl_VFCX_iaM"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> trailers look like something right out of a kid’s toy box, but it’s his latest incredible videos that have really caught my eye: faithful remakes of scenes from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, done in such spectacular fashion that they could have been an official collaboration between Sony, Netflix, and Lego.</span></p> <p><span>Mutanga has uploaded two videos featuring the Lego versions of Huntr/x to his TikTok account. One is a snippet of one of the coolest parts of the movie’s first musical number, “How It’s Done,” which shows the group skydiving down onto a blocky version of Seoul and kicking some demon booty on the way down.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The second is less action-packed but longer, and lets Mutanga add a cute nod to his </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>roots. It’s a scene, maybe a third of the way into the movie, after the demonic Saja Boys boy band has started getting their flirty, sexy demon claws into the hearts and minds of the world. They’ve weakened the Honmoon barrier between the real and demon worlds, and the girls are trying to figure out what to do while maintaining their Kpop girl group cover. Their manager, Bobby, comes in to give them an update on their rivals’ newfound virality, and as he scrolls through videos of the Boys’ fans dancing to their hit song “Soda Pop,” a familiar webslinger briefly appears on his phone.</span></p>   <p><span>Mutanga’s incredible work speaks for itself, but I will say I sure hope someone over at Lego or Sony is ready to give this kid a job when he’s of age.&nbsp;</span></p>
