              <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update is live, and lapsed players are rushing back to their near-abandoned islands. The update is technically two parts—the free part, which everyone will get, and the paid part, which is only for Nintendo Switch 2 players. Most of the content is tied to the free update, like Kapp’n’s seaside hotel which has been constructed on island piers. For existing owners, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade is $4.99; Nintendo says it’s got an “enhanced resolution,” as well as mouse control support and larger multiplayer sessions.</span></p> <p><span>Though Kapp’n’s hotel is the big, main content piece of the big 3.0 patch, there’s a lot of little details to love in both the free and paid updates.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000658997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658997"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658997">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><span>You can decorate two rooms per day at Kapp’n’s hotel</span></h2> <p><span>Isabelle will announce that the hotel is open, so head right down to the pier to check it out. Kapp’n and Tom Nook will be inside to give you the rundown on what’s going on. Basically, the hotel is already entirely built, but they’re looking for someone to help Kapp’n’s wife, Leilani, decorate the rooms. You’ll be prompted to decorate a room, and Leilani will walk you through it. She wants it to be themed, but you don’t </span><i><span>have</span></i><span> to follow that. You’ll get 200 tickets for doing so! You’ll continue to get prompted for a couple days to decorate rooms and help out with unlocking other features around the hotel.</span></p>

 <p><span>But, at max, you’re only able to decorate two rooms per day. Once you decorate a room, tourists will start showing up. You can keep helping with the hotel, though, by taking on tasks at a DIY requests stand on the pier, which will be unlocked as you proceed.</span></p>

 <h2><span>Tourists will roam your island</span></h2> <p><span>The animals that show up to rent the rooms on your island can be found wandering around, exploring the sights. They’ll interact with your residents, but can’t be asked to move onto your island, like with the campsite.</span></p> <h2><span>You can decorate your pier</span></h2> <p><span>All of the wooden parts of the hotel pier can be decorated as you please. It’s not a ton of room, but it’s enough to bring in some extra flair. It works exactly the same way as decorating anywhere else, but you’ve got to work around some of the permanent fixtures.</span></p>

 <p><span>The hotel’s facade can’t be customized, but it is decorated seasonally, it seems—there’s snow on the roof in winter, and an adorable little snowman outside.</span></p> <h2><span>Save up your bells for Resetti’s pricey service</span></h2> <p><span>Resetti will be wandering around your island when you update to 3.0. He’s able to quickly reset portions of your island, but it’ll cost you 60,000 bells per day. The good news is that it’s </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> 60,000 bells per portion of land—it’s a daily rate, so you can keep calling Resetti back for an entire 24 hours at no extra cost.</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, the first use of the service is free, so you’ll have time to save up if you want to give it a try but can’t afford his hefty fee. Here’s how it works: You first go tell Isabelle you want to use the service, and Resetti will be wandering your island. He’ll give you three options: to reset either the whole island, your beaches, or specific areas. If you choose the third option, you can go and choose the area and summon him.</span></p>

 <h2><span>New movement actions make decorating and terraforming more precise</span></h2> <p><span>This is a super small detail, but makes a huge difference. There are new movement options in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>. It’s easy: You just need to tap and hold the L button to move precisely in different directions. Basically, it’s movement on a grid—up, down, left, and right. When you press the L button and don’t hold it down, you can do a little, cute jump.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is particularly exciting for me, because it drives me crazy to be trying to dig up something and accidentally dig the wrong area. By being able to make precise movements, I can more easily position myself in the correct spot. It’ll help with placing items in the world, too, I think.</span></p> <h2><span>Craft without having resources in your pockets</span></h2> <p><span>Empty the sticks and rocks out of your pockets, because crafting now pulls from your home inventory! If you </span><i><span>do</span></i><span> have materials in your pockets, crafting will use those first, then move to home storage. You can do this from any crafting bench on your island, but it won’t work if you’re crafting on someone else’s island.</span></p> <h2><span>Bulk crafting limited to 10 items</span></h2> <p><span>Crafting that pulls from home storage is particularly helpful now that bulk crafting is a thing. However, bulk crafting is limited to making 10 of a certain item at once—no more than that. Ten is still a lot, and will certainly make life easier for people who are furiously crafting.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Even Is A Video Game Backlog In 2026?]]></title>

            <guid>1407187</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/that-s-a-wrap-on-backlog-month-1846849615">We’ve written a lot about backlogs on this site.</a> Those long lists of games we want to play or finally get around to finishing. I have a backlog. It’s very big. It’s scary to think about. And I also recently realized, after returning to <em>Diablo 4</em>, that in 2026, a backlog is becoming an outdated concept as forever games take over the industry and live-service titles get killed, making it harder and harder to actually finish a game, cross it off your list, and walk away.</p> <p>For decades, competitive multiplayer games have existed, and the concept of a game that can’t be “finished” has been around for about as long as games themselves. But when I talk about the games that undermine the very concept of a backlog, I’m not talking about online-only PVP titles like<em> Arc Raiders</em> or <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. I’m instead talking about the growing list of live-service games, many of which can be played solo, that have campaigns with “endings” but also keep growing, that are all fighting for your attention and receiving an endless wave of updates and expansions.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">I finished <em>Diablo 4</em> in 2023</a> and really enjoyed it. With that completion, it was crossed off my backlog. But since then, it has received numerous seasonal updates, adding new content and narrative elements. It has also received an expansion and <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4s-second-expansion-adds-new-classes-and-big-changes-2000652722">is getting another one later this year</a>. I booted the game up last week to check it out again and realized that, well, shit,<em> Diablo 4</em> is <em>back</em> on my backlog. I completed <em>The </em><em>Division</em> <em>2</em>‘s main campaign once upon a time, but since then, it’s expanded into a bigger game with more missions to finish and more story to experience. That one is probably never leaving my backlog, despite me having over 300 hours in it at this point.</p>

 <p>Then there are those live-service games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">like BioWare’s <em>Anthem</em></a>, which I had on my backlog for years, always telling myself I’d get to them and finish up the main story one day. Well, in&nbsp;<em>Anthem</em>‘s case, I waited too long, and now the game is dead, the servers permanently shut down. And while I could just scrub it from my mental backlog of games, I know it will linger around like a ghost. A memory of what I could have done. There are a lot of live-service ghosts hanging out in my mental backlog these days. It’s getting crowded.</p>

 <p>A part of me wonders if the entire concept of backlogs is pointless now. Even single-player games that aren’t technically live-service titles, like Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a>, are often updated with <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644">new features and content</a>. It might just be time to try to build a new backlog in my head and reserve it only for offline single-player experiences that I’m confident won’t be expanded upon or killed in the future.</p>

 <p>At the very least, if I do rebuild my backlog, I’ll have a more manageable one. I mean, it will still be <em>extremely</em> long and nearly impossible to complete. But at least this new list–which will be devoid of live-service titles and “forever games” that, ironically, can go away forever with little warning–won’t be literally impossible to finish. And that’s nice. I guess.</p>
