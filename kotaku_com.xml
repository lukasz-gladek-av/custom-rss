This is usually where we get a bunch of updates on live-service games like <em>Pokémon Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket</em>, and <em>Go</em>, as well as a more substantial look at whatever RPG is in development over at Game Freak. As expected, <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A </em>made an appearance, and there were a few surprises along the way. If you want to watch the full presentation you can do so below, but if you just want the highlights, read on.</p><h2 id="h553741"><a id=""></a></h2></div></div><div><p>The stream began with a pre-show of sorts with a DJ set hosted by a pair of DJs Pikachu. (Much like “attorneys general,” DJs Pikachu is the correct plural here.) The music selections included some pretty rad electronic remixes of classic <em>Pokémon </em>music. Release the tracks on streaming, TPC!</p></div><div><p>Kicking off the Presents is a look at the next season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, the amazing stop-motion show on Netflix. Haru is still working at the resort and has an unruly Sealeo to take care of, but she also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend Kent showing up. The show looks just as wholesome and soul-cleansing as season one. The new episodes will premiere on Netflix on September 4. </p></div><div><p>A new stop-motion series is also in development called <em>The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu. </em>The charming teaser features a Wooloo calmly grazing as all kinds of Pokemon-related shenanigans are happening just out of view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-recommend-id="image://ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1799" data-height="1013" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-recommend-id="image://ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1799" data-height="1013" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A new outdoor attraction is opening up in Japan. Made to look like a real forest and town featuring statues and attractions based on Pokémon, it’s set to open in 2026. Tickets will go on sale later this year.</p></div><div><p>Now for the game updates. <em>Pokemon Go</em>’s next Go Fest event, Max Finale, will take place on August 23 and 24, and will feature Max Pokemon, including Eternatus.</p></div><div><p>We didn’t see much of <em>Pokémon Masters EX</em> this time, but Carmine &amp; Sinistcha will join the game on July 29 as a sync pair.</p></div><div><p>A bunch of pirate-themed characters and cosmetics are coming to the puzzle game/management sim <em>Pokémon Cafe ReMix</em>, including a captain outfit for Lapras, Alolan Meowth, Totodile, and Minccino. You can also recruit a summer-themed Jigglypuff to help out at your cafe.</p></div><div><p>The Legendary Beasts are coming to <em>Pokemon Sleep</em>, so expect to see Suicune, Entei, and Raikou show up in your research in September. A new area called Amber Canyon is also coming to the game in August.</p></div><div><p>Latias is joining the MOBA <em>Pokémon Unite</em> for its fourth anniversary. Latios joined the roster on July 18, with Latias to follow on August 8. A new battle mode called Electrode Volleyball is also now available in-game.</p></div><div><p>We saw some of the new full-art Mega Evolution cards coming to the Trading Card Game, including Lucario, Gardevoir, Kangaskhan and Venusaur.</p></div><div><p>Minutes before the Presents began, a new puzzle game called <em>Pokémon Friends </em>was released on the App Store. Someone flipped a switch too early, it seems. The game centers around collecting <em>Pokémon </em>plushies by solving short puzzles in a variety of classic, traditional brainteaser formats. The game is free-to-play on mobile and apparently a $9.99 package on Switch.</p></div><div><p>After a brief mention of the game’s Switch 2 upgrades, it was announced that <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>are getting new tera raids for the Treasures of Ruin, but you’ll only be able to capture them after the raids have been completed one million times across all players.</p></div><div><p>We finally saw our first footage of <em>Pokémon Champions</em>. The battle simulator includes ranked play, private battles, and a new training mode that lets you alter monster stats and move pools, and really craft your team. It’s coming to Switch and mobile in 2026.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show is a new look at <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. We started with a pretty slick trailer showing the main character running around the city, meeting new characters, and trying on new clothes, with their Pokémon following them around the whole time. The presentation focused on the story, cast, and what you can do in the moment-to-moment, but it also revealed one new Mega Evolution: Dragonite, which brings back some of the visual elements of its previous evolution, Dragonair, such as wings on its head and a pearl on its tail. And that was it. Alrighty then. The game looks really cool and there’s some exciting stuff here, but I was hoping for a more substantial blow-out on the rumored Mega Evolutions. Maybe they just want to keep those under wraps until the game comes out on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive spent the last week teasing a big announcement, and now it’s finally been revealed: <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em>. The first proper, single-player adaptation of the famous horror franchise showcases the return of Pinhead actor Doug Bradley and includes a red-band version of the trailer you won’t find on YouTube.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to save his girlfriend from a hellish abyss,” reads the official description for <em>Hellraiser</em>. “Playing as Aidan, you will harness the box’s infernal abilities in order to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and his Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will become a legend, even in Hell.”</p><p>Horror makes me queasy, and I’ve never been able to sit through an entire <em>Hellraiser</em> movie before. So, it didn’t take much for the game’s first official trailer to gross me out. But the real <em>Hellraiser: Revival</em> trailer is actually only hosted on the game’s website. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hellraisergame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hellraisergame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It does not hold back</a></span>. I can’t embed that one, though, so here’s the YouTube version:</p><p>It shows Aiden and his unnamed girlfriend having sex before she solves the puzzle box, summons the Cenobites, and is subsequently ripped apart by chains as the extra-dimensional, sadomasochistic cult is wont to do. Taking the women in refrigerators trope to new hellish depths, we then get a quick sizzle reel of Aiden using melee weapons to beat the crap out of various monstrosities. No release date was teased, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p> Saber Interactive is making <em>Hellraiser: Revival </em>with Boss Team Games, who it previously collaborated with for<em> Evil Dead: The Game</em>. However, that adaptation, which featured the return of Bruce Campbell but faced mixed reviews over its lack of content, was primarily an asymmetric multiplayer game. <em>Hellraiser: Revival</em> looking like a traditional first-person action adventure should be a lot more reassuring to fans who want another story in that universe rather than another knock-off of<em> Dead by Daylight</em>. </p><p>Saber Interactive confirms this is a brand-new Hellraiser story within the established canon. The most recent film was the 2022 reboot directed by David Bruckner. While no sequel has been announced, one is reportedly in the works. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hellraiser-pinhead-doug-bradley-red-band-trailer-saber-1851786676]]></content:encoded>
