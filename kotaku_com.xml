The 2026 film is the next big crossover in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and will also bring Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689">back into the fold as Doctor Doom</a></span>. But now we’re getting a long, drawn-out cast announcement confirming which MCU heroes will be facing off against Doctor Doom next year.</p><p>The stream is lingering on shots of director’s chairs featuring different actors’ names on them. The first one was Thor actor <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong>, who was last seen in <em>Thor: Love and Thunder </em>in 2022. After several minutes of hanging out on his chair, the camera panned right to reveal a chair with <strong>Vanessa Kirby’s</strong> name printed on it. Kirby is playing Sue “Invisible Woman” Storm in <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps, </em>which will premiere on July 25. However, she was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already confirmed for the film last year</a></span>, so that’s not new. Third up is <strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>, the new Captain America, who just starred in <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> in February. Fourth revealed is <strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>, who plays the Winter Soldier, and will star in <em>Thunderbolts* </em>on May 2. Next is <strong>Letitia Wright</strong>, who plays Shuri, the new Black Panther who took on the title in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That’s all we’ve seen thus far.

Since the launch of November 2024's set, Surging Sparks, the popularity of the 30-year-old collectible card game exploded, which in turn drew the attention of scalpers, which has rendered the products almost impossible to buy ever since. Journey Together, officially releasing Friday 28 March, is such an anticlimactic set that it almost feels designed to try to calm the waters.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195752,195281" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It hasn’t, and it won’t, because May 29’s freshly announced set, Destined Rivals, is reintroducing the beloved baddies Team Rocket to the TCG for the first time since the year 2000. With fan favorites like the pairing of Giovanni and Mewtwo, it’s going to make the already impossible situation <em>so</em> much worse, and the release of pre-orders for the set this week saw the Pokémon Center websites inaccessible for a day, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scalpers yet again scooping up everything before real customers could</a></span>. </p><p>But perhaps Journey Together could offer at least a moment of respite over the next two months? Because, despite featuring its own significant return of a long-lost aspect to the TCG, it’s such a bland, anticlimactic collection of cards that it should at least temper the feverish demand.</p><figure id="" data-id="b5627816c96514fc04dbe5a9d359111a" data-recommend-id="image://b5627816c96514fc04dbe5a9d359111a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Iono's Kilowattrel card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Iono's Kilowattrel card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5627816c96514fc04dbe5a9d359111a" data-recommend-id="image://b5627816c96514fc04dbe5a9d359111a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Iono's Kilowattrel card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Journey Together brings back the concept of “Trainer’s Pokémon,” something first introduced in 2000's Gym Heroes expansion and not seen since 2004's EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua. These are cards on which Pokémon are identified as belonging to a specific named trainer, and which have specific abilities and interact in unique ways with various Tool, Trainer and Stadium cards. Bringing them back to the <em>TCG</em> 21 years later is an interesting mechanical shift, and one that makes sense given <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">the Scarlet &amp; Violet era of the card game is running a year longer than is normal</a></span>.</p><p>The four trainers in Journey Together are favorites N (<em>Black &amp; White</em>), Lillie (<em>Sun &amp; Moon</em>), and Hop (<em>Sword &amp; Shield</em>), joined by the most popular trainer from <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em>, online influencer Iono. So everything’s in place for a very appealing set of cards, and very importantly, with big changes for the table-top game. It’s just...where are the special art cards?!</p><figure id="" data-id="7974d2f53f814d939c0461de8ef8640a" data-recommend-id="image://7974d2f53f814d939c0461de8ef8640a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hop's Zacian ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hop's Zacian ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7974d2f53f814d939c0461de8ef8640a" data-recommend-id="image://7974d2f53f814d939c0461de8ef8640a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hop's Zacian ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, I recognize the inherent contradiction here. I both want the game to be available for players to buy, while also lamenting the lack of collectible cards in the set. I want to believe the latter could improve the former, but caught as this set is between the impossibly popular (and still unavailable <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">despite promises from The Pokémon Company International</a></span>) Prismatic Evolutions and the forthcoming Destined Rivals, it’s hard to be optimistic. And given people will be paying ludicrous prices if they want to be able to get hold of any (I’m not just talking about paying resellers, which you shouldn’t—independent and online stores will also have to mark up prices to cover their own increased costs), it’d be nice if they at least had a chance of picking up something pretty.</p><p>But, having opened 50 packs (very kindly provided to us by Pokémon), I have very little positive to report.</p><p>Pull rates are, in my admittedly too-small sample, horrible. The worst I’ve experienced in the already extremely ungenerous <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> era. From 50 packs I managed seven basic ex cards (now so commonplace that they’re essentially considered bulk), and only <em>five</em> rare cards. That’s <em>dismal. </em>But it’s also not especially surprising, given just how few there were to pull. Journey Together has only 31 “secret cards” in the set, compared to the 61 in Surging Sparks and 59 in Twilight Masquerade, and it’s even lower than the previously disappointing 33 in Stellar Crown. Plus, despite there being some absolutely beautiful artworks in there (Lycanroc, N’s Reshiram, Noibat and Wailord really stand out), most are bizarrely dull. Obviously Iono’s Bellibolt ex Special Illustration Rare is going to fetch a hefty price, but it’s not a particularly attractive card. Compared to the extraordinary wealth of intricate art included in Prismatic Evolution, it feels weirdly despondent.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a8f60d5475c455f8f2ad806c405767ff" data-recommend-id="image://a8f60d5475c455f8f2ad806c405767ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Wailord card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Wailord card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8f60d5475c455f8f2ad806c405767ff" data-recommend-id="image://a8f60d5475c455f8f2ad806c405767ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Wailord card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In terms of the TCG itself, the Trainer’s Pokémon also feel lacklustre. That’s perhaps because this is just the beginning of the mechanic, a toe dip, before May’s Destined Rivals really gets into it.</p><p>For some reason, of the 20 different evolutionary lines of Trainer’s Pokémon, seven belong to N, seven to Hop, and only two each for Iono and Lillie. None is especially outstanding, although the ex versions are obviously the most powerful. N’s Zoroark ex is possibly the most interesting, letting you ditch one card from your hand each turn to pick up two more, and has two-energy attack that lets you use the attack of any other N’s Pokémon from your bench.</p><p>There’s a Tool called Lillie’s Pearl, which can be attached to either Lillie’s Cutiefly/Ribombee or Comfey, and prevents the opponent from getting a Prize Card when its defeated, which is neat! (There’s also a brand new Trainer called Ruffian, who can discard both Tools and Special Energy from opponent’s cards to counter this.) Meanwhile, Hop has a Choice Band Tool that reduces energy costs by one, and does 30 more damage, when applied to Hop’s Pokémon. </p><p>There are two new Stadia, too. N’s Castle removes retreat costs for all N’s Pokémon for both players, while Postwick adds yet another 30 damage to both players’ Hop’s Pokémon. It’s all enough that players will want to experiment with it, but it does seem like the big guns are being held back for now.</p><figure id="" data-id="0178bd452ce673add94ef2bbf8598624" data-recommend-id="image://0178bd452ce673add94ef2bbf8598624" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Furret card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Furret card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0178bd452ce673add94ef2bbf8598624" data-recommend-id="image://0178bd452ce673add94ef2bbf8598624" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Furret card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is all academic, of course, since it’s near impossible to buy anything. Quick anecdote: my wife recently sold a massive sack of empty Pokémon card tins on Facebook Marketplace (don’t blame me) for a few bucks, and the lovely lady who bought them for her kids to store cards in explained how she was going to be lining up outside a local toy store on Friday morning, in desperate hope to be able to get a Journey Together ETB for her daughter, while knowing how incredibly unlikely it was to be successful. She looked so sad, knowing how likely her daughter was to be disappointed in the face of incorrigible excitement. (I obviously gave her a wad of the Journey Together cards I’d opened, because I’m not a total monster.) But this is ridiculous! It shouldn’t be like trying to buy a launch day console when looking to pick up a few packs of <em>Pokémon</em> cards! (Never mind that someone working in the same store told me that somehow scalpers are queuing up before they open on the days they receive stock, despite no one knowing how they know when that’s happening.)</p><p>Journey Together, while obviously not <em>really</em> an effort to be deliberately disappointing, is at least a set you shouldn’t be too fussed about not being able to buy. It’s so dull, and offers so few interesting cards, that it’ll likely end up sitting on shelves next to Stellar Crown in a few months anyway.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
