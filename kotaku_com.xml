              <p><span>Sony and Santa Monica Studio announced a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356"><span>remake of the original </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>trilogy</span></a><span> during the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-sony-ps5-god-war-castlevania-kena-castlevania-2000668291"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span> last week, and details about the project are still pretty scarce. However, we may have gotten some information from an unlikely source: Christopher Judge, the voice of Kratos. No, not the one who was in the State of Play talking about the remakes, the one who plays the god of war in the series’ more recent, Norse-themed games.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber Fuzhpuzy posted </span><a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju"><span>a since-deleted video</span></a><span> from Fan Expo Vancouver 2026 in which she approached Judge and asked him a few questions about the upcoming remakes in which, the actor confirmed, he will not be playing Kratos, as original Kratos voice actor T.C. Carson is reprising his role.</span></p>

 <p><span>Judge confirming he won’t be playing Kratos is one thing, but it seems the actor is still privy to some unannounced details about the remake project. He said that the games will include a new “fighting system.” Could this mean that the remakes are leaning into modern </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>’s heavier combat systems rather than going back to the hack-and-slash mechanics of old? Judge didn’t get any more specific, so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ps5-remake-trilogy-sex-minigames-censored-2000669769"><span>we can only speculate</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The big reveal here, however, is that Judge says we’ll hear about what he is doing with Santa Monica Studio “late summer,” though he doesn’t say if this is a new </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> game or an unrelated project.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Fuzhpuzy has taken down the video, it has been </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596"><span>shared on social media</span></a><span>. Hopefully Judge doesn’t get into too much trouble over this. Last year, Ubisoft apparently threatened </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed </span></i><span>actor Matt Ryan </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-remaster-matt-ryan-1851787469"><span>with legal action</span></a><span> for discussing the still-unannounced </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag </span></i><span>remake with a fan at a convention.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Destiny 2 Is In Real Trouble After More Big Delays And Promises]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-shadow-order-roadmap-delay-update-2000671302</link>
            <guid>1440601</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s mid-expansion update<em> Shadow and Order</em> has been delayed by three months after weeks of silence leading up to its originally planned March 3 launch. Bungie blames the wait on “large revisions” to address months of player complaints but it puts the loot shooter in an even worse position after an already terrible year.</p> <p><em>Destiny 2</em> players are the fans who cried wolf. They’re always sounding the alarm even when things are going relatively well. But trust me when I say things have never been this bleak in the history of the soon-to-be 12-year-old sci-fi MMO. Its concurrent PC player count is at an all-time low. Last December’s <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion was a neat story campaign but did little to fundamentally patch up the broader game’s crumbling framework. And a long-promised roadmap of the game’s future has been MIA for months.</p>

 <p>Normally, a message from Bungie going, “Hey, we get it, we’re working on fixing things, it’s just going to take some extra time” would be the kind of thing that soothes some of the panic. Instead, <em>Shadow and Order</em>‘s February 18 delay announcement has only made everyone even more worried. “Our next Major Update, <em>Destiny 2: Shadow and Order</em>, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed,” it read. “This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed. </p> <p>This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed. This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. We…</p> <p>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/2024242522004836464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Bungie continued, “This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more. Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April).”</p>

 <p>This will be Greek to most folks, including any lapsed <em>Destiny 2</em> fans that have been out of the loop for the last year, but it essentially suggests the studio is trying to overhaul some of the main loot chase complaints players have had since the current Year of Prophecy launched last July. We don’t get a clear idea of how that progression will be fixed, however, or a sense that Bungie itself knows yet.</p>

 <p>The normal thing for Bungie to do right now would be a developer diary that lays out the team’s evolving design philosophy and explains what the next three months will be spent fixing. Instead, the announcement reads like a grudging, last-minute “the dog ate my homework” acknowledgement following weeks of fans begging for an update. Bungie actually deleted a weekly reset post recently because so many fans were dunking on it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cannot apologize enough for the delay here. Team's still jamming. Hope to have some comms out soon.</p> <p>Please continue to yell at me directly, and I say this without any sarcasm.</p> <p>They're focused on our immediate and long term future.</p> <p>I am happy to take 100% of the blame here in…</p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1985744704886227117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Some have wondered if Bungie is essentially trying to shift the spotlight from <em>Destiny 2</em>, its troubled but already long-established multiplayer hit, to the upcoming launch of <em>Marathon</em>, its first new shooter in over a decade. This way, the bad vibes surrounding the former don’t start contaminating the glowing potential of the latter. Maybe Bungie even hopes more <em>Destiny 2</em> players will give <em>Marathon</em> a shot now that they have nothing new to play for the next three months.</p>

 <p>Maybe, possibly, who knows? Either way, that only buys<em> Destiny 2</em> a little more time before it has to come out and impress players with&nbsp;<em>something</em>. June would normally be the time frame for fans to get excited for the next annual expansion rather than dreading a potential “too little, too late” approach to last year’s leftovers. The fact that the game’s current existential crisis has some players once again wishing for <em>Destiny 3</em> while others go back and re-grind through <em>Destiny 1</em>&nbsp;tells you how cooked things are right now.</p> <p>It doesn’t feel like there’s enough gas left in the tank to reignite the engine, and Bungie not coming out and confidently saying there is only adds to the doomerism.</p>

              <p>More cuts are happening at Ubisoft. The company has confirmed layoffs at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio behind games like <em>Watch Dogs, Splinter Cell Blacklist,</em> and <em>Far Cry 6. </em>But don’t worry, that long-in-development-and-still-totally-happening <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake is fine, okay?</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">as first reported by <em>MobileSyrup</em>,</a> layoffs hit Ubisoft Toronto as the company continues to cut costs as part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">a larger corporate restructure</a>. That process started last year following an infusion of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">$1.25 billion from Tencent</a> that saw the company assume shared control over some of Ubisoft’s key franchises, like <em>Assassin’s Creed.&nbsp;</em>As part of this big shake-up, many Ubisoft devs have been laid off and multiple projects, including a long-in-development remake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,</em></a> have been cancelled. 40 developers were laid off, according to Ubisoft.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that the <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-splinter-cell-being-remade-by-far-cry-6-devs-1848221698">first announced in 2021</a>, was still in active development despite the layoffs. That doesn’t really provide me with any confidence that the game will eventually ship, considering what happened to the <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake earlier this year. And now it will have to be made with even fewer people to help.</p> <p>“Following the recent announcement of the final phase of Ubisoft’s global cost-savings plan and the discontinuation of projects, Ubisoft Toronto will be reducing its workforce by 40 roles. This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected. Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance,” said Ubisoft in a statement shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft also confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that the studio will continue supporting projects such as <em>Rainbow Six</em> as a co-developer. In an internal employees-only email shared with <em>MobileSyrup</em>, the company explained that Ubisoft Toronto will remain a “key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Mario ‘Game’ From Nintendo Lets Kids Torture The Poor Plumber For 12 Minutes At A Time]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-free-mario-game-phone-switch-2-face-head-my-mario-app-kids-2000671322</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mamma mia, there’s a new <em>Mario</em> game available to play today. But before you get too excited, you should know that the just-released<em> Hello, Mario&nbsp;</em>isn’t a 3D or 2D platformer, sports game, or other zany spin-off. Instead, it’s a small app that lets kids play around with Mario’s face until he gets tired and goes to sleep, forcing your child to do something else, like load up TikTok.</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hello-mario-switch/">Nintendo released <em>Hello, Mario</em> on Android, iOS, Switch, and Switch 2</a>. It’s less of a game and more of an interactive digital kids’ toy starring everyone’s favorite hopping plumber, Mario. Or at least his face. Players can yank on different parts of Mario’s head and face to get different reactions while also stretching the famed platformer in odd-looking ways. You can also tap on different parts of his head to give him sunglasses, play peek-a-boo, or even run a comb through his moustache. It’s similar to how you could mess with Mario’s head in <em>Super Mario 64</em>, if a bit less charming.</p>

  <p>At one point, I yanked on Mario’s nose and right ear, pulling them violently in different directions, and he shouted, “Oh, yeah, Mario Time!” I didn’t realize Mario was into this kind of stuff. We learn something new about him in each game, y’know? Anyway, after about 12 minutes, Mario stopped letting me squeeze and pinch his face and went to sleep. This is a feature Nintendo says will help limit screentime for your kids. But you can just do something else on the phone or even restart the app, and he’ll be up and ready to go again.</p> <p><em>Hello, Mario </em>is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/">part of a new brand line from Nintendo called “My Mario.”</a> Here’s how Nintendo describes this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>The My Mario collection is thoughtfully designed to bring smiles to the faces of young children, their parents, and caregivers while inspiring imaginative play. Select items have been developed in collaboration with a range of licensed partners, including Fisher-Price and TOMY.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s nice, but this really just feels like Nintendo trying to turn babies into good, loyal fans of Mario as soon as possible. It reminds me of the stuff Disney and other big media companies have been doing for years now by slapping their characters on baby food, diapers, tiny toys, etc. Get them hooked on some IP before they can even say their first word. Smart business. But also kinda gross.</p>
