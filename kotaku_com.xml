            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bluetooth speaker market overflows with generic black boxes that all sound roughly the same, but <strong>Marshall brings legitimate audio heritage and iconic design</strong> to an over-crowded category. The <em>Acton III</em> just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/">dropped to a record low of $179 for Black Friday’s opening day on Amazon, down from its usual $299 price</a>. Marshall built its reputation on guitar amplifiers that shaped rock and roll for decades, and that audio expertise translates directly into home speakers that sound like music instead of compressed digital mush.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Small Speakers Sound Big</h2>
<p>The Acton III delivers a <strong>wider stereo soundstage compared to the previous generations</strong>, hence giving the impression of sound surpassing the physical speaker cabinet. To achieve better stereo separation in such a compact form factor, Marshall redesigned the internal driver arrangement and acoustic tuning. The signature Marshall sound <strong>emphasizes midrange clarity and controlled bass</strong> which makes vocals and instruments sound present rather than distant. You get to hear details in recordings that cheaper speakers bury under the boomy bass or shrill treble.</p>



<p>Marshall engineered the Acton III to be immediately usable without complicated setup procedures or compulsory app installations. You power on the speaker, toggle on Bluetooth on your phone, select Marshall Acton III from available devices and <strong>start playing music within 30 seconds</strong>. This straightforward approach saves you from frustration over pairing modes, connection failures, or multi-step configuration processes. This speaker remembers your previously paired device and picks up the signal automatically when it comes in range.</p>
<p>Next-generation <strong>Bluetooth 5.2 provides more stable connections with lower latency</strong> than older Bluetooth versions. The improved protocol keeps connections strong even when you walk into other rooms with your phone and reduces audio lag during video playback. Marshall future-proofed the speaker by building in support for Bluetooth features that haven’t been finalized yet, so firmware updates can enable new capabilities as the Bluetooth standard evolves.</p>



<p>The<strong> 3.5mm auxiliary input will accept wired connections</strong> from devices that don’t have Bluetooth or for situations where you want to avoid wireless compression. You can plug in older MP3 players, laptops without Bluetooth, or use the aux input for guaranteed zero-latency audio during gaming or video editing. For purists who prefer wired, analog input bypasses digital processing.</p>
<p>The <strong>top analog control knobs adjust the volume, bass, and treble</strong> with very satisfying tactile feedback-beating tapping on glass touchscreens any day. Boosting the bass for hip-hop or dialing it back down for acoustic is straightforward; you can easily dial in your preferred sound signature. The treble control brightens up vocals and cymbals or tames overly harsh recordings.</p>
<p>At $179, this Black Friday price makes the Marshall Acton III cheaper than many generic Bluetooth speakers that don’t feature the audio engineering, build quality, and design heritage that Marshall has. That 40% discount brings premium audio down to mid-tier pricing, and that wider soundstage combined with Marshall’s signature tuning delivers an experience that justifies the brand’s reputation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="90" data-end="688">Searching for a holiday gift that fits the lifestyle of the fitness lover in your life? Whether your partner prefers long runs, scaling indoor climbing walls, or sticking to a steady gym routine, the right present can show how much you pay attention to what they care about. Right now, thanks to an early Black Friday promotion, you can snag the Google Pixel Watch 4 at a solid discount. The 41mm model usually sits at about $450, but Amazon has it marked down to $350 for a short window. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">That works out to a 22% price cut, putting an extra $100 back in your pocket.</a></p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="924">The Pixel Watch 4 has a clean, polished look while maintaining the practicality people expect from an everyday wearable. You can pick between two display sizes, 41mm or a slightly larger 45mm, depending on preference or wrist size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="926" data-end="1470">The Google smartwatch can act as a personal fitness coach. It can suggest running workouts tailored to your goals, your training history, and how prepared your body is on a given day. Those personalized plans can help runners watch their progress unfold mile after mile, as longer routes and quicker splits start to feel more manageable. You can even design your own workouts, complete with warmups, cooldowns, and pace targets. Saved runs can be revisited anytime so you can track improvements and chase new personal bests.</p>
<p data-start="1472" data-end="1708">Beyond workouts, the watch provides a wide range of useful health metrics, including daily readiness scores, cardio load stats, and the FitBit Morning Brief, which gives you a quick snapshot of your recovery and helps you shape the day ahead.</p>
<p data-start="1710" data-end="1995">With the Pixel Watch 4, you can use offline Google Maps, pay on the go with Google Wallet, and connect it with other Pixel products or smart home gear such as a Google Nest hub with ease.</p>


<h2>Upgrades With the Pixel Watch 4</h2>
<p>The main upgrades we’re seeing on this newest model over the Google Pixel Watch 3 are subtle. First, while it’s hard to tell in the pictures along, the watch now features a curved display. While the Pixel Watch 3 had curved glass as well, the actual screen underneath the Watch 4 is also curved, standing out visually.</p>
<p>You can also expect better battery life with this new model getting you up to 30 hours as a standard when using the always-on display or up to 48 hours when in Batter Saver mode.</p>
<p>And to no one’s surprise, Google is now touting AI features on the Pixel Watch 4 with direct access to Gemini.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-external-hard-drive-drops-to-a-new-record-low-amazon-clears-out-the-4tb-option-2000645709</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-external-hard-drive-drops-to-a-new-record-low-amazon-clears-out-the-4tb-option.1359130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kicked off Black Friday by dropping the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/">Seagate 4TB external hard drive to a record low of $99, down from its usual $124 price</a>. External storage solves the constant problem of running out of space on laptops, game consoles and desktops without requiring you to open up your machine. This 4TB capacity gives you enough room to store your entire game library, backup your computer multiple times, or archive years of photos and videos. The drive’s<strong> universal compatibility with Windows, Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation</strong> means you buy it once and use it everywhere without reformatting or compatibility headaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plug-and-Play Simplicity</h2>
<p>The Seagate 4TB HDD <strong>doesn’t need any software installation or setup process</strong> to get it up and running. You connect the provided 18-inch-long USB 3.0 cable between the drive and your computer, and the OS immediately recognizes it as available storage. Windows users will see the drive pop up in File Explorer; Mac users will find it in Finder; and console gamers can format it via their system settings in roughly 30 seconds. This is true <strong>plug-and-play functionality</strong> with no troublesome proprietary software, driver downloads, or cumbersome setup wizards.</p>



<p>In theory, the USB 3.0 interface can reach transfer speeds of as high as 5Gbps but realistically, <strong>this works out to 100-120MB/s for sequential file transfers</strong>. You can back up your entire photo library in the time it takes to make coffee or transfer 4K video footage without waiting around all afternoon. You will be able to copy a 50GB game in about 7-8 minutes. This speed is more than adequate for directly playing games from the drive on either an Xbox or a PlayStation, though load times will be slower compared to internal SSDs.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact design measures approximately 4.5 inches long by 3 inches wide</strong> and less than an inch thick, so it easily slips into a laptop bag or backpack. Weighing only a few ounces, you hardly know the drive is in the bag when on the move. Finished in matte black to resist fingerprints, it looks professional when plugged into your laptop for home or office use. The rounded edges and smooth surfaces keep the drive from catching on contents inside a bag or scratching other devices. Seagate has engineered the enclosure to shield the internal drive against minor drops and bumps common during normal travel.</p>



<p>The 4TB of capacity offers enough space for <strong>around 1,000 hours of HD video, 80,000 high-resolution photos, or around 50 of the latest AAA games</strong>. Xbox and PlayStation users are able to install their entire game collections and not have to continuously uninstall titles to make room for new releases. Archive completed projects, store raw footage, or maintain multiple backup versions of important files without running out of space on the drive.</p>
<p>In addition, Seagate bundles the drive with one year of <em>Rescue Service</em> which will help you get your data back in case the drive dies or you accidentally delete some important files. That service alone can save you thousands of dollars compared to paying for professional data recovery out of pocket. With decades of experience in the storage business, the company’s drives power everything from consumer devices to enterprise data centers.</p>
<p>At $99, this <strong>Seagate external hard drive costs just 2.4 cents per gigabyte</strong>, which is exceptionally good value for reliable branded storage. Amazon’s Black Friday pricing brings the cost down to where buying cloud storage subscriptions for the same capacity would cost more over two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-ace-anc-headphones-are-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-amazon-clears-out-stock-and-wants-them-all-gone-2000645672</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-ace-anc-headphones-are-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-amazon-clears-out-stock-and-wants-them-all-gone.1359127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s stock counter shows<strong> fewer than 12 units remaining at the time of writing this article</strong> which tells you everything about how fast the Sonos Ace headphones are moving at this Black Friday price. Premium wireless headphones solve the problem of airplane noise, open office chaos and commute soundtrack quality but most flagship models cost a fortune. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/">Sonos Ace just dropped to its lowest price ever at $279 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from the usual $399</a>, which puts them at roughly half the cost of AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Music</h2>
<p>The <strong>Sonos Ace delivers spatial audio via Dolby Atmos</strong> which places instruments and vocals in a three-dimensional soundstage around your head. Dynamic head tracking shifts the audio positioning as you move, so the sound stays anchored to your device rather than rotating with your head. This tech creates an immersive listen that’s almost as if you’re sitting in a recording studio or a concert hall. It works great in those Atmos-mixed tracks on Apple Music or Tidal, where producers have placed elements on purpose in the spatial field.</p>



<p>It’s unusual that Sonos allows for <strong>lossless audio streaming over Bluetooth</strong>; most wireless headphones tend to compress audio to fit within Bluetooth’s bandwidth limitations. The company also uses USB-C connectivity for true lossless playback when you want absolute audio fidelity. This dual approach means you get convenience when you need it and maximum quality when you’re sitting down for critical listening.</p>
<p>The <strong>ANC uses multiple microphones to analyze and neutralize external sounds</strong> across a wide frequency range. Sonos engineered the ANC to handle everything from low-frequency airplane engine drone to mid-range conversation noise. It also adjusts in real time to your surroundings, kicking cancellation harder or softer depending on the ambient noise. Transparency mode lets you hear your surroundings when needed, be it airport announcements or quick conversations.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches 30 hours with ANC enabled</strong> which means you can fly cross-country multiple times before needing a charge. That endurance puts the Ace ahead of most competitors that struggle to hit 20 hours with noise cancellation running. The rapid charging feature gives you three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in, saving you when you forgot to charge overnight. <strong>A full charge takes about three hours via USB-C</strong>&nbsp;and the headphones support charging while listening through the cable.</p>
<p>The physical design focuses on all-day comfort: <strong>plush memory foam ear cushions are wrapped in soft vegan leather</strong>. Sonos shaped the headband and earcups to adapt to various head shapes, hairstyles, and even accessories such as glasses without causing pressure points. An adjustable headband extends smoothly to find that just-right fit, while earcups rotate to keep up with the angle of your head.</p>
<p>At $279, the Sonos Ace costs roughly half what you’d pay for AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones and delivers comparable or superior features in several areas. The fact that Amazon has fewer than 12 units left at this record low price suggests other people have already figured out this value equation.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-is-going-nuts-selling-rog-strix-27-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor-at-a-new-record-low-2000645693</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-is-going-nuts-selling-rog-strix-27%E2%80%B3-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor-at-a-new-record-low.1359070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The fact that this <strong>Asus ROG Strix 27-inch OLED gaming monitor</strong> has never been on sale before makes<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5734/"> this Black Friday drop to an all-time low of $549 (down from $699) on Amazon a big deal</a>. Asus usually sticks to its guns with MSRP on premium ROG monitors but Amazon’s opening day of Black Friday saw deep cuts across the board on everything from the larger 32 and 34-inch models that also reached new all-time lows.</p>
<p>Gaming monitors solve the fundamental problem of seeing what you’re shooting at before your opponent does, and OLED panels take that advantage to another level with instant pixel response and infinite contrast. The ROG Strix XG27AQDMG combines <strong>1440p resolution with 240Hz refresh rate and true 0.03ms response time</strong> in a package that makes everything else look washed out and sluggish.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5734/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED Technology Perfect for Gaming Workloads</h2>
<p>The <strong>26.5-inch WOLED panel offers a resolution of 2560 by 1440</strong>&nbsp;which hits a sweet spot between the lack of detail in 1080p and the demanding GPU of 4K. Third-generation WOLED technology results in brighter white windows and clearer text compared to previous generations of OLED that struggled with full-screen brightness. Each pixel emits its own light and turns fully off for true blacks, creating infinite contrast that makes dark scenes in games actually visible instead of turning into grey mush. The glossy coating maximizes color vibrancy and eliminates the haze that matte coatings introduce, though it does require some attention to room lighting to avoid reflections. The <strong>99% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage</strong> means colors look saturated and accurate without the oversaturation that cheap gaming monitors produce.</p>



<p>The <strong>240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms grey-to-grey response time</strong> eliminates the ghosting and motion blur that plagues slower panels. Your mouse cursor moves across the screen with zero trailing, and fast-paced shooters clearly display enemy movement without smearing, while racing games show track details even at high speeds. This combination of high refresh rate and instant pixel response creates the motion clarity that competitive gamers need to track targets accurately.</p>



<p>ROG’s exclusive OLED Anti-flicker technology <strong>reduces flicker during refresh rate fluctuations</strong> that can cause eye strain during extended gaming sessions. Conventionally, variable refresh rate displays would usually flicker when frame rates change rapidly, but Asus worked out algorithms that would smooth these transitions. The technology works invisibly behind the scenes, maintaining consistent image quality whether you’re getting 240fps or dropping to 120fps during intensive scenes.</p>
<p>Included in the purchase price is <strong>three months of Adobe Creative Cloud access</strong>&nbsp;which adds value if you do any photo editing, graphic design, or video work. The OLED’s perfect blacks and wide color gamut make it excellent for creative work beyond gaming, as it’s able to accurately display the full range of colors that content creators need to see. The 1440p resolution provides enough screen real estate for editing timelines or working with multiple windows without feeling cramped.</p>
<p>At $549, this is the first discount ever on the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG and brings OLED gaming down to prices that previously only got you mid-tier IPS panels. You’re getting third-generation WOLED technology with burn-in protections, 240Hz refresh and instant response times for $150 less than Asus’s asking price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-heros-rival-this-dji-4k-120fps-camera-is-going-for-pocket-change-at-black-friday-2000645668</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-hero%E2%80%99s-rival-this-dji-4k-120fps-camera-is-going-for-pocket-change-this-black-friday.1359067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>GoPro should be looking over its shoulder because DJI has been closing the gap fast in the action camera market over the past few years. The <strong>Osmo Action 5 Pro</strong> goes head-to-head with GoPro’s latest Hero13 Black, and in several areas, it actually pulls ahead. This Black Friday deal on Amazon drops the <em>Essential combo</em> to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/">a record low of $259, down from the usual $339</a>, which undercuts GoPro’s flagship by a decent margin.</p>
<p>Action cameras capture moments your phone can’t handle like mountain biking through trails, surfing big waves, or documenting motorcycle rides where stabilization and durability matter more than megapixels. DJI packed this camera with a massive sensor, advanced stabilization, and dual touchscreens that make it easier to use than the competition.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Sensor That Handles Low Light</h2>
<p>The <strong>Osmo Action 5 Pro features a 1/1.3-inch sensor</strong>, considerably larger than you’d find in most action cameras. It features 2.4-micrometer pixels that pull in more light per pixel to give you usable footage in conditions where other action cameras produce grainy messes. The 13.5-stop dynamic range means you can shoot into bright skies without losing detail in shadows or capture sunset scenes without blowing out the highlights. <strong>DJI’s processing handles 4K video at 120fps</strong> which gives you buttery slow-motion playback to analyze your technique or create dramatic highlight reels. In quick-changing lighting conditions such as moving between shaded forest trails and sunny clearings, this sensor does an excellent job of maintaining consistent exposure.</p>



<p>Subject tracking that actually works in the real world is powered by an advanced 4nm chip. You can set the <strong>camera to track yourself, friends, or even pets</strong> while <strong>shooting in either 16:9 or vertical 9:16 aspect ratios</strong>. Its tracking stays locked on moving subjects with remarkable accuracy, removing that perpetual anxiety of whether I am staying in frame or not. This feature transforms solo content creation because you simply don’t need someone behind the camera following you around.</p>
<p><strong>Voice control</strong> remains on and ready for response within about a meter radius so you can start recording, shoot photos, or stop recording from a distance without touching the camera. This makes sense when you’re skiing, climbing, or doing anything where reaching for buttons breaks your flow. Recognition accuracy handles commands reliably even in moderately noisy environments, though strong winds or loud motors can sometimes throw it off.</p>



<p>The <strong>dual OLED touchscreens on front and back</strong> eradicate that usual action camera frustration: composing shots blind. The front screen means you can frame yourself perfectly for vlogs or selfie shots without having to guess where you’re positioned. Both screens stay bright and readable in direct sunlight, which matters enormously when you try to adjust settings on a sunny beach or snowy mountain. The <strong>touchscreen interface responds quickly and logically,</strong> and makes adjustments of parameters feel natural rather than something you have to commit to memory, along with button combinations.</p>
<p>DJI’s 360° <em>HorizonSteady</em> <strong>stabilization keeps your horizon straight</strong>, no matter how much the camera rotates on the roll axis. You can mount this on your chest, helmet, or handlebars and get footage that’s like it was coming from a gimbal. The stabilization algorithm compensates for sudden jolts, vibrations, and continuous movement while maintaining natural-looking motion.</p>
<p>The 1950mAh battery provides <strong>up to four hours of continuous recording</strong> in normal conditions and impressively keeps 3.6 hours even at negative 20 degrees Celsius. That kind of cold-weather performance puts it ahead of most action cameras, which start dying quickly in freezing temperatures. The <strong>IP68 rating</strong> certifies the camera for depths up to 20 meters without any additional housing, so you can take it snorkeling, surfing, or kayaking without worry.</p>
<p>This Black Friday price of $259 makes the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro substantially cheaper than GoPro’s Hero13 Black with comparable or superior features in several key areas. The larger sensor alone justifies the purchase for anyone who shoots in challenging lighting conditions and the dual OLED screens eliminate the composition guesswork that plagues single-screen action cameras.</p>
