One big step to getting more people playing is that <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will be launching on both Game Pass and PS Plus sometime later this year. </p><p>“This lowers the barrier of entry to try out the game, since millions of Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscribers will have access. Of course, that’s a bit scary because so many players will hopefully be there during the launch window, and we hope the game holds up,” said Puha.</p><p>“It also means there’s financial backing and marketing support for the game from both first parties, which is crucial – especially as Remedy is self-publishing this game across all platforms.”</p><p>A big part of the plan to keep <em>Firebreak</em> from burning out in weeks or months, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shut-down-ending-call-of-duty-cod-june-1851712899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shut-down-ending-call-of-duty-cod-june-1851712899">like<em> Concord</em> or <em>XDefiant</em></a></span>, is to release the upcoming shooter on both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=4526772422648048520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=4526772422648048520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam and Epic</a></span>. Remedy’s last two games arrived exclusively on the Epic Games Store, so this is a shift for the studio and will provide a larger pool of potential players for <em>Firebreak </em>at launch. Remedy plans to sell <em>Firebreak</em> as a “mid-priced” shooter and not a full $60 or $70 game, which will likely help it build an audience faster on PC.</p><p> The <em>Alan Wake</em> studio is also committed to making sure <em>Firebreak </em>has full cross-platform matchmaking across consoles and PC. </p><p>And another important part of Remedy’s plan is to keep<em> FBC: Firebreak</em>’s minimum specs on PC “reasonable.”<em> Alan Wake 2</em> was a very pretty game, but it pushed computers and consoles and led to performance problems. The goal is to avoid that with <em>Firebreak</em>. </p><p> “We’ll still have great graphics and visual effects, all that you expect from Remedy, but in a multiplayer experience like this, framerate is king as well as the responsiveness of the controls,” explained Puha. </p><p>While there’s no guarantee that <em>Firebreak </em>will be able to succeed where so many other online shooters have failed, it’s good to see a studio being smart and realistic about the video game market. It’d be nice if we could assume that really good games will always sell well but that’s just not the case, and Remedy seems well aware of that, and is trying everything to avoid making the next big multiplayer flop. </p><p><em>FBC Firebreak </em>arrives sometime in 2025 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Probably, but it’s hard to tell at the moment. All Nintendo released today when announcing the collaboration was a 15-second teaser and a release window of October 2025. Otherwise no price, no description, not even a glimpse of the finished product outside of the single D-pad brick. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/looks-like-legos-making-a-brick-built-nes-that-plays-ma-1844361085?_gl=1*9eutxa*_ga*MTM0Mjk0ODIxMC4xNjkxNzY3NjQ2*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ1NDk5NS45NS4xLjE3MzY0NTY3NzEuNDkuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/looks-like-legos-making-a-brick-built-nes-that-plays-ma-1844361085?_gl=1*9eutxa*_ga*MTM0Mjk0ODIxMC4xNjkxNzY3NjQ2*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ1NDk5NS45NS4xLjE3MzY0NTY3NzEuNDkuMC4w">The last Lego Nintendo system</a></span> was the NES, which released in 2020. That set’s replica console, game cartridge, controller, and TV consisted of 2,646 bricks with a price tag of $200. I imagine the Game Boy set will be somewhat smaller and potentially cheaper as a result. After all, you can get an actual Nintendo Switch Lite that plays actual Game Boy games for $200. </p><p>Which raises another question. Will the Lego Game Boy play actual games? None of the other Lego consoles have, not the replica Atari 2600 and not the <em>Pac-Man</em> arcade machine. And actually running <em>Tetris</em> would require a screen, an emulation device of some kind, and a battery pack. So probably not. </p><p>Still, the Lego Game Boy is coming at the perfect moment to capitalize on retro handheld nostalgia.

All that is well and good, but the most important addition to the game isn’t a new map, mode, or playable character. It’s a ghost dog who is hanging out in the hero shooter’s recreation of New York.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194513" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blade’s Book Club Is The Best Thing About Marvel’s Midnight Suns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="192" data-playlist="194513,197298,197284" data-current="194513"><div><p>Blade’s Book Club Is The Best Thing About Marvel’s Midnight Suns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19959.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Bats is, or…was a basset hound that Doctor Strange cared for. The ol’ dog was introduced in the 2017 <em>Doctor Strange </em>comics as the sorcerer’s pet. Strange cast an enchantment on Bats allowing him to communicate with people, but this was short-lived as the dog soon passed away due to a heart attack after a confrontation with Loki. Bats would later return to Strange’s side as a ghost, however, maintaining his speech capabilities and acting as the hero’s companion.</p><p>In the trailer for <em>Marvel Rivals’</em> new season, which includes a map based on Doctor Strange’s base of operations, NetEase teased that Bats would make an appearance, and now that some players are exploring the inner halls of the Sanctum Santorum, it’s been revealed that Bat hangs out in the lobby.</p><p>I’m a casual Marvel fan and most of my exposure to its heroes comes from the MCU and video games, so I had no idea that Bats existed until recently. It seems like that’s the case for a lot of <em>Rivals </em>fans who are also finding out about the ghost dog’s existence through the shooter. Longtime comic fans are excited to see a more niche side of the Marvel universe represented. I just met Bats but I would die for him, and seeing so many fans share cute moments between him and Marvel heroes has endeared him to me real quick. Also, he’s a Spider-Man fanboy? NetEase, please put in some kind of interaction between the two if a Spidey player is in the room with him.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>has a pretty expansive roster already, but within its maps and lore drops, it’s found ways to integrate other characters beyond the ones pushing payloads and capturing objectives. So thank you to NetEase for bringing Bats into my life. Let me pet him in the spawn room.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">check out <em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
