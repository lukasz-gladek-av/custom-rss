Leading up to launch, fans were hoping developer BioWare would put the creation suite out ahead of the game itself so we would have time to mess around with it in advance, and jump right into the game itself on launch. BioWare didn’t do that, but the studio is finally releasing the character creator for free as part of today’s officially unofficial “Dragon Age Day” on December 4.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194028" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Umbran Witch Suplex" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="163" data-playlist="194028,193348,194066" data-current="194028"><div><p>The Week In Games: Umbran Witch Suplex</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19503.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The standalone app is available on all platforms, and any characters you create are transferable to the full version of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>as long as you buy the game on the same platform. So you can’t use the free character creator on PC and transfer your characters to console or vice versa. The free version has no time limit, so tweak to your heart’s content. However, also keep in mind that you can update your appearance any time during the game. Well, Rook’s, anyway. You can’t revise your Inquisitor’s appearance throughout, and you won’t see them until several hours in, so by the time you know something is wrong it’s too late to go back. So maybe spend a little extra time with them if that’s a concern.</p><p>Customizing Rook’s appearance is one thing, but you’ll also have to choose your class and faction, as well.

It’s a dangerous area, filled with bandits and Snorks. My first time setting foot outside the Army Warehouse was pitch-black, and a small horde of Snorks ambushed me from all sides. It was one of the most terrifying gun battles of my playthrough. But in the end, I prevailed and walked away with the Lullaby.</p><h2 id="h33468"><a id=""></a>Where To Get The Lullaby Unique Assault Rifle</h2><figure id="" data-id="b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-recommend-id="image://b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-recommend-id="image://b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I initially learned about the location of Lullaby, I thought its proximity to the Lesser Zone would mean a cakewalk compared to the Riemann SMG up north. I was incorrect, though. You see, the Chemical Plant is filled with enemies, and due to the A-Life quirks, they continuously spawn. By the time I clambered through the upstairs window to open the Journalist’s Stash to acquire the Lullaby, two more bandit groups and another small horde of Snorks spawned and were fighting in the streets below.</p><p>But for now, let’s focus on acquiring the unique assault rifle. To get it, start by climbing up the truck outside the front entrance until you’re aligned with the second floor, then hop across to the awning hanging over the front door. From here, mantle over the windowsill and into the second-floor hallway. </p><figure id="" data-id="49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-recommend-id="image://49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-recommend-id="image://49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll end up in front of a locked gate leading to the first floor. Ignore this for now, but turn left down the hall and enter the last room on the left-hand side. It’s the one with the hole in the exterior wall. You’ll find the stash with Lullaby inside the back corner of the room.</p><p>Once you have the weapon, leave the area immediately. Enemies will continuously spawn around the corner and across the bridge, pinning you between warring factions as you attempt to evacuate. Oh, and Lullaby is heavy, so it may weigh you down and force you to walk out of the area instead of running.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-weapon-upgrade-attachment-repair-broken-1851707644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-weapon-upgrade-attachment-repair-broken-1851707644">Don’t Let Your Weapons Decay If You Want To Survive <em>Stalker 2</em></a></span></p><p>Of course, once you have Lullaby and any other unique weapons you want to wield, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-weapon-upgrade-attachment-repair-broken-1851707644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-weapon-upgrade-attachment-repair-broken-1851707644">don’t forget to maintain them</a></span>.
