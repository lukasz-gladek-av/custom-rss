But <em>Rivals</em> uses it differently from what you might expect. The game uses Ace two separate ways. One refers to more of a title or status, while the other refers to a specific gameplay situation. The identical naming has certainly caused some confusion for players. </p><h2 id="h4982"><a id="score"></a>What does ‘Ace’ mean on a scoreboard?</h2><p>The first usage of Ace you’ll likely see is on the scoreboard. Check in midway through a match, and you’ll see one player on each team with the word displayed over their character portrait. <strong>Whichever player has the Ace term is essentially the one performing the best.</strong> If they keep the title throughout the match, they’ll likely be who you see as the MVP or SVP. Those familiar with <em>Overwatch</em> will recognize this as similar to the On Fire system.</p><p>The scoreboard is pretty minimal on details for other players otherwise. If you’re wondering how Ace is determined and why someone with fewer kills than you has the title, it’s likely because they made up for it with better heals, more blocked damage, or more time on the objective.</p><h2 id="h4983"><a id="kill"></a>How to get an ‘Ace Kill’</h2><figure id="" data-id="04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-recommend-id="image://04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-recommend-id="image://04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll also see the term pop up in the middle of your screen during a match sometimes. <strong>It’s a little awkward, but Ace is also used as the name of <em>Marvel Rival</em>’s version of a team kill.</strong> Don’t worry, it’s not like you have to solo the whole team yourself. You’ll be notified that an Ace occurred even if you’re walking back from the respawn area.</p><p>Of course, actively participating and taking out most of the enemy team does feel pretty great. The best way to do this is to work together with your teammates and coordinate your attacks. That’s easier when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183">playing with friends</a></span>, but the Ping system is still useful for relaying information. Having one person immobilize the opponents while someone else picks them off is always a great strategy. Making a move when the other team is all concentrated in one area is also a wonderful opportunity to make use of.</p><p><strong>The easiest way to get an Ace kill is to use ultimate abilities at the right moment.</strong> Most will dish out a lot of damage quickly or over a large area. Be smart with them and you can KO multiple players in one go. The following are ones that I’ve seen lead to an Ace kill the most often:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">Jeff The Land Shark</a></span> – It’s Jeff!</li><li>Moon Knight – Hand of Khonshu</li><li>Psylocke – Dance of the Butterfly</li><li>Scarlet Witch – Reality Erasure</li><li>Spider-Man – Spectacular Spin</li><li>Storm – Omega Hurricane</li></ul><p>We don’t know if Ace will remain the name for these two situations in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>as the game continues to receive updates. Gaining the Ace status on the scoreboard after helping to get an unrelated-in-name Ace kill is pretty confusing. Either way, I hope you can come away from this with a better understanding of both.

I’m most excited, however, to mess around with the huge range of new possibilities for the Grass decks, combining Serperior and Exeggutor. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-new-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-mythical-isla-1851722781?rev=1734447333147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-new-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-mythical-isla-1851722781?rev=1734447333147">We have a full guide for these new cards</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-recommend-id="image://deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-recommend-id="image://deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Those 18 secret rares offer some stunning art to find, too. My son somehow already hit the alt-art Marshadow <em>and</em> Salandit, although we’re both primarily chasing the astonishing Serperior. There are also lovely alts for Mew ex, Celebi ex, and the most stunning lithograph-style rendering of Aerodactyl ex. It is, yet again, agony that these are not real-world cards to add to a binder.</p><p>You’ll also want to dig into the offline challenges, since—as mentioned—there’s hourglasses in them there hills. Hit Battle, Solo, and then the Step-Up Battle at Advanced level, and then the tiny “Expansions” button top-right, and you’ll be able to select a series of unlocking new challenges to pit yourself against decks designed around the newer cards. The same goes for the Expert Solo Battles. Why is it hidden like this? Why isn’t it mentioned in the news updates? I wish I knew. But still, this’ll allow you to open a few more packs when completed.</p><figure id="" data-id="b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-recommend-id="image://b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1008" data-height="1930" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-recommend-id="image://b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1008" data-height="1930" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It does seem like the new set might have not only been a surprise for players, but also the app’s designers, since the UI has somehow become even more abysmal as a result. If you want to see your Mythical Island collection, you have no choice but to scroll down through your Genetic Apex cards to find where they’ve been peculiarly inserted between GA’s secret rares and Promo-A cards. And if you don’t toggle the switch at the top to show missing card spaces, they’re not even given their own delineated section! It’s as if the developers set out to do the precise opposite of what anyone playing would expect or desire.</p><p>Things are slightly more sensible on the Home screen, although only after you’ve fiddled. When you open up the app for the first time today, you’ll see just a Mythical Island pack as an option, and might fear Genetic Apex has suddenly gone away. Not so, but you’ll need to tap on the pack (because god forbid this app <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">put options to do things that are nothing to do with opening a pack</a></span> anywhere other than on the screen for opening a pack), and then the faint button bottom-right that says “Select other booster packs.” Do this, pick a GA pack, and when you return to the Home screen you’ll <em>now</em> have the option to pick from either. Great work, everyone!</p><p>As poorly implemented as so much of this may be, it’s still a real pleasure to see Mythical Island added, especially given how many Pack Hourglasses are up for grabs in the (buried) new challenges. It’s fun to tear a bunch of packs open in a day, especially when gathering even the Basics makes for some major updates to your decks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But if you just can’t wait, you can buy an Early Access pack now and get started. But you may have some questions first, such as whether the game provides crossplay or cross-progression features. That’s fair, so let’s take a look and see!</p><h2 id="h4354"><a id="crossplay"></a>Does Path of Exile 2 have crossplay?</h2><p>One of the best parts of playing an action-RPG like <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is beating the hell out of monsters with your friends. Luckily, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> features multiplayer with up to six players in a party, meaning you can dive in with quite a few pals at once. </p><p>But what if your friends are on another platform? No worries! <strong><em>Path of Exile 2</em> has full crossplay across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PC</strong>. This means you can easily link up with friends regardless of which platform they choose to play the game on. </p><p>That’s great for playing with friends on different machines. But what if you want to switch up platforms yourself? </p><h2 id="h4355"><a id="crossprogression"></a>Does Path of Exile 2 have cross-progression?</h2><figure id="" data-id="5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-recommend-id="image://5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-recommend-id="image://5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is a long-term game with so much content coming down the line, it’s reasonable to want to play it on multiple platforms based on your day-to-day whims. Perhaps you want to play it on PC during the day and then run it on your PlayStation Portal in bed later that night. Well, there’s some good news for you if you find yourself in such a situation.</p><p><strong><em>Path of Exile 2</em> features cross-progression across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC</strong>. So, if you want to play across multiple platforms, you’ll have no problems doing so! </p><p>There is one caveat, though: <strong>You’ll need to purchase the Early Access version on each platform separately if you want to play during this early period of the game</strong>. However, once the game enters its full free-to-play release, you’ll be able to hop between platforms with no purchases necessary.</p><p><em>Path of Exile 2</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC in Early Access, so get out there and start wailing away on those baddies.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But some heroes can just shut down several ultimates in the game; it’s just a matter of timing, precision, and situational awareness to ensure it’s worth the risk when you could, instead, just run away.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193348" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="223" data-playlist="193348,197298,197284" data-current="193348"><div><p>God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18794.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have been trying out several of the game’s stun-based abilities against different ultimates, and discovered that several heroes on the roster can deny enemy players all that value with the press of a button. Some of them are pretty simple, such as Luna Snow freezing Scarlet Witch out of her Reality Erasure attack.</p><p>Others require much more precision and game sense, like using Cloak &amp; Dagger’s Dark Teleportation ability to briefly make your team invulnerable right as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">noted menace Jeff the Land Shark</a></span> tries to gobble them up and spit them off the map.</p><p>Timing really is everything with some of these strategies. Several heroes’ ultimate abilities have a brief startup animation before they get real crazy and can’t be stopped. Characters with crowd control abilities, like Wolverine and Peni Parker, can stop most ults if they strike just before the enemy executes the attack, and doing so will often come down to the stars aligning. The ability can’t be on cooldown, of course, and you have to have the perfect line of sight to strike. But if you’re going to play heroes who have that utility, it’s a good skill to have in your arsenal.</p><p>A lot of these shutdowns will become second nature as you memorize ultimate voice lines and are on the receiving end of every attack. Anticipating when your foe’s about to drop theirs is a big part of canceling a possible team wipe. This also comes with time, as you’ll get a sense of when enemies have likely racked up enough damage or healing to charge their ultimate. Then you’ll know what positioning to look for as enemies set up their attacks. You’ll see an Iron Man who tries to flank your team to surprise you with an Invincible Pulse Cannon, for instance, or Thor leaping into the air before he slams his hammer down. You can spend some time in the training range to see what abilities you can actually stop, but nothing will replace the practice of getting into casual matches and trying them out naturally. Then you’ll be ready to take those skills into competitive play.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">check out <em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
