              <p>A TikTok content creator allegedly flew all the way from the United States to Edinburgh, Scotland to stand outside the offices of <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> developers Rockstar North and yell at people entering and exiting the studio. According to the creator, he is “sick and tired” of waiting for a new trailer or information on any further delays.</p> <p>On September 30, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-devs-harassed-by-tiktoker/">as spotted by </a><em>TheGamer,</em> TikTok user Backonboulevard shared a video on the social media service that appeared to show him staking out the Rockstar North office in Scotland and then yelling at two different people that he seemingly assumed were developers working on<em> GTA 6</em> after spotting them entering and exiting the building. The video has over 140,000 views and is currently pinned on the TikTok user’s channel.</p>

 <p>In the first incident, a person can be seen walking toward the office when Backonboulevard yells at them: “When’s the delay? When’s the next trailer? I wanna know!” The person shrugs, starts walking away quickly, and replies, “I don’t know.”</p>

   <p>In another incident shown in the video, Backonboulevard seemingly follows a person after they have presumably left the office and shouts at them, asking: “When’s the delay happening? Is there another delay? What about the trailer? Another trailer? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me nothing?” That person looks visibly scared and understandably nervous about a random dude aggressively confronting them in the dark, and quickly flees the scene as the TikTok creator follows before the video cuts.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted the TikTok user about the video and reached out to Rockstar Games.</p> <p>“I’m sick and tired of waiting for the answers,” explained Backonboulevard in the video. At another point, he showed the outside of Rockstar North’s offices to prove he was there. “Right now we are here, right here, live from Rockstar North. I told you guys I wasn’t playing around.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1973022044251152503">On Tuesday, the video was flagged by <em>GTA</em> content creator GameRoll on Twitter</a>. “If you’re waiting outside of somebody’s workplace to harass employees over a video game, give your head a wobble,” said GameRoll.</p> <p>While many in the comments below GameRoll’s post shared disbelief and anger over what Backonboulevard seemingly did, there are many, many comments below the original video on TikTok that take the creator’s side and blame Rockstar’s lack of information and new trailers for the harassment. And to be clear: That’s fucking stupid and you should never, ever, ever sit outside a video game studio and harass the people inside and demand answers from them. That will never work out, it might get you in trouble legally, and it’s just a dick move.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch in May 2026 <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">after being delayed earlier this year</a>. It will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Don’t yell at the devs about it, okay?</p>

              <p>Peacemaker’s dance emote will return to <em>Fortnite</em> now that Epic Games is satisfied it had nothing to do with Nazi imagery. Following the reveal of the HBO show’s recent season 2 twist, the company implied it was concerned the dance moves<a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842"> intentionally recreated a swastika</a>. The emote will now return next week, with modified animations.</p> <p>“We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current <em>Peacemaker</em> storyline,” the<em> Fortnite</em> account on X posted on Wednesday. “To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI">https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI</a> <a href="https://t.co/CnsrL8QL7t">pic.twitter.com/CnsrL8QL7t</a></p> <p>— Leryensu (@iLegendTz) <a href="https://twitter.com/iLegendTz/status/1973484250289807592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> we’re about to mention some major plot points from <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2.</p> <p>This whole thing started after the alternate universe that John Cena’s Chris Smith has been exploring this season was revealed to be one in which Hitler’s Germany won WWII and America is now run by Nazis. If you then went back and looked at the&nbsp; dance in the Peaceful Hips <em>Fortnite</em> emote, which is supposed to be the one Cena does in the season 2 intro, you can sort of see that maybe there’s a swastika in there somewhere if you overlay multiple freeze frames.</p> <p>Epic Games then pulled the emote and said it would investigate to see if this had been done by someone at Warner Bros. on purpose. It seems the company is now satisfied that it was just an unintended coincidence. But what fans really want to know is if the dance will actually sync up to the music this time the way it’s choreographed in the show. We’ll know when the emote returns during <em>Fortnite</em>‘s reset next week on October 9.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is nearly upon us. The RPG is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16, and that means copies are going to ship out to stores any day now. It also means that it’s entirely possible for people to get their hands on the game early, and it appears someone has broken the seal on that, as </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1973230039698424098">leaker accounts are scrambling</a> after what seems to be an early copy has been seen on 4chan.</span></p> <p><span>While it’s not out of the question that this could be an elaborate hoax, a 4chan user posted an image of what appears to be </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s character customization screen running on a Switch. The screen shows eight default character appearances and tells the player to pick which one will act as their base to customize later. A leaker who goes by the username BallGuy has posted confirmed information about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>before and has corroborated the customization screen’s authenticity, saying it matches one they have seen.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨🚨🚨WARNING🚨🚨🚨</p> <p>A Picture has surfaced on 4chan alleging they have Pokémon Legends ZA running on Nintendo Switch on the character select screen <a href="https://t.co/AyBL44CgOl">pic.twitter.com/AyBL44CgOl</a></p> <p>— Pory (@pory_leeks) <a href="https://twitter.com/pory_leeks/status/1973218325200343306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community is tenacious when it comes to leaks and while they’re also often good about keeping them in designated channels, if you’re at all worried about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> spoilers, you might want to start muting some key terms on social media or just logging off. Descriptions of several </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>new Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> that are coming to the RPG have been circulating for months, so we’ll likely see images of them sprouting up online in the coming days or weeks as early players seek them out. It’s also possible that there might still be some surprises in store, even for those of us who have seen the list of supposed new Megas. The </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is adding </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>two Mega Raichu forms</span></a><span> that weren’t leaked ahead of time, so there’s probably more coming that we don’t know about yet.</span></p>
