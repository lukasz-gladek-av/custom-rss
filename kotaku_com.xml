            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-is-fine-but-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-is-one-1839230688"><em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em></a> was sneakily one of the best RPGs of 2016. Almost a decade later, its long-awaited successor is mounting another lowkey coup in a genre that’s only gotten more competitive in the years since. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> plays like a very traditional turn-based role-playing game in all of my favorite ways while bringing multiple generational leaps’ worth of technical upgrades to a spin-off series whose last entries were built for PS Vita. It feels like the <em>Persona</em>-style glow-up many <em>Pokémon</em> fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>At PAX West last week I had the chance to play over 90 minutes of <em>Digimon Story: Time</em> <em>Stranger</em>, which comes to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 3, and the latest Bandai Namco-published creature fighter from veteran RPG maker Media Vision did not disappoint. Things already seemed good coming out of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677">Summer Game Fest demo</a> earlier this summer and a deeper dive only firmed up the sense that the game, first announced eight years ago, can meet the increasing expectations surrounding <em>Digimon Story</em>‘s return.</p> <p>The latest session let me play the start of the game before later shifting to a much more advanced segment over a dozen hours into the adventure. You play as a secret agent working for the ADAMAS organization investigating ominous anomalies in Tokyo that seem to be linked to social upheaval. The <em>Digimon Story</em> games have always had an emphasis on compelling conversations and background intrigue, which <em>Cyber Sleuth</em> took to the next level with a narrative that felt like more than just a means to an end of raising virtual pets.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624121"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624121">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>What I played of <em>Time Stranger</em> continues that with English voice acting and more polished cinematic animations, coupled with an unusually stellar soundtrack. Are there extremely goofy moments too? Absolutely. I’ve already witnessed half a dozen snippets that I can’t wait to send to folks in the group chat who have not interacted with <em>Digimon</em> since it debuted in the West on Fox Kids back in 1999. Watching familiar RPG tropes reenacted by absurd-looking creatures that speak like humans is an acquired taste, but <em>Time Stranger</em> does an admirable job.</p> <p>Eerie anime vibes established, my early tutorial section eventually transitioned to a later stretch set in the Digimon world’s colorful seaside Abyss Area which felt oddly reminiscent of<em> Chrono Cross</em>‘ tropical archipelago. Here, <em>Time Stranger</em>‘s bread and butter took center stage: fighting, collecting, and growing your Digimon. There’s the combat triangle between Data, Virus, and Vaccine type Digimon, elemental weaknesses, and a swapping system that lets you use different Digimon on the fly if your current team doesn’t have the right build.</p>

 <p>Building meter during battle also lets you unleash an ultimate attack to deal extra damage or buff your team. It’s a nimble set of mechanics that helps turn-based battles shine, forcing you to think about what you’re doing and adapt on the fly without getting bogged down in too much minutiae. It’s definitely old-school but more satisfying than just mashing the same set of attacks over and over again. If things do start to get repetitive, a fast-forward button helps bypass the boring bits. Defeat a Digimon enough times and you get a 100 percent scan rate to create your own, or you can wait for a 200 percent scan rate to get an even stronger version of it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624122"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624122">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Outside of combat, the main focus remains on Digivolving and De-Digivolving your pals. The first makes them more powerful while the second makes them weaker again in the short term to raise their long-term potential. Aiding this convoluted process is the DigiFarm system which lets you tweak the new personalities of your Digimon to change which stats grow the fastest. Certain personalities are also required to Digivolve or De-Digivolve specific Digimon along with player rank and relationship status. Consumable items and training sessions let you speed up this process too.</p>

 <p>There’s also an entire character skill tree full of perks that provide extra bonuses to your team depending on a Digimon’s specific relationship with you and their personality type, though I didn’t get to see how these systems feel over the long haul. Do they feel balanced? Do they get tedious? Is it too streamlined or too convoluted? But I certainly came away with the impression that <em>Time Stranger</em> has a great foundation to work with.</p> <p>Will it hold up over a 40-50 hour adventure? Is it well paced? Does the story end up going somewhere cool even if you’re not a dyed-in-the-wool <em>Digimon</em> sicko? Only the full, finished game can answer those questions. So far, however, the successor to <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em> continues to look like it’s making smart choices and pushing the series forward. It could easily be overshadowed next month by <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> but it doesn’t deserve to be. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> should be on every RPG fan’s radar, whether they’ve been keeping up with the franchise or not.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong%E2%80%99s-most-popular-mods-are-all-about-making-the-game-easier.1291866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></a>is out. Did you know that? You probably pieced that together. After seven years of waiting, Team Cherry’s long-awaited 2D action-platformer is here and kicking people’s asses. But on PC, thousands of players are using mods to help them overcome the challenging game.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> released late last week on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC after nearly a decade of waiting. And first reactions to the sequel are almost entirely positive, with fans loving the small tweaks to the<em> Hollow Knight</em> formula and the larger size of its world. Plus, that $20 price tag is nice in an era when everything is more expensive than ever. And <em>Silksong</em>, like <em>Hollow Knight</em>, isn’t the easiest game in the world. Many players are even claiming that <em>Silksong</em> is harder than the OG. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">This has led to a lot of discourse on the internet about how hard it is or isn’t, and about game difficulty in general</a>. But if you’re playing on PC, there’s a solution: Just mod <em>Silksong</em> and make it easier.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong?modSort=popular">If we hop over to <em>Silksong’s</em> mods hub over at <em>NexusMods</em></a>, a popular PC modding site, you can see there are already 60+ mods available for the recently released platformer. And many of the most popular mods available for the game make it much easier to play. The most popular mods for <em>Silksong</em> include one that adds health meters to enemies, another one that stops enemies from doing double damage to the player, and one that shows the player’s position on the map at all times. All of these mods have over 15,000 downloads. An automapping mod has 9,000 downloads. Another free PC mod that increases how much damage players deal to enemies has over 7,000 downloads.</p>

 <p>In fact, the only mod more popular than all of these mods that make <em>Silksong</em> easier is the mod needed to run any of these other creations. That mod, “BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager,” has over 28,000 downloads as of September 8. That’s a lot of downloads for a game that’s barely been out a week. Of course, not all the mods for <em>Silksong</em> are about making it easier. But those mods, like one that adds ultrawide support and a death counter, only have a few hundred downloads or fewer.</p> <p>It seems that the people coming to <em>NexusMods</em> for <em>Silksong</em> mods mostly have one goal in mind: Make the game less challenging. I expect reactions to this will vary a lot, but personally, I land on the side of “If folks want to make a game easier or harder with mods, and it doesn’t ruin it for other people, then whatever.” But I’ve been on the web long enough to know that ain’t a universal take.</p>

              <p>Best Buy is liquidating its warehouse with a big clearance sale on an oddball assortment of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch physical games</a>. However, to find deals worth potentially grabbing, you’ll have to dig through some gunk and a lot of sports games from a year ago to find some good games worth adding to your collection.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1964929126176866311">As spotted by the internet’s favorite deals guru, Wario64,</a> Best Buy is currently holding <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?browsedCategory=pcmcat1487698928729&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;loc=1719813&amp;qp=currentoffers_facet%3DCurrent+Deals%7EClearance%5Esoldout_facet%3DAvailability%7EExclude+Out+of+Stock+Items&amp;ref=388&amp;sp=Price-Low-To-High&amp;st=categoryid%24pcmcat1487698928729">a large video game clearance sale online and in stores</a> around the country. Is this more evidence that Best Buy, like other retailers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-buy-dvd-blu-ray-games-sales-stop-2024-1851136668">is looking to exit the physical video game space</a> and just fill stores up with more cellphones, old Funko Pops, and fridges? Perhaps, but regardless of why these games are on sale, they are cheaper than normal, and you get a physical copy, too. You can add these to your library or even pass down a copy of <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> or <em>Diablo IV</em> to your grandkids.</p> <p>Anyway, we dug through the junk to find some of the best games and biggest deals currently available via the Best Buy clearance sale. Keep in mind these might sell out at any time so this list might be out of date by the time you see it. Also, many games are only on sale on a specific platform, which we have listed below next to the usual price and the new sale price.</p> <ul> <li><em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> – Xbox – $8 ($15)</li> <li><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Next Level Edition</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Redfall</em> – Xbox – $10 ($70)</li> <li><em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Midnight Suns Enhanced Edition</em> – Xbox – $12 ($20)</li> <li><em>Deathloop</em> – PS5 – $13 ($60)</li> <li><em>Sponge SquarePants A Patrick Star Game</em> – $16 ($20)</li> <li><em>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</em> – Xbox – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Diablo IV</em> – PS5 – $25 ($70)</li> <li><em>Core Keeper</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Smurfs Village Party</em> – PS5 – $21 ($40)</li> <li><em>Super Bomberman R 2</em> – PS5 – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>Samba de Amigo: Party Central</em> – Switch – $24 ($40)</li> <li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> – Xbox – $26 ($50)</li> <li><em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII: Reunion</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>NFS Unbound</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS5 – $32 ($40)</li> <li><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em> – Xbox – $31 ($70)</li> </ul> <p>And yeah, <em>Redfall</em> wasn’t a great game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-redfall-offline-update-4-arkane-austin-1851484821">but it got an offline mode not that long ago</a> and is easily worth $10 if you are hankering for a vampire-themed RPG shooter this Halloween season.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-star-trek-tng-enterprise-price-release-date-2000624069</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-finally-announced-a-star-trek-set-i%E2%80%99m-willing-to-mortgage-my-house-for.1291740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have we hit peak licensed Lego set? Maybe. The brick builder toy maker has been releasing more and more elaborate sets based on famous franchises at higher and higher prices. The new Lego Death Star <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-death-star-1000-most-expensive-set-star-wars-size-release-date-2000623168">will be $1,000</a>. What fools would pay that much for plastic? But now Lego has teased an upcoming <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> set that’s probably the Enterprise-D and now <a href="https://youtu.be/nF-SR2UwGQ8?si=EEuRI0PGtYYUfzYw">I am that fool</a>.</p> <p>That’s because on Monday, Lego teased a new collaboration with <em>Star Trek</em> that saw Patrick Stewart’s Captain Jean-Luc Picard beamed into the Enterprise-D as a Lego figurine. Every nostalgic licensed cash-in seems silly until they finally find the one you can’t live without. A <em>Star Trek: TNG</em> Enterprise is about as close to that for me as you can get. I’m not saying I would make poor choices with my family’s finances to make whatever this set is show up on my doorstop at some point, but I’m not saying I wouldn’t either.</p>   <p>While an Enterprise-D Lego set seems like a sure bet with this tease out there, leaks from last month have only fueled fan speculation. Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1mfzqbr/icons_10356_star_trek_uss_enterprise_d_via_4chan/">a 4chan leak</a> of the images, which may or may not be accurate but certainly looked convincing, the set will be 3600 pieces and ship November 28 for $400. Fans will get the Enterprise plus mini-figures of Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Data, Dr. Crusher, Wesley Crusher, Troi, and Guinan.</p>   <p>The Enterprise-D is the only toy model I ever put together and it’s the only Lego set I’d ever consider spending $400 on. But it’s not the only <em>Star Trek</em> set I’d get out my wallet for. A Klingon Bird of Prey? A Romulan Warbird? Don’t get me started on the Borg Cube. I would, in time, buy and build them all. The best part? Because it’s Lego I can create my very own three-nacelle Enterprise from the <em>TNG</em> series finale “All Good Things.” Fine. You win Lego. Make it so!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-wifi-6-mesh-3-pack-drops-below-prime-day-pricing-cheaper-than-buying-singles-2000623518</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A sketchy home Wi-Fi system will drive you nuts in so many ways. Streaming fails, sudden lag fits during an intense gaming session, and those awful dead spots that somehow seem to move around the house — they all mean your home network is outdated or just too weak to give you a strong signal throughout the house.</p>
<p>A mesh Wi-Fi network is the answer — one hardwired mothership and two wireless beacons render your old router and extenders moot and give you a powerful, consistent signal everywhere. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/">Right now Amazon is running a great $140 sale on the TP-Link Deco X55 AX3000 Wi-Fi 6 mesh system</a>, which blankets up to 6,500 square feet in a signal strong enough to banish those dead spots and eliminate those laggy streaming and gaming sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose the Boosters</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi boosters and wall-outlet range extenders were the best weapons against Wi-Fi dead spots and weak signals for years, but even at their best they only gave you marginal relief. As both Wi-Fi and the devices that rely on Wi-Fi evolved, those boosters and extenders fell way behind the times, and the mesh network stepped up to take on the fight.</p>
<p>TP-Link was one of the early adopters of mesh technology, and this is one of their better systems at an exceptional price. Each one of the 3 units has three Gigabit ports if you want or need to hardwire, and the easy-to-install network supports up to 150 devices to ensure you’re not experiencing web traffic jams when everyone logs in at the same time. The difference you’ll immediately experience is huge&nbsp; — speeds of up to 3,000Mbps, with TP-Link’s AI-Driven Smart Mesh technology that learns your network environment and user behaviors and adjusts on the fly to optimize your signal.</p>



<h2>Bigger and Safer</h2>
<p>The 6,500 square foot range of the TP-Link Deco X55 network is enough to cover most homes and often backyards or garages in a powerful signal. But if your home or property outstretch that coverage, adding another TP-Link Deco beacon is an inexpensive and amazingly easy solution — just plug it in and the network immediately adds it, and your signal and coverage grow.</p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco X55 mesh network is also sure to upgrade your home internet security, with a real-time network scanner that automatically detects threats, robust and easy to operate parental controls, and for an extra $6 per month or $55 per year you can install TP-Link’s HomeShield Pro service for DDoS attack prevention, advanced parental controls, and more.</p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco X55 mesh network and Deco app will take you from unboxing to a massive upgrade to your home Wi-Fi network in next to no time, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/">this Amazon deal that brings you the 3-pack set for just $140 is a 30% drop from the usual $200 price.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-descends-to-%E2%80%98mixed%E2%80%99-review-status-on-steam.1291713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> got its fancy new remaster earlier this year, fans of Bethesda’s open-world RPGs, myself included, were <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557">elated at the return of this vintage classic</a>.</p> <p>Sadly, the enthusiasm wasn’t made to last. As seems befitting of its origins as a Bethesda-developed game, <i>Oblivion Remastered</i> is plagued by bugs and crashes on PC, especially following its 1.2 update which has ticked off enough players to see its Recent Reviews status on Steam sink to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/#app_reviews_hash">the dreaded pale orange “Mixed” designation</a>. Recent reviews cite quizzical issues with performance across the board, crashes, unfair difficulty scaling, and frustration with Unreal Engine 5, a sentiment only becoming more and more common.</p> <p>“I stopped counting the crashes,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/sansidee/recommended/2623190/">reads one review</a> taking aim at crashes encountered whenever trying to sleep or skip time in the game. “I really want to recommend this game,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011033991/recommended/2623190/">starts another</a>, “but I can’t due to technical issues and performance.” The same review cites the “few and far in between” patches the game has received, and the recent 1.2 update certainly hasn’t helped. “Started playing at launch with mods,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/HangukMoon/recommended/2623190/">writes another reviewer</a>, “and the game was perfectly fine to me. Came back this week and can’t for the life of me find out how to fix the “gpu crash dump triggered” crash.”</p> <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/2623190/">Frustration over performance</a> is certainly one of the louder sentiments among Steam reviewers, especially with the remaster exhibiting the well-known stuttering issues seen in other Unreal Engine 5 games. But as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197981796923/recommended/2623190/">another reviewer points out</a>, not all the issues are unique to the new version. “Old 2006 <i>Oblivion</i> bugs have been faithfully ported over to the 2025 remaster,” they write. “I was shocked to find issues, look them up online for [a] workaround, and [saw] these were the exact same bugs from the 2006 game.”</p> <p>Speaking for myself, the wildly inconsistent framerate and stuttering have definitely meant that I’ve spent considerably less time with the gorgeous remake of Bethesda’s 2006 open-world RPG than I was hoping to. Bummer!</p>
