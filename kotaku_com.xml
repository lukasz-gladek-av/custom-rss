However, <em>Sonic 3</em>’s isn’t quite as self-explanatory as those in the first two movies if you’re not already familiar with the blue blur and all his friends (and enemies). The first two movies’ post-credits scenes felt like natural extensions of the movies they came from, but <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s is a bit more disorienting and might have left new fans a bit confused. Fear not, because we’re here to fill in the gaps and speculate on what it all means.

It starts with Sonic running around, seemingly racing against Tails and Knuckles as seen earlier in the movie. However, in his haste, the hedgehog takes a wrong turn or two and ends up in a New York state park. A bit far from your home in Green HIlls, Montana, my guy. Once there, he’s greeted by none other than Metal Sonic, an evil synthetic recreation of our hero who Doctor Eggman creates in the games to try and match Sonic’s speed and power. At first, Sonic outmaneuvers Metal as his attacker attempts to obliterate him with an energy blast from a cannon in his arm, but is then suddenly surrounded by a squad of his robotic doppelgangers. Just as they all jump in to take him out, they’re struck by a flying hammer covered in pink chaos energy similar to Sonic’s blue and Shadow’s red. It returns to its wielder: a hooded figure who reveals herself to be a pink hedgehog before the movie cuts to black.</p><figure id="" data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not one of the long-time fans who likely was popping off at this point in the theater, this hammer-using vigilante is Amy Rose. She originally debuted alongside Metal Sonic in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog CD </em>back in 1993. For most of her early appearances, Amy was defined as Sonic’s one-sided love interest—she was infatuated with the hero, but he was too busy being the fastest hedgehog alive to consider something as trivial as romance. However, as the years have gone on, Amy has become a much more well-rounded character and a team leader in her own right. Historically, she’s added some girlypop spunk to the <em>Sonic </em>cast, and after being a boys club for three movies, the live-action universe is in dire need of that.</p><p>But what are she and Metal Sonic doing in the live-action movies? Again, this scene feels pretty disconnected from the rest of the film, so there’s only so much we can pull from in this short exchange. Given that Sonic has traveled to a different part of the country than we’ve seen in the movies thus far, it’s entirely possible Amy has already been on Earth by herself for some time and decided to be a vigilante in New York. How she got here, where she comes from, and just how she’ll feel about more alien animals in her space remains to be seen, but seeing as <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>doubles down on the idea of Sonic and his kind being aliens from different places, it stands to reason that Amy is not from Earth, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The bigger question mark in this scene is Metal Sonic. Eggman builds the robot hedgehog in the games, but as we saw not 10 minutes prior, Jim Carrey’s version of the mad scientist has seemingly kicked the bucket in a final moment of heroism. Granted, they also pretended to kill him off at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>, but there were more explicit teases to his survival than anything in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Agent Stone, Eggman’s loyal henchman, has seemingly turned a new leaf at the end of the movie as well, so he’s probably off the table. In theory, anyone could have seen all the events of the first three movies and decided to create a robot version of Sonic, but there’s still the question of why. That’s the major difference between this post-credits scene and previous ones; this one feels almost abstract, introducing new ideas and characters who have no clear, direct connection to what happened in the movie it bookends. I wouldn’t be surprised if this scene is featured in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em>, maybe 10 to 15 minutes into the film with more context to fill in these gaps. But for now, the only thing we really know as a result of this scene is who the new players will be in the next film.</p><p>The second post-credits scene is much shorter and more straightforward. We see that one of Shadow’s inhibitor rings has made a small crater on Earth after it fell to the planet during the final battle in space. The shot lingers briefly before we see Shadow walk into the frame and pick it up. It’s not much, but it confirms that Shadow survived the destruction of the Eclipse Cannon and will be around for the next movie. That’s not too surprising. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is heavily based on <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, in which Shadow is presumed dead after the final battle, only to return in <em>Sonic Heroes</em> after being rescued by Eggman. There are reports of plans for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow-centric spin-off</a></span>, too, so of course they didn’t kill him off for good.</p><p>Overall, I’m starting to wonder if <em>Sonic 4</em> could be a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. Metal Sonic is the primary antagonist of that game, and if Shadow’s reported spin-off introduces the rest of his team, treasure-hunting spy Rouge the Bat and decommissioned Eggman robot E-123 Omega, they’re already halfway to having most of <em>Heroes</em>’ cast accounted for. Whatever the fourth movie ends up being, <em>Sonic </em>fans have a lot to chew on after the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>. And hey, not to brag, but I was right about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899">the characters most likely to appear in the post-credits scene</a></span>.

But if you’re on an extended trip somewhere with no ability to charge it, you may want to try extending that life even further. Here are some tips for extending the battery life on your PlayStation Portal.</p><h2 id="h130493"><a id="brightness"></a>Reduce screen brightness</h2><p>This one is a no-brainer. The brighter you keep your screen, the faster your battery will drain. If you’re in a dark room, you should be able to keep the brightness close to its lowest setting, but you may need to increase it again to see the screen in well-lit locations.</p><p>The brightness setting can be accessed on your quick settings tabs, or you can go into Settings &gt; Display and Brightness. You’ll want to do that anyway for the next trick.</p><h2 id="h130494"><a id="light"></a>Turn off the light bar</h2><p>The light bar around the rim of the PlayStation Portal controller looks cool, but it can drain your battery a bit. Since the light doesn’t serve any purpose beyond proof that your device is on, it may be worth disabling altogether.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness to turn this feature off. While you’re there, you can also disable the mute button light, though I doubt that tiny light affects the battery much, if at all.</p><h2 id="h130495"><a id="haptics"></a>Turn off the haptics and trigger effects</h2><p>It goes without saying that the PlayStation Portal’s haptic feedback and trigger effects are awesome, but they can also contribute to battery drain in games that frequently use it (this is also true of the PS5’s DualSense controllers). </p><p>If you head to Settings &gt; Controller, you adjust the intensity of these features. I’d recommend turning them all the way off if your goal is to save as much battery as possible, but even just reducing their intensity will help a little.</p><h2 id="h130496"><a id="restmode"></a>Set a reasonable time for entering Rest Mode</h2><p>Lastly, make sure you set a reasonable time for the PlayStation Portal to enter Rest Mode, which will turn the screen off and reduce the amount of power it’s using when you’re not actively using it.</p><p>To adjust this feature, head into Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery. The best time setting would be 30 seconds, but even somewhere around 1-2 minutes should help you reduce battery drain when you’re away from the handheld. </p><p>With all of these settings changed, you should save some battery life on your PlayStation Portal. That means more time to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615"><em>Astro Bot</em>’s new Christmas level</a></span>!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it doesn’t end there, because if you want to play, you have to have an NFT!</p><p>These take the form of Niji Warrior cards, which can be bought via the game’s website, where—like in all normal games—you then have to sign in to your “wallet.” This is where your pretend money and pictures are kept, and in this case it wants you to use something called Eden Online, Ubisoft’s own in-universe creation. (You can also sign into Coinbase or Walletconnect, but not being a crypto-bro, I have no such things.) So, because I actually <em>am</em> an incredible games journalist, I let the thing hook into my personal Gmail account. This apparently generated a wallet I could associate with the account, meaning I was able to “enter the photobooth.”</p><figure id="" data-id="a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-recommend-id="image://a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1126" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-recommend-id="image://a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1126" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here, having repeatedly been told I could “reveal” my card, I was rerouted to a website called magiceden.io, a somehow-surviving NFT “marketplace,” where I discovered that all the 10,000 free options to “mint” a card had already been taken. But I need my Niji Warrior card to be able to play! So, as I read about how this “expanding the universe of the Netflix series” was “built on the Arbitrum blockchain,” and how these “10,000 AI-generated NFTs evolve based on your performance and involvement, unlocking exclusive access to in-game assets, governance rights, and perks tied to iconic Ubisoft franchises like Assassin’s Creed, Rayman and Splinter Cell,” I wondered if it was all too late.</p><p>Only here, on a non-Ubisoft site, written in small print within a section ironically entitled “Vision,” does it reveal that the “mint” is part of an “Early Access for Niji Warrior holders,” the “full launch” happening in 2025, despite the game being listed as out all over Ubisoft’s site and store. It seems we now have to click through to the “Collection” to buy one of them from someone else. Suddenly I’m thinking of Egyptian architects for some reason.</p><figure id="" data-id="19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-recommend-id="image://19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-recommend-id="image://19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I cannot emphasize enough that Ubisoft’s sites imply that you simply “Reveal” your ID card, with no mention of money, no mention that you will need to buy cryptocurrency to have any way to play the actual game.</p><p>Speaking of playing the game, I figured I’d try that instead and see what could be done without shattering my crypto virginity. The first few tries, after discovering that Ubisoft Connect had, of course, yet again forgotten all my login credentials since the last time I was forced to use it, ended in error messages.</p><figure id="" data-id="b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-recommend-id="image://b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1100" data-height="262" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-recommend-id="image://b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1100" data-height="262" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I was told the game was “Unable to start download (Code: 17006)“ and also “(Code: 17017).” The link to the support page told me to visit the “Live Feed Update section on Ubisoft Help,” linking to the latter. The Ubisoft Help page has no Live Feed Update section. This is really very good.</p><p>Then, as I was about to write that up, another attempt saw the game successfully download! (For some reason, it refused to acknowledge my two gaming SSDs in its list of install drives.) It was here! I clicked to launch, and here’s my favorite screenshot of the game so far:</p><figure id="" data-id="71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-recommend-id="image://71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A black screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-recommend-id="image://71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, OK, that’s not fair.

The most expensive is (oh my actual god) 50 ETH, or $162,975.50.</p><p>Damn, I’m just those two quarters short.</p><p>Oh! And if you thought, “Well, 12 bucks, I could maybe just suck it up and take a look,” the minimum amount it appears to be possible to add to a wallet is $21!</p><p>I cannot tell you anything else about it right now, because Ubisoft is working <em>pretty</em> hard to hide what the game looks like from those not willing to shoot for the moon. The publisher has accidentally forgotten to upload any trailers to its own YouTube channel, instead opting for a hardwired version on their site...which doesn’t show any in-game footage. Like, not even a hint.</p><p>Ubisoft has also, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em> noticed</a></span>, not yet remembered to mention the game on its own socials, instead using an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eden Online sockpuppet account</a></span>. On there, I <em>was</em> able to find a tiny glimpse of the game itself amongst the cartoon sequences.
