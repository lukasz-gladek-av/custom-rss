              <p>The head of the biggest gaming site in the world is leaving the company at the end of August, <em>Kotaku</em> has learned. John Davison, who has been <em>IGN</em>‘s publisher since joining back in 2019, told staff on Monday it was time for “the next chapter.” The high-profile departure comes shortly after a big round of layoffs that saw multiple departments across the company impacted.</p> <p>Arriving just months before the start of the 2020 pandemic, Davison’s tenure at <em>IGN</em> saw the site expand into events like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-and-sega-among-publishers-appearing-at-ign-live">IGN Live</a> and a market analytics platform called <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-launches-gaming-trends-platform-shedding-light-on-how-mobile-roblox-and-more-are-reshaping-the-industry">Gaming Trends</a>. Under parent-company Ziff Davis, <em>IGN</em> also made a massive acquisition last year in the form of the Gamer Network, a suite of European-facing gaming sites like <em>Eurogamer</em>, <em>VG247</em>, and <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>. Many of those sites were hit with mass layoffs at the time of the deal, and <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> was gutted. One of the most valuable parts of that package, <em>Digital Foundry</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/digital-foundry-df-direct-ign-patreon-retro-games-media-2000616308">announced just last week</a> that it had purchased all outstanding equity to allow it to leave<em> IGN</em> and go fully independent.</p> <p>Davison, whose 25+ years in games media include stints at <em>EGM</em>, <em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em>, and <em>GameSpot</em>, will be leaving<em> IGN</em> at a time when its future trajectory has never been more uncertain. A reporting, news, and features operation that expanded under previous EIC Tina Amini has suffered cuts in recent years due to multiple rounds of layoffs and buyouts. Amini, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-editor-in-chief-tina-amini-steps-down">who left in 2022 and now works at Xbox</a>, was never replaced. Davison reported to Ziff Davis president of gaming and entertainment Yael Prough, and it’s not yet clear if the parent company plans on backfilling his role.</p>

 <p>Davison and <em>IGN</em> did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>IGN</em> laid off over a dozen staff earlier this month, which included approximately 12 percent members in its editorial union. “The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">the IGN Creators Guild wrote at the time</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p> <p>“It’s been an honor to work alongside such talented, passionate people, and I’m deeply proud of what we’ve accomplished together,” Davison wrote in a message to staff today. “I’m excited for what comes next.”</p>

              <p>A <a href="https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665"><em>League of Legends</em></a> player who claimed to have built a career around boosting accounts and selling them replied angrily on social media to a developer at Riot Games. He was worried about how he would make money now. The dev’s response was a link to McDonalds’ careers page.</p> <p>On August 11, <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-banning-bots-boosters-and-more-in-2025/?_gl=1*dgamq1*_gcl_au*MTU3NTAxOTczNy4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga*MTM2MDIzODkzMS4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga_FXBJE5DEDD*czE3NTQ5NDY3OTAkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQ5NDY3OTEkajU5JGwwJGgw">Riot Games announced plans</a>&nbsp;to ramp up its efforts to fight back against smurf and alt account misuse in <em>League of Legends,</em> one of the biggest MOBAs on the planet. These new plans include banning and punishing people who grind on accounts owned by other players, boosting their rank in the process, and charging a fee for doing so. These services have <a href="https://insaneboost.gg/">become quite common online.</a> Even <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">Elon Musk admitted to using one such service</a> in <em>Path of Exile II.</em> But Riot is cracking down and banning accounts associated with the practice. These changes will begin in <em>LoL</em> update 25.18 and will likely lead to players being far more cautious about paying others to boost their rank in<em> League of Legends</em>. That will lead to fewer customers for those offering such “services,” and one of these people wasn’t happy about that news.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/cat1_alex/status/1954924168245358742?">Twitter user SLS replied to Riot’s Director of Product Drew Levin</a>, and explained that their “main income” comes primarily from boosting other players’ accounts in <em>League of Legends</em>. They also coach players in the free-to-play MOBA, but admitted that this only earned them about 15 percent of what they make boosting in a month. They wrapped up their comment with: “What I do after? [sic] Just chill at McDonald’s?” Levin reshared the post and included a link to McDonald’s careers page, seemingly joking that it was time for SLS to find a new job.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4">https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4</a> <a href="https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF">https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF</a></p> <p>— Drew Levin (@drewlevin) <a href="https://twitter.com/drewlevin/status/1954931160469114915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Bro, you do understand that you have built a business off of ruining other people’s games, right?” <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954926308049494207">replied Levin</a>. “[I] have no desire to preserve that at the expense of whatever lobbies you’re boosting accounts through.”</p> <p>When SLS replied to that message with a complaint that the boosting industry wasn’t hurting the game and that boosters take specific orders related to very high ranks, Levin replied again, this time pointing out how absurd it was that SLS was describing breaking how the game ranks players as an “industry.”</p> <p>“‘The industry?’ ‘Taking orders?’ Bro you are paid to trick our skill evaluation systems, and you are talking to the person leading the effort to improve their integrity,” <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954930709510168878">said Levin on social media</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Riot Games about the response.</p> <p>While some players who relied on boosting or liked smurfing–which is when a high-level player creates a new account to use their skills against low-level players–were upset about the changes, the vast majority of the replies to Levin were happy to hear Riot Games was taking alt account abuse seriously in 2025. Of course, it remains to be seen if Riot Games can actually weed out all the boosters and smurf accounts from <em>League of Legends</em> and how quickly people find ways around their new efforts.</p> <p>Also, it should be noted that working at McDonald’s, like any other fast food joint, is a very hard job that requires incredible amounts of patience and stamina. It would be nice if we could all stop acting like people who work at these places are lazy teens working a summer job for beer money or whatever. If that cultural shift were to happen, perhaps they’d have a better shot at getting paid more. And don’t you think the people making your food deserve more money? I do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>OpenAI launched its long-awaited <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">AI update, GPT-5,</a> on August 7. It made lofty promises like “PhD‑level intelligence.” But within 24 hours, the tool’s most devoted users were cataloging its many bugs, errors, and shortcomings on Reddit. The ChatGPT fandom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkobei/openai_just_pulled_the_biggest_baitandswitch_in/">started melting down</a>. CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969">responded</a> by promising to let customers start using the older GPT models again. By August 11, Altman was in <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1954703747495649670">full screencap apology</a> mode trying to cauterize the flow of bad vibes.</p> <p>“If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” he posted on X earlier today. “It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake).”</p> <p>The tenor of this self-inflicted debacle should be familiar to anyone who’s played <em>Destin</em>y, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, or dozens of other online multiplayer games. It’s the same mix of developer hubris, corporate profit motive, hyper fandom, and “<a href="https://x.com/dril/status/660644922744262656?lang=en">Sorry. Im sorry. Im trying to remove it</a>.” An upcoming expansion is sold with lofty promises. It arrives full of half-baked ideas and stealth nerfs. Players encounter a surprising number of bugs. Meanwhile the prices in the microtransaction shop are going up and the places where you can earn rewards for free are disappearing.</p>

 <p>“This guy communicates in a way that is indistinguishable from a community manager of a live service video game having a botched expansion release,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/catharsis23.bsky.social/post/3lw5jvotgfk2s">wrote</a> one Bluesky user in response. “Seems kind of humiliating.” Vocal AI critic Ed Zitron, who pegged GPT-5 as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittification-of-generative-ai/">generative AI’s enshittification moment</a>, was more direct. “This is the ultimate folly of OpenAI: they engaged gamer-like hype, got gamer-like fandom, and now face the wrath of gamer-like hate,” he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3lw5k3nkztc2r">wrote</a> today.</p> <p>The GTP-5 fiasco <a href="https://gizmodo.com/it-took-just-24-hours-of-complaints-for-openai-to-start-bringing-back-its-old-model-2000640912">revolved around a few main issues</a>. While it was promised as another big leap in the model’s capabilities, what really seemed to be going on was that it was just routing queries to lots of different models to save time and money. There was also a very limiting cap on the number of queries users outside of the most expensive plans could make each week. Finally, there was the disappearances of GPT-4o, one of OpenAI’s most popular models which also <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">had a reputation for being</a> “sycophantic.”</p> <p>“ChatGPT psychosis” is one of the biggest concerns with the billion-dollar cash-burning enterprise right now. Chat bots can suck users into “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html">delusional spirals</a>” with them. People are reportedly being <a href="https://futurism.com/commitment-jail-chatgpt-psychosis">involuntarily committed or jailed</a> after becoming obsessed with their GPT interactions. One guy thought he had trained his AI to become self-aware and that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/">it was talking to God for him</a>.</p>

 <p>Altman clearly thinks this aspect of ChatGPT can be harmful in the wrong hands. But many of the people currently paying for ChatGPT also clearly prefer it. And he’s spent so long packaging OpenAI’s platform-shift moonshot as a grand cosmic journey everyone’s on together that dialing down the snake oil is no longer an option. After years of hyping AGI (artificial general intelligence), Altman told Wall Street last week that it’s actually “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/sam-altman-says-agi-is-a-pointless-term-experts-agree.html?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=689a05a3778386000185beda&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">not a super useful term</a>.”</p> <p>This is the part in the live-service hype cycle where studios usually go from talking about how their game is completely transformative and unlike anything else you’ve ever played before to offering very in-the-weeds explanations of why patch notes that are impossible for outsiders to parse will overhaul the game into the best version of the thing you already love. The players, who have invested not just their money and free time but also no small chunk of their identity in how your product makes them feel will now become like the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. They are not trapped in your hyper-complex, infinitely monetizable skinner box. You are trapped in whatever they insist on perverting it into. Even if that’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/i-feel-like-im-going-crazy-chatgpt-fuels-delusional-spirals-ae5a51fc?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiqx4e9RsfPVEG8-vSVaF26bdgC8kiLYXSykv1hX5M3kzc2lNInkty8wQyYn5o%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689a6287&amp;gaa_sig=w891GxyjybddGBhS316rMpTsfH3domwnKveQDIM4DMGXW47JE1c4U4x30cETuWVawzdNGNzebYIZi-hOBA5Rcw%3D%3D">an expensive rabbit hole full of apocalyptic conspiracies</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s Our First Look At The Rumored $1,000 Lego Death Star Set Containing Over 9K Pieces]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>For months now, rumors of a Lego <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars</em></a> Death Star set have been floating around Reddit, Instagram, and other places where Lego nerds (like myself) hang out. Now we finally have our first real look at the massive upcoming Lego set, and it seems to confirm the previous rumors, which also claimed the price for this 9,000+ piece set might be $1,000.</p> <p>I first heard about a massive <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Lego Death Star</a> set that could cost as much as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1lq9y5m/death_star/">$1,000 back in May</a>. At the time, the only supposed details that had leaked were its set number, piece count, October release date, and estimated price, as well as some tiny details on possible minifigs that would be included. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1kj36y8/my_speculation_and_analysis_on_the_1000_death/">There was also speculation</a> that it wouldn’t be a full orb, but instead a half-orb that would serve as more of a large diorama piece. Now some new leaked images seem to confirm many, but not all, of those previously rumored details.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1mm3ecd/75419_ucs_death_star_full_box_source/">On August&nbsp; 9, three photos</a> of what appears to be the (still officially unconfirmed) Lego Death Star set were shared on Reddit. The photos show the massive set’s equally massive box and confirm the previously leaked set number and piece count. Well, actually, the piece count of 9,023 is a few bricks more than what was leaked, but it’s close enough that I’m confident that the source of the details had advanced information.</p>

 <p>The new leak also confirms <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-review-discussion-so-good-1851777959"><em>Rogue One </em>and<em> Andor’s</em> Orson Krennic</a> is one of the many included minifigs. Others include Ben Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in his Stormtrooper disguise, R2-D2 and C-3PO, the Emperor, a bunch of Imperial higher-ups seen in <em>A New Hope</em>, and Darth Vader. Oh, and I think I spotted a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sim_Aloo">Sim Aloo</a> figure in the images included on the back of the box. (Though a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1m8ys0s/part_2_for_death_star_mini_figures/"><em>different</em> leak</a> simply refers to him as an “Imperial Dignitary.” Boo!)</p> <p>Of course, the big news from this leak is that if all these previously rumored and speculated details are accurate, then it’s very likely Lego is about to set <a href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/sets/top/most-expensive-lego-sets">a new record for the most expensive official Lego set ever.</a></p> <p>Currently, the highest retail price the toy company has ever placed on a single set is $850 for the very big Millennium Falcon. <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/millennium-falcon-75192">That 7,500+ piece set was released in 2017</a> and is still for sale as of August 2025. The rumored price point of $1,000 for the new <em>Star Wars</em> Death Star would shatter the old record. However, the new Death Star won’t break the biggest set record, which is held by the Eiffel Tower set released in 2022. It contains 10,001 pieces and costs $630.</p> <p>And if you’re curious, the old Death Star set released in 2016 cost $500. At the time that seemed like a lot, and it still is a lot of money in 2025 to most people. I can’t imagine how many people will be able to afford double that when the new set arrives in October, assuming the rumored price is accurate. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">And as tariffs continue to be a growing problem</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">in the United States thanks to President Trump</a>, expect Lego sets and other toys to become more expensive, too.</p>
