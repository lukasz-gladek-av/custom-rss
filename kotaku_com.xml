            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Every year needs its marquee bad game, and just two weeks into 2026, it looks like the new yeare might already have a contender. </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>is a survival horror game from TeamKill Media, the team who made the apparently also awful </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/quantum-error/"><i><span>Quantum Error</span></i></a><span> from 2023. Both games are currently sitting at a 40 on review aggregate site Metacritic, and given that </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>only has a handful of reviews thus far, there’s still time for the dinosaur-shooting </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>knockoff to tumble down farther in the ranks.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span> mixes the claustrophobic corridors and over-the-shoulder shooting of games like </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span> with the dinosaur-infested setting of </span><i><span>Dino Crisis</span></i><span>. Or it tries to, at least. From the sound of it, the game doesn’t pull any of this off anywhere near as well as the games it’s clearly trying to emulate, and its simplistic shooting never quite manages to make its dinosaur foes feel terrifying enough to overpower you.</span></p>

 <p><span>“In a straight up skirmish with these scaly foes, a well-timed dash back can really befuddle the raptors, shattering their simple gameplan of running at you, taking a big swing, pausing, and doing it again,” Jarrett Jawn writes at </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>. “There’s limited space before you hit a wall or a door that might have automatically closed behind you, though, so you can only backdash so much before making yourself a much easier snack to catch. The camera will collide with these barriers far sooner than [protagonist] Violet will, rendering any encounter that doesn’t take place in the dead center of the room a completely unintelligible mess for as long as it takes you to get the camera refocused.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Several reviewers state that everything about </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>’s combat seems undercooked in a way that makes it hard to even interpret visually or through audio cues. </span><i><span>PushSquare </span></i><span>reviewer John Cal McCormick, meanwhile, described the shooting as “limp” and its guns “weightless.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Shotguns should boom, but firing one in </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span> feels like when you bite the end of the paper off a McDonald’s straw and blow through it so the wrapping flies off,” McCormick writes.&nbsp; </span><span><br> </span><span>“Less of a boom, and more of a wildly unsatisfying thwip. Hit boxes seem erratic, and visual feedback is largely non-existent. It’s often unclear if you’re actually hitting your target or not until the dinosaur you’re shooting at unconvincingly keels over.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Outside of the actual pointing and shooting, several reviewers noted the odd tonal dissonance between the game’s survival horror setting and the way it frames its protagonist Violet, with her&nbsp; fanservice-driven wardrobe and </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>’s insistence on giving players an unimpeded view quickly growing tiresome, corny, and at odds with the moment at hand.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Although the character model is highly detailed, it is done so in a sexualised manner, which is further enhanced through the array of revealing costumes that you can dress her in at save points,” </span><a href="https://cogconnected.com/review/code-violet-review/"><i><span>COGConnected</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> Jaz Sagoo writes.</span></p> <p><span>“In a pivotal moment in the story, Violet bawls at the death of a comrade,” McCormick says. “The comrade was killed by a space dinosaur, incidentally. And as the tears stream down her face, and the voice actor puts their all into each wail, the camera pans back to reveal Violet is dressed like a sexy cowgirl complete with arse-less chaps.”</span></p>

 <p><span>If you scroll down to the comments on most of these reviews, you’ll find that a lot of folks aren’t terribly surprised by this, given </span><i><span>Quantum Error </span></i><span>was also a certified stinker. There are also plenty of people saying what they really want is for Capcom to bring back </span><i><span>Dino Crisis </span></i><span>so we can get a real dinosaur horror game instead of these knock-offs. But from the sound of it, you’re better off waiting for Capcom to pull the franchise out of cold storage than playing </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good music can instantly lift the mood and the vibe of any space. Those shopping for a solid Bluetooth speaker today – we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Beats Pill speaker by 33%, offering it now for just $100.</a> That’s after a nice $50 savings, and the offer applies to all color options. These include the stunning Champagne, the classic Black, and the bold Red.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Compromises on Sound</h2>
<p>Beats Pill – well, looks like a large pill, but in a good, minimal way. The speaker includes a removable lanyard and soft-grip silicone backing for easier portability. It can be slipped into any bag or simply carried using the lanyard when you’re heading out.</p>
<p>Sound quality is nothing short of impressive. Beats Pill features a bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer that displaces 90% more air volume for deeper bass, plus a redesigned tweeter which offers crisp highs and rich mid-range tones. The result? Balanced, yet punchy sound for all your favorite tracks. Whether you’re starting your day with a motivational podcast or want your music to match your workout energy, expect an immersive sound experience. Conversations come through clearly, while tunes hit with satisfying bass that moves you.</p>
<p>Even better, the woofer’s material and structure are designed to minimize low-end distortion, even when you have pumped the sound all the way up. Feeling like having your own private Coldplay concert in your lounge? Push the volume to maximum to get in the feels. Additionally, the Beats Pill supports not only Bluetooth connectivity but also USB-C connections to other devices. The latter offers high-resolution lossless audio, which preserves the detail and depth of audio, letting you enjoy the music exactly the way its creator intended. You can even pair two of these speakers together for an even larger sound setup in Amplify mode or Stereo mode. Just ask a friend to bring theirs, connect the two, and get the party started.</p>



<p>Note that despite Beats being owned by Apple, this speaker plays nicely with both Android and Apple devices. You can connect it to your smartphone, laptop, computer, TV, and more without a problem. Best of all, the included microphone lets you take calls and activate voice assistants like Alexa and Google right through the speaker. Once you’re done, your track picks up right where you left off.</p>
<p>Durability comes from the speaker’s IP67 dust and water resistance, which makes it easy to take it anywhere – beach, poolside, bathroom, great outdoors – with you. Battery life is just as impressive. A single charge gets you around 24 hours of playback, making the Beats Pill more than capable of keeping the party going all night and into the next day. It can even serve as a handy power bank when needed, as you can use it to charge your phone or other devices via USB-C cable.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking to enjoy their favorite tracks to the fullest on the go.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/"> It typically retails for $150, which isn’t bad considering all the features the Beats Pill packs, but you can treat yourself to one for just $100 today.</a> The discount is expected to expire soon, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Pokémon Lego Sets Are Incredible And Expensive]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895</link>
            <guid>1403455</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’ve known for a little under a year now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713"><span>Lego and </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>were collaborating</span></a><span> on sets featuring Pikachu and friends, and now we finally know what they are, how much they cost, and my god, how do y’all afford this as a regular hobby? They look incredible, though.</span></p> <p><span>The first five </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Lego sets include models for <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152">Pikachu</a>, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/eevee-72151">Eevee</a>, a Pokémon Center, all eight Kanto gym badges, and a huge set featuring <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153">Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise</a>, and will launch on February 27, aka Pokémon Day, commemorating the series’ 30th anniversary.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658897" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658897"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658897">© The Pokémon Company / Lego</figcaption></figure> <p>For anyone who collects official Lego sets, these prices might not deliver much sticker shock. I’m super tempted by the one of Pikachu jumping out of a Poké Ball, but oof dah, $200 is a lot. The Eevee one is the most affordable here, running $59.99, and it’s also the most straightforward model. It’s just Eevee being a little brick guy. However, the Kanto starter trio is a staggering $649.99, which isn’t too surprising when you consider how elaborate it is. It has 6838 pieces, each of which helps build Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise in their natural habitats. The standout is Charizard, who is the centerpiece of the set as it flies off what looks like a volcano. The whole thing’s pretty neat, but is it “more expensive than a PlayStation 5” neat? You decide.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, you won’t find the Pokémon Center and Kanto Badge sets on store shelves. The badges are only available if you buy the starter trio set from February 27 to March 8, and the Pokémon Center is a Lego Insiders reward, available to you if you have 2600 points through your membership.</p>

  <p>Aiming this product line squarely at adults with nostalgia for the brand, The Pokémon Company also released a live-action promo telling folks that Legos are for older Pokémon fans who have bills to pay and lower back pain. I guess kids are also unlikely to have the $650 lying around to pick up the most elaborate of these sets.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bose’s Latest ANC Wireless Headphones Hits Record Low, New QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Headphones (2nd Gen) Is Now Cheaper Than AirPods Max]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/boses-latest-anc-wireless-headphones-hits-record-low-new-quietcomfort-ultra-bluetooth-headphones-2nd-gen-is-now-cheaper-than-airpods-max-2000658788</link>
            <guid>1403398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A quick word-association exercise will usually produce the word “Bose” when the question is “luxury headphones.” In terms of performance and especially active noise cancellation, that’s absolutely true. But in terms of price, even Bose’s newest models are more accessible than you might think, and never more accessible than right now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">thanks to this $50-off Amazon deal on the QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones</a>.</p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="1017">The QC Ultra 2s dropped just this past October at $450, but lately Amazon and other retailers have quietly slashed the price deep into deal hunter territory. That means this $400 Amazon deal represents savings on months-old Bose headphones that would make even the most hardened tech shopper blink and the most devoted audiophile reach for their wallet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="690" data-end="1017">Serious Sound, Serious Deal</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Here’s the wild part: Despite its premium positioning and outstanding , this deal pushes the QC Ultra 2s <em data-start="1101" data-end="1108">below</em> the cost of some older Bose QuietComfort models (yeah, the ones that aren’t even “Ultra”). So if you were on the fence about spending bigger on flagship-level noise cancellation, this Amazon deal makes the argument a whole lot easier.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose took their stellar original QuietComfort Ultra headphones and made several significant upgrades to create the QuietComfort Ultra 2s. This latest model delivers Bose’s very best adaptive noise cancellation performance, with AI-based background noise suppression and Wind Block tech for listening in windy conditions. Bose added two new sound modes – Immersion and Cinema — along with support for wired lossless listening via audio or USB-C cables. The Cinema mode is a high-performing spatial setting which balances the overall audio in favor of dialogue, ideal for streaming and podcasts.</p>


<h2 data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Truly Premium</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Even the physical look of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 headphones is a step up from the originals, with more premium materials, polished metal yokes, and an overall sleeker and more modern look. The over-ear comfort level of the Ultra 2s is a step up from the already-pleasing original Ultras, and the battery life has been upgraded from 24 hours to 30. But it’s the active noise cancellation that Bose really leans into, and if you’re still recovering from holiday travel that involved overcrowded planes or trains stuffed with noisy commuters, you know the real value of a pair of world-class noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones pair easily with any Bluetooth device — Apple, Google, Android, and any properly equipped smart TV, for starters — and the Bluetooth Core 5.4 connection is strong and steady. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">This somewhat unexpected Amazon sale bringing the QC Ultra 2 headphones down to $400 so soon after their release is the best way for you to experience true Bose sound without breaking the bank.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Peak Dev Explains The Completely Bonkers Psychology Behind Game Prices]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-pricing-indie-steam-peak-content-warning-2000658886</link>
            <guid>1403395</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game pricing is more all over the place than it’s ever been as developers explore the top and low ends of the spectrum, as well as everywhere in-between. And that’s before seasonal sales, subscription services, and monthly giveaways. Indie games in particular used to have to fight to prove they were worth the price of admission in the eyes of gamers used to big blockbuster spectacles produced on AAA budgets. But the psychology underlying those perceptions isn’t as clearcut as some might think, according to one of the developers of 2025’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">top-selling “friendslop” climbing sim <em>Peak</em></a>.</p> <p>The game <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">launched last June</a> at a discounted sale price of $5. That was $3 below what would be it’s “normal” price of $8. Co-creator Nick Kaman recently explained the logic behind the maneuver <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/peak-interview">to <em>Game File</em></a>. “We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really?” he said. “In a player’s mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that’s still five bucks. Four bucks is also kind of five bucks.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free. So we’ve got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks… that’s ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn’t become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right? So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal.”</p>   <p>The developers of<em> Peak</em> didn’t randomly pick $8 out of a hat. That was the <a href="https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637">price of <em>Content Warning</em></a>, another hit in the multiplayer virality sim genre. But the overall logic lines up with something game designer and Suspicious Developments studio founder Tom Francis recently wrote about indie game pricing. His take was <a href="https://www.pentadact.com/2026-01-08-15-years-of-indie-dev-in-4-bits-of-advice/#price">part of a four-point advice guide</a> for new developers based on his 15 years of experience making games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/heat-signature-is-a-thrilling-game-about-spaceship-heis-1818625899"><em>Heat Signature</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a>.</p>

 <h2>Steam indie game pricing is a “solved problem”</h2> <p>According to Francis, game sales are a function of three things: 1) how many people come to the Steam Page, 2) how much the Steam page makes them want to buy it, and 3) how much it costs. “We just ask people how much they think the game should cost, and every time we’ve gone with the price most people chose, and every time they’ve sold great and reviewed great,” he explained.</p>

 <p>He pushed back against the older conventional wisdom that meeting player expectations rather than setting them would lead indie game prices in a race to the bottom. “Among the many genres and models that didn’t exist back then is the occasional janky/silly/ugly game charging $5 to encourage a kind of ‘fuck it, why not’ good will, and blowing up if it lands right with streamers,” he wrote. “That might bring the median price down, but it’s not a sign that people will no longer pay $20 for an indie game.”</p>

 <p>You can see this philosophy in action with the recent release of <em>Rising Front</em>, a pretty ugly-looking, very rudimentary WWI and Revolutionary War battle sim FPS (complimentary). Its 1.0 launch on Steam on January 9 was accompanied by an influx of fairly positive reviews. It’s normally priced at $15 but is currently on sale for just $12. According to Kaman, that’s actually $10. Maybe after reading the <em>Peak</em> developer’s comments, <em>Rising Front</em>‘s creators will lower it to $8.</p>
