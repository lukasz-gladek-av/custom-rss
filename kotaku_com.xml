            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A YouTuber reportedly discovered a way to generate infinite money via a strange trade-in deal glitch at GameStop. After making a video about it, the company figured out what was going on and has now claimed to have “patched” the bug. Or maybe this is all some odd marketing stunt. Or somehow both things are true. It’s hard to say anymore.</p> <p>On January 20, video game retailer, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">Bitcoin investor</a>, and Funko Pop graveyard <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056">GameStop posted a lengthy comment</a> to Twitter about a so-called “Infinite Money Glitch” that was recently discovered by <a href="https://youtu.be/6GEgSUUJ758">YouTube content creator RJCmedia</a>. How the glitch worked, apparently, was that if you bought a Nintendo Switch 2 for $415 and then immediately traded it back in along with the purchase of any pre-owned game, a promo would be triggered that increased the value of the trade-in to $472. Repeat this a few times, and you could rack up a few hundred bucks in trade-in credit.</p>

 <p>Here’s why this glitch happened and how it worked, according to GameStop:</p> <p>“In short, our system briefly valued the pre-owned trade more than the new retail cost of the console itself, creating a narrow window where customers could repeat this transaction over and over again to amass infinite trade credit,” said GameStop on social media.</p>  <h2>GameStop’s response to the infinite money glitch</h2> <p>GameStop says that “effective immediately, the glitch has been patched.” It further added that “trade promotions have been updated to ensure customers can no longer convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream, and balance has been restored.”</p>

 <p>GameStop, a company that has become famous for memes, shitposting, spinning dumb mistakes into marketing material, and also for reportedly treating its employees poorly, ended its lengthy statement by reminding people that it remains “committed to offering promotions that reward” its customers. However, it “gently” reminded people that its stores are “not designed to function as infinite money printers.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GAMESTOP ISSUES STATEMENT ON INFINITE MONEY GLITCH</p> <p>GameStop is aware of the “GameStop Infinite Money Glitch,” exposed by YouTuber RJCmedia. </p> <p>By purchasing a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99 and then immediately trading it back in along with the purchase of a pre-owned game, a… <a href="https://t.co/F2D2v41IeQ">pic.twitter.com/F2D2v41IeQ</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So now the big question: Is this real? The video from RJCmedia seems real enough, with the creator visiting different stores and filming the process of trading in each console. There is also a bit where he is surprised to see a GameStop store closing soon and isn’t able to pull off the trade glitch there. Alluding to the news that many GameStop stores will be shutting down due to greed would likely be something the company wouldn’t want in a piece of viral marketing. There’s also nothing in the video disclosing it as a paid ad, and the creator isn’t massive, so it doesn’t seem like a person the company would partner with to do some weird guerrilla marketing. If it seems odd that I’m spending this much time dissecting whether or not this is real, it’s because <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-s-stock-price-soars-to-new-records-because-cap-1846113214">GameStop is a very weird</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-xbox-360-digital-marketplace-physical-discs-1851609043">company these days</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestops-concept-stores-of-the-future-are-very-sad-1841917148">and you</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-gme-bitcoin-meme-stock-close-stores-1851772455">gotta be careful out there</a>.</p> <p>Anyway, I think this is all real, though the statement from GameStop is clearly trying to make this a fun situation, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-box-staples-gamestop-replacement-launch-1851783684">which reminds me of the stapler incident from last year.</a> I hope others out there got to take advantage of this strange bug. Power to the players and all that, you know?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Rare </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards are locked up in one of the most secure locations in the United States. The Surging Sparks Pikachu, which includes a full art illustration of the little yellow guy adorned in a Stellar-type Tera crown, is sitting in a Lucky Box vending machine in the Pentagon food court. Good luck getting into that, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233"><span>card robbers</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.404media.co/theres-a-lootbox-with-rare-pokemon-cards-sitting-in-the-pentagon-food-court/?ref=aftermath.site"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a><span> reports that the Lucky Box vending machine, which is essentially a gacha machine for rare, graded cards of both the sports and trading card game variety, was seemingly put up in the United States’ military headquarters </span><a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/pentagon-lucky-box/?ref=404media.co"><span>around Christmas Eve last month</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <figure id="attachment_2000661404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661404"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661404">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In a now-deleted Threads announcement, Lucky Box posted that it had set up one of its loot box machines in the Pentagon food court, and&nbsp; among the potential prizes which the machine’s display touts could be yours if you blindly give it some cash is the aforementioned Pikachu card. Based on photos posted on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1qbc0du/comment/nz9gcjz/?ref=404media.co"><span>Army subreddit</span></a><span>, the machine also has an image of a giant Charizard card on the side of it, but it’s unclear if that’s just decoration or if the original fire-breathing dragon card is also in that specific machine. Taking your chances at a Luck Box machine can cost anywhere from $100 to $200.</span></p> <p><span>Lucky Box’s </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSf3_KvCWta/"><span>social media accounts</span></a><span> include photos of big winners, some of whom won rare </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, while others won autographed jerseys from various sports teams. But it doesn’t look like they’ve posted anyone scoring something big in the middle of the Pentagon yet. In fact, most of its posts feature the boxes in Las Vegas, where </span><a href="https://luckyboxvending.com/pages/store-locator"><span>over 20 of the machines are found</span></a><span>. The winners that are featured are finding some pretty valuable </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, though, from a rare Venusaur to the ancient Mew promo card from </span><i><span>Pokémon: The First Movie</span></i><span>’s theatrical run.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards are already pretty much considered gambling by people who crack packs open by the dozens in the hopes of scoring a quick buck, but it’s still striking to see that concept&nbsp; demonstrated as blatantly as it is here, with valuable cards locked away in a machine that requires people to shell out hundreds of dollars for a small chance of scoring one.. Thank goodness the most powerful military in the world is keeping its eye on the machine until the lucky winner comes along. </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">The console wars ended a while ago</a>, in case you didn’t know. But if they were still raging on, a talented hardware modder in China created a device that would force a lasting peace. It’s a massive and very cleverly designed triangular box that contains an Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch 2. They all work and can be easily swapped between with the press of a button.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/modder-builds-all-in-one-console-with-ps5-xbox-series-x-and-switch-2-in-a-single-system-ningtendo-pxbox-5-powered-by-a-shared-250w-power-supply-mounted-inside-a-lost-wax-chassis">As first spotted by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>,</a> Chinese tech and computer expert <em>小宁子 XNZ&nbsp;</em><a href="https://youtu.be/FAIqzpbv9Xw">has created an all-in-one mega console</a> which she anointed the “Ningtendo PXBOX 5,” a name that just rolls right off the tongue. According to XNZ, the idea behind this wild device came from her wanting to play various console-exclusive games without having to get up and manually power on and off each machine to switch between them.</p>

  <p>The design of the monster machine is inspired by the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/112025">2013 Apple Mac Pro, aka the one that looked like a trash can</a>. And while she didn’t use the actual innards of an old Mac, the inside of that strange computer was a triangular setup that ended up being the perfect design to house three disassembled gaming consoles. A fan at the bottom is then used to cool the consoles.</p> <p>But creating a triangular heatsink for that would be expensive, so XNZ used an ancient method known as lost-wax casting to create the high-end piece of tech. Essentially, you first create an object out of an easy-to-melt piece of material, like wax or plastic, and then coat it in a heat-resistant material. Then you heat the object and all the soft insides melt and you can pour molten metal inside, which hardens and cools into your desired shape. Nifty!</p>

 <p>The end product is an impressive device but it might not be the most practical. The power supply she used only allows one console at a time to play a game, though the others can idle in the background. A big button on top switches the HDMI input between the consoles. Probably easier and cheaper to just buy the consoles and an HDMI switcher with a remote, but that’s not nearly as cool as the Ningtendo PXBOX 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span>-like cozy life sim </span><i><span>Heartopia </span></i><span>is one of the biggest new games on Steam this month. It’s also made with AI-generated content according to a new disclosure by the developers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Heartopia</span></i><span> is developer and publisher XD International’s answer to the question, “What if </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> was a chibi anime?” It dropped on January 17 following a wave of closed betas in both November and December 2025. Concurrent players peaked at over 35,000.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Reviews have been mixed, though. It currently sits at only a 66 percent positive rating on Steam. And many of the negative responses from players on Valve’s platform are taking issue with the developer not disclosing their use of AI-generated artwork in </span><i><span>Heartopia.</span></i></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661397"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661397">Discord</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“This game contains Generative AI (used to generate the puzzles), which they didn’t disclose until the accusations of it surfaced,” writes user </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/paruisfree/recommended/4025700/"><span>parupa206</span></a><span>. The use of AI wasn’t made public until </span><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/new-cosy-animal-crossing-gen-ai-053843-20260120"><i><span>GAMINGbible’s</span></i><span> Richard Breslin</span></a><span> emailed </span><i><span>Heartopia’s </span></i><span>UK PR team earlier this week. A statement from the developer appeared on Discord not that long after.</span></p> <p><span>“Monetization Content in Heartopia does not include AI-generated materials,” read part of the message to fans. “Should any AI-assisted content be used in the game in the future, it will be announced in advance. Marketing materials produced outside the game, including those created in collaboration with third-party suppliers, are not covered by the scope of this disclosure.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Since then, </span><i><span>Heartopia’s</span></i><span> Steam page has been updated to include a newly added “AI Generated Content Disclosure” section, which states that “AI is used in the puzzle gameplay to reinterpret and redraw in-game snapshot images” and that AI is also “used in in-game chat to help players understand different languages.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The devs have seemingly not apologized for not disclosing their use of AI-generated assets on Steam in any of the official </span><i><span>Heartopia </span></i><span>channels that I could find, and, given how </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZMFYb1_MWc"><span>blatantly obvious</span></a><span> its usage appears to be in its puzzle minigame, I’m not sure how they ever thought they’d get away with not disclosing this in the first place.</span></p>

            <guid>1411387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of the most popular <em>Fortnite</em> custom content creators and studios are using young women in their ads, but not making it clear whether the woman made the map or is just a spokesperson. This is causing frustration among some female <em>Fortnite</em> creators trying to find success online with their own maps.</p> <p>User-generated content is becoming a bigger and bigger part of Epic’s online battle royale metaverse, <em>Fortnite</em>. Some popular maps have tens of thousands of players online at one time. Some user-created maps and modes can even <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-only-up-steam-game-pc-uefn-epic-popular-1850615732">become more popular than <em>Fortnite’s</em> official modes.</a> And the creators and teams behind these maps can make a lot of money if one of their creations goes viral, thanks to Epic’s system for paying developers based on how long people play custom maps and how often they come back to them. Some creators are making millions of dollars from these maps.</p>

 <p>As you might expect, that amount of money floating around means there are people trying to gain any edge they can in the <em>Fortnite</em> clout economy, including misleading players about who is actually behind new user-generated content. <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/male-fortnite-creators-are-enlisting-young-women-to-market-their-maps-and-co-op-their-identities/">A new report from <em>GamesBeat</em></a> dives deep into the ongoing controversy around male <a href="https://fortnite.gg/creators"><em>Fortnite</em> creators</a> and large content studios primarily using young women in social videos and online posts without always disclosing how that woman is actually connected to the map or mode being advertised.</p> <p>Pandvil is one of the most followed and highest-earning <em>Fortnite</em> creators around. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSHB2XbEXF2/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&amp;img_index=4">And if you look at some</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSK2mtpjD1F/?hl=en">posts online,</a> you’d likely believe that Pandvil is a woman. There’s even a meme that references people discovering that the creator is a woman. However, that’s reportedly not the case. <em>GamesBeat</em> spoke to three individuals who have knowledge of the real-life creator’s identity and who claimed the woman seen in many of Pandvil’s videos isn’t the creator. Instead, she’s allegedly a social media manager employed by the creator’s studio, further blurring the lines between spokesperson and developer.</p>   <p>Pandvil seems to lean into the idea of him being a young woman, and he’s not alone. <em>GamesBeat</em> reports that <em>Fortnite</em> creators <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hivecr8/">Team Hive</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@unc.creative/video/7509941569529679126">UNC Creative</a> also post many videos online featuring women who aren’t the creators of the maps they’re promoting, though in Hive’s case, <a href="https://x.com/hivesisters/">they do openly employ women</a> who act as the studio’s social media and marketing team. And while women have been used to market products, including games, for a very long time, the parasocial nature of online creator spaces makes this different.</p>

 <p>If you’re just randomly scrolling through your feed and stumble upon one of these videos, you might assume the creator is the young woman in the video describing the new map or mode, not realizing she’s just a paid spokesperson or community manager. Other female island creators who spoke to <em>GamesBeat</em> shared frustrations and misgivings with this marketing strategy. They felt that it could hurt them financially by taking away possible media coverage and brand deals or siphoning away players.</p>

 <p>Mackenzie Bell, the co-founder of content studio <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fn_alliance/?hl=en">Alliance Studios</a>, didn’t blame creators for using women in ads, but instead wants Epic to improve the <em>Fortnite</em> creator ecosystem. “It’s less about calling out the individual creators or teams and more about addressing the overall systemic issues,” <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/male-fortnite-creators-are-enlisting-young-women-to-market-their-maps-and-co-op-their-identities/">Bell told <em>GamesBeat</em></a>. “If the platform and the creator economy balance itself better, with stronger discovery tools, more equitable payouts and support for diverse voices, I think creators wouldn’t feel as pressured to lean into potentially misleading marketing just to survive.”</p>
