              <p><span>The video game industry’s awards season was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>dominated</span></a><span> this year by adulation for French turn-based roleplaying game</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span>. It’s easy to see why so many people loved it, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119"><span>AI usage</span></a><span> and</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>controversial status</span></a><span> as an “indie” game aside, but my personal game of the year was a much smaller project that garnered a lot less attention: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/baby-steps"><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i></a><span>. Fortunately, at least one awards show is finally giving it the respect a bunch of us weirdos believe it deserves.</span></p> <p><span>The 2026 Independent Games Festival Awards released </span><a href="https://igf.com/article/baby-steps-strolls-to-lead-with-5-nominations-at-2026-igf-awards"><span>its list of nominees</span></a><span> on January 8, showcasing the incredible work of developers outside the AAA space. </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> managed to pick up nominations in five categories, including Excellence in Audio, Excellence in Design, Excellence in Narrative, the Nuovo Award (for “experiences that make the awards jurors think differently about games as a medium”), and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/baby-steps-qwop-indie-devolver-pc-ps5-new-trailer-1850521583"><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i></a><span> tells the story of Nate, a man transported from living in squalor in his parents’ basement to a magical world inhabited by long-dicked donkey men and Australians. Navigating this strange setting, at least on PlayStation 5, revolves around using the controller’s triggers to independently control Nate’s feet by lifting them off the ground, and the control stick to have Nate lean in whatever direction you intend on traveling. Even simple walking requires maintaining a rhythm, and things get even more difficult as you climb slippery slopes and awkward rockfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’m so happy to see </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> get this kind of recognition. Not only does it advance the nascent genre of physics-based “rage games” practically invented by co-developer Bennett Foddy (who previously made&nbsp;<em>QWOP </em>and <em>Getting Over It</em>),&nbsp;but it also manages to interrogate the very concept of challenging video game mechanics through both gameplay and narrative. Please play this game, and remember, </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> doesn’t want you to rage, it wants you to love yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>Offbeat local TV broadcast simulator</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/blippo-plus"> <i><span>Blippo+</span></i></a><span>, surreal strategy game</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/titanium-court"> <i><span>Titanium Court</span></i></a><span>, and the bafflingly controversial</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><i><span>Horses</span></i></a><span> also received multiple nominations. After seeing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>the Game Awards</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260115137649/en/Finalists-Announced-for-the-26th-Annual-Game-Developers-Choice-Awards-Led-by-Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-With-Eight-Total-Nominations"><span>the Game Developers Choice Awards</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/29th_dice_awards_finalists_93k3p1.asp"><span>the DICE Awards</span></a><span> focus almost exclusively on </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> and other mainstream, AAA fare, it’s refreshing to know there are still shows dedicated to plumbing the depths of the medium rather than remaining at surface level.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Furthermore, this year’s show features a new category honoring games made by women and other gender-marginalized developers in collaboration with investment fund</span> <a href="https://www.wingsfund.me/"><span>Wings Interactive</span></a><span>. Each award comes bundled with a $2,000 bonus, apart from the grand prize which awards $20,000.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/i-cant-stop-flicking-coins-and-hiring-tiny-dudes-in-this-new-steam-game-2000660664</link>
            <guid>1408786</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I have two monitors on my desk. Normally, the left one is reserved for work chat, and the other I use for writing and for checking the web. But lately, something else has been hanging out in the corner of my left monitor: <em>Gambler’s Table</em>, a new idle coin-flipping game out now on Steam, that I can’t stop playing.</p> <p>The goal of <em>Gambler’s Table</em> is to click a coin to flip it over. And then flip it again. And then again. And again. And again. When this coin lands with the money symbol facing up, you get a dollar. When it lands heads up, showing a skull, you get a skull point that can be used to buy hats.</p>

 <p>Don’t worry about that. Just keep flipping. Quickly, you’ll have enough money to buy a second coin to flip. And then a third coin. A fourth coin. That’s a lot of coins to flip by yourself!</p> <p>Don’t worry,<em> Gambler’s Table</em> has little minion men you can buy who will also flip coins for you. As you rack up more money, you can buy upgrades that make coins flip faster and increase their profit per flip. Eventually, you’ll get silver coins. And gold coins. Before long, you’ll be waving your cursor around to flip dozens of coins in seconds, thanks to an upgrade that removes the need for clicking. Earn enough money, and a skill point will be provided, offering a powerful upgrade that is permanent. Then you can wipe the whole table to start over, earning even more money and getting another skill point in the process. Repeat…forever?</p>

  <p>A part of me understands that what I’m doing is mindless and that I’m only doing it because, like so many gamers, I have a need to see numbers go up. And yet, I keep flipping coins, building up a massive amount of money, wiping the table clean of all coins and minions, and starting over. Every so often, I stop and use my skull points to buy a new hat for my minion. It’s my treat to them for flipping coins. Then I catch them resting on the job and have to give them a hard poke to get them back to work. Coins won’t flip themselves, you know? We all have a job to do here at <em>Gambler’s Table.</em></p>

 <p>In fact, I’m wasting a lot of time right now writing this when I could be over there, on my other screen, flipping coins. My minion boys are doing it. But if I helped them, things would go so much faster. So I’m done telling you about <em>Gambler’s Table.</em> I don’t have any time to tell you about its incredibly smooth animations and wonderful coin-flipping noises. Nor can I talk about the sillier upgrades that are available later, and the wonderful effect that happens when you wipe the table clean for a new run. I have coins to flip, damn it. Now leave me be.</p>

 <p><em>Editor’s note:</em> In the hours since receiving this blog from Zack, we’ve not heard from him. Emails and texts have been ignored. His wife called and said the door to his basement office is locked, but she can hear a clicking noise and what sounds like someone humming “Flip…flip…flip…flip.” We are hopeful Zack will return soon.</p>
