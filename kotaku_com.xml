            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> endgame is pretty hectic, so by the time you reach the post-game, you might be overstimulated and overlook some of the ways things have changed in your home base of Hotel Z. There’s an entirely missable epilogue of sorts for a character that even gives you a free Pokémon with ties to someone from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-best-worst-games-ranked-red-blue-scarlet-violet-1849984595"><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i></a><span>. We’ll start with a spoiler-free explanation of where to go and what to look for, then we’ll dive into the details.</span></p> <p><span>As soon as you beat the final boss, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>the credits roll</span></a><span>, and when you’re finally given back control of your character, you’ll find a Poké Ball sitting on the table in your hotel room. It’s entirely possible to miss and walk right past it because </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t direct your attention to it, but this Poké Ball contains a Pokémon you’ve already met on your journey, and a note from an old friend. Now that you know where to go, let’s unpack this.</span></p>

  <p><span>The Poké Ball has AZ’s Lucario, which you used much earlier in the game to learn how to use Mega Evolution. But this Lucario wasn’t always AZ’s. The 3000-year-old war criminal (who has never done anything wrong in his life) was gifted this fighting/steel monster by “a certain trainer” who hoped it would be able to keep him safe in Lumiose City. If you examine Lucario’s stats, you’ll see its original trainer is listed as Korrina. If you don’t know or remember who that is, Korrina is the fighting-type gym leader in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. She also gave the player a Lucario in those games as well. While Korrina doesn’t actually appear in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, she’s still indirectly helping the player out.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Alongside Lucario’s Poké Ball, you’ll find a letter from AZ written before his passing. In it, he reflects on his 3000 years, including when he originally received his partner Floette, the Kalos War thousands of years prior that led to the events of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, the first time he saw a Pokémon undergo Mega Evolution, and when he saw the “dark day” fall over Galar, the region in </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This is in reference to what is colloquially known as the Darkest Day, in which a Legendary Pokémon called Eternatus caused the Pokémon of the region to undergo forced Dynamax transformations, which turn Pokémon into kaiju-like giants. The monsters nearly destroyed the region, but the entire event came to an end when the two Kings of Galar defeated Eternatus. The event was “recreated” in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, but AZ was alive for the original one.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By itself, this might just seem like a bit of extra world-building, but given that we know through </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>the Teraleak</span></a><span> that the next </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game may be a historical Galar game, AZ might appear in a future game, despite his death in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. Even if we never knew anything about the leaks, this line would likely have sparked speculation that the next </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game would go back to the past like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>. It feels like Game Freak is still solidifying what the </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> moniker means, and if it keeps bouncing around the timeline like this, maybe the subseries will just be a place for the team to experiment and fill in lore gaps without any hard rules.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-25-244hz-gaming-monitor-at-record-low-now-costs-the-same-as-a-budget-display-2000639677</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-25%E2%80%B3-244hz-gaming-monitor-at-record-low-now-costs-the-same-as-a-budget-display.1338019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re approaching the holidays fairly fast, but the big holiday sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a month away. Luckily, you can still find some good opportunities to save even right now. If you’re a PC gamer in the market for a new primary or secondary monitor, now’s a great time to jump on it because Amazon has the <strong>Samsung Odyssey G4 gaming monitor</strong> on sale for 29% off: It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5081/">normally listed at $280, but the discount has it knocked down in price by $80, bringing what you have to pay down to an even $200</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This 25-inch monitor from Samsung is capable of delivering a clear depth of colors in a 1080p FHD resolution. It’s got a fast response time of just 1ms with a smooth refresh rate of 240Hz. The screen eliminates lag and will make any game that relies on fast inputs and quick reaction times a dream to play. That pogo platforming section in Hunter’s March from <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> can be significantly easier on a better monitor.</p>
<p>The monitor has NVIDIA G-SYNC which is able to keep your GPU and panel synchronized. What this does is eliminate choppiness, screen-lag, and image tears. AMD FreeSync Premium can also help to ensure better stability and a stutter-free gameplay experience.</p>
<p>With this monitor, you can connect your PC or gaming console over either of the two HDMI inputs or through the DisplayPort input. If you have multiple sources connected to your Samsung Odyssey G4 display, the monitor can auto-detect when a new source signal is plugged in or turned on, changing the input over so you don’t have to manually. Get into the action faster.</p>



<h2>Optimal Viewing</h2>
<p>This Samsung monitor is built with an ergonomic stand which can be raised and lowered to your liking. Tilt the angle of the screen toward or away from you to find the optimal viewing for how and where you are seated or standing at your desk. The screen can even be rotated to go either horizontal or vertical. This makes for a wondering secondary monitor. Keeping you main screen horizontal front and center is ideal for longer gaming sessions so you neck is always straight as your facing forward. Then you can have a second monitor positioned to the side of it vertically. This is great for Discord, Slack, or any kind of message apps so you can see more of the conversation at once.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-liquidates-its-mic-mini-at-a-record-low-noise-cancelling-and-hq-audio-now-cost-peanuts-2000639685</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-liquidates-its-mic-mini-at-a-record-low-noise-cancelling-and-hq-audio-now-cost-peanuts.1337992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shooting high-quality video with exceptional vibrancy and just the right angles is just half the story. You need clean audio to get the message, excitement and even frustration across. Most cameras out there have built-in microphones but they are not always enough: If you want that professional audio that cuts through background chatter and reaches with exceptional clarity, it might be time <strong>for a proper wireless mic system</strong>.</p>
<p>DJI – one of our favorite go-to brands for cameras – also has a solid lineup of wireless microphones and we just spotted an option going for less. The DJI Mic Mini, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">which typically retails for $119, is now going for just $74 at Amazon, after a generous 38% discount</a>. It’s the lowest price we’ve seen in the past 30 days; even Prime Day didn’t bring it this low. We recommend grabbing it sooner rather than later, as the offer might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Range With Two Noise Cancellation Modes</h2>
<p>This setup gives you two transmitters and one receiver, so it’s perfect for when you’re shooting with more than one user. Each transmitter is small, lightweight, and can be worn/clipped easily. It doesn’t feel bulky or look unpleasant on camera. Despite its tiny size, it offers a maximum transmission range of 400 meters for stronger signals both indoors and outdoors. Recording in those busy streets and jam-packed cafeterias won’t be a problem, ever again.</p>
<p>You’re also getting two noise cancellation modes; basic and strong. The basic mode is ideal for relatively quieter environments, like your home, while the strong mode is more appropriate for noisier settings. It also comes with an automatic limiting feature that reduces volume spikes and maintains a consistent tone; your audience won’t be hit with an unexpected jumpscare mid-video.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 10 hours of operating time on both the transmitters and the receiver. This is more than enough for longer shoots, and you can even go a couple of days without plugging them in. The DJI Mic Mini also plays well with a wide range of devices. Even without the receiver, you can pair the transmittor with DJI devices like the Osmo Pocket 3 and Osmo Action 5 Pro.</p>
<p>In the box, you’ll find two transmitters, one receiver, a mobile adapter, a camera audio cable, clip magnets, windscreens, a charging dock, and a carrying pouch. Keep in mind that the offer might end soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clears-out-some-star-wars-sets-ahsoka-tanos-duel-on-peridea-is-going-for-peanuts-2000639650</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-clears-out-some-star-wars-sets-ahsoka-tano%E2%80%99s-duel-on-peridea-is-going-for-peanuts.1337926/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If I try to think of brands that appeal to everyone across all ages and gender, the one that pops into my mind front and center has got to be LEGO. Whether you’re a kid or just a kid at heart, there is joy to be found in building a LEGO set. Assembling LEGO bricks piece by piece, can be a mindful, rewarding, and enjoyable activity. Then by the send of it, you have some cool <em>Star Wars</em> or <em>Marvel</em> toy to play with or display on your shelf.</p>
<p>The only catch is that LEGO sets can get pretty pricey, and when they do actually go on sale, it’s usually not by a lot or it sells out almost immediately. That’s what when a big sale does kick in, it’s hard to pass it up. Right now, this LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano set depicting the duel on Peridea has dropped in price:&nbsp;With the 40% off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/">you end up saving $22 as the price comes down to just $33 (down from $55) for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>From the <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em> Season 1 Finale</h2>
<p>There are too many Star Wars LEGO sets to count, and even a small handful depicting scenes from the recent Disney Plus show <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em>. This set portrays <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s duel on Peridea against Grand Admiral Thrawn’s army</strong> from the final episode of the show’s first season.</p>



<p>The <strong>382-piece set designed for ages eight and up</strong> includes five minifigures of characters from the show: We have <strong>Ahsoka Tano, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Morgan Elsbeth, Ezra Bridger and a Night Trooper</strong>. The buildable brick platform they fight on features three built-in turntables which can spin each minifigure allowing you to recreate their dynamic battle. You can even reenact Ezra’s leap off the platform with the launchpad.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p>Right now, the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s Duel on Peridea is discounted down to its lowest price yet of just $33.</p>
