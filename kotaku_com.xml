It’s been a lot like when the Dancing Hot Dog Snapchat filter was having a moment back in 2017. That was kind of fun. </p><p> Except that this time around, it’s a company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/openai-expects-revenue-will-triple-to-12point7-billion-this-year-sources-say.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/openai-expects-revenue-will-triple-to-12point7-billion-this-year-sources-say.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">valued at over $250 billion</a></span> who keeps promising it will invent Artificial General Intelligence that will completely change the world and is instead just burning billions in investor capital to provide random internet users (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1905332049021415862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1905332049021415862%7Ctwgr%5Eeb2bdaa41bacb00fe47c6d77d53d124ce5ce9b24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fwhite-house-deportation-ai-ghibli-animation-cartoon_n_67e5b4ace4b0455df70b41c2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1905332049021415862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1905332049021415862%7Ctwgr%5Eeb2bdaa41bacb00fe47c6d77d53d124ce5ce9b24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fwhite-house-deportation-ai-ghibli-animation-cartoon_n_67e5b4ace4b0455df70b41c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or the White House</a></span>) with more ways <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/quantian1/status/1904870047698346191&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/quantian1/status/1904870047698346191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to shitpost</a></span> or delude themselves into thinking they are doing art by typing prompts into a chat field.

Also the stuff people are making doesn’t even look cool. </p><p>Exhibit A is a trailer for Peter Jackson’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy by PJ Ace that’s ben re-rendered using OpenAI’s hallucination of what a Studio Ghibili movie might look like. I organically encountered it earlier today when scrolling through Reels on Instagram. I then saw it spread to LinkedIn and Bluesky. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3llfbkwqqrs2n&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3llfbkwqqrs2n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some people</a></span> were very impressed by it, or at least pretending to be in order to continue hyping up the next promised revolution in moviemaking and their self-identified role as an important voice in that new creative world order. </p><p>Look, I’m not above looking at random AI slop in my Instagram feed. My favorite two genres are <em>Warhammer 40K</em>-style imaginings of the Roman Empire if it had never fallen and was colonizing the galaxy, and AI-invented slideshows of what life was back in the ‘90s while spooky melancholy music plays. The algorithm knows what I’m a sucker for, and on more than one occasion I’ve been willing to prove it right. </p><p>But Studio Ghibli <em>Lord of the Rings</em> lost me within five seconds. The edits are crude. The animation is stilted. The colors are flat. The compositions are boring. While talking, everyone’s mouth looks like it’s in the middle of a dental exam. Discernable facial expressions are nonexistent. And the Ghibli-fication, such as it exists, is almost exclusively about rounding off corners and turning people’s faces into beige ovals with big anime eyes while the landscapes and backgrounds that are usually what give Ghibli films so much texture, richness, and vitality all look like<em> The Simpsons</em> by way of the Lo-Fi Beats Girl’s color palette. </p><p>PJ Ace wrote that he spent nine hours and $250 on generating the clip. For just $50 more he could have purchased the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://shoutfactory.com/products/the-world-of-studio-ghibli-blu-ray-bundle?variant=40675649028230&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;adpos=&amp;scid=scplp826663241822KIT&amp;sc_intid=826663241822KIT&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkZm_BhDrARIsAAEbX1HkPi3-yongu5u1OvJ9WtVk5lnw7TgW1l3vMX1JWvR0gNaLWQJpMqoaAg6zEALw_wcB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://shoutfactory.com/products/the-world-of-studio-ghibli-blu-ray-bundle?variant=40675649028230&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;adpos=&amp;scid=scplp826663241822KIT&amp;sc_intid=826663241822KIT&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkZm_BhDrARIsAAEbX1HkPi3-yongu5u1OvJ9WtVk5lnw7TgW1l3vMX1JWvR0gNaLWQJpMqoaAg6zEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entire 22-film World of Studio Ghibli Bluray bundle</a></span>. It would have occupied way more than nine ours of his time with beautiful animated storytelling. Most importantly, it wouldn’t have required large-scale artistic theft to earn five seconds of viral fame on social media. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No, it was nothing quite as colossal as <em>God of War </em>or <em>The Last of Us </em>coming to the handheld console, but a remaster of the first two <em>Patapons </em>and the next game in the <em>Everybody’s Golf </em>series will be available on Switch. Both are coming to the system through a partnership with Bandai Namco, which also recently brought the cult Vita RPG <em>Freedom Wars</em> to the system earlier this year, but Sony also brought <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a></span><em> </em>to the system on its own in 2024. At the moment, Sony only seems to be putting “smaller” titles on Nintendo’s platform, but if PlayStation is open to sharing more of its catalog with Switch owners, I can think of a few more that would fit right in.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Ape Escape </em>series got a bit of a spotlight again last year as one of the games featured in <em>Astro Bot</em>. PlayStation fans still have a soft spot for the long-dormant platformers, and their simple loop of chasing and catching apes is much better suited to a handheld like the Switch than a big-box console these days. If Sony were looking to test the waters for bringing the series back, putting something on the Switch, which has a much larger audience of young players than other platforms do, seems like a solid business plan. </p></div><div><p>It’s easy to forget that <em>Gravity Rush </em>started out as a handheld game, but the original open-world action game was a Vita exclusive for three years until Sony remastered it for the PS4 in 2015. <em>Gravity Rush </em>and its sequel are two deeply underappreciated gems in Sony’s catalog that deserved better than they got. The gravity-bending mechanics are an incredibly clever way to handle open-world traversal, letting you “fall” from one side of the map to the other rather than just using straightforward flight. It requires you to pay attention to physics in the environment, and you also use it to collide with your foes. It’s such an interesting spin on how we move through video game worlds that it’s a shame more people haven’t played it. Just port ‘em to Switch, Sony.</p></div><div><p>Sony seems ready to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/little-big-planet-3-lbp3-all-dlc-delisted-removed-ps4-1851667727&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/little-big-planet-3-lbp3-all-dlc-delisted-removed-ps4-1851667727">abandon its platformer/level creation suite</a></span>, so I don’t have much hope that <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>will make an appearance on PlayStation consoles again, much less on Switch. But the entire premise of this list is pie-in-the-sky requests. <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>’s platforming is floaty, frustrating and doesn’t hold a candle to better games like the <em>Mario </em>series that are readily available on Switch. However, its level creation tools are still some of the best on the market. <em>LittleBigPlanet PS Vita</em> already demonstrated that the series is well-suited to handhelds, so a Switch version seems like a no-brainer.</p></div><div><p>I wouldn’t have thought there was any hope of <em>LocoRoco</em> making a comeback in 2025, but after seeing <em>Patapon </em>remasters announced for Switch, I can dare to dream. The PlayStation Portable series was built to be on a handheld. As you tilted the world with the shoulder buttons, it felt like you were controlling a world inside the device’s tiny screen. Sure, the same control scheme applies to the PS4 version on your TV, but it still feels most natural on a handheld. If we’re bringing bite-sized cult classics like <em>Patapon </em>to Switch, <em>LocoRoco </em>should be in the running as well.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Medievil </em>series deserves a new entry on PlayStation 5, but I will settle for seeing the existing games brought to the Switch. To this day, there’s no simple way to play <em>Medievil 2 </em>unless you’ve got a spare PlayStation lying around, though the original spooky hack-and-slash game was remade for the PS4 in 2019. Sir Daniel Fortesque’s Tim Burton-esque adventures have gotten more chances than most of Sony’s original PlayStation gems to re-enter the public consciousness after being remade for both the PlayStation Portable and PS4, but I simply don’t think twice is enough. The third time’s the charm. Put our haggard hero on Nintendo’s handheld, Sony.</p></div><div><p>I simply don’t think there is an excuse for <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>not to be on every platform imaginable. The PS1 and 2 rhythm games are hardly demanding for any modern device to run and the original has already been remastered for the PS4. A new generation of players needs to hear Chop Chop Master Onion teach karate by way of hip-hop. Why deny the millions of Switch owners the experience of rapping their way through their driver’s test or rap-battling their teachers in the line for the bathroom? Now I’m pulling up YouTube videos of all these songs, and they’re all bangers. Like <em>Medievil</em>, it’s time <em>Parappa </em>got a new game, but in the meantime, put these tracks on Switch, Sony.</p></div><div><p>Alright, here’s the real reason I made this list. I’m here to put <em>Sly Cooper </em>propaganda on your screen. Fans are still holding out hope that Sony will one day greenlight a fifth game in the heist platformer series that will resolve the cliffhanger ending of <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>, but in the years since, the Vita has still been my go-to place to play Sucker Punch’s PS2 trilogy, and I gotta blow an inch of dust off that thing if I ever want to see the Cooper Gang. That could all be changed if Sony would put the games on the Switch. I still think the <em>Sly Cooper </em>games are some of the most timeless games in PlayStation’s long history, which makes it a real shame that Sucker Punch and Sony stopped investing in them during the PS3 era. Yeah, <em>Thieves in Time </em>was a passion project from Sanzaru Games that was divisive but nailed the smooth and simple stealth mechanics that made them so successful back in the day. Sony, if you ignore everything else I have said here, don’t ignore this. Put <em>Sly Cooper </em>on the Switch. And PC. And hell, put it on Xbox while you’re at it. Have you considered a mobile port? </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
