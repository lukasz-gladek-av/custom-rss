            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The <i>Gears of War </i>franchise has a long history as one of Xbox’s most beloved properties, but the times are changing. Though it has seen life on PC in the past, <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> marks the time the series has made the move to a Sony platform. Yep, this substantial remaster of the first game in the franchise is finally available on PS5 (as well as Xbox and PC) with all the bells and whistles you’d expect, so it’s time to pick up a chainsaw and start chewing through the Locust horde.</p> <p>If you’d like to go online with <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i>, however, you’ll probably want to link up with your gaming posse. Blasting bodies apart with shotguns is better with friends, after all. So, let’s see if <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> has crossplay support and whether or not you can carry your progress between platforms.</p>  <p>If you’re looking to jump into gory gunfights together with friends, I’ve got some really great news for you! <b><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i></b><b> offers full cross-play support</b>, meaning you can team up with anyone across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC ecosystems. Regardless of platform, you’ll all need to be signed into your Microsoft accounts to make this happen, but <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account">that’s easy enough to set up</a>.</p>

 <p>Crossplay is available for both co-op and competitive multiplayer modes, so you and some friends are free to tackle the campaign or frag nerds online. But whatever you do, just don’t kill me. I’m really bad at <i>Gears</i> multiplayer, so you have to be nice. Mom said so.</p> <h2>Does <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> have cross-progression?</h2> <p>In another twist of good news in a world filled with bad news, <b><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i></b><b> also supports cross-progression</b>. With this feature, your progress can transfer between any platform on which you own the game. So, if you started on PC and decided you wanted to swap over to PS5, that’d be no problem at all! You’d just need to re-buy the game on Sony’s platform, and then you can pick up right where you left off.</p> <p>Cross-progression works for both your campaign and multiplayer progress, so you’ll lose nothing when swapping back and forth. Again, you’ll need a Microsoft account to use this feature, but that’s to be expected.</p> <hr> <p><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> is available August 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-knock-out-this-fun-3d-platformer-in-under-10-hours.1271781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If you’re the kind of person who likes quirky platformers with a whole lot of charm and whimsy, you may have your eyes set on <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i>. In this bizarre 3D platformer, you’re cast as the titular character who possesses the ability to copy and paste textures, allowing you to change the world around you to solve puzzles and reach new areas.</p> <p><i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> can be a whole lot of fun if you’re able to brave its frenetic gameplay and art style. But you may be wondering how long it’ll take you to reach the end of this rowdy adventure and how much extra content there is to dive into. Let’s answer that for you below.</p> <p><b>If you’re just mainlining </b><b><i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i></b><b>‘s campaign, you can likely reach the end of the game in about 6-8 hours</b>. This makes it notably shorter than some similar 3D platformers, but its wacky gameplay and clever puzzles ensure that not a moment is wasted. Even so, you may wish for a few extra hours when you realize how brief the main quest is, especially if you really click with the Swap ability and enjoy blasting textures all over the map.</p>

 <p>Luckily, there are a lot of optional things to do in <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> that can extend your time with the game, especially if you’re aiming to obtain all of its trophies or achievements. You’ll need to find a variety of optional secrets and collectibles, as well as swap textures over a thousand times. But given that a large part of the gameplay loop involves the Swap ability, you’ll be well on your way to that one anyway.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking to push through the campaign or track down every secret, you can get started doing so right away. <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[If You’re On The Lookout For A Short, Worthwhile Horror Game, Check Out Ratshaker]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ratshaker-playstation-store-horror-hltb-psn-2000618066</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you%E2%80%99re-on-the-lookout-for-a-short-worthwhile-horror-game-check-out-ratshaker.1271751/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If you look at <i>Ratshaker</i> on the PlayStation store, you might be inclined to write it off as one of hundreds of shovelware games on storefronts designed for easy trophies. I know I did at first. But then, I saw the game gaining traction across multiple subreddits where plenty of users seemed to agree that it’s actually a surreal horror title worth the low cost of entry — I checked it out. I’m glad I did.</p> <p>While <i>Ratshaker</i> may have a low-res visual style, brief runtime, and fairly easy trophy list, it manages to rise above the trappings of shovelware to be something that diehard horror fans can appreciate. The game tasks you with, well, shaking and squeezing a rat to solve some basic adventure-style puzzles around a home where something horrible has happened. Yeah, it’s fucking weird.</p> <p>But while <i>Ratshaker</i>‘s simple premise initially leans toward being quirky and funny in its delivery, don’t let that fool you. As you further explore the home and peel back what happened there, <i>Ratshaker</i> reveals some truly unnerving events that may stick in your head for a while. If that sounds up your alley, here’s how long it’ll take you to beat this bizarre experience.</p>

 <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Ratshaker</i>?</h2> <p><i>Ratshaker</i> is a cheap game with a short runtime, so you shouldn’t go in expecting an epic adventure. Instead, <b>you’re treated to an immensely strange horror mystery that will take about an hour to unravel</b>. But the brief time you spend with <i>Ratshaker</i> will feel like enough. It’s a game that doesn’t <i>need</i> much time to tell its story, which ends up far more unsettling than you may expect, even after engaging with its disturbing opening.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618068">© Screenshot: Sunscorched Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re also playing <i>Ratshaker</i> for its fairly easy platinum trophy, be aware that there are missable trophies throughout the adventure. And you’ll technically need to see both the real ending and a secret ending to earn the platinum trophy, but you can do both on one playthrough if you manage your saves right. Following a guide can help you not miss out on these trophies if you’re not eager to play <i>Ratshaker</i> twice.</p> <p>Even if you’re not seeking the easy platinum trophy, I’d argue that the low price and ominous vibes make <i>Ratshaker</i> a good grab for any horror fan who appreciates weird shit. It’s available now on PS5 and Windows PCs, with a release on additional platforms planned for later this summer. Shake that rat.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[6 Things We Just Learned About Borderlands 4]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-things-we-just-learned-about-borderlands-4.1271541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The overwhelming consensus among the first hands-on demos with <em>Borderlands 4</em> earlier this summer was that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-4-hands-on-preview/">it’s more of the same</a>. If you already like <em>Borderlands</em>, the sequel is likely to provide everything fans usually show up for. If not, well, TBD on how many nonbelievers Gearbox Entertainment manages to win over with its most ambitious looter shooter yet. Much of that will come down to the details, and the studio has been sharing a lot of them recently. Here’s a bunch of stuff we learned <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">about <em>Borderlands 4</em> this week</a>.</p> <h2>Split-screen co-op returns</h2> <p>Senior project producer Anthony Nicholson<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/12/how-borderlands-4-built-for-co-op-ground-up/"> wrote on Xbox Wire this week</a> that in addition to supporting local co-op, <em>Borderlands 4</em> will also let you play with another pair of people in split-screen mode. Two TVs, four-player sessions, tons of chaos. Teaming up has also apparently been streamlined with a better lobby system and improved dynamic level scaling, including the option for each player to set their own difficulty.</p> <h2>Switch 2 won’t have couch co-op</h2> <p>“Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full cross-play with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S,” reads <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNFY9RTPMT184WZ70D421">the Nintendo version’s support page</a>. The port targets 30fps and arrives on October 3, roughly three weeks after the platforms.</p>

 <h2>There are over 30 billion guns</h2> <p>Yes, that’s a real stat Gearbox is pushing. One of the reasons for that big number is that <em>Borderlands 4</em> lets you mix-and-match elements from different in-universe weapons manufacturers. Then there are all of the RNG stat and perk drops you can get. According to Nicholson, the studio created a Matrix-like gun rack to help conceptualize all the possibilities and prevent the game from spitting out combinations that wouldn’t work.</p> <p>“It was this really large gun map where you could see all of the individual parts for all the individual guns, for all the individual manufacturers,” he <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">told the Epic Games Store blog</a>. “It made it so you could see how each of those things were and how we could have those combinations roll together and how they would work—the slides, the animators, the actions, the art all fitting together. Because a certain gun, if it pumps one way, but there’s a long barrel that goes on the bottom, obviously those parts can’t go together.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> has “more passive perks than all the previous <em>Borderlands</em> combined”</h2> <p>Size matters, at least for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1lh1qm0/borderlands_4_long_info_dump_compiled_from_32/">Gearbox’s marketing guys</a>. The <em>Borderlands 4</em> map is bigger than the last two numbered entries combined. The guns have four times as many polygons as <em>Borderlands 3</em>. All those billions of guns. You get the idea. The skill tree follows a similar pattern. It sounds more advanced, and potentially overwhelming, than any game prior—more <em>Diablo 4</em> or<em> Path of Exile</em> than your traditional RPG shooter.</p>

 <p>“The Augment and the Capstone system that we have forces you to make a choice and all of them drastically change the ability that each player has,” character designer Nick Thurston <a href="https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-passive-perks-interview-gearbox/">told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “That <em>alone&nbsp;</em>would create more build diversity than we’ve ever had. But then we also have more passives than all the previous Borderlands combined. I think Amon alone has 87 passives, and most Vault Hunters have about 80.”</p> <h2>Techno Viking Amon is<em> Borderland</em>‘s “most complicated” Vault Hunter yet</h2> <p>Amon is the guy with the big fire and ice axes you see in all the <em>Borderlands 4</em> trailers. But looks can be deceiving. He’s not just a tanky melee character. He’s apparently the poster child for the new game’s build variety. Everyone in a squad could play as Amon, but the styles might all be different, Gearbox claims. Melee, ranged, support, he can do it all. Unlike most of the franchise’s Vault Hunters that pop abilities and then just shoot stuff, Amon’s skills can be deployed in more ways.</p>

 <p>“He just has more abilities than any other Vault Hunter numerically because of his trait, which allows him to have forge skills,” Thurston <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-amon-is-a-more-complicated-vault-hunter-to-play-than-past-options/1100-6533956/">told <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “I wouldn’t say he’s super complicated, but he has a lot more going on in the middle of combat, and he’s a lot more active than I think a lot of people historically expect from Vault Hunters.” He sounds like a more advanced archetype than some of the others, though Gearbox says he’s still approachable to new players.</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> is inspired by mergers, acquisitions, and fascism</h2> <p>The game takes place on a prison planet called Kairos. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford suggests that’s a not-so-subtle illusion to the studio’s rocky period during which it was sold to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-gearbox-embracer-acquisition-1851297286">poorly conceived Embracer holding company</a>, before trying to escape again. The studio group is now owned by longtime publishing partner 2K Games, part of the broader Take-Two portfolio that includes <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> maker Rockstar Games and mobile maker Zynga.</p> <p>“There’s this cultural and emotional shift in me, personally, and at the studio. What does it mean to trade some autonomy for organization?” he told <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">the Epic Games Store blog</a>: “What does it feel like to move up and down the scale between autonomy and being organized or even being controlled? On one end of a spectrum you have anarchy, and on the other end of the spectrum you have fascism, totalitarianism, zero freedom. It’s not just about societies—that’s all of us as individuals, to imagine where we want to be on that spectrum and how comfortable we are. And we were going through that as a company.”</p>
