              <p><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>, Riot Games’ free-to-play </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> fighting game, released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series consoles yesterday after roughly 18 months of closed beta tests. While it’s too early to comment on the overall quality of </span><i><span>2XKO’s</span></i><span> gameplay, PlayStation 5 players aren’t too impressed with its performance.</span></p> <p><span>After roughly 18 months of closed betas and “Alpha Lab” playtests, Riot Games has finally released its beginner-friendly, free-to-play (but microtransaction-heavy) fighting game </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>in full. There’s no critical consensus regarding </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span> yet. At launch there aren’t even <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/2xko/">any reviews of the console version</a>.&nbsp; B</span><span>ut I sunk a couple of hours into it this morning and can confirm that it’s still just as good as it was during the last closed beta.</span></p>

 <p><span>Little caveat there: I played on PC. </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>has technically been available on PC in early access since October 7, 2025, but only officially launched on Xbox Series S/X and PS5 on January 20. This is relevant because, according to the numerous posts that have popped up on the r/2XKO subreddit over the past 24 hours, the PS5 version of the game has a few performance-related issues.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch. Extreme screen tearing in fights, lags in matches and in lobbies, horrible monetization.</p> <p>There’s a great fighting game here but it’s dying by 1000 cuts. <a href="https://t.co/w4jT0pyN5m">pic.twitter.com/w4jT0pyN5m</a></p> <p>— reyna cervantes (@Jfcdoomblade) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>As detailed in the most active PS5-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/game_runs_like_total_ass_on_the_ps5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>thread</span></a><span> on the subreddit, titled “Game runs like total ass on the ps5,” PlayStation players have reported that they’re experiencing crashes, frequent FPS drops and, most commonly, heavy screen tearing.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I’m not having FPS drops (though I’m on PS5 Pro), but the screen tearing is horrendous,” writes user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0t6r6l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>trugay</span></a><span>. “It’s the worst I’ve ever seen on a console title. It makes this a fairly disappointing release. I’m enjoying the game and its mechanics, but this is really dampening the experience.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Over on Twitter, user </span><a href="https://x.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644"><span>Jfcdoomblade</span></a><span> uploaded a clip of the FPS drops in action and stated that “2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch.”</span></p> <p><span>Oddly enough, I was unable to find any similar complaints from Xbox Series users. In fact, the only Xbox-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qir40k/having_a_blast_on_xbox_so_fun/"><span>thread</span></a><span> I could find was from one user gushing about how much fun they’re having.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note here that the screen tearing issue can’t be properly replicated through recorded footage, as screen tearing occurs through the monitor used to display the image. PS5 owners have theorized that the screen tearing issue in </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>may only occur when the game is played on a 120hz screen.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re confused as to why the same issue isn’t popping up for PC players who are using 120hz monitors, PS5 users have </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0tfyys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>further theorized</span></a><span> that this may be due to an issue with how v-sync has been implemented on the PlayStation 5 version of </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>.</span></p>

              <p>The very first design for Pokémon mascot Pikachu was a delightfully chubby little fellow. Chunkachu, as it’s lovingly known, was Mitsuhiro Arita’s original drawing for the 1996 Japanese Pokémon card, and it gave the yellow mouse a lot more to love than he has in most modern renditions. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of <em>Pokémon</em> this year, Takara Tomy is releasing a proper chungus of a plushie in that original design.</p> <p>It’s going to be a very busy year for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>. 2026 is the 30th anniversary of not only the release of the very first&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> games, Japan’s <em>Pocket Monsters </em><em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> on February 27 of 1996, but also the very first Japanese <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards with October 20, 1996’s 1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack, meaning the celebrations are going to last the whole year. And that’s a very good excuse to remember how Pikachu used to look, both in the game and on the cards, before he got the Mounjaro.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661887"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661887">© Tomy / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The new plush comes not from The Pokémon Company and isn’t available on its various Pokémon Center stores, but rather is being sold by toy giant <a href="https://takaratomymall.jp/shop/g/g8202602097181/">Takara Tomy</a>, and currently only in Japan. The extremely cuddle-able stuffed toy is 7,480 yen, or about $47, which isn’t too bad for a 40 cm tall cuddly. At the time of writing it’s sold out on Tomy’s site, though more expensive options for purchase still seem to pop up on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0GG8Y6125?th=1">Amazon’s Japanese site</a>.</p> <p>Chunkachu has been celebrated across the decades in <em>Pokémon</em>, not least with the design of the monster’s <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/vmaxclimax/46.jpg">VMAX incarnation</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/25thanniversarycollection/1.jpg">updated versions of the original artwork</a> appearing during the 25th anniversary celebrations. But for the most part, the far more slimmed-down rendition of Pikachu is the recognizable emblem of the entire franchise. And fair enough—name a beloved cartoon character that didn’t look all kinds of weirdly different in their first form than the version we got used to. Oh my dear god, original Garfield.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661873"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661873">© Jim Davis</figcaption></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Announces A Brutal New Restructuring With More Investment In Gen AI And Further Job Cuts]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869</link>
            <guid>1412194</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The French publisher behind <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is planning <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">even more cuts</a>, delays, and pivots as part of a brutal new restructuring. Ubisoft announced on Thursday that a company-wide reset will include a new creative structure, “rightsizing of the organization,” and more investment in things like “player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <p>The latest shifts come <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">amid a challenging five-year stretch</a> for Ubisoft in which big blockbusters like <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> and <em>Far Cry 6</em> were few and far between while big bets like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>xDefiant</em> failed to pay off. In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">its January 21 earnings press release</a>, the company promised a “radically new value-creation model” based around a “more gamer-centric organization.” This will include “business units with faster, decentralized decision-making and a greater ability to quickly adapt to players’ expectations” and a “rightsized and more agile organization, delivering improved structural efficiencies over time.”</p>

 <p>A management consultant company like McKinsey &amp; Company couldn’t have written it better. For those not versed in 21st century corpo-speak, that means a slow disassembly of the global AAA factory that Ubisoft spent the 2010s building up and more studio closures and layoffs. The move will also include delays of many big games and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-2000661866">cancellation of others like the<em> Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake</a> that’s been in development for years. Ubisoft says it will double down on open-world games and games-as-a-service while boosting investments in things like “player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <h2>Ubisoft fragmented into “creative houses”</h2> <p>Instead of the integrated co-development model that has led the company to churn out massive games with armies of studios from around the world contributing to them, the new model suggests a series of siloes within the company based around individual IPs and genres. The first is a Tencent-backed subsidiary called Vantage Studios that owns <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. The second will own <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and<em> Splinter Cell</em>. The third will own<em> For Honor</em>,<em> The Crew</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>,<em> Brawlhalla</em>, and <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>. The fourth will own <em>Anno</em>, <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Rayman</em>,<em> Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>. The fifth will own<em>&nbsp;Just Dance</em>, <em>Idle Miner Tycoon</em>,<em> Ketchapp</em>, <em>Hungry Shark</em>, <em>Invincible: Guarding the Globe</em>, <em>Uno<span>,</span></em> and Hasbro-branded games like <em>Hasbro Game Night</em>.</p>

 <p>“Each Creative House will benefit from dedicated leadership with a clear creative mandate and accountability,” Ubisoft claims. “These leadership teams will include high-profile talent coming from the industry. They will be tasked with attracting and developing top-level, specialist talent, and supported by incentive schemes aligned with creative success, player engagement and long-term value creation.” Will that actually streamline things though, or just add a whole new layer of bureaucracy?</p>

 <h2>More closures, cuts, and layoffs</h2> <p>No restructuring is complete with out firings. The company cites recently announced closures of its Halifax mobile studio and Ubisoft Stockholm, as well as layoffs at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive. This is part of an ongoing $117 million cost reduction, but the company has now also committed to an additional $234 million of cuts over the next two years.</p> <p>“We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group,” CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed. “While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term.” He’s also open to selling more IP and studios if buyers are interested.</p>

 <p>But even those not getting explicitly laid off will face tough choices as Ubisoft end most remote work. “To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days,” the company wrote. While Ubisoft argues that it’s necessary to get its creative groove back, the policy will also likely lead to mass “quiet quitting” among those who can find a hybrid work schedule somewhere else.</p> <h2>Delays, delays, and more delays</h2> <p>This reset has basically exploded Ubisoft’s upcoming game release pipeline. Six games have been canceled outright. Outside of the <em>Sands of Time</em> remake, which was rumored to be coming early in 2026, the company ended development on five other games that didn’t meet quality standards. Those include “four unannounced titles,” of which three were “new IPs” and one was a “mobile title.” For those counting at home, that’s one game short of the total six that were canned. What’s the mystery cancelation?</p> <p>Ubisoft also delayed seven of its upcoming games “to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation.” The company didn’t clarify which of those are announced or unannounced, but did specify that one of the delays was an unannounced game planned for launch in the next two months, which indicates it may be the rumored remake of<em> Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>.</p>

 <p>Other big games that remain MIA are the next <em>Ghost Recon</em>, a multiplayer game called <em>Assassin’s Creed Invictus</em>, and, of course, <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>.</p> <h2>More gen AI NPCs?</h2> <p>Ubisoft revealed a lot of upcoming pain to shareholders on Wednesday, like a $386 million gross margin reduction for its current fiscal year ending March 31. So it’s hard to know whether the company’s tease of more gen AI investment is just an attempt to throw them a bone, or something it’s actually serious about as an exercise in “value creation” for gamers. The company promised “accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.”</p>

 <p>After failing to cash in on emerging technologies like cloud streaming and blockchain NFTs, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">promoted LLM chatbot NPCs at GDC 2024</a>. It then returned to the idea late last year with AI-powered squadmates in <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251">a tech demo that looked very Tom Clancy-ish</a>. “Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,” Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety</em></a> at the time. “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p> <p>Whether that value becomes real or stays imaginary, things seem likely to get tougher for Ubisoft before they get better.</p> <p><em>Update: 1/21/2026, 1:17 p.m. ET: Added more information, including about changing remote work policies.&nbsp;</em></p>
