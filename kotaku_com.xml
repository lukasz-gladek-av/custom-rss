            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve is running a big Black Friday sale for the first time in Steam’s history. Normally, around this time of year, we get a Fall sale and a Winter sale. Now Valve has decided to join in with every other online retailer and treat Black Friday as a week-long sales event. But hey, cheaper games are always nice, especially when they are new releases.</p> <p>On November 25, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials/?flavor=contenthub_topsellers&amp;offset=74">Valve surprised many by announcing a large Black Friday sale</a> on its hugely popular PC gaming storefront, Steam. The sale runs from now until December 1 and features a large list of games across basically every genre and sub-genre you can imagine. Better yet, a lot of the discounted games include titles, both big and small, that launched in 2025.</p>

 <p>For example, you can grab <em>Battlefield 6,</em> one of the biggest games this year, for $10 less than usual. If you are looking for something big to sink into over Thanksgiving, the remastered <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> is just $34 this week. Or maybe you want some puzzles to solve with your family and friends? Well, good news: <em>Blue Prince</em> is discounted to just $20 during Steam’s big sale. And if you crave a fun zombie game, this year’s <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is excellent and even better at $45.</p>

 <p>And it’s not just games that are on sale. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-black-friday-sale-discount-pc-gaming-2000647222">Valve has also marked down the Steam Deck, too.</a> You can get the base LCD model for $80 less than usual. It might be a bit old now, but the Steam Deck is still a damn fine way to play most indie games and smaller titles in 2025.</p> <p>Of course, with a sale this big, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> want to help you find a good deal. So our crack team of experts (me) used advanced algorithms (I spent an hour digging through deals) to assemble a handy database of big discounts worth checking out. (I made a list for you.)</p>  <ul> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Split Fiction</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 2026</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Of Ash &amp; Steel</em> – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> – $34 ($50)</li> <li><em>Blue Prince</em> – $20 ($30)</li> <li><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – $60 ($70)</li> <li><em>Moonlighter 2</em> – $25 ($30)</li> <li><em>Dying Light The Beast</em> – $45 ($60)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 4</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>– $21 ($30)</li> <li><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> – $26 ($40)</li> <li><em>Hellclock</em> – $14 ($20)</li> <li><em>Mars First Logistics</em> – $13 ($20)</li> <li><em>Metal Eden</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Wildgate</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Camper Van: Make It Home</em> – $11 ($15)</li> <li><em>Chip ‘N Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> – $21 ($30)</li> <li><em>Time Flies</em> – $12 ($15)</li> <li><em>to a T</em> – $13 ($20)</li> <li><em>Tron Catalyst</em> – $17 ($25)</li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> – $70 ($35)</li> <li><em>Jackbox Party Pack 11</em> – $24 ($30)</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Following the success of the Steam Deck PC gaming handheld, Valve announce an all-new lineup of gaming hardware including a Steam Controller, a VR kit called the Steam Frame, and the Steam Machine. The last of those is a retread of Valve’s attempt at having a home gaming console, but the company is in a much better position to be an Xbox killer now given current hardware capabilities along with the work put in to make the Steam OS into what it is now. That said, the big question is price. We currently have no clue what it will sell for nor when it will come out. So if you’re aching to get some gaming in right now, maybe go with a gaming laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/">This Asus ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop is currently on sale at Amazon Black Friday, for 19% off.</a> It’s normally listed at $2,100 but the discount ends up bringing it down by a full $400. You end up only having to pay $1,700 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Diving into the specs, this 2025 premiere gaming laptop is working with the AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor alongside an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU. You can expect cutting-edge performance all on a portable device. It’s packed with 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz memory and a storage capacity of 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD for your gaming library.</p>
<h2>Stunning Visuals</h2>
<p>The laptop is employing a premium ROG Nebula display, capable of ultra-fast 240Hz refresh rates with an input time of just 3ms. The screen measures across at 16 inches and has a 90% screen-to-body ratio to help maximize it’s workable area. It’s covered with an ACR film which helps to both enhance contrast as well as reduce glare when gaming in brightly lit spaces. NVIDIA G-Sync is supported, helping to eliminate screen tearing while playing fast-action games such as a first person shooter.</p>



<p>Advanced thermals work to keep your system cool and quiet during intense gameplay. The unit features three fans working in unison along with a heatsink the full width of the laptop and vents on all sides, all helping to keep the Asus ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop cool.</p>
<p>And it wouldn’t be a capital-G Gaming laptop without customizable RGB. The light bar can be set to synchronize with your keyboard and other ROG peripherals. And with the touch of a button, switch it to stealth mode to turn off the RGB lighting. Great for professional settings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>USB-C is now the universal norm for charging</strong> and data on everything from smartphones to tablets to laptops, ending the cable chaos that had plagued tech users for decades. Even Apple gave up its <em>Lightning</em> connectors in favor of USB-C across all devices so now <strong>everyone needs quality USB-C-to-USB-C cables</strong> for charging and syncing.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5930/">$6, down from $8, this Anker 2-pack works out to just $3 per cable for Apple-approved accessories</a> from a brand trusted by millions. This r<strong>ecord-low Black Friday price</strong> on Amazon makes stocking up on essential charging cables affordable enough to place them everywhere you need power.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5930/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>60W Fast Charging That Powers Real Devices</h2>
<p>The capability for <strong>60W power delivery manages fast charging for iPhones, iPads, MacBook Air</strong>&nbsp;and other USB-C devices that support Power Delivery protocols without bottlenecking charging speeds. This wattage proves enough to charge most phones at maximum speed and also supports tablet and laptop charging at respectable rates that keep most devices powered during use.</p>
<p>An<strong> iPhone 16 or 17 will charge from empty to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong> when paired with an appropriate 20W or higher charger, while an iPad will charge comfortably sans the frustratingly slow speeds that plague inadequate cables. The 60W rating provides headroom beyond what most phones require and ensures the cable never becomes the limiting factor in your charging setup even as devices demand more power in future generations.</p>



<p>The <strong>3.3-foot length strikes the practical balance</strong> between reach and portability that makes these cables work across multiple usage scenarios. This length extends comfortably from wall outlets to nightstands or desks without excess cable creating tangled messes, while remaining short enough to pack neatly in bags without bulky coils. Bedside charging reaches from floor outlets to mattress height with ease, office setups connect from desktop power strips to devices on desks, and car charging extends from dashboard ports to passenger seats.</p>
<p><strong>Apple’s approval from Anker</strong> offers the assurance of strict quality and safety standards that come inherently with the official compatibility certification process. What that means in real life is these cables will work seamlessly on your iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks without triggering any compatibility warnings or experiencing those frustrating connection issues like other, lesser, non-certified cables do. The extensive testing for electrical safety, data integrity, and durability makes sure such cables will not damage your expensive devices due to voltage irregularities or poor construction.</p>



<p>The two-pack quantity provides immediate redundancy by placing cables in several locations, rather than continually moving a single cable from room to room and risking loss or damage. Leave one cable at the side of your bed for overnight charging, using the second at the desk for daytime top-ups, or designate one for home and another for your work bag.</p>
<p>The fact that Anker is an Apple-approved accessory maker gives them a level of quality you just can’t get from some no-name cheap cables. If you want reliable USB-C cables without paying Apple’s premium pricing, this record-low deal makes essential charging infrastructure absurdly affordable.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="518">Have you upgraded your laptop recently? No? Well, if you’re still using a device that’s been around for like a decade, it might be time to consider replacing it. The 2024 Microsoft Surface Laptop is a fantastic, versatile option that can meet the needs of almost anyone—whether you’re a student, a small business owner, or simply someone looking for a more powerful device than using your phone for everything. Right now, you can save up to $450 on the 2024 model. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5923/">This significant 38% discount brings the price down from $1,200 to as low as $750 for a limited time. And it’s not even officially Black Friday yet!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5923/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="520" data-end="557">Powerful Performance for Any Task</h2>
<p data-start="559" data-end="1248">The Microsoft Surface Laptop is built with performance in mind. It features a choice between two processors: the Snapdragon X Elite 10-core or 12-core CPU. The 12-core processor is especially impressive, delivering speed that even outpaces the MacBook Air’s M3 chip, ensuring smooth and fast performance for all kinds of tasks. Whether you’re tackling school assignments, handling business operations, or simply browsing the web, this laptop can keep up without a hitch. It also offers 16GB or 32GB of memory, ensuring smooth multitasking and the ability to run demanding applications. Additionally, the 512GB storage capacity provides ample room for all your files, photos, and documents.</p>
<p data-start="1250" data-end="1923">As expected with pretty much any tech product to release in the last couple years, the marketing for this laptop is leading with it’s support for AI features. Microsoft markets this Surface Laptop as built for the AI era, offering integration with Copilot+, which is their new AI assistant. Copilot+ can generate art from text prompts and help you easily access documents or websites. In addition to this, Copilot+ promises to improve video call quality by enhancing lighting, reducing background noise, and blurring distractions, though these features have been around for a while—just now labeled as AI.</p>


<h2 data-start="1925" data-end="1964">Stunning Display &amp; Versatile Design</h2>
<p data-start="1966" data-end="2748">The Surface Laptop boasts a large and vibrant display, available in 13.8-inch or 15-inch sizes. With HD resolution and support for HDR and DolbyVision IQ, the screen offers sharp visuals that bring all your content to life. Whether you’re watching videos, working on projects, or browsing, you can expect vibrant colors and clear details. The laptop also features a touchscreen, allowing you to easily switch between tablet mode for a more interactive experience or use it like a traditional laptop with the keyboard and mouse. The minimal bezel design maximizes the screen space.. Plus, it’s incredibly thin and lightweight, making it easy to carry between classes, work meetings, or perhaps your local coffee shop.</p>
<h2 data-start="2750" data-end="2805">Convenient Port Selection &amp; Impressive Battery Life</h2>
<p data-start="2807" data-end="3264">In terms of connectivity, the Microsoft Surface Laptop comes equipped with all the necessary ports, including two USB-C 4 ports for fast data transfer and charging. The laptop is also designed to be highly portable, with long-lasting battery life that can keep you going for up to 20 hours before needing to plug it back in.</p>
<p data-start="3266" data-end="3608" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5923/">Whether you need a reliable laptop for work, school, or personal use, the 2024 Microsoft Surface Laptop is an excellent choice.</a> Get it now for as low as $750 ahead of Black Friday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/saudi-arabia-ea-funds-jared-kushner-trump-2000647246</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/saudi-arabia-might-be-headed-for-its-own-embracer-moment.1364383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is Saudi Arabia’s takeover of EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">another big-brain play</a> or a sign of desperation? Can a more generous <em>Black Ops 7</em> battle pass convince players to keep playing? What does James Cameron&nbsp;<em>really</em> think about Netflix? It’s another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>As we skid into the long holiday weekend, I’m trying to decide exactly how many <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday</a> discounted game controllers I should buy to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. Or maybe I should just stop paying my electricity bill and force them all to take up knitting instead.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia is having an Embracer moment</h2> <p>The country’s Public Investment Fund has made a bunch of bad bets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html">according to <em>The New York Times</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-savvy-games-group-s-saudi-owned-parent-fund-is-running-low-on-investable-cash"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). It reports that the sovereign wealth fund is running low on cash for new investments. You might remember one of them being a&nbsp;<a href="https://ig.ft.com/saudi-neom-line/">concept for a futuristic city</a> in the desert in the shape of one long line.</p>

 <p>This makes the fund’s massive bid to take EA private seem somewhat more desperate and precarious, given that much of it will be debt-financed at high interest rates. Embracer itself <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-saudi-arabia-dead-island-2-borderlands-deal-1850475619">once looked to the PIF to save it</a>, rapidly unraveling once a multi-billion dollar deal failed to materialize. It never recovered. We’ll see how long Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman can continue flooding the zone with oil money to whitewash the country’s human rights record.</p>

 <p>Notably, the EA Saudi deal was reportedly facilitated by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law. MBS recently visited the White House <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl">in exchange for</a> fighter jets, advanced AI chips, and god knows what else. Trump brushed off MBS’s alleged role in having a Washington Post journalist murdered a few years back as “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-asked-about-khashoggi-murder-trump-says-things-happen-and-mbs-knew-nothing-about-it">things happen</a>” and claimed his family has done “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5613866/fact-checking-trumps-claim-his-family-has-done-little-business-with-saudi-arabia">little</a>” business with the Kingdom. I guess the largest leveraged buyout of an American firm by a foreign entity is just table stakes these days.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Black Ops 7</em> battle pass will be more generous than the <em>Black Ops 6</em> one</h2> <p>You’ll still have to battle FOMO, but unlocks will come more easily. “The team has taken learnings from <i>Black Ops 6</i>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey,” the devs <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Battle-Pass">wrote in a new blog post</a>. “The result: each season’s Battle Pass in <i>Black Ops 7</i> will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.”</p>

 <p>Initial pages will be shorter, and players can earn Battle Pass Tokens from Daily Challenges including in the co-op campaign, in case you’re a <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">glutton for punishment</a>.</p> <h2>Palmer Luckey’s N64 clone is getting revealed soon</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The ModRetro M64 hardware is getting a full reveal on Black Friday – features, colors, our incredible new controller, cutting-edge <a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AMD</a> hardware, etc.</p> <p>Much has changed since we launched early bird pricing at $199 earlier this year, things like inflation, component shortages,… <a href="https://t.co/T8MLilyweh">pic.twitter.com/T8MLilyweh</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1993115525153436057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The ModRetro M64 is the arms dealer’s latest side project: an FPGA machine that plays old N64 cartridges on modern displays. Despite things like “inflation, component shortages, tariffs, and more,” the price will remain $200, which is 20 percent less than the recently launched Analogue 3D. The devil will be in the details, however. Luckey says all will be revealed on Black Friday, though a holiday 2025 release seems like a long-shot at this point.</p>

 <h2><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> gets a free update this week</h2> <p>The November 27 patch will <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1993318901262823923">add more</a> weapons, enemies, and other small features, like some fresh team-up attacks for the musou fighter’s characters.</p> <h2>Helldivers 2 is getting jungle armor and giant chainsaws</h2> <p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos Warbond</a> will go live for players on December 2. In addition to the new Contra-style kits, players will get the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool which looks like a long buzz-saw that will slice through enemies and trees alike.</p> <h2>Big Jim hates Netflix</h2> <p>The <em>Avatar 3</em> director and box office giant James Cameron had some harsh words for the streamer’s Oscar strategy <a href="https://t.co/U5tk94vdNU">in a recent interview</a>. “We’ll put the movie out for a week, we’ll put it out for 10 days; we’ll qualify for Academy Awards consideration,” he said, critiquing the company’s free-loading strategy. “See, I think that’s fundamentally rotten at the core. The Academy Awards, to me, mean nothing if they don’t mean theatrical.”</p> <p>Basically, he’s accusing Netflix of trying to draft off of the prestige of awards nominations without actually investing in theaters, all while its platform is directly undercutting the broader movie-going experience. Personally, I think Cameron could do a lot more to help theaters by releasing good movies instead of more <em>Avatar </em>sequels, but his underlying logic is unimpeachable.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-gta-5-roleplay-ice-raid-new-save-collective-2000646967">People are training for ICE raids inside <em>Fortnite</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-multiplayer-metagross-xerneas-garchomp-2000646988"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> online battles are already super boring</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/dan-houser-ai-rockstar-gtav-rdr2-absurd-ventures-2000646935">Dan Houser is not buying all of the AI hype</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>It’s that time of the year again. Early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are rolling in hot, which means you don’t really have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of top-rated items across all categories (TVs, laptops, smartphones, kitchen appliances, games) have already dropped to their lowest prices ever. Finding the right discounts that are worth your hard-earned money, however, can be a little overwhelming during such times, but that’s where we come in to help. Our shopping team is keeping an eye on the best deals around, so you don’t have to!</p>
<p>Those looking for a reliable storage solution — we have good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">Seagate just dropped its massive 4TB external hard drive by 20%, which means you can bring it home for just $100 today.</a> The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase, too. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. The deal, however, wraps up soon. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for it, but we’re not expecting it to last more than a couple of days. If you have been wanting to expand the storage of your computer or gaming console without spending a ton, now is the time to act. Grab it before the price shoots back up to $125.</p>

<h2>Stores All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>Running out of storage is never fun, and this drive is sure to take care of that issue for years to come. The storage capacity it offers is truly massive. 4TB storage means you will have space to house all your old and new data, which can include thousands of photos, hundreds of movies, years of backup, tons of research papers, an unusual number of work documents, plus all your favorite titles. And even after all of this, you will still have plenty of space left for future downloads. If you have ever been in a situation where you had to delete some of your old files to make room for new ones (like all of us), you’re going to greatly appreciate the peace of mind this brings.</p>
<p>It’s designed to work with Windows or Mac computers and select gaming consoles, with the setup being fairly straightforward. If you’re planning to use it with a Windows-based computer, you just need to plug in the power and then plug in the included USB cable. The drive should now appear in the (My) Computer/This PC and Windows Explorer/File Explorer. Using it with a Mac requires you to reformat the drive. Once that’s done, the system will detect the drive, and you can start using it.</p>



<p>This drive, despite the massive capacity it packs, is quite minimal and lightweight. It easily slides into a laptop bag without bulking things up, which makes it easier to take with you on the go when working remotely. You also don’t have to worry about losing your important data, as your purchase will include a year-long access to Seagate’s Rescue Data Recovery Services. The service connects you to a team of world-class data recovery experts, offers one in-lab data recovery attempt, and gets you an encrypted storage device containing your recovered data if recovery is successful.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">In short, if you’ve been after a reliable storage solution for your important files, the Seagate 4TB external hard drive is a great option to consider, especially now that it’s available for just $100.</a> It not only offers a massive capacity, but is compatible with a range of devices and is easy to use, as well.</p>
