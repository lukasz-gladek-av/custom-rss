              <p>Gaming sessions with friends hit different when everyone has a controller: There’s nothing worse than passing around one gamepad or having to troubleshoot compatibility across various devices. The Xbox wireless controller has become the go-to option for millions of gamers and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Amazon has it down to just $39 from its usual $64 price</a>. That’s practically half the cost of Sony’s DualSense controller, and it makes this deal all that much sweeter if you need to stock up on extra controllers for those multiplayer sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Controller That Goes the Distance</h2>
<p>New in this 2025 edition of the Xbox controller are features that truly make for meaningful changes in your experience while gaming: The <strong>battery life runs as long as 40 hours on one set of two AA batteries</strong> which means you can game through several weekends without having to fear running out of power. This controller now <strong>includes a 9-foot USB-C cable right in the box</strong> for easy flexibility between wireless freedom and the reliability of a wired connection at any time.</p>
<p>These ergonomic updates to the controller have made marathon gaming sessions far more comfortable. Xbox has <strong>refined the sculpted surfaces and geometry</strong> for a better fit of various hand sizes while adding textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case. These grip enhancements give you more control in high-intensity moments when your palms start sweating and this <strong>hybrid D-pad provides a nice balance between precision and comfort</strong> in fighting games and menu navigation alike. The <strong>Share button integration is really handy</strong>, too: you can capture screenshots and recordings without having to fumble through menus or break focus during crucial gameplay moments.</p>



<p>In real-world practicality, the strength of this controller comes in with cross-platform compatibility: You can pair it<strong> wirelessly via Xbox Wireless or Bluetooth to your console, PC, phone, tablet, Fire TV Stick, smart TV, or even VR headsets</strong>. That means one controller works across your whole gaming ecosystem, not different gamepads for different devices. A <strong>3.5mm headset jack</strong> lets you plug any compatible headset directly into it, and a USB-C port supports direct plug-and-play connections to your console or PC without any setup hassle.</p>
<p>At $39, you’re getting a premium controller that normally sells for $64, and this represents the lowest price we’ve tracked for this model. With over 21,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars and more than 10,000 units purchased in the past month alone, this controller has proven itself in real-world use.</p>

              <p>Bigger doesn’t always mean better when it comes to PCs. If you’re after reliable everyday performance for your office work or even just casual use, a mini PC can do the job well without taking up a lot of desk space. Best of all? You can grab one without paying the full price right now.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5301/">GMKtec Nucbox G3S Mini PC (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel N95 chip, Windows 11 Pro) is available for $179 on Amazon</a>, down from its regular $249 price. The only catch? This <strong>deal is exclusive to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5301/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>That said, this might be a good time to consider signing up for Prime if you’ve been on the fence. <strong>Amazon offers a 7-day free trial</strong>&nbsp;so you can take advantage of this discount right away and also enjoy free shipping on your orders. It’s also worth noting that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are right around the corner, and a lot of the best deals will go to Prime members first. A Prime membership costs $139 per year or $15 per month, but if you shop on Amazon even semi-regularly, you’re likely to make that money back in discounts and shipping perks.</p>



<h2>Powerful Processor for Everyday Tasks</h2>
<p>The G3S runs on Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake N95 processor with 4 cores, 4 threads, and speeds up to 3.4GHz. When compared to entry-level chips like N100 or N5095, this one offers up to 36% better overall performance, which makes it ideal for day-to-day usage. The 16GB of DDR4 RAM makes it easy to multitask your way through busy days, while the 512GB M.2 SSD storage provides sufficient space for all your essentials. It’s not massive, but should be enough to store important work files, media content, and even a few games without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, you’ve got dual HDMI 2.0 ports that support 4K@60Hz output on two displays, which is great for anyone looking for a bigger setup. It also has three USB 3.2 ports, WiFi 5, Bluetooth 5.0, and Gigabit Ethernet for reliable wireless and wired connections. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, which means you can get started right away without worrying about any complicated installation procedures or subscription costs.</p>
<p>This deal brings the price of the mini PC down to $179, but don’t wait too long to grab it: The offer might end any moment now.</p>

              <p>Who doesn’t love a good holiday countdown? Advent calendars build anticipation, make every single day more exciting, and are fun for both kids and adults. Of course, the whole process gets a bit more creative when it’s a LEGO set.</p>
<p>This year, LEGO is offering its Friends Advent calendar 2025, and it’s already on 40% off at Amazon, bringing the price down to just $21. It’s marked as an <em>Amazon’s Choice</em> product, but there’s no telling how long the discount will last. If you’ve been thinking about grabbing one, now’s a good time to pick it up for less. Keep in mind that all other LEGO Advent calendars are now out of stock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Set Doubles as a Play Area</h2>
<p>The set includes a <strong>total of 237 pieces with 24 buildable surprises, for 24 days of fun</strong>. The theme is about a holiday sleepover with Lego friends; Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo. Each character gets their own cozy mattress to get some beauty sleep, and the crew is also accompanied by five adorable pets, including a guinea pig, a gecko, two dogs, and a cat. To spoil these furry friends, there’s a whole bunch of accessories, like a bone, scratching post, pet bed, food station, and water dispenser.</p>



<p>The whole setup comes together with some magical holiday touches like a cozy fireplace, a sled, a sofa to lounge on, a bright lamp, and a bunch of colorful gift boxes. There’s even a little Lego brick reindeer plushie to round it all out. And since the calendar opens up to double as a small play area, kids can use it to set up the full sleepover scene and get creative with their own stories. Maybe it’s a hot chocolate night while the pets throw their own little party in the corner. Or a Christmas tree decorating session with a surprise visit from Leo on the hobbyhorse! The possibilities are endless, and the fun goes on even after Christmas.</p>
<p>Everything is compatible with other LEGO Friends sets, so it’s easy to keep building. You can even plan a fun streaming night with Lego Friends: The Next Chapter, where kids can get to know the Heartlake City crew and maybe add a few more sets over time to expand the whole setup.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been planning to treat your kids to an exciting advent calendar that fuels their creativity, this set is a great option to consider. It’s now down to just $21 for a short time, which makes it even more approachable.</p>
