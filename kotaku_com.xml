              <p>The (nearly) complete <a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-stealth-metal-gear-splinter-cell-freelancer-1851786255"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em></a> experience, including all 25 levels and bald assassin Agent 47 himself, is making the leap from consoles and PC to iPhone and iPad. But folks might be shocked by the high sticker price of this new, portable version of the stealth action game.</p> <p>On August 27, as previously teased, IO Interactive released <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hitman-world-of-assassination/id6742786366?platform=ipad"><em>Hitman: WOA</em> on the Apple App Store</a>. It supports newer iPhones and iPads and includes almost the full experience, though it isn’t shipping with the wonderful roguelike mode, Freelancer. Instead, that will be added in a later, free update. Still, having all of <em>Hitman, Hitman 2, </em>and <em>Hitman 3 </em>in your pocket is wild. It also isn’t cheap. This version of the game can be downloaded freely, and you can play the first level at no cost, but to play the rest of the game, you’ll need to fork over $70. Or you can spend $3 per level, which equals around $72 before tax. Yikes.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="HITMAN World of Assassination - iOS Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYJwROKrP6I?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to a press release for the new port, IOI has “designed an entirely touch control scheme built specifically for iPhone and iPad.” Which is neat, but don’t worry, the game supports controllers, too. Still, I can’t help but look at that $70 price tag for a mobile game, one which is a many-years-old console/PC port, and make a weird noise. This same package, with Freelancer, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOopEwi6qPusLtSLqi-aw1HtKt3Iqx9rbzeD9cicht8xalRqrsLvV#dlc">is available on Switch 2 for just $60.</a> It seems odd to charge such a premium for a mobile port, especially when there’s plenty of data to show that these fancy iPhone AAA ports <a href="https://kotaku.com/re7-aaa-ios-iphone-village-remake-flop-low-sales-why-1851595596">don’t sell well at all on the platform.</a></p> <p>But I need to be careful and stop being too critical of this pricey new <em>Hitman</em> phone port because I just noticed my neighbor trimming the bushes outside looks a lot more bald and brooding than usual, and is that a rubber duck in his hand…oh no.</p>
