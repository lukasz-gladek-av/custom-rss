              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> has some laborious achievements. I know because I’ve been chasing them for weeks and still haven’t satisfied all of the necessary criteria to 100-percent the game in that regard. How tempting then to discover there’s a bug where you can pop every achievement in the remake and claim a complete Xbox gamerscore in just a couple of minutes. How fitting for an RPG about making deals with the devil!</p> <p>The trick was discovered by achievement hunter VidGamiac and shared on the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=1654991&amp;anchor=12598482#m12598482">True Achievements forum</a> earlier this week. It’s a weird one and I still have no idea why it works the way it does. It revolves around starting a fresh save file, choosing English, selecting the Enhanced version, and then later changing to Japanese after you finish the tutorial battle. You can skip the initial cutscenes and fast-forward through all of the dialogue and most of the combat, letting you complete the glitch in just a few minutes. The precise steps are laid out in the video below:</p>

  <p>“Confirmed,” wrote fellow hunter Vudix. “Works. Hat tip to you, Gamiac.” Not everyone is so impressed. “Kinda sad and pathetic tbh,” wrote OldMateClown. “Appropriate Gamertag,” Vudix responded. All of these people have gamer scores of over 1 million.</p>

 <h2>The<em> FFT</em> achievement glitch does not work on PlayStation</h2> <p>Sorry trophy hunters, this is an Xbox exclusive and won’t work for the PlayStation 4 and PS5 versions of the game. Bad news for any Sony sickos looking for easy Platinums, but good news for anyone like me who might be easily seduced by the allure of being able to finally finish this game off. Unlocking every achievement and trophy in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> requires doing close to everything in the game, including all of the errands you can sign up for at shops, even the ones that only appear on random days of the in-game calendar year.</p> <p>But the one that’s really stopped me in my tracks is called “Master of All Trades” which requires one party member to learn every ability in the game. I’ve spent a handful of nights setting up auto-battles to grind for JP points and chip away at it with Ramza but it’s taking a while. Setting up <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-guide-xp-jp-grind-tips-2000633724">those XP fog farm arenas</a> is harder than it looks. I didn’t think I’d ever get sick of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> and yet, well, we’re getting close!</p>

              <p>2015’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637"><em>Fallout 4</em></a> turns 10 years old this year, and to celebrate this anniversary, Bethesda is bringing the open-world RPG to Nintendo Switch 2…in 2026. Meanwhile, this new version of the game, <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em>, will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in November.</p> <p>On October 23, Bethesda held its second annual Fallout Day Broadcast, a Direct-like pre-recorded event announcing new <em>Fallout</em>-themed content and games. It happens on October 23 because that’s the day the bombs dropped in the post-apocalyptic video game series. This year, the event didn’t have too much to announce. The big “news” was the reveal of <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/N00XVTawnzBBH7HNwv0hN/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced"><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></a>, a version of the RPG that combines the base game, all the DLC, and 150+ pieces of Creation Club content into one package. This version will also support Creations, Bethesda’s cross-platform mods system that already exists in <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>.&nbsp; This version of the game is coming to all the platforms<em> Fallout 4</em> was previously launched on, plus a new one: the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

   <p>“The definitive edition of <em>Fallout 4</em>&nbsp;is coming to&nbsp;Nintendo Switch 2,” posted Bethesda in a press release. “It’s been ten years since players first stepped out of Vault 111 and into the post-nuclear world. To mark the occasion, Bethesda Game Studios is thrilled to announce <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em>. This is the ultimate celebration of a beloved classic, bringing together the complete&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em> experience on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.”</p> <p>This is the first official, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(franchise)#Games">mainline <em>Fallout</em> video game to arrive on a Nintendo platform</a>.<em> Fallout Shelter</em> and<em> Fallout Pinball</em> were previously released on Switch, but those hardly count.<em> Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is the first time the franchise has truly made the leap to Mario’s base of operations, and it makes me wonder if some other <em>Fallout</em> games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fallout-games-3-4-5-76-bethesda-rpg-new-vegas-611408965/2">like <em>Fallout 3</em> or <em>New Vegas</em></a>, could arrive on Nintendo’s new console in the future. Surely if<em> Fallout 4</em> can run on Switch 2, the older games can, too. For now, though, <em>Fallout</em> fans looking to play the franchise on Switch 2 will have to be happy with<em> Fallout 4</em> when it arrives on Nintendo’s system sometime in 2026.</p>
