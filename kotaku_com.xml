While <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, the follow-up to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>Death Stranding 2</em> are both due for release later in the year, questions remain about the state of multiplayer shooter <em>Fairgame$</em> and other Sony projects like Insomniac Games’ <em>Wolverine</em>. </p><p>It’s also possible that this week’s State of Play could include the announcement of a <em>God of War</em> anthology that brings the older PS2 and PS3 games to the PS5. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1imtu2l/ufeelingexamination6_who_leaked_hell_is_us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1imtu2l/ufeelingexamination6_who_leaked_hell_is_us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user Feeling-Examination6</a></span>, who previously leaked the existence of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, has added to the mounting pile of rumors that the <em>God of War </em>Greek saga is getting a modern re-release. Currently, of the games that preceded 2018's relaunch of the franchise, only <em>God of War III</em> has a version playable on PS5. </p><p>What’s less clear is which other games this rumored collection would feature. In addition to the numbered entries, there’s also <em>Chains of Olympus</em> and <em>Ghost of Sparta </em>for the PSP, as well as <em>God of War: Ascension</em>, the final game before the series went dark until 2018 brought the franchise into Norse mythology. What seems more certain is that if these games really are getting modern ports, they’ll likely  end up on PC as well at some point. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The long-anticipated latest entry in the strategy series went live for Deluxe Edition owners last week and complaints about the game feeling “unfinished” immediately started pouring in.

Stay tuned for larger, more substantive updates to come in the future.”</p><p> The patch notes call out fixes to naval units as well as to a bug that caused city states to disappear during age transitions and some other  gameplay issues. On the UI front, which has been a particular source of frustration for fans so far, the update tweaks alignment on certain menus and fixes cut-off text, missing icons, and spacing between certain descriptions. “Fixed an issue where the background color remains the default color when the user changes it in the Player Customize tab,” reads one of the specific bugs addressed. </p><p>To “expedite updates to the PC experience,” cross-play has been disabled for the time being. Firaxis has already promised bigger updates to address more player feedback, including a deeper overhaul of some of the UI issues currently being shared by fans.

Some players are being cautioned to wait for further updates to address match length and map variety, or for eventual sales, before diving in. But others are confident <em>Civilization 7</em> will be the next great <em>Civ</em> game and don’t want to hold off on getting to know its ins and outs. “The bones of an amazing game are there,” wrote one fan on Reddit. “If you liked<em> Civ 5</em> at launch and civ 6 at launch, you’ll like this. If you started playing <em>Civ </em>with<em> Civ 6</em> after [expansion pack <em>Gathering Storm</em>], you’ll find that this is an incomplete mess.”<br></p><p>One thing that would almost certainly push <em>Civ 7</em> to the next level is the addition of a fourth age.

So like many games, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> takes players several pegs down the ranked ladder at the start of every season to give them a new goal to grind toward. Unlike many games,<em> Marvel Rivals</em> also wanted to do this during the middle of each season too. </p><p>“Ranks will be reset when the second half of Season 1 starts on February 21, 2025,” the game’s developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced on February 10</a></span>. “Based on your standing at the end of the first half of Season 1, prepare for a drop of four divisions. For example, if you ended the first half of Season 1 at Diamond I, you’ll start the second half at Platinum II.”</p><p>The 500,000 member <em>Marvel Rivals</em> subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/search/?q=rank&amp;cId=2f433fb9-8c67-442c-b819-d9589608b1b6&amp;iId=f0fc68b0-d992-42ad-ae89-697ca415b0f1&amp;t=week&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/search/?q=rank&amp;cId=2f433fb9-8c67-442c-b819-d9589608b1b6&amp;iId=f0fc68b0-d992-42ad-ae89-697ca415b0f1&amp;t=week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately rebelled against the decision</a></span>. “De-ranks twice a season for Players below gold will kill this game,” read one upvoted thread. “Honestly mid season de-ranks make me want to play less,” read another. “Dropping ranks mid season is a TERRIBLE idea,” read a third. As one player in the subreddit put it, “Why bother with Ranked if my Rank is reset every month?”</p><p>It only took NetEase a few hours to recalibrate. “After the release of Dev Talk 10 regarding the seasonal rank adjustment, we received a wealth of feedback from the community,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in an updated dev diary</a></span>. “When the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset. Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half.”</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> will still give players who hit gold rank their rewards on February 21, but instead of needing to rank back up following that date to unlock the rest, they’ll merely need to complete 10 additional matches in competitive mode before the end of the season. Doing so will unlock the second set of rewards, including a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.</p><p>Live-service games are a delicate dance between developers trying to maintain the overall health and longevity of the game while players want to Have Fun, and not feel Screwed Over. Even beloved hits like<em> Helldivers 2</em> have occasionally missed the mark when it comes to this balancing act. Kudos to <em>Marvel Rivals</em> for course correcting so quickly. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
