              <p>We’re sure you’re already aware of this, but the next three months are basically one huge shopageddon. Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations lead straight into the biggest food shopping week of the year before Thanksgiving, following immediately by Black Friday and Cyber Week. Normally that would mean either a long, grueling trek of in-person shopping, or online shopping with so many tabs open your laptop cries uncle.</p>
<p>Or, you could do it all in one location, either online or in any of over 600 location nationwide, when you get a Sam’s Club membership. Getting access to the all-in-one warehouse giant should come at a premium cost just for the convenience and amazing prices, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/">right now at StackSocial you can get a one-year Club membership for just $15.</a> That even less than the usual discounted price offered by StackSocial, and you’ll easily recoup that $15 just in the gas you’d burn through hitting all those shopping stops if you weren’t a Sam’s Club member.</p>

              <p>Harry Potter is one of LEGO’s most beloved franchises, and the <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> set has earned a stellar 4.8 out of 5-star rating on Amazon with over 1,800 reviews backing it up. <strong>LEGO’s official website shows zero discounts</strong> on this flagship model and maintains the strict pricing the company is known for. But Amazon isn’t playing by those rules.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">this 2,660-piece castle has dropped from $169 to just $135, marking an all-time low for the best-selling Harry Potter LEGO set</a>. This deal is accessible to everyone, including non-Prime members, which makes it even more appealing.</p>

<h2>A Complete Miniature Replica of the Wizarding School</h2>
<p>It is the first L<strong>EGO brick model that includes the entire Hogwarts Castle and its grounds in a single build</strong>. Earlier sets focused on a solitary tower, classroom, or section, but this 2,660-piece model presents the entire campus to you in one continuous display. The construction includes the Main Tower with its signature pointed roof, the Astronomy Tower where the students study the stars, the Great Hall where banquets and ceremonies take place, as well as several courtyards and cross-bridges that lead to various sections of the castle.</p>



<p>The scale allows the LEGO designers to include recognisable details without overwhelming builders with tens of thousands of pieces. You will construct <strong>the Chamber of Secrets hidden beneath the school, the Winged Key room of Harry’s first-year nightmare, the Potions Classroom where Snape taught in the dungeons, and the large Chessboard Chamber from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges</strong>. The grounds surrounding consist of the Boathouse where students arrive by boat, the Black Lake in front, the greenhouses for Herbology class lessons and the Whomping Willow that attacks anything getting too close.</p>
<p>Other features recreate scenes from around the film series: The Durmstrang Ship comes out of the lake just as it did when Durmstrang participants arrived during the Triwizard Tournament in Goblet of Fire. The powder-blue Beauxbatons Carriage is present on the grounds, representing the arrival of the French school of magic. The crashed Ford Anglia is a part of the Forbidden Forest trees after the failed flight by Ron and Harry in Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>The finished model measures <strong>13.5 inches wide, 10 inches in depth, and 8.5 inches in height</strong>, large enough to be seen on a shelf or desk but not big enough to require special furniture. The build is supported on a highly detailed baseplate that is sculpted as the grounds of the castle with textured areas representing grass, pathways, and water. There is a gold mini-figure statue representing the Hogwarts architect which you can put near the nameplate “Hogwarts Castle” or in the corner of the baseplate to give it an extra visual touch.</p>
<p>For $135 for 2,660 pieces, you are <strong>paying around 5 cents per brick which is excellent value in the price system of LEGO</strong>.</p>
