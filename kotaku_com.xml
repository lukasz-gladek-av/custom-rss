            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The sun just refuses to set on <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>. Even with<em> GTA 6</em> delayed into next year, the current entry’s multiplayer mode is seeing an surprising surge in new and returning players. Rockstar Games’ parent company, Take-Two, just revealed the 12-year-old spin-off is 50 percent more popular than it was last year.</p> <p>“During the quarter, engagement for <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>&nbsp;benefited from the record-setting launch of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> Trailer 2 and the successful release of the ‘<em>Money Fronts</em>‘ Summer content pack, which culminated in higher than expected recurrent consumer spending growth,” the company announced in its quarterly earnings report this week. “We are pleased that new player accounts<em>&nbsp;</em>for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>grew over 50 percent year-over-year.”</p> <p>Every company that delays one of the most anticipated releases of all-time by more than six months should be so lucky. At this rate, Rockstar could push back the release of <em>GTA 6</em> from May to October 2026 and see <em>GTA Online</em> potentially double in popularity in just two years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-future-updates-gta6-take-two-ceo-support-1851763665">merely by dropping new trailers for the sequel</a>.</p>

 <p>I guess all of those people still buying <em>GTA V</em> each month are for real. The game was the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k">ninth best-selling game of the year so far in June</a>. That was up from being the 15th best-selling overall in 2024. Even if that number eventually comes down by the end of 2025, it would still be incredible if<em> GTA V</em> sold&nbsp;<em>just as well</em> as it had the year prior after more than a decade of being out in the wild.</p> <p>No wonder Rockstar has been content to take its time with the sequel while everyone else selling games on consoles battles to convince <em>GTA Online</em> fans to take a chance on buying something new. Shutting <em>GTA Online</em> down for good would be terrible for Take-Two’s shareholders but it <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-selling-games-2024-hogwarts-legacy-dragon-ball-1851746095">might spread the wealth around a bit</a> and give great games from other studios a better shot at getting recognized. Or all of those people would just go play <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> instead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Big news, everyone! Capcom has heard all your pleading and begging and has finally announced a brand new <a href="https://kotaku.com/exoprimal-dino-crisis-reboot-sequel-dinosaur-shooter-ca-1849066060"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>…merchandise lottery event. Wait, is that not what all you fans have been clamoring for over the last 20 years? Oh…well, uh, this is almost as good as a new game, right?</p> <p>On August 8, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-official-dino-crisis-merchandises-revealed-by-capcom-japan.1265337/">as first spotted by ResetEra users</a>, Capcom announced a new merch event themed around its classic survival horror series, <em>Dino Crisis.</em> The event runs from now until September 12 and features a variety of <a href="https://capcom-capkujionline.com/lp/DINO_CRISIS/">new <em>Dino Crisis</em> merchandise</a>, including desk mats, sweaters, keychains, and stickers. You can’t just buy this stuff directly, though. Instead, Capcom is operating this merch event like a raffle or lottery. Each <em>Dino Crisis</em> item in the event has a rarity scale. For example, the sweater has a 1-in-100 chance of shipping. You can purchase one or more “tickets” for 880 Yen (about $6 USD) and then Capcom ships out however many items you ordered, and you hope you got lucky enough to get some of the rarer ones, like the desk mat, which has a 3-in-100 chance of arriving at your doorstep.</p> <figure><figcaption>Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p>This new merch sale is the latest example of Capcom remembering <em>Dino Crisis,</em> but not actually announcing a new game or even teasing a hypothetical remake or fancy remaster. In 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768">Capcom asked fans what dormant franchises they would like revived</a>. One of the options was <em>Dino Crisis</em>, and the internet screamed loudly, “That one please!” That same year, <em>Dino Crisis</em> arrived on GOG with a few appreciated improvements. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-siren-ps2-horror-ps-plus-games-october-2024-1851669030">It was also released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4</a> as part of Sony’s PS Plus Premium retro library, complete with new trophies. And now we have this new merch sale.</p> <p>So it’s clear Capcom remembers that it owns<em> Dino Crisis.</em> That’s an important first step toward getting a new game or sequel. Of course, when or if that will ever happen remains to be seen. But at least you can (sort of) buy a cool <em>Dino Crisis</em> sweater right now? That’s neat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Third-party games often struggle on Nintendo platforms. Not <em>Madden NFL 26</em>. The first EA football game to grace one of the Mario maker’s consoles in over a decade, it’s already taking over the top of the Switch 2 sales charts, with its $100 Deluxe Edition bundle second only to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. But how does it play? New <em>Madden</em> entries have fraught receptions, even on the most powerful consoles. Last year’s version has 3.2 user rating on Metacritic. Apparently the Switch 2 version of Madden 26 successfully carried over that part of the franchise’s legacy. Fans are already divided on whether the port is a dream come true or hot garbage. And some are begging for refunds. Could it really be that bad?</p> <p>I haven’t played the game on Switch 2 yet myself (<em>Kotaku</em> received review code on PS5) but I have been monitoring day-one impressions as they roll in (early access began August 7 but the full launch isn’t until August 14). <em>NintendoLife</em> praised the port in its review. <em>“</em><em>Madden 26</em> on Switch 2 is absolutely a triumph in most regards,” writes PJ O’Reilly. “It plays well, it runs decently, and it looks not too far removed from other console versions.” He notes that the problems he has encountered like “existing menu issues, long loading times, and/or a persistent issue that’s locking me out of <em>Madden 26</em> because the servers are busy” are present across both platforms at the moment. Per usual, the paid early access period is more of a paid beta.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dude yeah, it’s not optimized. We need frame rate improvements it’s nearly unplayable</p> <p>— Jeremiah Krakowski (@JeremyKrak) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKrak/status/1953520199862227228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So, what to make of some players raging about things like apparent input lag and framerate stuttering on Switch 2, where it hovers above 30fps but doesn’t hit 60fps like on the other platforms? “Submit your refund asap for Switch 2. Game is unplayable,” reads<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk717v/submit_your_refund_asap_for_switch_2_game_is/"> one of the more dire warnings</a> on the <em>Madden</em> subreddit. The player in question, WhatIsGodWithoutOD, was seemingly able to extract a refund out of Nintendo according to a screenshot. “PSA&nbsp;: Avoid Madden on Switch2–at least for now,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk7acf/psa_avoid_madden_on_switch2_at_least_for_now/">reads another</a> thread by a player lamenting “insanely low frame drops.” The comments sections in both posts, however, include players reporting perfectly fine play sessions with the game.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VnHtNs_Hbs">Direct capture of <em>Madden 26</em></a> running on Switch 2 shows the frequent stuttering some players are talking about, but overall the resolution and performance seems decent enough for a PS5 and Xbox Series X/S game running on a handheld hybrid (this year’s entry is also the first to leave PS4 and Xbox One behind). “It’s a solid port overall although it could be better, and it’s still a very fun experience especially on the go,” wrote one especially level-headed player on the Switch 2 subreddit. So far at least, it sounds like the real divide is over the lack of a 60fps mode. Fans coming from PS5 and Xbox Series X/S <a href="https://x.com/JuniThePuny/status/1953492620937699745">might find the difference jarring</a>. Nintendo fans coming to the series for the first time in years seem to be finding it good enough so far, though there are some questions about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mky5gt/did_ea_lie_about_switch_2_feature_parity/">discrepancies in half-time shows and other features</a> between the different versions.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Madden on Switch 2 is not 60fps but the game still plays good!  Cant explain it, but it’s definitely smoother than 30fps too.  I have about two hours of gameplay here on X and YouTube you can see for yourself.  Definitely would recommend the game!  Here is a clip of a pick 6… <a href="https://t.co/6yHIhQhrgd">pic.twitter.com/6yHIhQhrgd</a></p> <p>— OBE1plays YouTube (@OBE1plays) <a href="https://twitter.com/OBE1plays/status/1953533129655722051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>For those who are playing <em>Madden 26</em> on Switch 2, fans are already circulating two urban legend fixes to help make the experience go smoother. These tricks&nbsp;<em>might</em> be legitimate, or they might simply be the modern day placebo analogues to blowing in the cartridge. The first is making sure the game is installed on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk8lb9/switch_2_moving_game_to_internal_storage/">Switch 2’s internal memory</a> instead of being read of a cartridge or sitting on the Micro SD express card. The second is doing a hard reboot of the game and system if performance starts to get especially funky. At least until EA starts patching the game, some players are already resorting to turning it off and on again.</p> <p>Otherwise, the early access period is a good time to wait and let Madden 26 begin sorting itself out, a now familiar pattern to annual <em>Madden</em> obsessives. There will be the round of rushed fixes, fans saying, “Actually this entry is pretty great,” and then the mid-fall slump when the nagging issues come back to dominate the conversation. Any real movement in the franchise or player base will be marginal, at least <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-will-make-nfl-games-again-for-the-first-time-in-16-y-1842235385">until 2K releases its own football game</a> and there is finally some competition in the space again. But you don’t have to actually play <em>Madden</em> to enjoy the best part about each new release: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mkafrj/classic_ea/">a fresh season of glitches</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> was a wildly successful sequel to one of the Nintendo Switch’s most popular games, so an upgraded version on Nintendo Switch 2 was a no-brainer. The upgrade promises improved visuals, performance, HDR support, and more; arguably, there is no better way to experience this gorgeous open-world adventure. But how does the original version run on new hardware <i>without </i>the upgrade? Let’s discuss. We’ll also get into some helpful tips for getting started in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i>.</p>  <p>Say you’ve got a copy of <i>Tears of the Kingdom </i>on hand, but are short the $10 needed for the upgrade. Fortunately, the first Switch edition of <i>TotK</i> is the same, incredible game many of us fell in love with in 2023. Yes, the resolution is lower, the load times are slower, but it remains one of Link’s greatest adventures yet.</p> <p>Without the upgrade, <i>TotK</i> will still only run at 30 frames-per-second on Switch 2. That said, the framerate is more stable, so you’ll have a slightly better experience than what you’d get on aging, OG Switch hardware.</p>

 <p>As has been <a href="https://youtu.be/XtdaeX_fGHI">well documented by this point</a>, the Switch 2 upgrade is a dramatic improvement. The game looks sharper, it runs at double the framerate, and load times have been cut in half. Also, the Zelda Notes are an excellent dose of extra lore.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Zelda Totk switch 2 UPGRADE vs ORIGINAL edition LOADING comparison" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBBtcxdv2mg"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;Unless you’re running on a super tight budget, we wholeheartedly recommend spending the extra 10 bucks to enjoy this masterpiece. Now, let’s get to some helpful tips for those jumping off a Sky Island for the very first time.</p> <hr> <h2><span id="tips-for-tears-of-the-kingdom-newcomers"></span>Tips for <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i> newcomers<span></span></h2>  <h3><span id="make-a-beeline-for-the-paraglider"></span>Make a beeline for the paraglider<span></span></h3> <p>Anyone who has played <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> will remember the paraglider being an immensely important part of Link’s kit, helping him glide around and reach new spots. It’s only more vital in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </i>due to the game’s heavier focus on sky exploration, so don’t accidentally start exploring too much of Hyrule before getting your hands on it. Luckily, you just need to follow the first few hours of the main quest to score the paraglider, so you’ll be gliding in no time at all.</p>

 <h3><span id="level-stamina-before-hearts"></span>Level stamina before hearts<span></span></h3> <p>Enemies in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> hit hard as hell, with some baddies being able to one-shot you handily during the first half of the game even if you have a few extra hearts. With this in mind, it’s a good idea to prioritize leveling your stamina as much as possible early on. This will let you do a lot more climbing and gliding, which is very important for reaching new areas or shrines with exciting loot.</p> <p>You can always cook and eat meals that give you extra hearts if you really need them. And after making a little more progress in the game, you’ll be able to respec your hearts and stamina for 120 rupees at a particular statue in Lookout Landing, so you’ll be able to change things up as you see fit.</p>

 <h3><span id="fuse-a-lot-of-makeshift-hammers-and-keep-them-handy"></span>Fuse a lot of makeshift hammers and keep them handy<span></span></h3> <p>This may seem like a niche tip, but keeping makeshift hammers around is one of the most helpful things you can do for yourself in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</i> You’ll find yourself exploring numerous deep caves in Hyrule, and you’ll be shocked at how many contain multiple pathways blocked by breakable rocks.</p> <p>Though you may be able to use bomb plants or other methods to clear rock blockages, hammer weapons, which you can make by fusing a normal weapon with a rock/boulder (or certain other hard materials), allow you to attack specific pieces of the blockage to carve a path just big enough for you to fit through. Even better, breaking the blockage will sometimes spawn new rocks you can use to fuse a brand-new makeshift hammer!</p>

 <p>You’ll find a more efficient way to break these walls later in the game–but until then, keep fusing!</p> <h3><span id="trust-your-own-ingenuity"></span>Trust your own ingenuity<span></span></h3> <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </i>goes big on the Ultrahand ability, which lets you combine various items in the world to create everything from simple platforms to intricate machines. And if you’re going to solve every puzzle and reach every well-hidden secret in Hyrule, you’ll need to master this ability.</p> <p>While you may encounter some puzzles or hard-to-reach-items here and there that have only one or two building solutions, a significant portion of these scenarios can benefit from your ingenuity. So, feel free to opt for a complex device or even a sloppy, half-assed solution of your own choosing. You’d be surprised at how often your own random building ideas can get the job done–sometimes even easier than the solutions the developers intended for you to use.</p> <p>Ultrahand doesn’t control you—you control Ultrahand.</p> <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> is available now for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>BANG! One moment, I was running down a dusty street in Cairo; the next moment, I was on my ass, bleeding out. Someone had shot me. A few teammates near me fired into the building where my attacker was and killed him. Lying on the ground, I watched them reload their rifles, look around for other enemies, and then…they just ran off, leaving me to die in the street. They could have revived me, but they didn’t. Instead, I had to respawn and burn one of our conquest tickets. It was annoying, and it keeps happening in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>.</p> <p>On August 7, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-huge-player-count-steam-beta-jurassic-forza-castle-crashers-2000616307"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a> launched on consoles and PC. However, for now can only play if you have an early access code, as the beta doesn’t go fully open until August 9. It’s weird to gatekeep an “open” beta, but whatever. Since it launched on Thursday, I’ve been squeezing in as many matches of Conquest and Breakthrough as I can and having a great time. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">I really enjoyed EA’s upcoming military shooter</a> when I played it <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">earlier this month at a big event in Los Angeles</a>, and I still like <em>BF6</em> now that I’m playing it at home. The gunplay is tight and responsive, everything sounds dangerous, explosions are incredible, and the maps are big, but not too big. Good shit. But what isn’t good is how frequently people don’t revive me or others when we’re down. Instead, they just run by or stand near me and do nothing. Please, stop ignoring your downed comrades and help them out.</p> <p>You might be thinking, “Well, if they aren’t medics, they can’t help you.” But that’s not how <em>Battlefield 6</em> works. In this game, anyone can revive a downed soldier by running up to them, holding a specific button, and dragging them to safety. After a few seconds of holding onto the injured player, they’ll be revived with partial health. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385">It’s a wonderful mechanic</a> that has already led to some incredible moments with friends while playing the beta. And I’m always willing to drag a random player to safety and bring them back into the fight as it’s fun, useful, and doesn’t take too long.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Sadly, most other players either don’t realize that anyone can drag and revive players, or don’t care to help. Worse, I see plenty of people playing the Support class, which has access to defib paddles that can instantly revive people, and they also ignore me and my friends. Why are you playing the medic-themed class that is built around helping people if you just run by all your downed teammates? It’s incredibly annoying and has led to my team losing matches because we keep respawning to get back into the action instead of reviving, and that burns through our respawn tickets in modes like Conquest. It also makes it harder for me to revive people because so many players just instantly respawn the moment they die, as they assume, understandably, that nobody is going to help them. Why waste time waiting for help that is unlikely to come? That leads to the team burning through tickets even faster. It’s all very frustrating.</p> <p>Look, I don’t expect to be revived every single time I go down. Sometimes I’m too far away from others. Sometimes there’s a fucking tank next to me. I’m not expecting people to throw themselves into danger just to revive me. But it would be nice if I didn’t have to bleed out slowly in a building filled with teammates simply because nobody grabbed me and helped. So, I ask you all, during the open beta and when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches later this October, to please, please, please revive people more. You’ll feel better, they’ll be happy, and your team won’t burn a ticket. Everyone wins. Doesn’t that sound nice?</p>
