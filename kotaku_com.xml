              <p>Winter power outages strike more frequently than most people realize with ice storms, heavy snow and equipment failures leaving homes without electricity for hours or days at critical moments. Having backup power transforms these emergencies from stressful crises into manageable inconveniences by keeping essential appliances running.</p>
<p>EcoFlow specializes in portable power stations that bridge the gap between small battery banks and expensive whole-home generators and delivers practical backup capacity without professional installation. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/">At $349, down from $699, the Delta 2 has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday while <strong>being EcoFlow’s bestselling model across several years</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 1800W Output Powers Real Appliances</h2>
<p>The<strong> constant 1800W AC power with an accompanying surge power of 2700W</strong> enables the operation of genuine household electronics such as full-sized refrigerators, microwave ovens, space heaters, and medical electronics, beyond the capability of smaller power stations. The power offered here almost competes with the power offered by conventional gas-generators whose use has long been hamstrung by the need for gas tanks, the resultant air pollution, and the lack of quiet operation.</p>



<p>In the event of power outage during the cold seasons, the Delta 2 can power a furnace blower motor, light a refrigerator in order to save the food, and recharge mobile and laptop collections all at the same time. The <strong>use of all the available 15 outlets, ranging from the AC, USB-A, USB-C, and DC ports</strong>&nbsp;enables the operation of all the needed electronics.</p>



<p>The <strong>Delta 2 takes only 50 minutes to charge from empty to 80%</strong> and this has changed the way you now prepare in advance when there are forecasts of storms and unexpected power outages. Conventional portable power stations need 6-8 hours to fully recharge, and this means you could be left in the dark when there are forecasts of storm power outages and when the brief periods offered when the power may be restored are not sufficient for recharging.</p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery chemistry, LiFePO4, has an extraordinary lifespan<strong>, boasting 3000+ charge cycles and retention levels over 80% capacity</strong>, estimated at about 10 years. Another advantage the LiFePO4 battery chemistry boasts over other lithium-ion batteries is increased safety. The battery management system constantly monitors voltage, current, and temperatures in all the cells and <strong>protects against overcharge, over-discharge, overcurrent, and short-circuit conditions.</strong></p>
<p>While the EcoFlow Delta 2 normally costs $349, you can get this power solution with 1800W, 50-minute fast charging and long-lasting LiFePO4 battery technology at an unbelievable price this Black Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>looks primed to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>take several awards home at The Game Awards next month</span></a><span>. Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>several nominations across multiple categories</span></a><span>, including the big one: Game of the Year. One category it is most represented in is Best Performance, which features three members of its English voice cast, one of whom has sparked a surprising conversation about how we recognize performances in video games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Daredevil </span></i><span>actor Charlie Cox, the voice behind </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s gunslinging false protagonist, admits that he wasn’t as involved in the game as other members of the cast. He spent a few hours in the booth and was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-charlie-cox-gustave-voice-1851784940"><span>surprised to hear just how much people loved his character</span></a><span>. Back in July, he </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-cox-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-actor-1851786701"><span>admitted he still hadn’t played the game yet, either</span></a><span>. Now that his performance as Gustave has been nominated for an award, Cox seems hesitant to take any of the credit.</span></p>

 <p><span>During a Q&amp;A segment at the La Conve 64 event in Mexico, Cox said that any credit he gets for his voice performance should be given to Gustave’s motion capture actor.</span></p> <p><span>“I’m thrilled for this nomination,” Cox said. “I’ve said this before, and I think it’s important to say, there’s an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game. So any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him because I kind of believe that the performance of that character is really down to him, and my voice is just part of that process.”</span></p>

   <p><span>Cazoria has since responded to Cox’s sentiment on his </span><a href="https://x.com/maxence_cazorla/status/1993339680608465405?s=20"><span>X account</span></a><span>, saying that the actor’s words were appreciated, but bringing Gustave to life was a team effort.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for all the messages these past few days.<br>Charlie’s words were incredibly generous, and I’m truly grateful 🙏<br>Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I’m honored to have played my part in it.<br>Thank you all so much for the love and support 🌹🤍<br>Tomorrow comes ✨</p> <p>— Maxence Cazorla (@maxence_cazorla) <a href="https://twitter.com/maxence_cazorla/status/1993339680608465405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Notably, Cazoria was also the motion capture for Renoir and Verso. Ben Starr, who provided the English dub for Verso, is also nominated in the Best Performance category, as well as Jennifer English for her role as Maelle. Cazoria may not be the name many English-speaking players associate with these characters, but as Cox points out, the motion capture artists deserve credit for helping bring these characters to life.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Is there a future where The Game Awards recognizes motion capture actors separately from voice actors? Some industry professionals, like </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>performance director Aliona Baranova, sure hope so.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yup, i think we should have a motion capture category at awards shows <a href="https://t.co/6vYaLwXU7X">https://t.co/6vYaLwXU7X</a></p> <p>— Aliona Baranova (@alionabaranova1) <a href="https://twitter.com/alionabaranova1/status/1993588077508673841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I would be surprised if The Game Awards bothers to make that distinction. The show already has a propensity to imperfectly lump categories together, such as discontinuing the Best Shooter category to put those games in the Best Action Game pile. But maybe as the industry becomes more aware of how many moving parts make up a whole character like Gustave, award shows will find ways to recognize everyone involved, rather than just the person behind the voice.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The holiday season is here, and to celebrate the most festive time of year, PlayStation is offering all PlayStation Plus subscribers extra games to download and play in December. ‘Tis the season and all that.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-december-lego-horizon-adventures-killing-floor-3-the-outlast-trials-more/">On November 26, PlayStation revealed December’s monthly games</a> that will be available to all PS Plus subscribers across all tiers. These games will be available to add to your PlayStation library permanently on December 2. Once added, you can install them and play them whenever you want as long as you are an active PS Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium subscriber. Here’s the list of games and what platforms they are available on.</p> <ul> <li><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>Killing Floor 3</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>The Outlast Trials</em> – PS4, PS5</li> <li><em>Synduality Echo of Ada</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS4, PS5</li> </ul> <p>You don’t want to wait too long to grab these PS Plus monthly games, as they are only available to grab for free until January 5.</p> <p>This is one of the better months for PS Plus in some time<em>.<a href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088"> Neon White</a></em> alone makes this a fantastic list of games. Its fast-paced platforming/shooting action is hard to put down, and the story it tells is equally engrossing. I expect many players will be fighting among friends to reach the top of the leaderboards.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile<em>, LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is the perfect game for the holidays. If you have young kids hanging out at your house, and you can pull them away from <em>Roblox</em> for a few hours, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><em>Horizon Adventures</em></a> is a fantastic co-op game that will help keep them distracted while the adults cook, clean, and wrap last-minute gifts.</p> <p>Or maybe you want to be scared during your holiday break? Well, then I’d check ou<em>t The Outlast Trials,</em> though you might want to scooch away the kids at your house before booting that one up. And don’t forget to add November’s freebies to your PlayStation account library. You have until December 1 to grab <em>Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, </em>and <em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <p>Samsung enjoys a great reputation in the electronics industry, especially when it comes to its extensive lineup of tablets, ranging from affordable models to high-end models such as the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra (that cost over $1,000). The <strong>Galaxy Tab A9+ model is placed in the budget category</strong> and provides all the basic functionalities of a tablet at an affordable cost. Now available at a record-low price on Amazon,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/"> the Black Friday offer has cut the 64GB / WiFi tablet price to $149 from the earlier cost of $219</a> and makes it the lowest-priced quality tablet in the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11-Inch Screen with 90Hz Refresh</h2>
<p>The <strong>11-inch screen means you get plenty of room to watch videos</strong>, work, and play without the bulk of larger tablets. The<strong> 90Hz refresh rate</strong> means you get even smoother animations and video compared with the typical 60Hz offered on other budget tablets. While the brightness levels are sufficient in indoor conditions, using it in direct sunlight outdoors still isn’t optimal, just like other tablets in the same price range. The tablet has an average battery performance similar to other tablets in the same range.</p>
<p>The <strong>quad-speaker audio system is boasting Dolby Atmos</strong> and provides better audio than the average tablet, courtesy of the soundstage effect. Videos and TV shows come alive with surround sound, whose audio effects help in better listening, particularly in the center. Playing tunes using the quad-speaker audio system provides better audio than the average tablet Speaker, since the audio system has separate audio inputs on the left and right side. The<strong> four speakers are optimized in a landscape setup</strong>, and allows the mobile tablet device to offer better left and right audio stereo when watching videos.</p>



<p>The improved chipset ensures there is sufficient power available for all basic needs like browsing, video watching, social networking, emails, and gaming, without the annoyance and disappointment that accompanies underperforming and budget-friendly tablets. Multiple Chrome tabs run well, video streaming occurs in high definition, and most leading mobile games run at an adequate frame rate.</p>
<p>The <em>Multi Window Display</em> feature means you can have <strong>multiple apps running at the same time in split-screen</strong> and floating window modes, making the tablet truly a productivity tool. Surf websites and jot notes in OneNote, watch videos on YouTube and respond to emails, and even cook recipes while video chatting with family. The large screen has room for up to three apps running side by side, without overcrowding each individual screen. This multitasking feature pushes the Tab A9+ beyond the territory of a consumption tablet.</p>



<p>With a <strong>thickness of only 6.9mm and a weight that measures in at 480g</strong>, there’s no denying the phone’s portability. This lightweight smartphone means that when you have to spend long periods holding the smartphone, you won’t experience much fatigue in the arms. The smartphone’s ruggedness means that you don’t have to worry about the typical drops and bumps when using the smartphone in your family.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Tab A9+ is now available for $149 and comes with features such as an 11-inch 90Hz screen, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, a refined processor, Multi Window functionality and the ability to <strong>expand the microSD card slot</strong>, all at 32% off the normal price on this Black Friday. The reduced price put forth by Samsung provides cost-effective quality tablets, especially designed for those who are on a budget and still need functional tablets.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Is More Of The Same—That’s Why I’m Playing It]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review-impressions-2000647644</link>
            <guid>1365601</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yeah, I’m playing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span>. Not the weird campaign or the extra-large Zombies offering, but the multiplayer. Team Deathmatch, mostly, maybe some Kill Confirmed. A few hours a couple of days a week, ass parked on the couch, brain on autopilot, cranking some </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span>. This describes me recently, but it could also describe versions of me stretching back more than 15 years ago.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not nostalgia as much as it’s resignation, or the quiet reliance on something familiar. </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> feels empty and sad. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> is too big and tactical for my twitchy shooter preference. </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> and</span><i><span> Arc Raiders</span></i><span> are much longer time sucks. In this regard, I suppose I’m Activision’s ideal consumer: a tired millennial who just wants to shoot shit quickly.</span></p>

 <p><span>When playing </span><i><span>Black Ops 7,</span></i><span> I am pulled into a parallel universe like the one from </span><i><span>Interstellar</span></i><span>. Every </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> that has ever existed or will exist is here, and I can press all of their buttons at once. The pre-game lobby music sounds identical to the music from </span><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i><span>, several of the Operators are from last year’s Zombies mode, and the map I’m playing on is a recreation of one from 2012’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 2</span></i><span>. Nuketown 24/7 is here, and it’s available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It always has been.</span></p>

 <p><span>The various bells and whistles that are supposed to make this version of </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> worth spending another $70 on are mostly lost on me (Activision gave me a code, plus it’s on Game Pass). I sink into comfort, into the pre-made loadouts or the singular one I build myself (a kitted-out AR, Semtex, Cold-Blooded), into cooking a sticky before throwing it into a crowded room, into reloading after every shot fired to ensure I have a full clip, and I relax into repetition.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I queue up in a lobby. Someone calls someone else the r-slur. I go 25 and 4. The lobby automatically queues up for another game. Someone calls someone else the f-slur. I go 18 and 9. I do this on repeat for a few hours, before dinner or bed beckons. Am I having fun? I guess?</span></p>

 <p><span>There are new things in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> multiplayer, of course. The most noticeable is the wall jump, which the sweatier players have already perfected in a particularly irritating manner—imagine your standard </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> but with the vertical leap of a </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> game that’s far more erratic. Skirmish, the 20v20 mode that sees players glide into a larger map on suited wings to try and capture various points, keeps me occupied for a few rounds. Then I return to TDM.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The new maps are fun, but they all blur together into a vague, </span><i><span>Call of Duty-shaped</span></i><span> smear. This doesn’t deter me, though it should. Instead, I am almost soothed by the banality of it all. I realize after a particularly dominant match that, out of all the shooter franchises I’ve played throughout the years, I am most attuned to these former pseudo-mil-sims turned power fantasies. While playing </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, I enter a flow state that I can’t mimic in any other game: my fingers move without me willing them to, my body relaxes like I’m neck-deep in a sauna, my eyes glaze over as if under a spell.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s difficult to argue the artistic merits of a gigantic video game publisher annually pushing out a hoo-rah shooter (</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>with at least some help from generative AI</span></a><span>), I can’t lie and act like I’m not playing them. But like the comfort breakfast I would eat every day in elementary school to exercise some control over my life, I will eventually grow tired of this taste. First, it was Entemann’s corn muffins, then it was Eggo waffles. Now it’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, tomorrow it might be </span><i><span>Halo Infinite </span></i><span>again. For those of us who love first-person shooters with fast queue times, the pickings are slim, and </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is there every year. </span></p>
