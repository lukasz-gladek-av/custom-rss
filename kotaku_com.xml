You need to understand both of its modes <em>and</em> the unique mechanics to use it properly. That’s asking for a lot when compared with other weapons in the game, but we promise the damage it delivers makes this worth the extra effort.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-recommend-id="image://1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-recommend-id="image://1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>What makes the Charge Blade such a complex weapon is that it’s made up of two weapon configurations: Sword Mode and Axe Mode.</strong> The former equips you with a sword and shield for quick movement and defensive guarding; the latter combines the two into a heavy axe that sacrifices your defense and speed for powerful attacks.</p><p>Knowing when to swap between the two is naturally an important part of learning how to use a Charge Blade. Cycling between the two modes is vital for combat. A unique mechanic for this weapon will have you gather energy with your sword to then use for your axe, or to provide buffs to your equipment.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-recommend-id="image://ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-recommend-id="image://ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Aside from offering two weapon modes, the Charge Blade’s defining trait is its Phial mechanic. Underneath the Melee Weapon Sharpness gauge will be four icons to keep an eye on: a Sword, a Shield, an Axe, and a set of five phials. <strong>Landing hits in Sword Mode will gradually accumulate energy.</strong> The outline of the phials will turn yellow and then red to convey how much energy you’ve built up. Keep attacking and the icons will start flashing bright red to signal that you have too much, with your sword attacks bouncing off enemies until you’ve discharged the energy.</p><p>You have a few options for how to charge the phials:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Basic Charge</strong> – This forms the basis of your gameplay loop. Activate the Charge command by pressing R2 + Circle or RT + B to store the energy in your phials. Do this when the Phials are yellow or red to fill up three of them, or all of them, respectively. The energy will then be consumed through the various Axe: Element Discharge moves, including the important Amped Element Discharge (AED) and Super Amped Element Discharge (SAED). You can enhance these even further by charging the phials twice in a row before going into Axe Mode</li><li><strong>Element Boost</strong> – Hold down Circle or B during the Charge animation to receive Elemental Boost. This is indicated by the Shield icon lighting up, although it’s not purely a defensive buff. Having this active will enhance your guard and make it possible to follow up an AED with an SAED in Axe Mode</li><li><strong>Condensed Elemental Slash</strong> – If you have Element Boost active, you can hold Triangle or Y during the Charge animation to activate Sword Boost Mode. Your sword attacks will deal more damage and will no longer deflect</li></ul><p>The basic gameplay loop is to charge your phials, consume them in Axe Mode, and then return to Sword Mode to charge again. I highly recommend activating the buffs for your shield and sword if you want to make the most out of this weapon. A lot of extra damage will be left on the table by not making use of them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-recommend-id="image://9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-recommend-id="image://9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There is another buff tangibly related to the Phial mechanic. Power Axe Mode, commonly referred to as Savage Axe by fans, will significantly increase the heavy weapon’s effectiveness. Not only does it lessen Phial usage so that relevant attacks only use half of a Phial at a time, but it also lets you add on more damage to your attacks by holding the face buttons down, causing the Axe portion to spin like a saw blade. You can tear through everything in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> campaign</a></span> with strong attacks like these.</p><p>Power Axe Mode can be triggered through the following methods:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Perfect Guard &gt; Savage Axe Slash – After successfully timing a Perfect Guard, you can press Triangle/Y to use Savage Axe Slash and activate Power Axe Mode</li><li>Mounted Finisher – Grabbing onto a monster’s back and using a Mounted Finisher (R1/RB over a wound) will activate Power Axe Mode</li><li>Focus Slash: Double Rend – Holding L2/LT and then pressing R1/RB will use Focus Slash: Double Rend.

Landing just one of these will turn your phial icons yellow, with another turning them red. Add in another attack in between, like Sword: Shield Thrust (Triangle+Circle/Y+B), and you’ll have a full charge ready in no time. Feel free to tweak the above combo with a couple of starting attacks or use it to charge into Element Boost or Sword Boost Mode instead.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>SAED Combo</strong>: Circle/B &gt; Circle/B &gt; Circle/B &gt; Triangle+Circle/Y+B</li></ul><p>Sometimes, the best combos just take a bit of button mashing. Press Circle/B in Axe Mode to use Element Discharge I. Press it again to use Element Discharge II, and as a special combo-exclusive input, pressing it a third time will bring out an AED. If you have your Element Boost active, follow this up with the standard SAED input to dump the rest of your Phial energy into one deadly attack. Make sure to hold the buttons with Power Axe Mode to top off with even more damage.</p><hr><p>Every weapon has some deeper strategies, but none matches the Charge Blade’s technical aspects. You’ll certainly think it’s worth it for the massive damage and unparalleled versatility.

A cute but dangerous alien crash lands on Earth, pretends to be a dog, and becomes the pet and best friend of Lilo. Of course, as you would expect, shenanigans ensue. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is set to arrive in theaters on May 23. Here’s the first official trailer: </p><p> <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>stars Maia Kealoha as Lilo Pelekai. The original voice of Stitch, Chris Sanders, is back behind the now CG incarnation of the alien. He wrote and directed the OG animated film back in 2002. Sydney Agudong also stars as Lilo’s sister and guardian Nani Pelekai. </p><p>It’s been a long time coming for <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The live-action remake was announced all the way back in 2018</a></span>. Since then, the film has gone through a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tumultuous development</a></span>, with different directors and writers hopping on and off the project. At one point, <em>Wicked </em>director Jon M. Chu was attached to this thing! Wild. There was also casting controversy, too, with at least one actor replaced before filming after people spotted them using some slurs online. </p><p>But after all that,<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>is finally coming to theaters, and after watching this first trailer my reaction is: Ehh... okay. Fine, whatever. Meh. </p><p>I understand that my love of the original will make it nearly impossible for me to be impartial about this new remake, but I just don’t think we needed this movie. Stitch seems mostly okay, but the trailer feels really flat and people seemed bored to be involved. The kid seems uninterested in what’s happening, likely because she’s a child and is being asked to act alongside nothing or blue-covered tennis balls. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remember those stories of how the kids in <em>ET </em>cried because they thought he had died on set</a></span>? That ain’t happening in an era where every film uses CG to create their alien characters. </p><p>Regardless, I get that Disney wants money and I know that kids aren’t as into 2D animation or even CG animation anymore, and prefer live-action stuff. As a result, we are getting a live action remake of basically every Disney movie ever made, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">including the horrendous-looking <em>Snow White</em></a></span><em>.</em> And yeah, to be clear: This  movie and Disney’s other live action remakes are all for kids. So while I don’t mind dunking on it or laughing at people posting jokes about the new trailer on Twitter, ultimately, what will determine if <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is a success is if kids drag enough parents to the theater in May. We’ll find out this Summer. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you decide to hop from PC to PlayStation 5, for example, you must start a new game, a new hunter, and grind through the story and monster hunts a second time.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you don’t have a buddy or two to hunt with, the game’s camp lobbies allow for up to 100 players simultaneously, and you can party up with any of them, so long as you have crossplay enabled!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
