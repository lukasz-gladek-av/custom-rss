              <p>How old is your home Wi-Fi router? Take this post as a notice that it might be time for an upgrade. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6769/">TP-Link is one of the best in the business, and right now Amazon happens to have its Archer AX21 Wi-Fi 6 router on sale for a hefty 35% discount.</a> The router is usually priced at $80, but has come down to just $52 for a limited time. That means you’ll be saving a cool $28 which you can go spend on V-bucks or something to grab the new Eric Cartman skin in <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>
<p>This dual-band Wi-Fi router is able to achieve super fast speeds, with greater capacity and reduced network congestion compared to its older model. You’ll be able to enjoy smoother online gaming and more stable streaming, as well as reach download speeds of up to 1.8Gbps in total bandwidth. The 5GHz band supports up to 1,200Mbps while the 2.4Ghz supports another 574 Mbps. Of course, your exact performance may vary based on a number of factors including distance between devices and obstacles such as walls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The TP-Link router has four Ethernet LAN ports, so you can connect all your devices on which you need the best, uninterrupted internet connections. Plug in your gaming PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and your Nintendo Switch 2. That’s your four right there. Additionally, more than 40 devices can be connected over Wi-Fi at once.</p>
<h2>Build Your Own Mesh Network</h2>
<p>This is an EasyMesh compatible unit—meaning you can use this as your main router for network onboarding and management. Then combine it with either other EasyMesh compatible routers or range extenders to turn your home network into a mesh network. This can result in better coverage and fewer (hopefully no) dead spots throughout your house or apartment. Mesh networks will intelligently switch your Wi-Fi-enabled devices from one node to the next as it detects it moving throughout your home. As in, you’re going from downstairs to upstairs with your phone in your pocket, it’ll switch over which router its connected to based on proximity. Each router will also share the same Wi-Fi name so no extra confusion there.</p>



<p>The TP-Link Archer AX21 router is listed as working with Amazon Alexa. However, not much info is provided on&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> you can do with Alexa with it. I do find it mildly amusing to be like, “Alexa, disconnect Derek’s PS5 from the Wi-Fi,” while your kid brother is about to get his very first Victory Royale<em>.</em> Again, though, not sure if that’s possible.</p>

              <p>We’re already more than halfway through January. What kind of changes have you been implementing to actually hit some of your 2026 goals? Perhaps you have high hopes of getting into better shape, eating healthier, maybe you’re aiming to learn a new skill. If your big plans are just to be more productive than ever before, you might want to take a look at your work setup. most of us are happy just working off a laptop, but you’re really limiting your potential by sticking with such little screen real estate. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">A portable monitor can go a long way, and this one from MNN happens to be seeing a major discount right now. Normally priced at $59, it’s come down to an even $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="588">Remote work has allowed many of us the flexibility to step outside our homes and get work done from anywhere we please, be it a coffee shops, library, or even a hotel room. Although, a change of environment can introduces a drawback. You’re now stuck working off just you’re laptop, instead of your elaborate multi-screen desktop home setup I’m assuming you must have. Managing emails, documents, spreadsheets, and video calls on a single laptop screen means all those windows are fighting for the same bit of space. A portable monitor addresses this issue by providing an additional display, closely mimicking the comfort and efficiency of your home setup wherever you happen to be working.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="590" data-end="1026">The MNN 15.6-inch portable monitor is built with mobile professionals in mind. Its large display makes it easier to view and manage multiple apps at once. It has an HD resolution of 1080p and render color brightly and accurately.</p>
<p data-start="1028" data-end="1318">Getting started is simple and straightforward. The monitor connects through either of its two USB-C ports, ensuring compatibility with a wide variety of devices. In addition to laptops, it can be used with smartphones, desktop PCs, PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and even a Nintendo Switch.</p>


<h2 data-start="1028" data-end="1318">Built for Travel</h2>
<p data-start="1320" data-end="1883" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With an ultra-slim profile measuring just 0.3 inches thin and 1.52 lbs., the monitor fits easily into a backpack or laptop bag without adding extra weight or bulk. It also comes with a scratch-resistant smart cover made from durable PU leather, providing extra protection while traveling. The cover doubles as a stand using a frameless magnetic design, allowing the monitor to be positioned in either landscape or portrait mode. Choose the orientation that best matches your workflow, whether you’re writing, coding, or scrolling through lengthy documents. Sometimes it’s nice to just have your Slack chats positioned vertically on the second display, while you’re getting your actual work done in front of you on your laptop screen.</p>
