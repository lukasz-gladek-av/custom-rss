            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite being a beloved, award-winning, and popular cartoon,<em> Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> never got an official video game adaptation. And since the show has been out of production for over 23 years now, it’s unlikely to ever get one at this point. But don’t worry, one fan is working hard on making the <em>Courage</em> game you’ve always wanted, and it’s close to launching. You’ll just need a copy of <em>Dreams</em> to play it.</p> <p>Here’s the latest trailer for <a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@elgatodeltejado">El Gato Del Tejado’s</a> upcoming <em>Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> game, which reveals that the full game will finally be available on November 28, following a previously released demo and <a href="https://youtu.be/0CyY0HVccjY">nearly two years of development</a>. I think the trailer perfectly captures the creepy and surreal vibes of the original Cartoon Network show, complete with Courage screaming and monsters trying to kill him and his owners.</p>

  <p>The weird part about El Gato Del Tejado’s upcoming fan game is that it’s not being developed in Unreal or Unity, as you might expect. Instead, the creator (who is also <a href="https://youtu.be/2HiRJrvvp58">remastering <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</em></a> and working on other cool projects) has chosen to use <em>Dreams</em> to build this creepy <em>Courage</em> game.</p>

 <p>Remember <em>Dreams</em>? It was the next creative game from <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> studio Media Molecule and offered players a full suite of tools to create and share their own games. Sadly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-ps4s-spectacular-dreams-game-is-hurting-from-a-lack-1845925922">the game’s community dried up</a> after it became clear that <em>Dreams</em> would never be supported on PC or <a href="https://kotaku.com/dreams-ps4-ps5-media-molecule-last-update-date-1850323245">get the long-term care it needed</a>. But that hasn’t stopped El Gato from devoting the last few years to becoming a truly skilled <em>Dreams</em> developer. And the <em>Courage</em> game really shows this off. I think if you showed that trailer above to most people, they’d not guess it was made in <em>Dreams</em>.</p> <p>Regardless of how it was made, I’ll be checking it out later this month when it launches on PS4/PS5 via <em>Dreams</em>. I just need to uh…download <em>Dreams</em> again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sidekicks seemed like a slam dunk for <em>Fortnite</em>. Add customizable pets that follow you around during matches and impress your friends. What could go wrong? Well, given the way they’ve been implemented in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">current <em>Simpsons</em> season</a>, a lot, apparently. One dramatic rallying cry within the community is calling for players to boycott the newest microtransaction opportunity over accusations of “greed.”</p> <p>There are three main issues. The first is that Sidekicks—a banana dog named Peels <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks?lang=en-US">went live in the battle pass on November 1</a>—can only be customized once. After selecting things like size, color, and so on, you can’t go back to change them, forcing you to buy a second Sidekick if you want them to look different. Second, opponents can’t see Sidekicks, only your squadmates. And third, upcoming Sidekicks will be very expensive, at least according to <a href="https://x.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984100625651790002">alleged leaks</a>. Some suggest prices as high as 2,800 V-Bucks a piece. Not great!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fortnite</a> please make the pricing more reasonable and let us edit our pets to whatever we want and for FREE once we own it.</p> <p>“You can purchase the same Sidekick multiple times to give them different Appearances” <a href="https://t.co/0B1CtTtDwS">pic.twitter.com/0B1CtTtDwS</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Leaks | Pluto V2 (@FortnitePV2) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984100625651790002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Why do I care so much about this?” wrote Mabdog420 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1omtr3l/please_do_not_buy_sidekicks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on the<em> Fortnite</em> subreddit</a>. “Why not just not buy the sidekicks and shut up about it? Because if we let this go unchecked it will ONLY GET WORSE. Epic always tries to implement predatory pricing or practices like reducing xp gains, and every time we’ve had to fight back to stop it.”</p>

 <p>Some players in the comments reported being sent a user survey ahead of Sidekicks officially joining the<em> Fortnite</em> shop on November 7. “How do you feel about having to purchase an additional copy of the same sidekick if you want to customize your sidekick with different features?” it asks. Many are putting “Strongly Dislike” and wondering who on god’s green earth would put anything else.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite is currently sending out surveys to players, asking them about sidekicks and their controversial features 👀</p> <p>They want to know what players think about "basic features" being permanently locked and the option to re-purchase them <a href="https://t.co/oJUEODR32C">pic.twitter.com/oJUEODR32C</a></p> <p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1985016913072927059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Others have little faith that the broader <em>Fortnite</em> community will be able to resist, citing the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1852515768732139725">addition of cosmetic shoes a year ago</a> that other players can barely see but that enough people are seemingly spending real money to buy anyway. “I still find the shoes a bigger scam than this,” one player wrote. The ongoing trend is making some fans lose hope.</p> <p>“Like someone who started pretty early in the game it makes me so sad to see what this has become,” another player wrote. “It’s like Once-ler in the Lorax but a game, to where we have to fight a metaphorical war just to get fair treatment. then having to settle with the plain oatmeal that they give us that’s just slightly tastier then all the other brands on the market so that’s why we stay. It’s just so tiring and such a depressing way for a gaming company to be seen and be ran.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mlb-slugfest-2003">Remember<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a>? If you do remember this over-the-top PS2-era baseball game, it’s likely because of its often funny color commentators, Tim and Jimmy, who offered up bizarre or crude jokes and stories between hits. And it turns out that some of the duo’s lines went a bit too far for the MLB 20 years ago.</p> <p>Published by Midway Sports in 2002 for PS2, Xbox, and GameCube, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ngx93LcdCyI"><em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a> was an arcade-y baseball game heavily inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/come-to-think-of-it-the-original-nfl-blitz-did-have-a-5911734">Midway’s popular <em>NFL Blitz</em> series</a>. Like <em>Blitz</em>, <em>Slugfest 2003</em> added a lot of chaos, violence, and humor into the classic sport in a way that I can’t imagine Major League Baseball would be okay with in 2025. But even back in the early 2000s, the MLB wasn’t on board for <em>all</em> of Midway’s naughty jokes and dark commentary bits. Now, thanks to the excellent <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-retro-classic-virtual-console-piracy-vghf-hist-1848558311">Video Game History Foundation</a>, we can hear which jokes crossed the line with MLB execs.</p>

 <p>On November 3, the VGHF posted a video on social media sharing some of the group’s favorite cut commentary jokes from<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em>. The VGHF, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving and sharing video game history, says these cut lines, as well as some documents related to<em> MLB Slugfest’</em>s unused jokes, were discovered in the group’s archives on a CD.</p>   <p>Over on the VGHF’s archives, <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/item/c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8">you can find a document seemingly sent over to Midway</a>, presumably from the MLB, listing <a href="https://us.preservica.com/Render/render/external?entityRef=c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8&amp;token=17e03a1a-f2fc-42e4-a85e-9a8af97d201a">all the jokes</a> that were “disapproved” for use in the finished game. Some of these jokes are bad, and I totally support the MLB for asking for them to be cut. But some of the cut jokes don’t seem too bad. For example, this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Baseball’s the greatest sport in the world, but one thing I liked growing up was taking a pop bottle and breaking it with a rock.”</p></blockquote> <p>That’s just funny. But perhaps my favorite cut line that is, admittedly a bit dark, is this one:</p> <blockquote><p>“Jimmy: Tim, have you ever wondered if this booth could just collapse and kill the both of us?”</p> <p>“Tim: Jimmy, it’s all I think about.”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, you can check out all the cut lines and more from <em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em> over on the VGHF’s fantastic publicly accessible digital library and archive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vghf-old-retro-game-magazines-read-online-free-library-1851751951">which also contains over 1,500 video game magazines</a> that can be accessed for free. <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">Though I recommend kicking over a few bucks to VGHF if you can, as the group is doing the work that publishers won’t</a> and that’s worth supporting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fans of several of EA’s franchises are worried about what might happen to their favorite games and series now that the publisher and all its subsidiaries are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829"><span>being acquired</span></a><span> by some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/electronic-arts-acquisition-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner-2000629849"><span>worst people and forces you could possibly imagine</span></a><span>. The Saudi Arabian government and Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are buying out the company behind games like </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, BioWare’s catalog, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189"><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i></a><span>, all of which are known and celebrated for their queer characters and storylines. Fans are so worried about what might happen to these games and their inclusive design moving forward that </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>content creators have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-4-youtubers-pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-2000638834"><span>opted out of the series’ creator program</span></a><span> over the acquisition. With so much uncertainty lingering over the company right now, fans can’t help but wonder what franchises like </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>might look like after all the papers are signed. One of the original leads on the game says that if </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>were to abandon the queer community, it would lose the heart and soul of what has made the life sim series so popular since its debut in 2000.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/the-sims-designer-says-that-the-series-diversity-is-critical-especially-at-times-like-now/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, original </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sims 2</span></i><span> artist and director Charles London explained that representing same-sex relationships is “incredibly important” to the spirit of the franchise.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s everything,” London told </span><i><span>FRVR</span></i><span>, “and I think it’s existential for the business, right? It is certainly for society. I think it’s incredibly important for there to be a mainstream, beloved brand that says ‘love is love and people are people’ and all the things that I certainly personally believe in, but also I believe it is existential to that business because it is what allows it to be universally appealing, right? Young, old, male, female, gay, straight, other, right? American, Iranian, whatever.</span></p> <p><span>“Its appeal and its recognition of the fundamental truths of our humanity is what creates the empathetic and emotional connection to that game that makes it so powerful,” he continued. “It’s not that there’s so many pants you can dress them in. Don’t get me wrong, that’s an important part of the business, right? That’s also existential… but it’s very connected to evergreen toys like Barbie.”</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, London says that the choice to put same-sex relationships in those early games wasn’t even meant to be the act of a “band of fearless social revolutionaries,” but was merely seen as a reflection of the human experience the team sought to emulate in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, without which the game would have been telling a “lie.”</span></p> <p><span>“I think it goes beyond the sexual,” London said. “The answer I gave actually is applicable to, I think, as many of the decisions we could have possibly made in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> where we are agnostic and where we leave room for player choice. </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> must remain [agnostic] for it to be successful, it must remain a faithful canvas on which the player is free to project the story that, to them, is important and emotionally impactful.</span></p> <p><span>“And that includes not just sexuality, it includes body image, it includes race, and it includes the choice of clothing. It includes the choice of architecture, the choice of job, structure, all the magnificent diversity of actual human life, and this is something that the team, I think, deeply understands.”</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, EA asserts that its “values and [its] commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged,” but given the pending new ownership, fans are skeptical. The Saudi Arabian government has made several attempts to latch onto the video game industry in an attempt at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367"><span>“sportswashing” the dire state of its human rights laws</span></a><span>, which include the criminalization of same-sex acts, marriage, and cross-dressing. If someone in a position of power at EA says that developers are no longer allowed to implement queer characters and storylines, there’s no guarantee that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>or a future </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>project will include them in the future. Hopefully, someone at EA hears what London is saying and fights back against any such regulation. It would be a real fucking shame if these series with storied queer history weren’t allowed to maintain it in the future.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve never played an isometric RPG that didn’t feel better with turn-based combat, so it’s really neat to hear <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-exploit-update-obsidian-pillars-eternity-2-removed-steam-2000631633">that <em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> will be testing the more tactical option in the weeks ahead. It’ll hopefully be more intuitive for some players than the game’s existing “real-time with pause” combat, and get more people to check out where Obsidian Entertainment’s big fantasy series got its start.</p> <p>Testing on the new mode will begin November 5 for the PC version of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with plans to add it in a future patch. Game director Josh Sawyer called it a big undertaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8">in a video blog</a> announcing the update, and said it was inspired by the positive reception to the addition of turn-based combat in <em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-is-getting-a-turn-based-mode-1831961398">back in 2019</a>. That said, fans had criticism of the system which Sawyer said will be addressed for the version coming to the original <em>Pillars</em>.</p> <p>“One of the major changes is that action economy is a lot more accurate to the real-time with pause game,” he said. “It’s not a one-to-one translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real-time with pause mode.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action">To keep combat from feeling slow, lethality has been buffed so that fights aren’t super drawn out. Obsidian is also looking at a HUD toggle to let players swap combat modes on the fly, but there will be an option in the game settings menu that players can change at will either way. Fans are taking the news well and already demanding a sequel. “Please give this man the budget of <em>BG3</em> to make the next <em>Pillars</em>,” one wrote on YouTube.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> might be an older game at this point but its universe is one that keeps getting carried forward, most recently with 2025’s great <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">first-person action-RPG <em>Avowed</em></a>. The turn-based mode will make it easier for players to revisit where the fantasy world of Eora got its start. It would be nice if it eventually comes to the console version of the game as well.</p>

              <p>Following some disruptive server issues after <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend was slammed with an influx of players, Embark Studios is giving out 500 Raider Tokens to those who played on Sunday, which translates to about five bucks in real, U.S. dollars. It’s a nice gesture, but as many in the growing <i>Arc Raiders</i> community have pointed out, five bucks ain’t gonna get you a whole lot in the in-game shop.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate your patience as our servers had a wobble on Sunday, Scrappy must've pecked a few wires loose, he's been put on the naughty step 🐓<br>As a token of our thanks, we're sending 500 Raider Tokens to all Raiders who logged in on Sunday.</p> <p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1985381493829443634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers were <i>packed</i> this weekend. Hitting over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone has helped land the extraction shooter in the top five most-played games on Valve’s storefront, putting it just under <i>Battlefield 6</i>. The game is winning over an eager fanbase with its engaging progression systems and hardcore gameplay loop. But <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ in-game cosmetic shop is a sore spot for many, especially given that the game requires a $40 purchase to play.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">How The Hell Did We Let $20 Skins Become A Thing?</a></p> <p>“I thought $10 worth of coins would be enough to buy [a particular] skin, not the bundle, just the skin,” a Redditor writes in a post titled “The prices are…a little spicy, right?” Whether you’re playing <i>Fortnite </i>or <i>Diablo IV </i>or any number of other games, it’s become all too common to see high price tags affixed to the privilege of sporting a new digital look.</p>

   <p>But to many <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ fans, it’s not just the price, but the lack of customization options with the pricey cosmetics that’s getting under their skin. For now, while you can mix up different backpacks with different outfits, items like goggles, helmets, and boots are all tied to the skin they come with. So no astronaut suit with a cowboy hat for you.</p>

 <p>“The fact that [the] entire costume comes in one piece with some minimal customization,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm95vw5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment reads</a>, “rather than pieces you can slap on later and recombine with other stuff kinda drags value down for me.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm8blmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">highly upvoted comment reads</a>, “Step 1: Don’t buy it. Step 2: Watch as prices become reasonable.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1om2l23/we_need_to_be_able_to_mix_match_helmets_round_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit post with nearly 1,000 upvotes</a> encourages players to use Embark Studios’ support site to request the ability to swap helmets across different outfits.</p>

   <p>Other folks haven’t been as kind, with one popular post on Reddit describing a particular facial cosmetic as paying four bucks to “have poop smeared on your face,” while countless other players are upset over a lack of customization options for things such as beards.</p>   <p>Perhaps these pricing concerns wouldn’t be as salient if the game were free-to-play, like Embark’s other game <i>The Finals</i>. But given the $40 asking price, which feels plenty fair for a game of this scale, demanding half the cost of the game just to dress up a certain way feels odd to say the least.</p>
