              <p>Slow internet speeds aren’t just frustrating. They can affect everything from your work to late-night streaming sessions. If you’re done dealing with dead zones and calls dropping off mid-sentence, you need a solid mesh Wi-Fi system.</p>

<p>As for the speed, the Deco BE25 taps into Wi-Fi 7 with a 4-stream dual-band setup that reaches up to 5 Gbps combined; that’s 4,324 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on 2.4GHz.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-has-a-chatty-companion-who-won%E2%80%99t-shut-up.1353928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fresh previews just dropped for <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-release-date-motorcycle-open-world-2000625308"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, that big Nintendo holiday blockbuster we still haven’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-trailer-nintendo-switch-release-date-2000641104">gotten a dedicated Direct for</a>, and they document a troubling discovery. At least for the game’s opening areas, the stoic bounty hunter Samus Aran isn’t alone. Instead, she’s accompanied by what is reportedly a very annoying Galactic Federation trooper named Myles MacKenzie. A new trailer reveals he’s not the game’s only sidekick, either.</p> <p>“Oh wow! Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. What a mess. You’re alone, on a planet, with no hope of survival. But, you’re also not sitting next to Phil anymore in that cubicle…So…Win?” That’s apparently how Myles introduces himself in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, according to a recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview"><em>IGN</em> preview</a>. <em>Metroid</em> fans are used to quiet, creepy adventures investigating strange mysteries on alien planets. The last thing most of us want is an NPC constantly babbling nonsense in our ears.</p>

 <p>But it sounds like that’s exactly what Myles does, at least in the early part of the game. He sounds full of cringe-y, MCU-style quips and the most obvious tips, like telling you to use missiles to damage armored enemies. “I was in complete disbelief at how Myles was <em>constantly&nbsp;</em>talking during gameplay, to the point where I dug around the settings menu to see if I could tone it down,” <em>IGN</em>‘s Logan Plant writes. “The only option I found was to mute voice acting entirely…”</p>

 <p>Not good! Potentially even worse, Myles isn’t alone either. A new trailer today revealed even more trooper companions:</p>  <p>The overview introduces three additional humans Samus will come into contact with, seemingly in different parts of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s world. With previews stating that the game features four main biomes forking off of the central desert hub area, this heavily implies that Samus will be working with one of the stranded troopers in each of the different areas.</p>

 <p>“Like Samus, some Galactic Federation troopers were also transported to Viewros,” we learn from the new trailer. “Follow distress signals to help the troopers, and occasionally battle alongside them. They can provide useful upgrades. Teamwork is key if any of you hope to escape the planet alive.”</p>

 <p>Will they all be as chatty annoying as Myles apparently is? Hopefully not. It’s still a major red flag, though.</p> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/so-far-metroid-prime-4-doesnt-feel-like-metroid-at-all/"><em>VGC</em>‘s Andy Robinson</a> was equally critical of<em> Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s opening hours, finding an escort mission that required him to defend Myles particularly off-putting. “By itself, these feel like pretty uninteresting mechanics,” he wrote. “But inside a <em>Metroid</em> game, it feels particularly disappointing.<em> Beyond</em>’s opening section felt like a solid, if predictable, <em>Prime</em> game drenched in a puddle of gameplay and narrative tropes, each sabotaging what makes the franchise beloved by fans. <em>Metroid</em> games are essentially sci-fi horror, but so far, <em>Beyond</em> feels like <em>Indiana Jones</em> – and not the good ones, either.”</p>

 <p>You don’t have to be a diehard <em>Metroid</em> fan to be turned off by overly yappy NPCs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-atreus-hints-puzzles-suljic-ps4-ps5-1850300067"><em>God of War</em>‘s Atreus</a> constantly interrupting quiet moments with unwanted hints was one of the bigger knocks against <em>Ragnarök</em> until an option was later patched in to make his suggestions less frequent. Even when the writing isn’t annoying, I still get tired of NPCs constantly talking to fill the lulls between action. Just because nothing is happening in the game doesn’t mean nothing is happening for me as the player.</p> <p>We’ll find out if it’s as big of a drag in the rest of <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> once it’s out on December 4</a>. And if it is, well, I hope Retro Studios is already working on a way to patch in an option to cut Myles’ mic.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-always-lose-your-stuff-these-apple-airtags-are-now-practically-free-on-amazon-2000644338</link>

              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or backpack happens to the best of us and Apple just made the solution super affordable. The company kicked off a serious Black Friday sale on AirTags, dropping prices to record lows we have never seen on these trackers before. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">four-pack now sits at $64 instead of the usual $99</a>, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">a single AirTag costs just $18 down from $29</a>. What really makes this deal great is that <strong>AirTags now cost less than the main competitors</strong> like Samsung and Tile, despite offering significantly more reliable tracking thanks to Apple’s massive network of devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 1x AirTag at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 4x AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>AirTags work by tapping into the <em>Find My</em> network, which includes <strong>hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world</strong>. When you misplace something with an AirTag attached, nearby iPhones, iPads, and Macs anonymously relay its location back to you without those device owners even knowing. This network density gives AirTags a serious advantage over rival trackers that rely on smaller user bases. You get precise location data in crowded areas where Apple devices are everywhere, from airports and shopping centers to coffee shops and office buildings. The <strong>whole system works completely anonymously and securely</strong>&nbsp;so your location data remains private while still helping you find your lost items.</p>



<h2>Precision Finding That Works</h2>
<p>Setting up an AirTag takes all of ten seconds with your iPhone or iPad: you pull the tab to turn it on, hold it near your device and it automatically pairs with one tap. You assign it to something, such as keys or a backpack, and it immediately shows up in the Find My app alongside your other Apple devices. It’s a completely frictionless process compared to trackers that require separate apps and fiddly Bluetooth pairing routines.</p>
<p>Precision Finding leverages Ultra Wideband technology to take you directly to your AirTag when nearby. On-screen directions on your iPhone feature distance and arrow indicators, almost like a game of hot and cold, that take you straight to your lost item. This works incredibly well in your home or office when something slides between couch cushions or ends up buried under a pile of papers. You can also <strong>let the AirTag play a sound to help locate it by ear</strong>&nbsp;which proves useful when Precision Finding narrows it down but you still need that final audio cue.</p>



<p>And if someone actually does lose something far from home, the<em> Find My</em> network keeps working in the background. When any Apple device comes near your lost AirTag, it securely and anonymously updates the location in your<em> Find My</em> app. You’ll get a notification showing you exactly where to find it on a map. The system even works when your AirTag is in Lost Mode, which lets you add contact information so someone who finds your item can reach you directly.</p>
<p>AirTags are built for <strong>real-world conditions with IP67 water and dust resistance</strong>. Attach them to a gym bag, drop them into a travel backpack, or clip them to your dog’s collar; rain and dirt aren’t going to ruin them. They’re small enough to slip into a wallet’s card slot or attach to your keychain without adding bulk. Apple designed them to be durable and practical for everyday use, not fragile gadgets you need to baby.</p>
<p>That means the $64 four-pack provides coverage for your most important items at only $16 per tracker, cheaper than buying four single AirTags separately, even at the discounted $18 price. You can tag your keys, wallet, backpack, and car keys all at once, creating a complete tracking system for everything you regularly misplace. The peace of mind from knowing you can locate your essentials in seconds pays for itself the first time you avoid being late because you couldn’t find your keys.</p>

              <p>Mini PCs offer a third option from laptops and desktop PCs if you’re looking to run Windows without spending too much cash. They work brilliantly as dedicated work stations, supplemental devices to your other devices to get work done, or as your main device if you don’t want to take up too much space. They even make for handy little gaming units. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5581/">This GMKtec mini gaming PC happens to be on sale right now too. Amazon has the GMKtec K12 Gaming Mini PC discounted by 31% ahead of Black Friday.</a> For a limited time, you can grab this mini gaming PC for $220 off, bringing the price down from $720 to just $500.</p>
<p>As the name of the product category implies, a mini PC takes up substantially less room than a standard PC would. Heck, you can even reduce it’s footprint to zero by mounting it to the back of your display or monitor.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Gaming</h2>
<p>Taking a peak into the specs, The GMKtec mini PC is working with a Ryzen 7 H 255 processor. That has eight cores and 16 threads, an can run at up to 4.9 GHz. Paired with the powerful Radeon 780M iGPU, you can even get some decent gaming done with this hardware. The K12 mini PC is equipped with dual 16GB RAM, totaling to 32GB. It comes with a 512GB SSD but three SSD slots are available, each capable of reading up to 8TB for a max of 24TB. You get both Wi-Fi 6E support and Bluetooth 5.2 support built in.</p>
<p>The OCuLink port can take your gaming even further. You can actually plug into a beefier graphics card externally to get the gaming boost you’re looking for. Just know the mini PC doesn’t support hotswapping it. You’ll need to turn off the power first before plugging to or unplugging from a graphics card connection.</p>



<p>The base hardware is still pretty powerful, able to display in resolutions up to 8K if you need. It allows for connecting to up to four screens at once. The HDMI 2.1 will grant you up to 8K at 60Hz, the DisplayPort will grant you up to 4K at 60Hz, and the two USB-C can be used for display, though the product page doesn’t specs for those two.</p>
<p>Dual cooling fans help keep the rig from overheating. The two can deliver silent, ultra-efficient cooling at just 35dB. Plus the fans have cool lighting. Wouldn’t be a gaming PC without cool lighting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a massive departure from the series norm, the campaign in the newly released <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </i>is an online co-op experience from start to finish. Not only is the campaign always online, but as if it thought it was <i>Elden Ring</i>, you can’t pause it, and you’ll get booted for idling.</p> <p>Maybe it’s secretly an experimental art project on the nature of entropy.</p> <p><i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</i> comes out today with a full campaign and multiplayer mode. The campaign, it seems, goes all in on co-op play. The <i>option </i>to play campaigns in co-op is usually a welcome one but here, co-op is so inherent to the experience that it’s making solo play really hard, with a lack of checkpoints and an expectation that you’re always online and never AFK (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-is-online-only-with-no-checkpoints-or-pausing-and-will-kick-you-if-youre-idle-for-too-long">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>).</p>

 <p>Apparently, trying to complete this campaign on your own ramps up the tedium, with you having to do things like repeat objectives scattered around an environment–such as placing explosives in certain spots–that were clearly designed to be handled by multiple players all working together.</p>

 <p>It’s an unfortunate situation for those who enjoy a straightforward, linear solo campaign with objectives that feel designed to accommodate solo play. Maybe go back and play 2022’s <i>Modern Warfare II</i>? It was kind of a snoozefest in some ways, but hey, at least you wouldn’t get kicked for idling.</p> <p>It kind of reminds me of that one time me and two friends of mine managed to somehow make it through a <i>Destiny </i>raid without the extra three players by running around like crazy people to accomplish certain objectives that were clearly made with more people in mind. It felt like we were getting away with something we shouldn’t’ve been. Maybe tackling <i>Black Ops 7</i>’s campaign solo at least offers some of these transgressive thrills?</p>

              <p>The announcement of a new&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> game would usually be something that came with a great deal of fanfare and publicity, which makes the strange, quiet appearance of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em> quite peculiar. This mobile project, which is apparently a collab between <em>Minecraft</em> developers Mojang and&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush</em> creators King, has only come to anyone’s attention after it appeared on the Apple store for people in Malaysia. Huh.</p> <p>When Microsoft so controversially bought Activision in 2023, understandably most of our attention was on how this seemingly monopolistic move meant the Windows and Xbox owner now controlled everything from <em>Call of Duty</em> to <em>World of Warcraft</em>. But less focused on was the simultaneous acquisition of King, which Activision Blizzard had previously bought for $5.9 billion. That’s now suddenly being brought into the light with the sudden announcement of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em>, a match-3 game in the manner of King’s mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga</em>, but based around the blocky world of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

 <p>Oh yes, because as hard as we might try to forget, Microsoft owns <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>too, after that 2014 purchase for $2.5 billion. And if I’m a besuited Microsoft exec, and I’m looking at the miniature model on my table of all the empires I own, at a certain point I’m definitely going to want to see if there’s money in combining them together.</p>

 <p>The result on this occasion is a free-to-play matching puzzle game set in <em>Minecraft</em>‘s world with <em>Minecraft</em>‘s art and tools. You have a sort of 3D mini-world in which you can craft, but to get the “energy” to do this you need to play the block-tapping 2D puzzle game. Here you tap matching groups of colored blocks to break those around them, revealing TNT and fireworks and so on as you attempt to clear a level. Although, not having played it myself and given the scant information <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft-blast">on the game’s site</a>, it’s hard to provide you with much clearer guidance.</p>

 <p>You might imagine a video of someone playing the game would be more informative, but&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> YouTuber PatarHD’s footage is so frustratingly edited and so painfully scripted that it feels like the world’s most confusing ad.</p>  <p><em>Minecraft Blast</em> is currently being playtested in Malaysia alone, and apparently this test will only last for a week or two. But Microsoft promises more locations and longer tests will be coming soon, stating that right now it is in “extremely early days with this project,” and that it plans “to start rolling out small, limited-run tests in select markets to help us gather early feedback and involve our community from the start.”</p>

 <p>However, in the YouTube video above, PatarHD claims that if you have an iOS device, you can just change your region to Malaysia and download the app now.</p> <p>It looks like the full version of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em> is still a fair way off. Although given it’s F2P, perhaps we can enjoy the wait.</p>
