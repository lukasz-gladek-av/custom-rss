            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-best-class-beginners-spellsword-1851778678<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you ask random folks what their favorite class is in <em>Oblivion</em>—classic or <em>Remastered</em>—they’ll all proclaim something different as the absolute best. We all have favorite playstyles, after all. But if you’re brand new, as in you never played the original, surely there’s a single class that encompasses the best of what <em>Oblivion </em>offers, right? There is! Here’s the best <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> class for a beginner, as declared by me.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196903,196646" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#spell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#spell">Spellsword</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#custom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#custom">Custom class</a></span></p><h2 id="h471279"><a id="spell"></a>I recommend Spellsword for new players</h2><figure id="" data-id="2b789ac67cf3d08d23476b67ea8168d3" data-recommend-id="image://2b789ac67cf3d08d23476b67ea8168d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The class selection screen for the Spellsword in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The class selection screen for the Spellsword in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b789ac67cf3d08d23476b67ea8168d3" data-recommend-id="image://2b789ac67cf3d08d23476b67ea8168d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The class selection screen for the Spellsword in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Why not a Warrior or Mage—a straight-up generic playstyle that highlights the best of the game’s first-person combat or spell-slinging? It’s easy; Spellsword is the best of both worlds. While you may not specialize in one or the other outright, the class allows you to mix and match, combining a sword and shield with an appropriate Restoration or Destruction spell that makes quick work of enemies or allows you to keep on kicking. </p><p>With a focus on Heavy Armor, Destruction, Restoration, and Blade, and attributes revolving around Endurance and Willpower, the Spellsword is a versatile class that’s quick-footed yet durable. </p><figure id="" data-id="e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-recommend-id="image://e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-recommend-id="image://e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sure, a Mage is cool, and often quite powerful in the late game. But have you seen their robes? Ew! <strong>A Spellsword can don the best Heavy Armor in the game</strong>, such as the Imperial Dragon Cuirass or Cuirass of the Blood Legion, or my personal favorite, the Aegis of the Apocalypse.</p><p>As for magic, you can create custom spells that drain health, reduce resistances, and fortify your abilities to empower you further. Or, stick with the basics, like Immolating Blast or Enemies Explode.</p><h2 id="h471280"><a id="custom"></a>Going the custom class route</h2><figure id="" data-id="7c875fb951391df3e4863c6ebcc8fed9" data-recommend-id="image://7c875fb951391df3e4863c6ebcc8fed9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The class selection screen for the custom class in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The class selection screen for the custom class in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c875fb951391df3e4863c6ebcc8fed9" data-recommend-id="image://7c875fb951391df3e4863c6ebcc8fed9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The class selection screen for the custom class in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Conversely, if you’re the type to forge your path and outright ignore advice, you could always choose the custom class route. Here, you can mix and match skills to craft a one-of-a-kind playstyle that feels unique without changing the game overwhelmingly. It might feel a little intimidating to roll your own class as a beginner, but the freedom here might just be what you need to tweak the experience to how you want to play.</p><p>Your options include:</p><p><strong>Specializations</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Combat</strong>: Armorer, Athletics, Blade, Block, Blunt, Hand to Hand, and Heavy Armor.</li><li><strong>Magic</strong>: Alchemy, Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Mysticism, and Restoration</li><li><strong>Stealth</strong>: Acrobatics, Light Armor, Marksman, Mercantile, Security, Sneak, and Speechcraft</li></ul><p><strong>Attributes</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Strength</strong>: Affects maximum Fatigue, Encumbrance, and damage dealt by melee and hand-to-hand weapons.</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: Affects maximum Magicka.</li><li><strong>Willpower</strong>: Affects maximum Fatigue and Magicka regeneration.</li><li><strong>Agility</strong>: Affects maximum Fatigue, reduces the risk of staggering, and increases damage dealt by ranged weapons.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>: Affects movement speed and jump length.</li><li><strong>Endurance</strong>: Affects maximum Fatigue, Health, and Health increases per level.</li><li><strong>Personality</strong>: Affects Disposition.</li><li><strong>Luck</strong>: Affects Acrobatics, Athletics, and Speechcraft</li></ul><p>Lastly, the Custom Class allows you to select seven Major Skills, providing a +20 increase to each chosen one. If you want a fighter-type class, opt for Blade. If you’re a mage-type, I recommend Destruction. Choose wisely!</p><hr><p><em>Oblivion Remastered</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs, and Game Pass.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Come this holiday season, first-party Xbox games will cost $80. </p><p>Much of this is likely due to President Trump’s rollercoaster tariffs against nearly every nation on the planet, something Nintendo confirmed was a factor and which Microsoft has implied in the act of increasing U.S. prices  far more than it’s raising UK prices. And while Sony is holding out for now on $80 games, the company has already raised prices on its PlayStation consoles multiple times this generation even before Trump’s tariffs, so I expect it to increase prices on games and devices sooner than later as well. </p><p>All of this works out pretty well for Take-Two and Rockstar Games, as both companies were likely planning to slap (at least) an $80 price tag  on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6. </em></p><p>Previously, before all this news, I could imagine Rockstar being a bit nervous to be the first major company to pull the trigger on selling a game for $80. (To note: As of May 1, Rockstar has yet to officially announce a price. This is all speculation.) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/70-dollar-games-60-ubisoft-ea-gotham-knights-ps5-xbox-1849593604?_gl=1*1pc8x2x*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjExMTE2OC42MS4wLjE3NDYxMTExNzAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/70-dollar-games-60-ubisoft-ea-gotham-knights-ps5-xbox-1849593604?_gl=1*1pc8x2x*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjExMTE2OC42MS4wLjE3NDYxMTExNzAuNTguMC4w">They may have anticipated a lot of backlash</a></span> to such a move. A lot of negative headlines. It would have been painful, even if in the end millions would still have forked over $80 for what is likely to be one of the biggest video games ever made. </p><p>But now, well, damn, things are working out pretty well for Rockstar Games. When they eventually announce a release date and reveal<em> GTA 6</em> will cost $80, the world will have already gone through the sticker shock and Rockstar won’t have to deal with nearly as much backlash. </p><p>And yes, I’m pretty dang sure Rockstar is going to charge $80 for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. You can argue all day that, well, Take-Two and Rockstar might want to go with a lower price to saturate the market or build up an audience that will pump money into <em>GTA 6</em>'s online mode. But this is <em>GTA 6</em>. Rockstar could charge $300 a copy and still sell a few million on launch day. The hype and demand for this game is unreal. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-gtavi-grand-theft-auto-price-70-take-two-ceo-t2-1851489239?_gl=1*zezcff*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjEwOTY2OC4zNDMuMS4xNzQ2MTExNzU0LjE0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-gtavi-grand-theft-auto-price-70-take-two-ceo-t2-1851489239?_gl=1*zezcff*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjEwOTY2OC4zNDMuMS4xNzQ2MTExNzU0LjE0LjAuMA..">There was no way this thing, which has been in development for a long time and has a huge budget, was going to cost just $60.</a></span> </p><p>I mean, look at it this way: Do you really think Rockstar and Take-Two are going to be let Nintendo get away with charging $80 for the next<em> Mario Kart </em>game, while not doing the same for the next <em>Grant Theft Auto</em> sequel? No way. The real question now is whether Rockstar and Take-Two think they can charge $90 or even $100 for the game. Before everyone began slapping $80 price tags on video games this month, I’d probably have said that’s too much. However, these days, it’s looking more and more plausible. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
