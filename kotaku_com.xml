              <p>An incident at a Burbank Chuck E. Cheese on August 7 is a useful PSA for what not to do at the kids arcade chain. An adult woman snuck into the Snow Day game meant for very small children and got her arm stuck in one of the holes. I guess she didn’t want the game to end. How many firefighters does it take to get a an arm out of the Snow Day game <a href="https://kotaku.com/chuck-e-cheese-subscription-fun-pass-tickets-price-1851620006">at Chuck E. Cheese</a>? At least six, it seems.</p> <p>It was around 3:30 p.m. last Thursday when the unidentified woman became trapped inside the large plastic arcade game, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/woman-stuck-in-chuck-e-cheese-game-burbank/3761451/">NBC Los Angeles reported</a>. The Snow Day game revolves around putting plastic balls into a central hole. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53xiyTvBrWc">A suction tube then pulls them up</a> and spits them back out the top of the machine. The higher the score, the more tickets you get for prizes. At no point do you need to stick your hand inside the hole, let alone your whole arm.</p> <p>You might be thinking, wow, that sounds like a really boring game. And you’d be right! It was created to fill “an under-served age gap in our industry,” i.e. to be something even a two-year-old could have fun doing.</p>   <p>The local fire department was called and apparently dispatched at least six people to the Chuck E. Cheese to witness the third-degree shame first-hand. Video from the scene showed one person seemingly trying to take the machine apart while several others stood around and contemplated the “place where a kid can be a kid.”</p> <p>“We prioritize children’s safety above all and have verified that the game poses no risk to our young guests,” a Chuck E. Cheese spokesperson said following the incident. The design prevents children’s arms from reaching the area in question. There was no injury to the young adult or any children, and the family continued to enjoy an evening of fun with the family.”</p>

              <p>Later this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers</em> 2</a>—previously a PS5- and PC-only PlayStation-published sci-fi shooter—arrives on Xbox with crossplay support. And a new trailer teases the possibility that some Orbital Drop Shock Troopers from <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> might appear as backup.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">Back in July</a>, Arrowhead and PlayStation Studios announced that their super-successful live-service shooter <em>Helldivers 2</em> would arrive on Xbox on August 26. The co-op shooter leaping to the PS5’s main rival is yet more evidence that the console wars are over. Plus, it means a bunch of Xbox-only players get a chance to enjoy one of the best co-op games released in years. Now, just about two weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-ps5-sony-playstation-decision-ceo-discord-2000616377"><em>Helldivers 2</em> crashes onto Xbox Series X/S consoles,</a> Xbox and Sony have teamed up (which is a little weird to say) to tease some <em>Halo</em> content coming to <em>Helldivers 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On August 12, a new trailer for <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox dropped and it shows off a bunch gameplay, featuring the kinds of loud explosions and mayhem you’d expect. But at the very end of all that is a quiet, jazzy tease that seems to heavily imply<em> Halo 3: ODST</em> soldiers are inbound. I’ve set up the trailer below to start right at the teaser:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Helldivers 2 - Bring the Boom | Out August 26" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE?start=70&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Ohhh, how I’ve missed the rain-soaked streets of <em>Halo 3: ODST a</em>nd its chill jazz music soundtrack. What a game. And a perfect fit for <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Both Helldivers and ODST soldiers land onto battlefields via drop pods to fight intergalactic threats. <em>Helldivers 2</em> has been very careful with its IP crossovers, but <em>ODST</em> makes sense and visually won’t feel too out of place. The real question is how fans will get their hands on some ODST armor, and also, will it feature some smooth jazz music? We’ll likely find out more before <em>Helldivers 2</em> launches on Xbox Series X/S on August 26.</p>

              <p>Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene changed the entire course of gaming in 2017 with the release of&nbsp;<em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>, now known nonsensically as <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>. (<em>Plunkbat&nbsp;</em>forever.) Without it–for good or ill–we may not have <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the most successful games ever.&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em> isn’t doing too badly itself, with more than half a million people playing at least once every day. Now, Greene is hoping to revitalize the survival genre with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-2-prologue-brendan-greene-playerunknown-metaverse-1851765648"><em>Prologue</em></a>, developed over the last four years and today revealing a surprise free open beta.</p> <p>Reminiscent of games from the survival sim heyday, <em>Prologue&nbsp;</em>drops its players in a woodland cabin and challenges them to find their way to a weather station, randomly placed on the sprawling 8-by-8km map. Along the way, you’ll be bombarded by weather extremes and hungry wildlife, while needing to keep yourself fed, watered and warm. Which, while certainly a familiar premise if you played <em>The Long Dark</em> or&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, is aiming for a different emphasis.&nbsp;<em>Prologue</em> appears to be aiming for the extremes of isolation, a sense of agoraphobic loneliness in its procedurally generated maps.</p> <p>Plus, of course, this comes with the pedigree. Greene may have moved on from&nbsp;<em>PUGB</em>, hence the title now only containing his nickname’s initials, but PlayerUnknown Productions comes with a lot of expectation. And then a lot of confusing rhetoric about “metaverses” and the like. But if you want to find out exactly what the game’s about, well, you can right now! For free!</p> <p>Available on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27">Epic</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Prologue: Go Wayback!&nbsp;</em>playtest lets you download and play the game ahead of its Early Access launch intended for later this year. To get it on Steam, head to the store page (the “go wayback” title, which hopefully isn’t permanent, at least makes it possible to search for) and then click on the “Request Access” button beneath the demo link. You’ll instantly get in, and will find the game available to install at the top of your Steam library. I’m downloading it as I type.</p>

              <p>Remedy, the creators of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em> and&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, have had a good six months. The company’s revenue has risen by 63 percent, which is just the sort of good news you want to be able to tell your parents, and at the same time the company completed buying all the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control</em> from publishers 505 Games, as part of its plans to become fully independent of external publishers. Lovely to be them. However, despite all this good news, it seems Remedy’s latest game, three-player co-op shooter <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, is still struggling. But Remedy isn’t giving up on it.</p> <p>Back in July, while acknowledging the launch hadn’t gone as well as hoped, Remedy’s Thomas Punha <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449">tried to downplay the significance of the very low player counts on Steam</a>. “Steam is a very important part of the business of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” he told&nbsp;<em>GameSpot.</em>&nbsp;“The Steam [active player count] is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn’t everything.”</p> <p>However, it seems like it’s still an awful lot. In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">company’s latest financial report</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala concedes that PC was where <em>Firebreak</em> had been intended to best succeed, but it has instead fared vastly better on console thanks to subscription deals. “On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed,” says Virtala. “The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.”</p>

 <p>Well, that’s kinda true. The game remains on “Mixed” reviews on Steam, although it’s trending slightly more positively. Currently 68 percent of the 1,685 reviews are positive, although even this stat belies just how few people are playing. It’s all very well to say players are having a better time, but how many? To this day, the game has an all-time peak simultaneous player-count of 1,992, and that was two months ago. In the last 24 hours, the game peaked at 24 people. It’s a colossal flop.</p> <p>The higher (although not stated) numbers on console are likely because the game was included day-one on both Game Pass and PS Plus, meaning anyone with a sub can take a risk-free look, even, if they–like most humans–will struggle to coordinate three people to play at the same time. Still, you make money by putting your games on these services, as Virtala points out:</p> <blockquote><p>“Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. Thus far,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>’s commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.”</p></blockquote> <p>Despite all this, Remedy is valiantly sticking with <em>Firebreak</em>, even though I think anyone would give them a pass at this point. There’s still a “Major Update” coming in September, which the company plans to support with a marketing campaign in an effort to turn its fortunes around. Virtala adds, “We are committed to continuing to work on <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p> <p>In better news, the report states that&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em> is meeting its milestones, and the <em>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</em>remake “continues its progress and remains in full production.” Meanwhile, the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em> has now sold over 5 million copies, which is stunning. And the company is well on its way to becoming self-sustaining as a self-publishing studio freed from publisher pressure and fees.</p>
