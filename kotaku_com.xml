Public visibility brings more scrutiny, and you can’t find an actor in Hollywood more visible than Pascal these days.

Pascal has been a successful actor for a while, but he’s definitely become a staple of franchise entertainment in recent years. He was in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, is in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-season-3-baby-yoda-games-books-tv-1840299667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-season-3-baby-yoda-games-books-tv-1840299667"><em>Star Wars </em>show</a></span><em>, </em>and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-baby-yoda-new-movie-2024-1851152136&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-baby-yoda-new-movie-2024-1851152136">getting his own movie next year</a></span>. Add on his role in <em>The Last of Us </em>and now the MCU, and Pascal is everywhere toxic fandoms exist. But also, right now you can go to a movie theater and see him in three different films: <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, <em>Eddington</em>, and <em>Materialists</em>. Oh, right, he was just in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038"><em>Gladiator II</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robot-movies-kids-children-ranked-walle-the-wild-robot-1851658849&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robot-movies-kids-children-ranked-walle-the-wild-robot-1851658849"><em>The Wild Robot</em></a></span>, too. The man’s getting his bag, but you can be a good actor starring in quality stuff and still get backlash for people never hearing the end of you. It’s an “I can’t miss you if you won’t leave” sort of deal.</p><p>Unlike some celebrities who get this brand of weird fatigue-based backlash, Pascal has the distinction of being pretty likable, and has gone viral plenty of times for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU7-KMGZ4bc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU7-KMGZ4bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being personable and funny in interviews</a></span>. So if he’s not on your TV screen, he’s probably on your glowing slab giving a sound bite. But those interviews and public appearances are now precisely the place where the actor is getting the most backlash. Pascal is currently promoting <em>Fantastic Four </em>alongside his co-star Vanessa Kirby, who plays his character’s wife. The two have been notably touchy-feely on the road, and this has led to many presumptuous accusations about the two’s relationship and Pascal’s treatment of his female co-stars. This all goes back to a viral clip from San Diego Comic-Con in 2024, in which the two held hands on stage while promoting the film. Kirby herself has gone on the record in an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/pedro-pascal-cover-story?&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/pedro-pascal-cover-story?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a></span> saying that both the actors were nervous to be on stage talking about the film, and that it was a grounding moment for both of them.</p><p>“What happened is we were both incredibly nervous going out in front of thousands of people who love this comic,” Kirby told <em>Vanity Fair</em>. “He wanted me to know that we were in this together, and I found it a lovely gesture and was very glad to squeeze his hand back.”</p><p>But that’s not the only footage of Pascal and Kirby getting close, and now a subset of the internet is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JohnEkdahl/status/1948159649527513282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JohnEkdahl/status/1948159649527513282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning on him</a></span>, accusing him of inappropriate behavior in these interactions despite it being very obvious that Kirby <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/sakotrak/status/1947672425275314287&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/sakotrak/status/1947672425275314287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is initiating plenty of the contact</a></span>, the existence of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pedro-pascal-oscar-isaac-cuddle-new-photo-response-online_n_67cf2cbde4b04dd3a4e5a2bd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pedro-pascal-oscar-isaac-cuddle-new-photo-response-online_n_67cf2cbde4b04dd3a4e5a2bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">footage of him also being touchy with male co-stars</a></span>, and explanations about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a65488380/pedro-pascal-anxiety/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a65488380/pedro-pascal-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor’s struggles with anxiety</a></span> as a contributing factor for his asking for person-to-person contact.</p><p>One important piece of context is that Pascal has become especially vocal in his support for trans people in a time when the grifters of the culture war will wield anything they can to try and take down people they perceive as enemies. The actor attended the <em>Thunderbolts* </em>premiere <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/style/pedro-pascals-trans-women-tee-intl-scli&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/style/pedro-pascals-trans-women-tee-intl-scli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wearing a shirt in support of the transgender community</a></span>, has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/06/30/the-feud-between-jk-rowling-and-pedro-pascal-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/06/30/the-feud-between-jk-rowling-and-pedro-pascal-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called out <em>Harry Potter </em>author J.K. Rowling</a></span> for her anti-trans efforts, and been a vocal supporter of his trans sister, actor and activist Lux Pascal. Yes, Pascal is having a moment, and some people online are probably tired of seeing him in big movies, but there’s an unmistakable bigoted corner of the internet that is looking to tear down someone they see as a powerful, influential enemy in a smear campaign. </p><p>Ultimately, whatever genuine concerns people may have about Pascal’s behavior are rooted in a parasocial assumption that we’re all experts in reading people we’ve never met. The internet treats real celebrities like they’re characters whose goals and motivations are all up for interpretation. Every viral video or tweet is treated like a lore drop to be dissected for your favorite or most-hated character in the multimedia franchise of life. Innocent until proven guilty only applies to the public figures you like, I suppose? Unless someone actually comes forward, this entire controversy feels manufactured, but reality has never stopped nonsense from persisting.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007]]></content:encoded>

One clip from it circulating around this week following Bollea’s death shows him trying to explain to a jury <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidbix.bsky.social/post/3lupztnlmlc2g&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidbix.bsky.social/post/3lupztnlmlc2g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why Hulk Hogan had a 10-inch penis but Bollea himself did not</a></span>. There was the moment when the judge in the case allowed one of the jurors to ask the then-Editor-in-Chief of <em>Jezebel </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/ex-gawker-editor-hulk-hogan-had-limited-privacy-right-on-sex-tape/2269326/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/ex-gawker-editor-hulk-hogan-had-limited-privacy-right-on-sex-tape/2269326/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether she had slept with<em> Gawker </em>owner Nick Denton</a></span> to get the job. It was unclear what bearing that would have had on the case. Also, Denton is gay. Every day in our political life is now this stupid, and with way more at stake for everyone involved.</p><p>Then there’s the bizarre trajectory the whole circus ultimately sent <em>Kotaku</em> itself on. It was sold at auction along with its non-Gawker sister sites to Univision, the Spanish-language broadcasting company that was then mounting a confused and ill-timed foray into digital media. Left mostly to its own devices, <em>Kotaku</em> briefly reached its highest headcount ever in 2018. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-taps-vincent-sadusky-as-ceo-succeeding-randy-falco-1527026754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-taps-vincent-sadusky-as-ceo-succeeding-randy-falco-1527026754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanks to the shifting whims of distant CEOs</a></span>, the relative honeymoon was short-lived.

The new company was called G/O Media, short for Gizmodo/The Onion. Spanfeller told us in his very first meeting that he came up with it on a napkin just before the deal was finalized.</p><p>That anecdote proved a harbinger for how carelessly the websites themselves would be treated (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/deadspin-sports.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/deadspin-sports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to sports</a></span>”) over the subsequent years. I can tell you from experience that Spanfeller’s management style was an unusually disqualifying mix of ignorance, pettiness, bullying, gaslighting, and perversely ill-informed micro-management. I cannot, despite the dozens of hours I’ve wasted contemplating it, tell you what the logic behind any of it was.</p><p>What it achieved, however, was the slow, painstaking disfigurement of <em>Kotaku</em> amid an unceasing exodus of beloved colleagues, cuts to resources, and interference in its day-to-day operations (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to guides</a></span>”), which have served millions of readers year-in-and-year-out for over two decades now. Some find it is easy to blame COVID, unions, and the hollowing out of the internet by tech monopolies for all of these things. Funny how the ruler-of-your-own-destiny crowd turns to systemic explanations when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.megangreenwell.com/the-adults-in-the-room&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.megangreenwell.com/the-adults-in-the-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their failures start piling up all around them</a></span>.</p><p>Who knows what exactly the future might have held if Bollea had lost the 2016 sex tape trial? But I would be willing to bet the house we would never have been sold to fucking Jim Spanfeller. Bollea’s death will mean <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/razzball.bsky.social/post/3lusblxfbss2b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/razzball.bsky.social/post/3lusblxfbss2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different things</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/society/hulk-hogan-racist-liar-scab-obit/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/hulk-hogan-racist-liar-scab-obit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to different people</a></span>. To me, it will mark the end of one of the most idiotic storms <em>Kotaku</em> has ever weathered, which is saying something. July is also the month the site was sold to new owners Keleops, reuniting it with at least one of the other old Gawker sites, <em>Gizmodo</em>. I don’t like to piss on people’s graves, but I do like to toast the future, and <em>Kotaku</em>’s is finally one I’m looking forward to again. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000]]></content:encoded>
