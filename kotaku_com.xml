              <p><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s next big content drop is right around the corner and it’s taking players into the depths of the chemical fog-infested Terminid home worlds. Revealed on Tuesday, Into the Unjust arrives in September alongside a new Devil’s Dust Warbond just a week after the hot PlayStation extraction shooter launches on Xbox Series X/S.</p> <p>After spending the summer fending off Illuminate invasions and jetpack-toting Automatons, Into the Unjust will send players back into the alien bug breach, tasking them with missions deep in Terminid territory that will include blowing up giant bug towers and navigating deep underground through their tunnel systems. New objective types will include escorting a giant moving oil rig as it gets attacked. We are so back.</p> <p>Fans will also have access to a bunch of new equipment coming in the Devil’s Dust Warbond. Here’s a breakdown <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/">from the PlayStation Blog</a>:</p>

 <blockquote> <p><strong>AR-2 Coyote</strong><strong><br> </strong>You can hunt in packs or go by your lonesome with this assault rifle that features incendiary ammunition. But be warned: this coyote is wild.</p> <p><strong>G-7 Pineapple</strong><strong><br> </strong>This cluster frag grenade might look like a cute and unassuming fruit, but it’ll have the bugs in absolute pieces.</p> <p><strong>S-11 Speargun</strong><strong><br> </strong>A true big game hunter’s companion. The S-11 fires heavy-duty projectiles that release a cloud of gas on impact.</p> <p><strong>EAT-700 Expendable Napalm</strong><strong><br> </strong>Heat up the planet with this single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs.</p> <p><strong>MS-11 Solo Silo</strong><strong><br> </strong>The long-range power of a missile in a new convenient package. Calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Warbond will also include new armor that boosts resistance to toxins and other hazards players are likely to face in the thick of the Terminid fog. Combined with the new Strategems coming in the update, it should give lapsed players some fun new toys worth unlocking.</p> <p>But it’ll be baptism by fire for all of the players picking up <em>Helldivers 2 </em>for the first time on Xbox this week. Live today roughly 18 months after launching on PS5 and PC, the Xbox release should bring about an influx of players that tips the scales back in Super Democracy’s favor amid the game’s ongoing <em>D&amp;D</em>-style Galactic War meta game. It’ll also indicate just how much of a market there is for PS5 console exclusives on Microsoft’s rival platform.</p> <p>A successful campaign against the bugs won’t just unlock the next chapter in <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s story, it could also usher in the next phase of cross-platform ports from Sony’s first-party portfolio. But fans will have to survive untold new alien horrors first.</p>

              <p><span>Anime and nerd conventions have plenty of ingrained traditions that transcend any one gathering. From artist alleys to yaoi paddles, most veteran attendees know what to expect when they show up to their annual event, and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is adding a new tradition to the mix.</span> <span>The Netflix musical has only been out for two months, but it’s already leaving an imprint on conventions around the world, as fans are using them to pay their respects to their favorite demon boy band heartthrob.</span></p>  <p><span>Jinu is the lead vocalist of the Saja Boys, Huntr/x vocalist Rumi’s beau, and also a demon with a tortured past he longs to forget. He leads the boy band in a battle for hearts and minds against Huntr/x, but is slowly won over to the light side by his connection to Rumi. Progress isn’t linear, though, as he does end up betraying her in the lead-up to the final showdown and nearly feeds all of Seoul’s kpop fans to Gwi-ma, the demon king. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-songs-animal-crossing-youtube-stream-2000618416"><span>Huntr/x</span></a><span> faces the demons in one last musical battle, Gwi-ma nearly defeats Rumi with a massive, soul-powered energy blast, only for Jinu to stand between them and take the blast himself. As he dies, he tells Rumi that she set him free and gave him his soul back, which he leaves to her to finish the fight.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, redemption arcs are great and all, but my babies didn’t even get to kiss. “Are they lovers? Worse. They never got to be.” The rest of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>fandom is also feeling this grief, because memorials for Jinu are popping up at conventions all around the world. The anchor of these displays is usually a memorial photo of Jinu, which is then surrounded by offerings such as stickers, notes, and even empty soda cans and bottles as a reference to Saja Boys’ breakout hit “Soda Pop.”&nbsp;</span></p>              <p><span>R.I.P. to a real one, but even as fans mourn Jinu, there’s another subset of them who believe the demon diva may come back in the inevitable sequel, as the film implies his soul lives within Rumi’s sword which she uses to defeat Gwi-ma. But until I see him fully re-materialize and give Rumi a kiss on the forehead, I’d better keep seeing memorials for him at every convention.</span></p>
