              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714"><em>Divinity</em></a> was one of the biggest reveals at <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">the Game Awards 2025</a>. Hell, there was an entire demonic statue sitting in the desert for over a week to get people hyped. Actors were paid to sit in the front row of the showcase and get lifted into the air on pulleys to introduce the game’s first trailer. But what is it and why should you care? Here’s the little we know so far about Larian Studios’ next major RPG.</p> <h2><strong>What is&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It’s a new game from Larian Studios, most famous for the acclaimed 2023 hit RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;Like that one, <em>Divinity</em> is also an RPG. Unlike that one, <em>Divinity</em> takes place in Larian’s own made-up fantasy universe instead of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Forgotten Realms. Larian’s land of Rivellon is still inhabited by humans, elves, dwarves, and so on, though it has some peoples you won’t find in <em>BG3 </em>too, and it still revolves around magic and demonic forces, but there are seven gods and more religious overtones. It started in 2002 with the studio’s first fantasy RPG, <i>Divine Divinity.&nbsp;</i></p>

 <p>“The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir.” That’s the tagline for the new <em>Divinity</em>, which Larian promises will be its “most ambitious title yet” and even larger than <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It was <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">massive statue</a> and a gnarly cinematic trailer that suggests the world of <em>Divinity</em> may be on the verge of succumbing to some truly wicked hellspawn.</p>

  <h2><strong>Wait, is this <em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>?</strong></h2> <p>No, it ain’t. While fans of that turn-based sub-series would love to see Larian go back to that solid foundation, the company’s head of publishing was very clear that this isn’t a direct sequel. “There aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will,” Michael Douse wrote on X <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">prior to <em>Divinity</em>‘s announcement</a>. But Larian did name-check both<em> Original Sin</em> games in its press release, saying fans of those will have a better understanding of this new game’s world.</p>

 <p>Here’s how director Swen Vincke put it in the announcement: “Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled ‘Divinity.’ We’re ready to bring everything we’ve done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before. We’ve been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. This is the <em>Divinity</em> we’ve always wanted to make and you’re going to have loads of fun with it.”</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Divinity</em> be turn-based?</h2> <p>That’s one of the great debates raging among fans as <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1999108111789851024"><em>alleged</em> rumors</a> circulate that Divinity&nbsp;<em>might</em> not be turn-based. That would be a big departure from Larian’s last decade of projects which have all been that way. Back in the beginning, however, the <em>Divinity</em> franchise was a real-time action series that played like <em>Diablo</em>. It’s not hard to see Larian going back to that, especially if <em>Divinity</em> is operating on a grander scale than past projects. Maybe it’ll be third-person action more in the vein of modern <em>Dragon Age</em>? Still, the studio has a history of sticking to what works and iterating from there. If I had to bet money, I’d say it’s probably still turn-based.</p>

 <h2>Is that old guy getting <em>Wicker Man’</em>d in the trailer important?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653115"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653115">Larian Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>Probably! Fans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/1pkhj33/they_commited_the_original_sin/">Divinity subreddit</a> have been debating who it might be. One theory is that it’s a character called <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Lucian">Lucian</a> who’s the canonical hero for the original <em>Divine Divinity</em>, eventually getting godly powers and being worshiped. He also adopts a child named <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Damian">Damian</a> who ends up being a vessel for demonic entities. Here’s one fan’s theory:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“The implication of this trailer seems to be that the people of Rivellon stopped worshipping the dead gods and committed, besides the seven deadly sins, the Original Sin of killing the powerless Lucian, which causes the Hellstone to spawn, as the last remnants of the gods and Source were destroyed that way.”</p></blockquote> <p>Much of this interpretation depends on where in the existing timeline the new <em>Divinity</em> takes place. Is it after <em>Original Sin 2</em> or a prequel to the entire franchise? Or maybe somewhere in the middle? Whoever is being tortured in the game’s first trailer, it seems clear that all is not well in Rivellon and the demons are coming to take over.</p> <h2>When is <em>Divinity</em> coming out?</h2> <p>There’s no release date yet. Not even a release window or a whisper of one. <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> was made in three years. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> took six. A lot will depend on whether this is the only game Larian has in production or it’s working on something else alongside it. Either way, we probably won’t see it out in the wild until 2027 or beyond.</p> <h2>What platforms will <em>Divinity</em> launch on?</h2> <p>PC seems like a safe bet. Maybe even an Early Access launch like Larian did with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It could be far enough away to be a cross-gen console release on both PlayStation 5 and PS6. Same for Xbox. Hopefully it runs well on PC handhelds and Valve’s Steam Machine. Maybe it’ll even come to Switch 2? Larian’s only other game to launch on a Nintendo platform was <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is a lengthy coda to the base game, riffing on every narrative and mechanical overhaul Game Freak brought to Lumiose City. It is essentially the postgame that </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> lacked when it launched in October, and while your mileage may vary on whether or not you want to spend an extra $30 to play it, what’s here is a compelling spin on everything that made the game one of </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> most compelling experiments.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is set after the events of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, so you’ll have to see the credits (the real ones, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>not the fake ones</span></a><span>) to dive in. A young girl named Ansha shows up in Lumiose City to ask for Team MZ’s help. She’s in search of a powerful legendary Pokémon to give to her mother as a present. Because we’re heroes who never turn away a person in need, we agree to help her find this mystery beast, but before we can really start looking, the city is overtaken by mysterious portals that lead to a bizarro version of Lumiose called Hyperspace. In this mirrored universe, we find Pokémon that aren’t native to the city and are more powerful than they’re supposed to be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The only way we can face these powerful foes and investigate this odd phenomenon is by Ansha feeding her partner Pokémon Hoopa berry-filled Donuts that allow it to power up our Pokémon as we head into Hyperspace on short expeditions. All of this paves the way for an interesting, albeit slightly underbaked (ironic, considering the whole Donut gimmick) roguelike mode that puts all your battle knowledge to the test.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653108">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t quite introduce a complete mechanical overhaul of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s real-time battle system, but it is far more demanding. Each time you head into Hyperspace, you’re on a timer whose length is determined by the quality of the Donut you make for Hoopa, which also increases your stats and raises your level beyond the typical cap of 100. You only have so much time to complete a few missions to gather intel points, and learning how best to make the most of your limited time can be the difference between a lucrative run or a wasted one.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These trips into this mirrored version of Lumiose can last anywhere from a few minutes to almost 10, depending on the recipe Ansha cooks up, all determined by the Berries you bring her. Once you’re in Hyperspace, you’ve gotta make quick choices about what enemies you fight, which objectives you focus on, and the Pokémon you bring and use with you. Even your most powerful monster might waste some of your time because its moves take too long to charge up, and the clock won’t stop ticking as long as the game is unpaused.</span></p>

 <p><span>Getting a hang of the whole system can take some time, especially when the early expeditions you take into Hyperspace give you just a scant few minutes to acclimate yourself to the ways in which you must change how you carry yourself in this hostile new environment. By the time I was making Donuts that gave me more minutes on the clock, I had a strategy in place that I would adapt on the fly. I’d lead with a Pokémon equipped to handle a rift’s assigned element, barrel through the mini-quests I was assigned for that route, then head to high ground to find the Bonus Ball treasure chest that would spawn after I’d completed my tasks. I’d use my Salamence to search for this item, because his flight ability meant he could get to this golden ball from just about anywhere, helping me snag it within whatever precious seconds I had left in a run.</span></p>

 <p><span>These trips into Hyperspace made me more aware of some of the weaknesses of my party’s composition. I didn’t trade out Pokémon, but as the time limit ticked down in these sections, I became more aware of how slow my Houndoom’s Dark Pulse charge-up was and the time I could save by swapping it out for a faster Crunch attack. My Raichu is spec’d as a physical attacker, but only one of those attacks can reach targets in the air. By the time I was really trying to min-max every Hyperspace run, I had changed several of my go-to movesets just to accommodate the ever-present threat of being yanked out of Hyperspace. Fast attacks that could reach targets above eye level were more important than heavy-hitting ones that would take precious seconds to cast.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653109"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653109">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s roguelike elements are a bit shallow, with your success mostly determined by how far past the level cap you are when you enter Hyperspace, the time limit and focus on verticality do require you to rethink what efficiency looks like in a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game, and ideally, you think of those things before you head into the imaginary city with level 140 monsters.</span></p> <p><span>The trouble I expect some folks to have with the roguelike half of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is that it is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>huge grind</span></a><span>. I hit the credits at about a dozen hours, and large chunks of that time were spent going in and out of Hyperspace to gather intel for folks back home to research the cause of this phenomenon before it engulfed the entire real city. I don’t mind it personally, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system has always felt more like a puzzle game to me than a grindy RPG. I like seeing a Pokémon in the distance, choosing who in my party can most likely take it out the fastest, and seeing if I can pull it off. The grind started to hit me hardest in the endgame as I tried to capture some of the major Legendary monsters in the DLC, and even as I chip away at some of the post-game stuff, I’m still feeling that. But I still enjoy </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system enough that the grind’s not a detriment for me.</span></p> <p><span>If all </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>had to offer were the roguelike elements, however, I wouldn’t be that hot on it. Thankfully, there’s also a bevy of new quests full of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>funny citizens saying silly things</span></a><span>, stories to hear, and monsters to catch. Over 100 returning Pokémon from regions far beyond Kalos appear in Hyperspace, and that includes a ton of new Mega Evolutions as well. As anyone who has paid attention to me yelling about it on </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>for months will know, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>added two Mega Evolutions to my favorite guy, Raichu. I was a mark ready to slap down $30 to finally see my boy get some love, and the X form’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Superman-like fighting style</span></a><span> makes him one of my favorite Mega Evolutions Game Freak has ever put out. But Raichu is just one of several Megas added in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, and there are some inspired choices. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s base-game Megas skewed a bit too silly for some folks’ liking, and </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>definitely tips the scales in the opposite direction with a ton of “cooler” designs. I won’t spoil some of the monsters Game Freak decided to give a new form to, but suffice it to say that I was really eager to see each new form when I finally came to face them.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of those Megas are especially memorable because </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>brings back the best part of the base game with Rogue Mega Evolution battles. These lengthy boss fights against rabid Mega Evolutions are still some of the most entertaining skill checks in probably any </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game, and they’re made all the more challenging because they take place in Hyperspace, thus having a time limit and broken level cap to deal with. These frantic fights are tough, require coordination between your player character and Pokémon, and still find ways to surprise me in how the different Rogue Megas behave.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000653107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653107">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One of the best things </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>adds is the ability to replay these fights, which wasn’t available in the base game. I’ve had a lot of fun going back to some of those fights with Mega Raichu in my party, so he can actually take them on. One of my biggest problems with </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was that its focus on Mega Evolution made its party compositions feel more limited, as it was much more difficult to handle some of these fights without Mega-Evolution-capable critters on your team. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t change that, but at least it gives me a chance to play through these fights again with my favorite guy.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of this is tied up in a story that ties together multiple sides of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. Each of this series’ generations has been set in a different region, and as such, they can feel a bit disconnected from one another. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes a point to spotlight multiple sides of its mythology, so it surprisingly feels like a sequel to games you might not expect. Fans of </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>’s Hoenn region will probably get a kick out of how much it factors into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but there’s something here for fans of </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>’s Sinnoh legends, as well.</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Raichu flies around like he’s Superman, and if you don’t think that’s the tightest shit you’ve ever seen, I don’t know how to help you.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Game Freak</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Post-game expansion for Legends: Z-A with more monsters, Megas, and challenges</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Roguelike mode is a new challenge, interesting use of the series’ mythology, Mega Raichu.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>It’s a grind, roguelike elements could be a bit meatier.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Switch, Switch 2 (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 10, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~12 hours to credits, still chipping away at post game stuff.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>As much as I loved everything </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>gave me, I understand the $30 price tag is a big ask for folks. I try not to weigh in on the price of things in reviews because I don’t know every reader’s financial situation, and it feels disingenuous of me to try to make some sort of judgment call about whether or not something is “worth” a certain amount of money. Mega Raichu sold me on the expansion before I’d even played it, but looking at the DLC in the context of </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> long history, it does feel a little bit icky. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s post-game was practically non-existent, and </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes the post-game one of the most robust in the series, but it’s on top of an already pricey game in a world where video game prices are only getting more expensive.</span></p> <p><span>I can’t make the call for you on whether it’s “worth” the price, but I can tell you that I got a whole lot more of a game I loved and that spoke to the things I enjoy most about this series. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s greatest strengths are in its experimental battle system and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>city-centric storytelling</span></a><span> that makes the most of its merry band of misfits. I got that in spades here, and I got to see it with a Mega Evolution of my favorite Pokémon by my side.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you didn’t already&nbsp; love </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, I would be surprised if anything here changed your mind. I’m having a great time, though. Raichu and I aren’t done scavenging every inch of Hyperspace for the Pokémon we haven’t met yet, and if this is the end of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story, it’s still going to be one of my favorite games in the series. </span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Holy crap, <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">the Game Awards 2025</a> started off with a huge surprise: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>!</em> A spiritual successor to <em>KOTOR</em> from Casey Hudson and set in the Expanded Universe! Wowza, that’s exciting stuff. Here’s everything we know right now about this upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> game.</p> <h2><strong>What is <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><em>Fate of the Old Republic,</em> or as all the cool kids call it, “<em>FOTOR</em>,” is a newly announced single-player<em> Star Wars</em> action RPG that is set in the same era as the beloved <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> games, the less-loved-but-still-good MMO spin-off, and all the various tie-in media. It was revealed during the Game Awards 2025. Here’s the awesome trailer:</p>

  <h2><strong>OMG! Is this <em>Knights of the Old Republic 3</em>?</strong></h2> <p>Nope! But <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer">Lucasfilm, Casey Hudson, and Arcanaut Studios have referred to <em>FOTOR</em> as a “spiritual successor”</a> to those games that take place in the same era of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. It also isn’t a turn-based RPG, but it will feature many choices, and the people making it have hinted at players being able to play as either good or bad characters, something that was a big part of <em>KOTOR.</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Wait, who is Casey Hudson?</strong></h2> <p>Hudson was the director behind BioWare’s original <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> and would also help create and lead <em>Mass Effect</em> after <em>KOTOR</em>. His return to <em>Star Wars</em> and the<em> Old Republic</em> franchise is a big reason why people are super excited about this game, and also why so many people think it’s <em>KOTOR 3</em>. (It isn’t, as explained above.)</p>

 <h2><strong>When does<em> Fate of the Old Republic</em> take place?</strong></h2> <p>We don’t really know much about <em>FOTOR’s</em> setting and story yet. The trailer shows off some new characters who will likely be involved in the full game, but Hudson and Lucasfilm are being tight-lipped about any specific details. They did, however, confirm that this isn’t a direct sequel to <em>KOTOR </em>or <em>KOTOR 2.</em> Instead, it will feature a new story, new locations, new characters, and so on. But if I were a betting man, I’d wager some credits that elements, characters, and locations from those past games might show up in some form or another in <em>FOTOR.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Is it canon? Or Legends?</strong></h2> <p>Again, we’ve not been given a clear answer to this question, but I’d be shocked if <em>FOTOR</em> was canon with the films. The<em> <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic#Continuity">Old Republic</a></em> games, books, and comics were all part of the old Expanded Universe, which was made non-canon after Disney bought<em> Star Wars</em> over a decade ago. While some elements of the <em>Old Republic</em> universe <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-rogue-one-easter-eggs-lore-luthen-1849774482">have been made canon</a>, like the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rakatan">Rakatan</a> species, the bulk of the <em>Old Republic</em> is no longer canon.</p>

 <p>But who cares?! The<em> Old Republic</em> MMO has been going strong for years now, telling new Legends stories. I think it’s great, actually, that Lucasfilm seems willing to let more projects be made that aren’t canon, but instead are part of the old EU. That’s a win for everyone in my book. And it lets <em>FOTOR</em> do its own thing without having to twist itself in narrative knots and retcons in order to fit in the canon timeline.</p>

 <h2>Who is making <em>FOTOR</em>?</h2> <p>As mentioned, Casey Hudson is directing, and <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is being developed by Arcanaut Studios, a new company founded by Hudson earlier this year. That actually leads us perfectly into the next question…</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a single player narrative-driven action RPG and spiritual successor to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</p> <p>Working on KOTOR was a defining experience of my career. This is a dream come true for me and our team of incredible… <a href="https://t.co/unx3HvoyUG">pic.twitter.com/unx3HvoyUG</a></p> <p>— Casey Hudson (@CaseyDHudson) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999287887053955250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>When is it coming out?</h2> <p>Oh boy, I’ve got bad news for you: Probably not anytime soon. Remember, Arcanaut Studios was just created earlier this year. That means this game is likely still in pre-production or has just entered development. We are very, <em>very</em> early in the process here, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">as pointed out by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Jason Schreier</a>, <em>FOTOR</em> is almost certainly not a PS5 game and might not be released until 2030.</p> <p>AAA games take a long time to make, and the time to create them is getting longer as games get more complicated and visually impressive. This is also a new studio that is still figuring out its culture, its tools, and learning how to work together. So yeah, the earliest I’d expect <em>Fate of the Republic</em> to launch is late 2028, and that is being extremely hopeful and would likely involve a ton of crunch and support studios. The more reasonable option is 2030 or later. Which, yeah, could mean <em>FOTOR</em> is a late PlayStation 6 game and/or an early PlayStation 7 launch.</p> <h2>What platforms is <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> launching on?</h2> <p>PC almost for sure. Beyond that, no idea. Nothing confirmed, and based on how many years away it will be, likely not PS5, Xbox Series X/S, or Switch 2.</p> <h2>Will I get to use a lightsaber?</h2> <p>Yeah. The trailer basically confirmed that. You need to pay attention more.</p>

              <p><span>The final </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719"><span>World Premiere at the Game Awards last night</span></a><span> wasn’t the long-awaited return of a beloved franchise or a major studio’s next project; it was a new shooter called </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> from Wildlight Entertainment. The sci-fi/fantasy raid shooter is led by folks who worked at Respawn on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/titanfall-the-kotaku-review-1541484198"><i><span>Titanfall</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-the-kotaku-review-1832997584"><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i></a><span>, so there’s some talent behind it. However, the reaction has been somewhat polarizing, and for reasons that aren’t really even </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>’s fault.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>In a vacuum, </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>looks pretty solid. It has </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>’s signature movement abilities, high-octane action, and a mix of fantasy and modern-day aesthetics that lead to fun moments like using a rifle on horseback and then casting elemental spells and scorching enemies alive. It’s got a lot going on, but it also shoulders the burden of looking kind of generic. Even its name is remarkably indistinct. If you showed me footage of </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>and told me it was an ad for mobile slop, I would probably believe it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Wildlight has apparently been developing </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>in secret for years, which is why this announcement comes just weeks before it’s set to launch on January 26. In the time since its development began, the hero shooter/live-service market has become fraught, to say the least. People have a harder time getting excited for a game that threatens to occupy hours of their lives or one that could go the way of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290"><i><span>Concord</span></i></a> <span>and get shut down almost immediately. Plus, the hero shooter genre feels pretty well worn at this point, and it’s impossible to make a new one without getting compared to standouts like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-vendetta-magik-rip-off-react-2000646220"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a><span>. Though admittedly, </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>’s similarities are nowhere near as on the nose as those in something like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-reaction-vanguard-release-date-tank-2000652174"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"I've waited my entire life to tell you about this F2P generic Hero Shooter made in secrecy by a few devs that use to work at that iconic game studio you use to like.

There’s only so much time in the week for a big time-suck of a multiplayer game, and a lot of people have comfortably sunk into their favorite and aren’t looking for another. The Game Awards may have put it in an even tougher spot by making it the final reveal of the night. But hey, at least people are talking about it?</span></p>
