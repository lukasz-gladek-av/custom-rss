It stands to reason that we’ll see more of the latter as additional characters are added in the future seasons. That means Team-Ups are a standout mechanic that will always have some influence on who you want to play as. You’ll benefit greatly from knowing every Team-Up Ability in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p><h2 id="h94206"><a id="team"></a>What is a Team-Up Ability?</h2><p>Team-Up Abiltiies are powerful expressions of teamwork and are exclusive skills between two or three heroes. <strong>Team-Up Abilities commonly work with one hero acting as an initiator and provider of special buffs or moves, while the other hero (or two) can receive it if they’re on the same team.</strong> Their benefits are usually pretty one-sided, but there is no downside to using them. Each one is additive and merely gives you more options.</p><p>A great example is Voltaic Union. Activated by Thor, he can provide Storm and/or Captain America with a buff that enhances their attacks. Only one of them has to be on a team with Thor to receive the buffs, but both can receive it if all three characters are fighting together.</p><h2 id="h94207"><a id="every"></a>Every Team-Up Ability in Marvel Rivals</h2><figure id="" data-id="63dc355944a913b6e87bae23de83c28c" data-recommend-id="image://63dc355944a913b6e87bae23de83c28c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2126" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a selection of Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a selection of Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="63dc355944a913b6e87bae23de83c28c" data-recommend-id="image://63dc355944a913b6e87bae23de83c28c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2126" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a selection of Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Below is a breakdown of every Team-Up Ability added with the launch of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. We’re including the ability name and a description of what the ability is. The heroes that can take part will also be mentioned, with those in bold being the initiators who provide the buffs.</p><p>We’re using the Team-Up Ability name from the Team-Ups screen on the main menu. Every hero involved in one of these has a distinct name for their role in the ability. It can get a little confusing, so we’ll just be using the main title.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ragnarok Rebirth - When <strong>Hela</strong> defeats an enemy with a final hit, she’ll immediately resurrect Loki or Thor if they’re in the respawn phase. If they’re alive, she’ll instead provide them with bonus health.</li><li>Metallic Chaos - <strong>Scarlet Witch</strong> infuses Magneto’s greatsword with her Chaos Energy, granting him access to projectile slashes.</li><li>Voltaic Union - <strong>Thor</strong> uses his Thorforce to power up Storm and/or Captain America. The former gains a lightning barrage attack, while the latter earns a movement bonus and an electric AoE buff to his shield throw.</li><li>Planet X Pals - Both Rocket Raccoon and Jeff the Land Shark can jump onto <strong>Groot</strong>’s shoulder to shoot out attacks, earning a damage reduction bonus while doing so.</li><li>Symbiote Bond - <strong>Venom</strong> channels the Symbiote through Spider-Man and/or Peni Parker, granting them an identical move that has Symbiote spikes explode from their body. </li><li>Gamma Charge - <strong>The Hulk</strong> uses his Gamma Radiation to charge up Doctor Strange and/or Iron Man. This buffs their Maelstrom of Madness and Armor Overdrive attacks respectively.</li><li>Ammo Overload - <strong>Rocket Raccoon</strong> gains a throwable Ammo Overload Device. Both The Punisher and Winter Soldier will receive infinite ammo and a faster firing rate if they’re near the device.</li><li>Dimensional Shortcut - Both Black Panther and Psylocke can gain a rewind ability when <strong>Magik</strong> is on their team. It allows them to return to the position they were in moments before, as well as partially earn any missing health back.</li><li>Lunar Force - With <strong>Cloak and Dagger</strong> on their team, Moon Knight gains the ability to create a small field around himself that he turns invisible in.</li><li>Guardian Revival - <strong>Adam Warlock</strong> grants a similar resurrection ability to Mantis and/or Star-Lord, letting them move around and revive themselves. </li><li>Chilling Charisma - When <strong>Luna Snow</strong> is on their team, both Namor and Jeff the Land Shark gain an activatable ability that will buff their other attacks while active.</li><li>Allied Agents - <strong>Hawkeye</strong> provides a variant of his strongest ability to Black Widow, letting her see afterimages of enemies that she can attack to deal damage.</li><li>Atlas Bond - <strong>Iron Fist</strong> empowers Luna Snow with a unique ability while on her team. It allows her to expel a ring of energy that can heal allies while also damaging and slowing enemies.</li><li>ESU Alumnus - <strong>Spider-Man</strong> provides Squirrel Girl with a Web Bomb ability. She can throw this at enemies to create an AoE blast that deals damage and momentarily binds them.</li><li>Fastball Special - With <strong>Hulk</strong> on the team, both he and Wolverine gain a unique Team-Up ability that allows the former to throw the latter. Each one has to initiate an interaction with the other to trigger it.</li></ul><hr><p>Team-Up Abilities aren’t necessary to win matches in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but your team will likely have better chances with some at your disposal. Knowing these can also give you insight into what strategies or extra skills your opponents might be planning on using.

Team Asobi says you’ll need to have completed the main game to access the holiday-themed level. </p><p>The team isn’t revealing much about the upcoming winter level because it want it to “remain a little surprise,” but the studio does say we can expect a “fun-filled” level with “brand-new special bots” to collect, as well as a “good dose” of jingle bells. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-free-dlc-new-bots-levels-helldivers-1851656690&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-free-dlc-new-bots-levels-helldivers-1851656690">And no, this isn’t a new speedrun level</a></span>.

But it also might be the last bit of <em>Astro Bot</em> DLC we get. </p><p>At the end of the blog post, Doucet added: “For now, it’s goodbye from Astro and the bots. We’ll see you around.” That sounds like an indication that Team Asobi will be moving on to a new project.

While you’re searching for clues in Indy’s main investigation, you’ll catch sight of a few dozen smaller, optional mysteries. But is it worth taking the time to check them out?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,196395" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a slightly more complicated question than you might think. <em>The Great Circle</em> separates its missions into several categories: Adventure, Fieldwork, Discovery, and Mysteries.</p><figure id="" data-id="621526241ba88ea197e64a08c896b5c7" data-recommend-id="image://621526241ba88ea197e64a08c896b5c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks at a map of the Vactican." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks at a map of the Vactican." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MachineGames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="621526241ba88ea197e64a08c896b5c7" data-recommend-id="image://621526241ba88ea197e64a08c896b5c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks at a map of the Vactican." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adventure is the primary plot, where Indy is out to learn who stole one of his museum pieces and why. Fieldwork missions can be broadly generalized as other, unrelated archaeological investigations; Discoveries involve collectibles and short-term activities, like an underground boxing circuit; and Mysteries are shorter and typically based around a single puzzle.</p><p>Due to the way that <em>The Great Circle </em>is structured, many of these missions tend to be interconnected. It’s easy to follow one mission only to end up pursuing another as you go about finding collectibles and quest items.<em><strong>gc-sm02.jpg]</strong></em></p><p>There’s nothing wrong with letting that spontaneous objective structure play out for you. In fact, you’ll end up benefiting if you stray from the main path from time to time. The two primary rewards for successful missions in <em>The Great Circle </em>are Books and Adventure Points. While Books are rarely an actual mission reward, it’s very common for access to a Book to be locked behind progress in a particular side mission.</p><p>Books are used to unlock passive bonuses to Indy’s skills, such as faster stamina recharge or more blocks of health, while Adventure Points are spent to gain those bonuses. Picking up any collectible, such as a note, photo, or artifact, is usually worth 15-50 AP, while side missions can earn you up to 300 at once.</p><figure id="" data-id="284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-recommend-id="image://284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MachineGames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-recommend-id="image://284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br>If you’re looking to prepare for the later challenges in <em>The Great Circle</em>, especially when playing on a higher difficulty, it’s worth taking the time to knock out at least a few side missions in order to improve Indy’s stats. It’s particularly useful to pick up the Moxie books from “A Remedy for All,” which extend Indy’s health meter, and to acquire the Blackshirt disguise in Vatican City so you can take the “Brawler II” Book from inside the fascists’ campsite.</p><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is available on PS5, Xbox Series X?S, and Windows via Steam. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
