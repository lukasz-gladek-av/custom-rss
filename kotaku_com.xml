            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is shaking things up this Labor Day weekend, going after all the big names – and Bose is no exception. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your audio setup, now’s a great moment to jump in: The Bose TV Speaker, which <strong>works as both a soundbar for your TV and a simple living room speaker</strong><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">, is down to just $163 on Amazon (41% off)</a>. Considering that it normally retails for $279, that is a huge discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is designed to<strong> improve the audio from your TV without the bulk of standard soundbars</strong>. It’s simple to hook up with HDMI-ARC, so installation is fast and hassle-free. The HDMI-ARC (Audio Return Channel) permits the soundbar to both transmit and receive audio via the same cable as video, less cord clutter and neater installation. <strong>And it has Bluetooth</strong>, so listening to music or podcasts from your phone or tablet is ridiculously easy and wireless.</p>
<p>Another of the first things you’ll notice about this soundbar is just how evenly balanced and clean-sounding its sound is. Bose engineered it to maximize conversation clarity which is a big plus if you catch yourself from time to time having trouble hearing every word or being drowned out by other sounds when you watch TV. The speaker’s voice-centric design is made to prioritize voices without comprising the depth of your go-to TV movies or shows.</p>
<p>The speaker uses proprietary drivers and proprietary digital signal processing to deliver clear sound that fills the room beyond your TV’s built-in speakers. Bass is unexpectedly strong for something this compact, providing kick to action flicks and music rhythms without distortion, making it a more immersive experience. You feel the actual sense you’re bringing your entertainment to the next level without complicated setups or humongous speakers.</p>



<p>Compact and slim, the Bose speaker just sits on a shelf or TV stand without wasting space or being in the way of your room’s decor. Its black veneer adds a touch of modern sophistication. It can also sit flat on your TV or be mounted on the wall using the included mounting bracket with some adjustability to fit your living room.</p>
<p>The <strong>attached remote control</strong> is another thoughtful touch: It allows you to easily control your sound level, bass, and whatnot, without having to search through a bunch of devices just to get your sound in balance.</p>
<p><span>This is a great opportunity to treat your home audio to an affordable boost this Labor Day weekend.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Post-Launch Roadmap Reveals The Return Of Something Fans Loved From Borderlands 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-post-launch-roadmap-reveals-the-return-of-something-fans-loved-from-borderlands-2.1284876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just a couple weeks before launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> has announced its post-launch roadmap for free updates and paid DLC throughout the next six months and it’s a lot. But one of the smaller details fans were surprised to see is the return of Pearlescent weapons and shields from <em>Borderlands 2</em>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/post-launch-roadmap/?linkId=856235028">rundown of <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s end-game</a> arrived alongside a developer panel at PAX West walking fans through how the XP-based loot grind will work this time around. The game’s first paid bounty pack arrives in the fall with new missions, a new boss fight, and a slew of Legendary gear and fresh cosmetics. There will also be Vault Cards that let players grind to unlock extra rewards, including gear that can keep being re-rolled until players find the version that fits their build.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000621710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621710"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621710">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>But the big update is <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s first paid Story Pack coming in early 2026. It’ll feature a new Vault Hunter, a mini-story campaign, new area to explore, and another trove of collectibles. It’s a cosmic-horror-themed expansion based around Mad Ellie, a Pandoran mechanic who happens to be Moxxi’s daughter. Some other past characters will be returning as well, with a second Story Pack following later in the year.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em>‘s Pearlescent drops are back</h2> <p>There are plenty of free updates sprinkled in between each DLC, but the biggest will arrive alongside Bounty Pack 2 in early 2026. It adds the Pearlescent rarity to the game, something fans have been begging to be brought back from<em> Borderlands 2</em> after it was dropped for <em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p> <p>These drops are essentially like ultra-rare drops with unique gimmicks. When they arrived in <em>Borderlands 2</em> they didn’t make or break builds. There were more like Shinies from <em>Pokémon</em> than <em>Diablo’</em>s Uniques, sought after as prizes rather than the deadliest tools in the game. <em>Borderlands 4</em> might change that this time around, however. “Pearlescent gear drops will be incredibly difficult to find, but their power level will match their coveted rarity,” writes Gearbox.</p>

 <h2>Where are <em>Borderlands 3</em>‘s Takedowns?</h2> <p>A returning feature the studio hasn’t mentioned yet are Takedowns. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3s-next-big-expansion-will-be-a-western-1843586642">These free updates for <em>Borderlands 3</em></a> were raid-boss-adjacent endgame modes that were designed to push squads of players to the breaking point with their difficulty. Gearbox hasn’t mentioned them by name yet, thought it has mentioned Invincible Bosses coming in a future free update for <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p> <p>“Think of them as bosses on steroids: new unique mechanics, massive health pools (not literally invincible, but close to it), extremely lethal attack damage, and other new modifiers that can make quick work of any unprepared Vault Hunters,” the new announcement reads. The first of these will drop before the end of 2025. Weekly big encore boss fights, wildcard missions, and Maurice’s Black Market Machine are all coming after launch as well.</p> <p>If <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s base campaign can deliver a better story than <em>Borderlands 3</em> and make good on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064">promised variety, variability, and build-crafting depth</a> of the new Vault Hunters, the post-launch roadmap definitely looks like it will be showering players with all of the content they’ll want in the endgame. Those are two big ifs. But with <em>Destiny 2</em> currently spiraling and <em>Diablo 4</em> still awaiting its next big expansion, I’m as primed for some fresh, smooth-brained loot chasing as I’ll ever be.</p>

              <p><em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-2-karl-urban-johnny-cage-first-trailer-1851786495">was set to hit theaters</a> on October 24, just a week before Halloween. It seemed like good timing for a hyper-violent video game classic about warriors fighting horrors from other dimensions. Apparently Warner Bros. disagreed. The studio has now delayed the sequel by nearly seven months because it thinks the corny fist-fest can make more money in the spring.</p> <p>That’s according <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/mortal-kombat-ii-opening-date-1236501771/">to <em>Deadline</em></a>, which reported the news late on Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend. It claims “research screenings have been strong” and that Warner Bros. didn’t want to bury its latest video game adaptation in a “crowded late October frame” between<em> Springsteen Deliver Me From Nowhere</em> and <em>Regretting You</em>.</p> <p>So instead, <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> will now come out on May 15, 2026.<em> Avengers: Doomsday</em> was originally set to open that month but was pushed back to December of next year. The only real competition will be <i>The Mandalorian and Grogu</i>, which arrives at the end of next May. So even if <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> ends up having a surprisingly long tail, it’ll probably get kicked out of most theaters by<em> Star Wars</em>.</p> <p>The sequel brings in<em> The Boys</em>‘ Karl Urban as the shade-wearing, split-kicking Johnny Cage and its July trailer looked decent. If it has the budget to double-down on some of the big spectacle fight sequences the 2021 reboot was missing, it could be fun, though I still think its cheesy gore-fest sensibility was a great fit for Halloween. I don’t usually like slasher movies but I’ll make an exception if Scorpion’s the one doing the impaling.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hands-On With Silksong: More Questions Than Answers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-with-silksong-more-questions-than-answers.1284819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has a lot in common with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6.</em> Fans have been waiting on it for years. Each new crumb of information is quickly devoured. Competitors are <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">scrambling out of the way</a>. And after years of fermenting hype, the most wishlisted game on Steam now has to deliver something bigger than the all-consuming cultural distortion field surrounding it. No small task. I’ve now played 15 minutes of the final demo and I still could not tell you which way it’s going to go. That’s because everything that can make a Metroidvania Soulslike like <em>Silksong</em> truly pop is precisely what Team Cherry is keeping most under wraps.</p> <p>I played the Gamescom 2025 build of <em>Silksong</em> on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld during a PAX West-adjacent event at Microsoft and it felt like eating a Dunkin Donuts Munchkin: easy, sweet, and over way too soon. That’s by design. Team Cherry <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">said in a recent interview</a> that the game took seven years to make because of all of the new areas, characters, and secrets it wanted to pack into the <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel. And it also clearly didn’t want to ruin any of those things by actually talking about them before the game’s September 4 release date on PC and console, or by showing them off ahead of time in the demo.</p> <p>The only portion of<em> Silksong</em> that anyone has played so far takes place near the beginning of the game. Hornet, the new protagonist, awakes in an underground glen full of bright moss and easy enemies. A short platforming section introduces players to the familiar <em>Bloodborne</em>-inspired combat (you need to deal damage to get health back) and the game’s exploration which has you exhausting dead-ends until you find the path forward. It wraps with a simple mini-boss fight that’s intent on scaring any newcomers away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000621699" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621699"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621699">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second section takes you to smoldering caverns with more deadly enemies to navigate. Ensembles of flying, fire-ball-spitting wizards and knights with big shields make you work to survive and gesture toward the ambient, elevated threat level that fills each path you choose to go down with just the right amount of tension.</p> <p>This is all classic <em>Hollow Knight</em> so far. The only thing that really sets<em> Silksong</em> apart in the demo is Hornet. The character’s a bit faster, has a down diagonal attack to speed up aerial recoveries, and can heal more quickly but only after more energy is gathered from dealing damage. It’s a different, more aggressive flow than the original game’s, and could take on an even more distinct identity once players start unlocking their full arsenals.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> really cost $20?</h2> <p>All of which is to say that while there were certainly no red flags in my brief hands-on time with <em>Silksong</em>, it’s impossible to know from the 15-minute demo whether <em>Silksong</em> can deliver on what fans have been hoping for over the last eight years. It’s slick and prettier than the original, but what will ultimately matter is the cleverness of its secrets, exploration, and later-game boss fights. One other bit of potential good news ahead of the game’s launch next week is that it might not be very expensive either.</p> <p><em>Hollow Knight</em> launched for just $15 back in 2017. You can currently buy it on PC for just half that price leading up to the sequel’s release (act now and you&nbsp;<em>might</em> be able to beat it in time). <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">A leak yesterday</a> on the GameStop website suggested <em>Silksong</em> will be $20, only $5 more than its predecessor at a time when Team Cherry easily could have charged $30 or more. The store listing has since been taken down and might have just been a speculative placeholder.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">According to <em>Dealabs</em>‘</a> own leak, the $20 price for <em>Silksong</em> on PC is accurate. No physical editions of the game have been confirmed yet, however.</p> <p>All eyes will be on Steam for when the actual price drops. So far Team Cherry hasn’t actually confirmed how much it will cost. Like almost everything else about the game, the small indie team is keeping that close to the vest. Not that it will matter. Just like the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">lack of reviews ahead of launch</a>, <em>Silksong</em> doesn’t have to play by conventional rules. It’s in a league of its own. In less than a week we’ll finally know if it truly belongs there.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-selling-off-this-100w-usb-c-charger-block-with-3-ports-now-at-a-historic-low-price-2000621687</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Carrying around multiple chargers can be such a pain – your bag ends up heavy and overflowing with cables. Wouldn’t it be nice to have just one charger that handles all your devices at once? That’s exactly where this Baseus 100W USB-C charger block comes in: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">it’s on Amazon for only $29, down from $49, which is a solid 40% off</a> – definitely a steal at this all-time low price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports</h2>
<p>This small charger is a monster with three ports: <strong>two USB-C and one USB-A</strong>. That means you can charge your phone, tablet and even laptop all at once without having to switch back and forth between several different plugs. And don’t worry about it being slow: <strong>it delivers up to 100 watts in total power</strong> which is more than enough to fast-charge something like a MacBook Pro or any other laptop while still keeping your phone and tablet topped up. It’s got this smart PPS technology that adjusts the power depending on what you’re charging so your devices don’t get too much juice and stay safe.</p>
<p>What I totally adore is the way the plug folds: When you’re all done charging, <strong>you just fold it up and it’s really tiny</strong>. It fits perfectly into your bag or even a large pocket, no bulky charger bricks weighing you down. And it’s durable, so you don’t have to worry about destroying it after a few recharges. It’s compatible with so many of the most popular devices, like the new iPhone 16, Galaxy S54, iPad, and so forth, so that you don’t have to be carrying a separate charger for every gadget.</p>



<p>Even when it’s charging three devices at a time, this charger keeps up with the speed: <strong>The USB-C ports split that 100W among themselves in a way that each device gets enough current to charge in a rush</strong>, and the USB-A port also provides fast charging so the old devices get a speed boost without being left behind.</p>
<p>Safety features are also spot on. It’s got inbuilt safeguards to <strong>protect your belongings from overheating, short circuits, or overcharging</strong>. So don’t worry about leaving your devices plugged in overnight. It’s also energy efficient, meaning less wasted power and smaller dent on your electricity bill.</p>
<p>Get it at this sale price while it lasts, and be on your way to quicker and simpler charging of all your electronics wherever you are.</p>
