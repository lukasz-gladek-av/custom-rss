              <p>Devs behind the sci-fi MMO Phil Spencer liked but canceled anyway form a new studio. More turnover at Halo Studios ahead of its big reveal for the future of the franchise. Would pricing <em>GTA 6</em> at $100 actually be a disaster for Rockstar Games? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I’m doing my best to avoid the <a href="https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1976104048010068331">dog collar conspiracy discourse</a> currently consuming the streaming world and pondering the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-earth-romulan-war-explained-2000669117">deeply mysterious Earth-Romulan war instead</a>. It’s also the <a href="https://www.thepopverse.com/the-full-schedule-for-nycc-2025-day-0-retailer-day-for-all-comics-pros">first day of NYCC 2025</a>. It’s full of toys I don’t need but <a href="https://x.com/VGArtAndTidbits/status/1976295355093340346">desperately want</a>.</p>  <p>Glenn Israel has been an artist working on<em> Halo</em> since he was at Bungie back in 2008. After more than a decade with the franchise, including time serving as a senior concept artist on <em>Halo Infinite</em>, he’s suddenly leaving the studio under mysterious circumstances. The news comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmqrY8ng2GI">amid fresh rumors of growing pains</a> at the studio getting ready to reveal the future of <em>Halo</em> at the 2025 World Championships <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384">later this month</a>.</p>

 <p>“As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe,” Israel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">wrote on LinkedIn</a> last week. “There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year. In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are *free to choose*. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values – and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong.”</p>

 <h2>Laid-off devs behind Microsoft’s cancelled sci-fi MMO launch a new studio</h2> <p>The studio’s made of developers who had been working at ZeniMax Online Studios on Project Blackbird and it’s called, fittingly enough, <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">Sackbird Studios</a>. It’s employee-owned and self-funded. “With internal funding and full creative control, the studio is focused on crafting bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises,” a post on the company website reads.</p>

 <p>“We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people,” said Lee Ridout, Sackbird Studios’ CEO. “When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.”</p>

 <h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> gets a new secret ending in a free update</h2>  <p>It drops October 10 and unlocks after players finish the just-added new game plus mode.</p> <h2><em>MTG</em> head designer pushes back against Universes Beyond “slop” accusations</h2> <p>A pro player’s rant went viral last week as he railed against what he saw as the dilution of<em> Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s identity. “There’s always a line in the sand where people say ‘this is <em>Magic</em>‘ or ‘this is not<em> Magic</em>,’ but everybody’s line is different,” head designer Mark Rosewater said earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minds-behind-magic-the-gathering-say-theyre-making-it-for-anyone-not-everyone/1100-6535324/">proactively responding to criticisms at MagicCon 2025 in Atlanta</a>. “I know your line seems like the line, because it’s so clear of a line to you, but your line is just not everybody’s line. And as the guy who has to make the game, I have to respect everybody’s line.”</p> <p>Rosewater also dunked on <em>MT</em>G’s most popular format to prove his point. “I’m not a Commander fan,” he said. “To me, <em>Magic</em> is a strategic game. I love it because I win when I’m outthinking my opponent. Commander is not a strategic game. It is a political game; you’re playing the people.”</p>

No Switch 1 or Xbox versions.</p> <h2>A new report warns against pricing <em>GTA 6</em> at $100</h2> <p>Despite speculation that Rockstar Games’ upcoming sequel could be the first game to break the $100 barrier, a MIDiA Research study claims that less than half of players interested in <em>GTA 6</em> would buy it at that price point.</p> <p>“Our research shows that 59 percent of consumers have some interest in purchasing<em> GTA 6</em>, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game,” analyst Brandon Sutton <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table">told <em>IGN</em></a>. “This notoriety also makes <em>GTA 6</em> the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.”</p> <p>One response to these findings might be: why not try every price for the game? The increasing popularity of Deluxe Editions shows that you can milk super-fans for all they’re worth and still sell the base version to everyone else.

              <p>Prime Big Deal Days may be over, but some of the best discounts are still alive on Amazon from brands like Samsung, SanDisk, Dyson, and, yes, even Amazon itself. Pretty much every Amazon-branded product is seeing a discount during the event and that includes the smart home hub, the Echo Dot. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">This 2022 smart speaker is still priced at just $35, the same as it was during Prime Day.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Vibrant Sound</h2>
<p>The Echo Dot is the standard Echo’s little brother. Even though its smaller, the smart speaker is still capable of producing powerful sound with a rich and deep bass with its 1.73-inch front-firing speaker You can listen to your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts with clear vocals and dialogue, even when you are rooms away.</p>
<p>Since the Echo Dot is a smart home hub, you can take control of all the other smart products in your home using just your voice. If you have smart RGB bulbs installed in you lamps, you can ask Alexa to dim them, or adjust to a spooky orange and purple glow for a Halloween party. With as smart thermostat, you can ask it to turn down the temperature when it’s starting to feel a bit warm. And you can do it from the comfort of your couch with your phone still in your pocket.</p>



<p>Echo Dots can answer questions, keep your schedule, or set timers when cooking or running laundry. I frequently find myself asking what the weather is like in the morning when getting ready as I will constantly forget where I set my phone down as I dart between the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. If you have more than one Echo device ( or just the Alexa app installed on your phones) you can connect with friends or family from different rooms of the house. Start a call from the Echo Dot in your kitchen to the Echo Dot in your basement to let the kids know dinner’s ready and it’s time to pause the game. It’s the new age version of connecting two cups together with a long string.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">The Echo Dot from Amazon is available in three different colors. Each happen to be on sale for $15 off.</a> Choose between either charcoal, glacier white, or deep sea blue, all of which are just $35 during the post-Prime Big Deals Day at Amazon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>It doesn’t take long until everything starts blowing up in </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>After a lean introduction that outlines the collapse of international order in the late 2020s, you assume the role of Gunnery Sergeant Dylan Murphy, an American marine on a NATO base in Georgia. Murphy and his squadmates are about to evacuate this base ahead of its transfer of control to a giant private military company called, bleakly, Pax Armata. Within minutes, the base comes under a surprise attack from the impatiently aggressive PMC. Soldiers scream and die, gouts of flame blossom on the tarmac like nasty orange flowers. Gunfire rattles. Here are the explosions, ahead of schedule.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s opening plays out as a statement of intent. You are here, it knows, to shoot enemy soldiers and watch the vehicles, buildings, and natural world all around your character fall apart or combust in spectacular fashion. The point of the game, whether in its single-player campaign or multiplayer mode, is to make you feel like you’re an agent of small change within the overwhelming chaos of a warzone.</span></p>

 <p><span>To that end, the game’s first mission is a kind of Disneyland ride for the </span><i><span>Guns and Ammo</span></i><span> set. As Murphy, you grab the turret of a Humvee and rattle off hundreds of bullets at Pax forces as a landscape of greenly forested hills and concrete military installations flies by, speeding past exploding buildings and burning vehicles until there’s a chance to catch your breath on the lip of a cliffside overlooking an office building in mid-construction. From there, Murphy and his squad rush into a gunfight. You’re introduced to the on-foot rhythm of popping in and out of cover to shoot enemies, order a teammate to throw a grenade, and set charges to blow up the office, destroying data servers before Pax can capture them. The evacuation goes wrong and the level ends with Murphy and his team shot down in a helicopter, fighting off overwhelming forces in a heroic last stand.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s a saccharine series of death scenes. Murphy reminds his friends that their motto is “unconquerable spirit” as their life drains, messy and red, onto an American flag conspicuously dropped onto the mangled floor of the helicopter. He alone is rescued in the nick of time. Murphy drapes the flag on a corpse, presses his hand to it, and watches blood spread out through the fabric and onto his gloves.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633397"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633397">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is hardly subtle stuff, but it is invigorating in a retrograde sense. It’s also, to </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s credit, something of a false indication of what’s to come. Over the eight missions to follow, the game tries–and sometimes succeeds–in subverting its players’ expectations of what a modern military shooter should look like, both in the direction the plot takes and in the ways that many fights play out.</span></p>

 <p><span>The campaign takes place over the course of nine missions, bookended by cinematics that show Murphy confronting a CIA agent sometime after the past-tense levels have taken place. Though the scope of the game is global, it’s told almost entirely through the perspective of Murphy and his fellow Americans in a special Marine squad dubbed Dagger 13. This means that the NATO allies encountered throughout the game serve only as backdrop for an international conflict that ends up largely centered on the United States.</span></p>

 <p><span>The exception is the primary villain of the game: a British Pax leader called Kincaid. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> places its world-changing action within the context of personal relationships and so Kincaid is an embittered soldier formerly betrayed by an American comrade, a foil for Murphy’s doubting patriotism with a massive chip on his shoulder and a gruesome acid burn scar on his face to match.</span></p>

 <p><span>Much of the first half of the game sees Dagger 13 hunting down Kincaid for more information on his involvement with Pax Armata’s mysterious access to advanced technology. It’s a simple enough way to propel a plotline forward, and it works—though the campaign also moves between set pieces at such a breakneck pace that it could hold a hamster’s attention. The player is tossed between a variety of scenarios that break up the gunfighting formula, like one in which you lead a tank column between the wrecked cars and cracked roads of a bombed-out Egyptian highway, or another that sees you hopping across the wrenched-apart steel and concrete of a collapsing bridge.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000633400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633400"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633400">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are also mission introductions that involve parachuting through the clouds and down past glowing tracer fire toward the cramped, sun-soaked streets of a war-torn Gibraltar. And, later in the same mission, a beach landing on a heavily defended shore where you rock along on an amphibious tank, battleships sinking into the waves behind you and artillery raining down on vehicles ahead. There’s a sense of choking dread in both cases, and especially in the latter, when crashing through the roiling sea and onto a beach defended by mounted guns, an inferno of oily black clouds of smoke and raging fires obscuring the view.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, the finer points of each enemy encounter aren’t nearly as engaging as their presentation. The shooting is finely tuned, with the basic act of pattering bullets into a Pax soldier or punching a hole through the side of a wall with a rocket launcher gratifying. The enemies just aren’t very interesting to fight. Despite solid level layouts that facilitate basic, on-the-fly tactics like flanking or dodging into cover, enemy infantry typically arrives in waves of dopey soldiers running directly onto the battlefield from some hidden corner in lumped-together masses. Your AI squadmates, who can be ordered to shoot, toss smoke or frag grenades, and mark enemies, are pretty braindead, too. Though the trappings of just about every battle are vibrant and creative, they’re let down by a sense of artificiality at their center.</span></p>

 <p><span>The sound design in </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>, as in past entries to the series, goes a long way toward keeping the illusion of real danger present. Regardless of how pedestrian it might be (in video game terms) to shoot through encounters with one group of enemies after another, the crack of an overhead sniper shot or boom of a nearby explosion, bits of gravel dropping down like hailstones, provides a sense of deadly chaos. </span></p> <p><span>I</span><span>t’s also one of the highlights of </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s multiplayer. Freed from the confines of its story, the narrative reduced to a backdrop for eternal battles between NATO and Pax forces, the game comes alive as a lavish digital toybox. Over the review period, the multiplayer was mostly made available in two- or four-hour sessions, the servers filled with other reviewers and too many bots. While this makes it hard to gauge exactly how matches will feel once the game is properly live, a limited tour of the various modes and features represents, along with the beta test period from this summer, a worthwhile indication of what to expect.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“It’s like World War III, but fun.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Battlefield Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Single-player and multiplayer military-themed first-person shooter.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Appropriately nihilistic campaign, great sound and visual spectacle in campaign and multiplayer.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Dull enemy AI and underdeveloped cast of characters; smaller maps and stripped-back modes are underwhelming.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC (played), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date: </p>                 <p> October 10, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Just over six hours to complete the campaign; roughly 10 hours of multiplayer.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>The maps are largely very good, especially in the case of a valley in Tajikistan, its ruined houses dwarfed by snowy mountain ranges, or the stretch of muddy ground surrounding a construction site outside of Cairo. In each of these, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> shines by providing lots of room for grand engagements between infantry and tanks, helicopters and jets either attacking ground forces or fighting their own battles in the sky. </span></p>

 <p><span>The classic </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span> frustration of spawning in and either immediately getting shot or blown up, or sprinting toward the center of the action only to get sniped from an unseen shooter, remains. But so, too, does the controlled chaos of large-scale combat between squads, all working toward the same objective in different ways. Fighting on-foot in a dilapidated house while tanks roar by outside the windows remains one of the most distinctive, exhilarating experiences in a multiplayer shooter. The smaller maps are less successful. While serviceable as a stripped-down infantry-on-infantry shooter, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s combat works best when it’s augmented by other factors, like needing to mine routes that tanks might take toward an objective or shooting rockets at enemy helicopters. In comparison, close-quarters fighting just isn’t as strong of a draw.</span></p>  <p><span>There’s a lot to do in multiplayer as well, and a good amount of flexibility in how to do it. After every match, across a wide variety of game modes, a confetti blast of new weapon attachments and vehicle customization options fills the screen, providing incentive to continue customizing your approach to combat until, in coming months, the real obsessives kill the joy of experimentation by locking down a mathematically superior loadout for every class. At its core, though, the focus on objective-based modes and the enjoyment that comes from taking any part in such large-scale matches means that even the lousiest player can get something out of the multiplayer.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s general look and feel is easier to appreciate when playing online, but its campaign is still worthwhile as tone-setting and a piece of modern military fiction in its own right. The characters are too flat, and the plot fails to dig deep enough into its richest elements, but there’s a bitterly nihilistic edge to the story that speaks to something truer than its paranoiac World War III premise might suggest. As the plot progresses, the instances of patriotic heroism its characters try to engage in ring hollower and hollower. The flag-centric last stand from the opening mission seems like a cruel joke to the Americans of Dagger 13, who begin to see, in the nakedly monetary goals of Pax Armata, an unintended reflection of their own nation and the crumbling goals of Western hegemony.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633395"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633395">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There’s an honesty to this tone and narrative. Like the climate apocalypse backdrop of </span><i><span>Battlefield 2042</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> is a game that acknowledges the doomed trajectory of the current Western political landscape and, rather than offer a hopeful alternative, figures we all might as well enjoy the dramatic thrills of its take on a world order falling violently apart. It points very directly to America’s stewardship of this process but assigns real blame to a Hobbesian understanding of human nature—one in which survival, in the form of moneymaking, is an eternal guiding principle that will send us all to ruin.</span></p> <p><span>At one point, the villainous Kincaid poses a question to one of the Dagger 13 heroes: “Don’t you want to die for something real?” And the answer, by then, is clear. There’s nothing worth dying for when these characters can no longer believe in their country or its allies.</span></p> <p><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>’s campaign is too unevenly executed to make its vision as compelling as it ought to be, but it still works well enough to inflect the entire game with a healthy cynicism unusual for the genre. Though every multiplayer military shooter feels at least slightly callous when viewed from a distance, unending war modeled with a twinned desire for both realism and the rendering down of martial violence into sport, </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> manages to make a natural home for its design ethos in that discordance. It finds the road to global ruin pretty exciting, and believes that you will, too. For the most part, it’s right.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Heart Machine, developer of 2016’s hit action-RPG <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>, has fallen on hard times after that game’s follow-up, the roguelike prequel <i>Hyper Light Breaker</i>, failed to resonate with players. Still officially in Early Access, the game will get some more attention from Heart Machine, but the studio has announced that it is winding down development, and that members of the team have been laid off.</p> <p>“We’ve had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members,” Heart Machine said in a statement (h/t <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/still-in-early-access-hyper-light-breakers-ending-development-and-laying-off-staff-this-was-not-our-ideal-path-but-rather-the-only-one-available-given-the-circumstances/">Joshua Wolens at <i>PC Gamer</i></a>). Attributing the challenges its facing to “broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today,” Heart Machine has hit bumpy patches in the past as well, with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">a previous round of layoffs</a> implemented toward the end of 2024, Though it seems like <i>Hyper Light Breaker</i> might never be completed in the ways its creators once envisioned and hoped for, the studio is promising to issue an update in January and bring <i>Breaker</i> to some kind of finish line.</p>

 <h2>‘As an avid <i>Hyper Light Drifter Fan</i>, I have tried to enjoy this game multiple times. I just can’t’</h2> <p>Fans of the very cool and visually captivating 2016 indie hit <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i> have, by and large, failed to latch on to what <i>Breaker</i> is offering. “I just can’t,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198372477945/recommended/1534840/">reads one Steam review</a> of the game in its present Early Access state. “The only thing that actually ties this game to <i>Drifter</i> is the title of the game and the art style. […] Characters currently are limited to select weapons to artificially promote character diversity. Extraction as a concept is pointless aside from being a source of infinite health.”</p>

 <p>“The core combat feels decent enough at times,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodClayston/recommended/1534840/">reads another negative review</a>. “But pretty much everything this game has to offer is either very rough around the edges or just questionably designed, on top of a large amount of smaller issues that quickly add up.”</p>

 <p>It’s not all doom and gloom in the reviews section. Some folks seem to be more patient with the game in its Early Access state, while others are finding genuine fun. Still, these are the lesser voices speaking out behind the game’s “Mixed” user review status on Steam.</p> <p>Though the game is still going to receive some attention, it’s unfortunate that its creators will never be able to implement their full vision for it, and particularly unfortunate that people have lost their livelihoods. Heart Machine continues on with its other projects, including the side-scroller <i>Possessor(s) </i>due out next month. “We are deeply grateful to everyone who contributed to all of our projects, and to our community for their continued support as we look forward to the future of Heart Machine,“ the statement says.</p>
