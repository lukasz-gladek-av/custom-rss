We didn’t know much about it, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122?_gl=1*qwsnjh*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjUzMjY5My4xMzEuMS4xNzM2NTMzNTM0LjIuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122?_gl=1*qwsnjh*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjUzMjY5My4xMzEuMS4xNzM2NTMzNTM0LjIuMC4w">based on what has leaked out</a></span> and was rumored, it sounds like <em>Transformers Reactivate </em>was going to be the big, modern, AAA game the franchise deserves and hasn’t really gotten in many years. However, back in 2010, we did get just such a game. </p><p><em>Transformers: War for Cybertron </em>is a third-person action shooter that lets you play through both sides of the civil war on the robotic planet of Cybertron. One campaign is focused on the Autobots and the other tells the story of the Decepticons. And don’t expect Earth or humans in this game, as it’s all about the bloody civil war that, eventually, leads to the fall of Cybertron (good name for a sequel) and the exodus of the Transformers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>War for Cybertron</em></a></span> and its sequel, <em>Fall of Cybertron</em>, play like most other third-person action shooters of the day, complete with the <em>Gears of War</em>-inspired “Hold this button to look at something cool happening” feature. But that’s fine, because instead of boring soldiers shooting people, you get to play as giant transforming robots with silly names who use big guns to destroy other robots, and ayou can become a car or hover tank, too. </p><p><em>War </em>and <em>Fall </em>both know that people want action and sci-fi nonsense in a <em>Transformers </em>game, make the right call in giving you plenty of that. Also, I hope you like different-colored metal corridors filled with nameless robot drones who you blast away over and over again, because that’s mostly what you do in these games. That may not sound great, but because it’s covered in <em>Transformers </em>lore, characters, and weirdness, it still ends up being a lot of fun. And unlike most other third-person corridor shooters of the era, you can transform into a car or a hover tank whenever you want. While in either form you can move faster and gain access to more powerful weapons. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They truly are more than meets than eye. </a></span></p><p>What’s wild to me is that I’m not a <em>Transformers </em>fan and I still enjoyed going back and replaying <em>War for Cybertron</em> earlier this week. If you <em>are</em> a <em>Transformers</em> fan, I expect you’ll get even more out of all the characters and lore shoved into these action-packed shooters. </p><h2 id="h69978"><a id=""></a><em>War for Cybertron</em> deserves a second life</h2><p>So how do you play <em>War for Cybertron</em> and its sequel in 2025? It ain’t easy. The games were pulled from digital storefronts years ago once Activision’s licensing deals expired, so you can’t just buy them on Steam. You can find used Xbox 360 copies floating around on eBay and other sites for under $30, but you’ll need an Xbox 360 console to play them, as none of the games are backward compatible. </p><p>There are other ways to find these games and play them on PC; perhaps you might check out some large archive of content on the internet. Once you get your PC version (I’m not asking how), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can use this tiny tool</a></span> to unlock the framerate and play <em>War for Cybertron</em> at 120 FPS. </p><p>It’s a shame that Microsoft and Activision haven’t cut a deal with Hasbro to remaster or at the very least port these <em>Transformers </em>games to modern hardware so more people can play them. We know Hasbro wants these games made available again, so it seems like it comes down to Activision. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571">The publisher claimed in 2023</a></span> that despite comments from Hasbro, it still had access to original code for the games. Over a year later, nothing has manifested and it’s still hard as heck to play these popular <em>Transformers </em>games. Which is a shame. </p><p>While we’ve continued to receive smaller <em>Transformers </em>games over the years, it’s been far too long since the last big-budget game based on the franchise hit store shelves. Hasbro and the other companies involved should work out a deal and get the <em>Cybertron </em>titles back on digital stores in 2025, giving <em>Transformers </em>fans who missed out a chance to play these fantastic games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tanks are typically expected to be defensive bullet sponges that pull aggro from their squishier teammates. But the role splits into two: some are main tank protectors, others are off-tank supporters, who run into a team fight hoping their healers are paying attention. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’</a></span> Vanguards similarly fall into several different archetypes, and each has a niche they occupy. But who is the best? While it can depend on the situation, a few heroes are more versatile than others, letting us love them more. Here’s our ranking of the eight tanks that are in the game now. We’ll update this ranking when the Thing is added later in Season 1.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-recommend-id="image://06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-recommend-id="image://06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As far as Vanguards go, I consider myself a Captain America main. Because I’ve spent a decent amount of time wielding his vibranium shield I’m confident in saying that America’s Ass is easily the worst tank in the game that I keep using because I haven’t found another character I gel with. When Steve pops off, it feels incredibly satisfying—more often than not you jump into a fight, slap someone around for a little bit, then jump out as your health rapidly deteriorates. Cap is one of the most disruptive heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it’s hard to get that much value out of him when his melee-based kit lacks that certain punch you need to make the most of his dives. If his attacks were a little more powerful and he could reliably get kills, he could be a contender, but right now, he serves as little more than a distraction while other heroes pull off more impressive plays.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-recommend-id="image://789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-recommend-id="image://789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Master of Magnetism is one of the more methodical Vanguards in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Sure, his slower kit isn’t as exciting as barreling through enemy teams as Thor, or setting up an ambush as Doctor Strange—hence his lower place in this list—but if you need someone to exert enormous amounts of pressure onto an enemy team and stop your team from getting dived on, Magneto’s an excellent pick. His shield-based moveset is all about absorbing damage and throwing it right back at the enemy team. He requires more patience than other tanks on the roster, but in the right hands, he’s a fortified frontline fighter.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-recommend-id="image://828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-recommend-id="image://828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On his face, the Hulk can come off like a gimmick character, clearly taking a page from <em>Overwatch</em>’s book. Like D.Va in Blizzard’s shooter, the Hulk has two forms, one much weaker with only a pistol to pester enemies until he can return to his massive, more impactful form. Despite this, The Hulk is an effective dive hero with good crowd control, mobility, and ways to convert damage into power, and he has better damage output than Captain America, so you can actually reliably smash your way through a team fight. His Super Hulk ultimate is an incredible survival tool that heals you to a whopping 1500 health, and altogether he’s just a really bulky brawler that can wreck shop when you know how best to cycle your abilities. However, Hulk’s team-up abilities make him one of the most desirable off tank picks with certain teammates. Pairing Hulk with Doctor Strange and Iron Man gives the two sarcastic geniuses an incredible damage boost that can make even half a team a force to be reckoned with. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-recommend-id="image://0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-recommend-id="image://0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the more entertaining spins <em>Marvel Rivals </em>puts on <em>Overwatch </em>archetypes is making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span> the equivalent of the robot-piloting hamster, Wrecking Ball. The symbiote-journalist duo is all about swinging into the battlefield, causing a bunch of chaos, and then feeding on all the incoming damage to get a second wind. He’s got great crowd control as he slows enemy movement, and can disrupt an enemy team formation better than most other heroes on the roster. Admittedly, he is one of the more independent tanks, and doesn’t have much in the way of supportive abilities to help his team, lacking something like Magneto or Hulk’s shields, but that mostly means you need a good team comp to compliment him when he swings into battle. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-recommend-id="image://fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-recommend-id="image://fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Peni Parker is an absolute menace on defensive maps. Her mine-based kit allows her to set up traps, claim space, and has enemy teams walking on eggshells as they try to push onto an objective and avoid her explosive traps. Her abilities are less useful when you’re pushing toward an objective yourself, but her mech is powerful enough to handle scraps and push alongside more brawl-based heroes. While she may be a bit situational, Peni is easily one of the best Vanguards in the game for holding an objective and countering teams that carelessly dive on a point. Also, setting up mines in front of the enemy spawn and blowing up half their team never gets old.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-recommend-id="image://ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-recommend-id="image://ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The God of Thunder is easily the best off tank in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. His mobility attacks let him dive in and out of fights easily, but they also double as a means to isolate and assassinate enemies, even as they’re grouped up. Thor’s entire kit feeds into itself, gaining power, health, and a stronger transformative state just by smartly utilizing all of his abilities. Where some tanks are more slow-paced, rewarded for intellectual play and setup, Thor is an unstoppable force, encouraged to stay in the brawl and reliably deal some of the most devastating attacks with short universal cooldowns. The catch being all of this is powered by a unique passive called Thorforce, required to pull off some of Thor’s most impressive abilities. Managing those mechanics is the difference between getting shredded immediately and swiftly taking out the enemy supports and cutting your foes off at the knees.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-recommend-id="image://2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-recommend-id="image://2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy’s talking tree is one of the more straightforward Vanguards in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but Groot is also one of the most reliable at what he does. He uses his branch-like limbs to build walls anywhere on the map. This can be a defensive measure, but it’s also an excellent way to stall enemies from reaching an objective. Toss those suckers up in front of an enemy spawn door and it will take them at least a few seconds to shoot their way through. Not to mention his ultimate ability has some of the best crowd control, as he groups enemies together and sets them up for a quick and easy wipe. Groot is just good at getting in the way, and when the enemy team finally does make its way to him, he’s a strong brawler who can become near-invincible when Rocket is riding on his shoulder and pumping him full of health. Groot is the platonic ideal of a defensive tank, and I’m always thrilled to see one on my team.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-recommend-id="image://d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-recommend-id="image://d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stephen Strange is easily the Vanguard who has gotten the most buzz since <em>Marvel Rivals</em> was in beta, largely because his portal ability led to some hilarious viral moments of tricking foes into walking off the side of the map out of spawn. But that’s a microcosm of what makes him a compelling tank, because the experimentation he allows is unmatched by almost any other character in the roster.</p><p>Baseline, Doctor Strange is one of the most effective defensive heroes because his shield is a big Reinhardt-style wall that can protect multiple heroes at once. But after you pair that with the sorcerer’s flight-based mobility, his possibilities as a shutdown character make him an excellent counter to some of the greatest threats in the game. Is your enemy’s Hela about to unleash a devastating ultimate on your team? Fly up in her face, throw up your shield, and give your team a chance to take cover before she can rain damage down on you. Is the enemy team putting too much pressure on your team to successfully get out of spawn? Throw up a portal and ambush them from behind.

Microsoft began this shift a year ago by bringing <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Pentiment</em>, and <em>Grounded</em> to other platforms, and has already confirmed its big Xbox exclusive of 2024, <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, will come to PS5 less than six months after release.<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>are also already confirmed to be coming day-and-date to Sony’s console in 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But, this sort of just throws you into one of the presets: low, medium, high, or ultra. That can be a good place to start, but if you’re still having performance issues, it’s worth diving into the menu to see what you can change.</p><h2 id="h64544"><a id=""></a></h2><p>To find these settings, click on the gear, then settings. In the display menu, I settled on the following settings.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Display Mode: Fullscreen. Borderless Windowed works better with a multi-monitor setup, but Fullscreen is better for performance.</li><li>Anti-Aliasing and Super Resolution Type: Nvidia DLSS (for those with Nvidia cards)</li><li>Mode: Quality</li><li>Sharpening: 70-80 (This can be lowered further to try and improve performance, but it’s a small gain for a noticeable visual difference).</li><li>Frame Generation Mode: Off</li><li>Low Latency Mode: NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency</li><li><strong>V-Sync: Off</strong></li><li><strong>Global Illumination: SSGI - Low Quality</strong></li><li><strong>Reflection Quality: Screen Space Reflections</strong></li><li>Model Detail: Medium</li><li><strong>Post-Processing: Low</strong></li><li>Shadow Detail: Medium</li><li>Texture Detail: Medium</li><li><strong>Effects Detail: Low</strong></li><li>Foliage Quality: Medium</li></ul><p>This is a good base to start from if you’re running into framerate issues. If everything runs smoothly, you can try upping the non-bolded settings above for options like Texture Detail to squeeze some prettier pixels out of your GPU. But if your frame rate still isn’t where you want it to be, there are some other worthwhile options. You can try lowering settings like foliage quality, shadow detail, and reflection quality. You may also want to try lowering your game’s resolution. </p><h2 id="h64545"><a id=""></a>You can also change your reticle in <em>Marvel Rivals</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-recommend-id="image://24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-recommend-id="image://24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, you can change your reticle already in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>! And, just like <em>Overwatch</em>, you can change these on a character-by-character basis. To find the menu, go to your preferred control method in the top menu (keyboard or controller), then go to combat. Here, in the HUD subsection, you’ll find the in-depth reticle editor. You choose from different types, like a simple dot or a set of crosshairs. You can create a custom color, and change the width and opacity.</p><p>As far as the best reticle, there is no 100% definitive answer. Get in this menu and experiment to see what works best for you! With this knowledge of the settings in your pocket, you’ll be better prepared than ever to help save the timeline!</p><hr><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While <em>Overwatch 2 </em>revolves around the role queue to ensure there are players on each type of hero, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t have any such system in place, so you may find yourself needing to flex to play healer (Strategist) and tank (Vanguard) often. With this, learning to play a character of each type will be vital, especially if you’re solo queuing. </p><h3 id="h164183"><a id=""></a><strong>Turn off Easy Swing. You’ll thank me later. </strong></h3><p>This might seem a little counterintuitive for a beginner’s guide, but turning off this setting will help you in the long run. Though Easy Swing makes things somewhat, well, easy by way of selecting a tether point for you to swing to, turning the setting off will see Venom swing in the direction your aiming. As you get better at the game, you’ll come to rely on this greater freedom of control, even if it’s a little more challenging at first.</p><h3 id="h164184"><a id=""></a><strong>Use your melee attack frequently.</strong></h3><p>Some of the melee attacks in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>can feel a bit clunky. However, this is definitely not the case for Venom. This melee strike can add up to a three-hit combo, which does enough damage to put the finishing touch on low health Duelists are trapped in your tendrils.</p><h3 id="h164185"><a id=""></a><strong>Delay your shield</strong>. </h3><p>When diving into enemy lines, keep a very close eye on your health, and <strong>use your shield ability when your health is very low</strong>, ideally all the way down to the double digits of Venom’s sizable health bar. </p><h3 id="h164186"><a id=""></a><strong>Watch your opponent’s composition closely</strong>. </h3><p>Keeping an eye on who’s on the battlefield will determine how early you should use your shield. Watch out especially for characters that can stun, like Luna Snow. If they do manage to stun you, use your shield ability earlier, right about when your health is around 200. </p><h3 id="h164187"><a id=""></a><strong>Use your Ultimate for preservation</strong>. </h3><p>Venom’s ultimate, unlike many others in the game, does not do a whole lot of damage. It also doesn’t have a major healing effect. Instead, it grants special temporary health depending on how much damage you dish out. Mainly, Venom’s Ultimate is is good for a last ditch effort at self-preservation. </p><hr><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Five months later at a WWE x C4 event, the former WWE World Heavyweight champion revealed he was “sworn to secrecy” about any involvement in the project, likely with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-kevin-feige-mcu-blade-1851696307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-kevin-feige-mcu-blade-1851696307">Kevin Feige</a></span> holding with a (metaphorical) gun to his head. Questions about his involvement began to arise when he told a fan on X (formerly Twitter) that no, an individual in the <em>Captain America </em>trailer released last November <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/WWERollins/status/1855427081695363583?t=yiMqYVzTfX5or9ZR-brTYw&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/WWERollins/status/1855427081695363583?t=yiMqYVzTfX5or9ZR-brTYw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t him</a></span>. </p><p>Now, we have definitive answers from Rollins about his work on the film. “The script went through a lot of rewrites and reshoots so what I was there to do, essentially my role got either repurposed or completely erased,” Rollins explains. “So I did do a bit of an audition to possibly pop into another role, I believe, or the repurposing of my role, I’m not exactly sure on what it was, but they ended up going in a different direction with it.”</p><p>It’s curious that a star of his caliber wouldn’t be given a straight answer on why he was removed from what may be the first blockbuster of 2025. With that said, he easily could be lying to set up a major reveal that shocks the audience. He has some experience in doing that, right? </p><p>In the end, Rollins or not, we’ll be seated and ready for Marvel’s attempt to improve upon a rather lackluster 2024 (and 2023, if we’re being honest) at the box office. Maybe a little WWE theatrics is just what they need. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
