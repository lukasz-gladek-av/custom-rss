              <p>The holidays are a mere blip in our collective rearview mirror now, so why are <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Apple’s newest and arguably best AirPods still at their all-time low price of $199 at Amazon</a>? Don’t know, don’t care, don’t want to jinx it — we just want to get there before somebody looks at the calendar and removes this $50-off deal on the AirPods Pro 3 altogether.</p>
<p>The Pro 3 were one of the biggest audio tech drops of 2025. As hard as it is to believe, it’s been less than six months since they hit the market and sent waves of audiophiles scurrying to get some of the first pairs. Next-level active noise cancellation at twice the level of the AirPods Pro 2 is an awfully good start for a sales pitch, but Apple packed so many more upgrades and innovations into the AirPods Pro 3 that it’s worth revisiting them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better for Longer</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation is a notorious battery hog for wireless earbuds and headphones, yet somehow Apple doubled the level of ANC from the AirPods Pro 2 to the Pro 3 and still boosted the battery life to 8 hours of listening time with ANC and 10 hours without. The redesigned MagSafe charging case now has a built-in speaker that makes locating them with the Find My app far easier.</p>
<p>The earbuds themselves received a very subtle but very effective facelift. They’re more streamlined, and the redesign was aimed at a more secure fit in your ear. That’s huge if you’re planning on making the AirPods Pro 3 your go-to source of entertainment while you’re working out, running, or otherwise physically active. The new foam-infused ear tips now come in five sizes, including a new XXS version, which addresses the unpredictability of ear shapes and sizes. Workout and exercise fans will also appreciate the health-monitoring upgrades, including real-time heart-rate monitoring and calories burned count that you can see on your iPhone.</p>



<h2>Sound Investment</h2>
<p>It’s really about the sound, of course, and the AirPods Pro 3 are now packing spatial audio and updated, vastly improved bass. That’s on top of the potent active noise cancellation, so your entire listening experience is getting an upgrade from the Pro 3 earbuds. The hearing aid and hearing test features and live translation? More icing on a really tasty audio cake.</p>
<p>It’s not as if Apple or Amazon are needing to unload a lemon with this deal — the AirPods Pro 3 are very possibly Apple’s best-yet wireless earbuds, and the reviews have been nearly unanimously great. Don’t waste time pondering why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">they’re still at a record-low $199 at Amazon a full month after the holidays</a> — just go buy yourself a pair.</p>
