So let me help you with your upcoming TV purchase by giving you some tips on what to look for in a TV, what’s important, and a recommendation or two if you really don’t want to shop around. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I promise we’ll get you through this process and by the end you’ll have a new shiny TV to play video games on! Or at the very least, you’ll be more informed about what to look for when you or someone you know goes TV shopping. </p><h2 id="h531"><a id="1"></a> 3 Must-Have Features</h2><p>In 2024, there will be a lot of features and options included on the box of all modern TVs. UHD this, VRR that, etc. However, not <em>all</em> of them are equally important to gamers. Here are the three big things to make sure your potential new TV has:</p><h4 id="h532"><a id=""></a><strong>1. A 4K/120hz screen is a must</strong></h4><p>These days, you really should be investing in a 4K/UHD television set. While a 1080p/720p TV set is much, much cheaper in 2024, the price gap is getting smaller and the amount of content designed for 4K is growing rapidly.</p><p>Xbox Series X, PS5, and PS5 Pro all support 4K games and video. Even if you don’t own one of those consoles yet, future devices will all support 4K (or higher) so you’ll want to make sure your TV is future-proof.</p><p>Oh and make sure it’s at least 120HZ so you can play games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Call of Duty</em> at a higher framerate than the standard 60 FPS. This will make your games look silky smooth. It will be hard to go back to 60FPS <em>Fortnite </em>once you play it at 120, trust me.</p><h4 id="h533"><a id=""></a><strong>2. Plenty of HDMI 2.1 ports</strong></h4><p>Playing games at 4K/120 FPS is very awesome, but to do this you’ll need more than just a new fancy TV. You’ll also need to make sure your TV has HDMI 2.1 slots. And preferably more than just one. </p><p>HDMI 2.o only supports 4K/60FPS, meanwhile HDMI 2.1 will let you play games at 4K resolution at 120 FPS, assuming you have a 2.1 cable, too. (The HDMI cable included in your PS5 or Xbox Series console is 2.1 capable, in case you were wondering.) So make sure your next TV has 2.1 ports.</p><p>You might think all new TVs have tons of HDMI 2.1 ports, but you’d be wrong. Many cheaper sets include just two or three HDMI ports. And sometimes only one HDMI 2.1 slot. Or sometimes none! So make sure you look at the box closely and check online that the TV you are eyeing has the proper amount and type of input you need. </p><p>If you have more than two modern consoles and other devices that plug into a TV, like a Blu-Ray player or PC, a lack of HDMI 2.1 ports will quickly be a problem. </p><h4 id="h534"><a id=""></a>3. OLED Or Bust</h4><p>Technically, you can still buy some nice LED/LCD TVs. (They are basically the same thing these days, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/oled-vs-qled&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oled-vs-qled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> explains in this very helpful guide</a></span>.) However, I’d avoid these TVs if you are looking to upgrade your gaming screen. </p><p>LED/LCD screens can’t provide the same high brightness and deep, dark blacks as OLED TVs. Also, if you go too cheap with an LCD/LED TV, you’ll likely get a set that uses edge lighting which will create a halo effect on the outer ridge of your screen. These TVs also have trouble being seen in a bright room and during darker scenes you’ll notice the telltale grey-black in the night sky or in a dark room. OLED, on the other hand, will provide you with pure black night sky and shadows due to the way the pixels can be turned off completely, which provides a much better-looking image. </p><h2 id="h535"><a id="2"></a>2 Nice-To-Have Features</h2><p>Depending on how much you are willing to spend and what you want out of your new TV, here are two features that might be nice to have. </p><h4 id="h536"><a id=""></a>1. VRR (Variable Refresh Rate)</h4><p>If the idea of uncapping a game’s framerate or running it at over 30 but under 60 doesn’t sound appealing to you or confusing, you might not need VRR. If you play games and never notice framerate hiccups or screen tearing, then also, you probably don’t need VRR. </p><p>But if you do care about how smooth your image is and you do like to tinker with visual settings on console or PC games, then VRR is worth looking for in your next TV. The tech basically allows your TV’s display rate to change on the fly to match your content, providing a smoother image. It’s not a miracle worker and really poorly optimized games that drop frames all the time and bounce around from 20 FPS to 50 FPS won’t be smoothed over by VRR, but for many console games that just dip down from 60 FPS to 5oish FPS, this tech will make it harder to spot the drops. </p><h4 id="h537"><a id=""></a>2. A Nice TV Operating System</h4><p>If you plan to only use your TV for gaming, then you’ll not really need to worry about the software it’s running as you’ll just turn it on, boot up your console, and move on with your day. </p><p>But if you plan on watching movies or using smart TV apps like YouTube or Max on your new television, then I’d recommend doing some research on the various OS different sets use. </p><p> Your best bet to figuring out what OS works best for you is to check Reddit and YouTube. Watch videos of people playing around with TV menus and read up on which operating systems are slow and if your desired television is too low-powered to properly run the TV’s software. </p><p>Of all the manufacturers, LG tends to have the best sets and best operating systems. It’s snappy, clean, easy to use, and offers up the options I care about. The LG app store isn’t as big as Roku or Google TV’s offerings, but it does include YouTube and most other “big” apps.</p><h2 id="h538"><a id="3"></a>Some 4K TV Recommendations</h2><p>Okay, maybe you don’t want to do any research and just want me to tell you which TV to buy. I can do that, but I still recommend checking out some basic facts on a TV before buying it. You might be spending $1,000 or more on this thing, so make sure it’s something you actually want! </p><p> Both of my recommendations are LG sets because in my experience (and talking to other TV freaks out there) the company really makes the best, easiest to use, and most reliable 4K televisions currently on the market. </p><p>Anyway, here are my two recommendations. </p><h3 id="h539"><a id=""></a>The “Cheap” Option</h3><p>If you want a solid 4K/120FPS gaming TV and you don’t want to spend over $1,000, then your best bet is probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lg.com/hk_en/tv-soundbars/oled/oled48b4pca/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lg.com/hk_en/tv-soundbars/oled/oled48b4pca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG’s B4 48-inch OLED set</a></span>. It comes with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports and supports VRR tech via Gsync. And LG’s software is nice and snappy. You can usually find this TV selling on Amazon and Best Buy for under $700 and it’s worth it. </p><h3 id="h540"><a id=""></a>The “Expensive” Option</h3><p>If you want a bigger, better TV to play games on, and you don’t mind spending over $1,500 on a TV, then you should probably buy the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65c4pua-oled-4k-tv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65c4pua-oled-4k-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG C4 OLED set</a></span>. So what does the extra $700+ get you over the B4 option above? Well, you get everything the B4 includes, plus a bigger screen as I recommend either the 55-inch or the 65-inch depending on your room. You also get a brighter picture with better contrast, too. And it features a better processor inside which should help with navigating menus, but will also allow the TV to upscale content better. </p><hr><p>Ultimately, either TV is going to likely be a big upgrade over anything that’s been sitting in your gaming room for more than five years. Especially if that TV was a cheaper LCD you bought on a Black Friday sale years ago.</p><p>Really it just comes down to how much you care about little features and how much cash are you willing to spend. Either way, the B4 or the C4 are great options and worth hunting down this holiday season either for yourself or that gamer in your life who keeps complaining about their old TV. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ll see how that all works in-game soon, as Blizzard is making him playable for a brief window this weekend from November 22 to 25, before he’s officially added to the roster in season 14 on December 10.

A lot of these Pokémon likely have high spawn rates in the open world, appear in several areas, and are relatively easy to find, boosting their place on this particular list, without reflecting their actual popularity. For example, Gyarados appears in the list of Pokémon added to the most teams (we’ll break that down next), but neither it nor its pre-evolution Magikarp are among the most-caught water-types.

Game Freak has revealed the 10 Pokémon that appear in most players’ teams. Some of these aren’t too surprising, such as the aforementioned Gyarados and other long-time favorites like Garchomp and Lucario. However, Fletchinder, Pawmi, and Charcadet are a bit more surprising as they are all unevolved members of their evolutionary lines, and indeed Pokémon new to this generation. Still, each was among the most-caught Pokémon in their respective typings, so there’s some expected crossover.</p><p>The most interesting names, however, are the inclusion of Meowscarada and Skeledirge, the final forms of starter Pokémon Sprigatito and Fuecoco. This seems to reveal that the grass and fire starters were the most popular this generation, as no form of Quaxly, the water-type starter in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, appears on the list. Annoyingly enough, Game Freak also includes Floragato and Crocolar, the middle evolution of both of these starters, on the list, which doesn’t tell us much of anything as that just reaffirms people are using those two starters throughout their playthroughs. I have to wonder which two Pokémon were pushed off the top ten list by essentially giving two Pokémon multiple spots in the ranking. The full list:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Gyarados</li><li>Garchomp</li><li>Lucario</li><li>Fletchinder</li><li>Floragato</li><li>Meowscarada</li><li>Crocolar</li><li>Skeledirge</li><li>Pawmi</li><li>Charcadet</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7916ef50d3c59dc3ca0589b6c5095ef" data-recommend-id="image://e7916ef50d3c59dc3ca0589b6c5095ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the most popular Tera Raids in Scarlet and Violet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the most popular Tera Raids in Scarlet and Violet." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7916ef50d3c59dc3ca0589b6c5095ef" data-recommend-id="image://e7916ef50d3c59dc3ca0589b6c5095ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the most popular Tera Raids in Scarlet and Violet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Tera Raids are one of the big post-game grinds you can do in <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, and one of the ways Game Freak has been supporting the RPG post-launch.

Nearly every Pokémon can learn this move, but none of them learn it naturally through leveling up, so statistically speaking, it makes sense that it would be one of the most-used TMs in the game.

Just as you can assign front-facing cards to represent your decks, every Rental Deck has one or two that represent the core of their game plan. These are the twelve currently available highlight cards and the basis for their subsequent decks:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Venusaur ex</li><li>Charizard ex</li><li>Blastoise ex</li><li>Pikachu ex</li><li>Mewtwo ex</li><li>Machamp ex</li><li>Nidoqueen &amp; Nidoking</li><li>Kanto Fossils (Aerodactyl, Kabutops, and Omastar)</li><li>Blaine</li><li>Lt. Surge</li><li>Brock</li><li>Koga</li></ul><p>You’ll receive a notification once you’ve pulled the necessary cards. Head over to the Mission screen and then onto the Deck tab to see the completed missions. Accept the reward to be granted with the related Rental Deck. They should be available to switch to next time you’re about to head into a Solo Battle. If you want to view what cards they have, you’ll need to click on the Decks button on any Battle screen. You cannot view them through the My Cards submenus.</p><h2 id="h99506"><a id="when"></a>Best Time to Use Rental Decks</h2><figure id="" data-id="8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-recommend-id="image://8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-recommend-id="image://8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rental Decks come with two limitations: They can only be used in Solo Battles and they have a limit of ten uses. That might leave you feeling unsure of what their purpose is. What’s the point if you can’t use them online and they’re not permanent options either?</p><p><strong>In my experience, Rental Decks are best used when you’re having trouble in Expert Solo Battles.</strong> These matches are the toughest challenges for those playing against the CPU. They’re even worse if luck hasn’t been on your side and you’re missing out on some key cards. With 25 Shop Tickets up for grabs from Battle Tasks and some decent first-time completion rewards like seven Pack Hourglasses and 200 Shinedust, it’s worth testing these different decks out.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> Has A Staggering 12 Different Currencies, And Counting</a></span></p><p>Another potential use for Rental Decks is during Solo Events, such as the ongoing Lapras ex Drop Event. I haven’t had too much of an issue beating these even on the Expert level, but I’m lucky to have some decent Lightning-type cards. Those who aren’t as lucky can use the Lt. Surge Rental Deck to stand a chance and hopefully nab some cool promo cards. That being said, the Event Stamina isn’t wasted when you lose or concede in these battles. It’s arguably better to just keep trying with the cards you have.</p><p>Speaking of things being wasted, I do want to point out that Rental Decks do not function the same way Event Stamina does. <strong>These aren’t limited by wins but by your uses.</strong> If you lose a match or concede, you will go back to the Battle menu with one less use available. Make sure you’re 100% confident before you use one of these in a match.</p><hr><p>Anyone with a good eye has likely noticed that there is an Expansion button on the Deck Missions screen. It stands to reason that whatever expansion comes next to <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> after Genetic Apex will also have its own premade sets. While the limited ten uses are a little disappointing, I do encourage people to use them. It can be a fun experience trying out new strategies and cards. Plus, even if pulling cards is entirely based on luck, eventually you could rebuild these rental decks on your own.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
