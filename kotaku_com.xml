              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage creates instant panic and wastes hours of your day retracing steps or tearing apart your house. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem by turning everyday items into trackable objects through the <em>Find My</em> network. A single AirTag usually costs $29 but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings a 4-pack down to $64 from the usual $99 price</a>. That’s $16 per tracker instead of $29.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How AirTags Work in Real Life</h2>
<p>Each <strong>AirTag pairs with your iPhone or iPad with just a tap</strong> during setup, and immediately shows up in the Find My app amongst the rest of your Apple devices. An integrated speaker plays a sound whenever you trigger it through the app to help you locate items that are wedged between the couch cushions or deep in your bag. You can also ask Siri where your keys or wallet are, and the associated AirTag will start to beep-beep-beeping without your needing to open any apps.</p>



<p>The real magic happens when your item leaves Bluetooth range which extends about 30 feet in open space. Apple’s Find My network leverages hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs around the world that anonymously detect nearby AirTags and report their location back to you in a crowdsourced way. This kind of tracking works passively in the background on other people’s devices without them knowing or needing to do anything.</p>



<p>Lost Mode is the feature that turns on when you mark an item as missing in the Find My app. Immediately,<strong> the AirTag will alert you when any device in the Find My network detects it</strong>, and that provides real-time updates on where the item might be. You can also include a phone number with the AirTag, allowing a person who finds your lost item simply to tap their iPhone or any other NFC-capable smartphone on it and display your contact information to get in touch with you to return it.</p>
<p>The sharing feature lets <strong>up to five people track a single AirTag</strong>, which is perfect for household items that multiple family members use. Your partner can locate the shared car keys just as easily as you can, and everyone gets notifications if the item gets left behind. Each AirTag runs on a replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts about a year before needing replacement, and the Find My app notifies you when the battery runs low. The<strong> trackers are rated IP67 for water and dust resistance</strong> which means they survive splashes and brief submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At $16 per AirTag in this 4-pack versus $29 individually, you’re getting the coverage you actually need at a price that makes sense.</p>

              <p>Most people can’t justify dropping $2,000 on a laptop, especially when reliable performance for basic tasks like browsing, video calls, and document work will suffice. That’s where HP’s 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop hits (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), right between capability and affordability: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">it’s selling for $626, slashed from its usual price of $1,999</a>. That’s a discount of $1,373 that brings professional-grade specs within reach, and HP sweetens the deal even further with $299 worth of bonus accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Built for Everyday Computing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i3-1315U processor brings six cores to the table: performance cores for handling demanding tasks and efficiency cores for managing background processes. This 12th-generation chip reaches speeds up to 4.5GHz when you need some extra power.</p>



<p>That 32GB of DDR4 RAM is the real game-changer here: Most budget laptops ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you to close applications constantly to avoid lag. This much memory future-proofs the machine by ensuring that it stays fast as software becomes more demanding over the course of several years.</p>
<p>With 1TB SSD storage, you can install your operating system, applications, photos, and videos including a music library without having to go through the inconvenience of deleting files or managing external drives. Solid-state drives load Windows and applications in seconds, while old-school hard drives take minutes.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD screen adds intuitive interaction to your daily workflow. You can tap icons, swipe through photos, pinch to zoom in documents, and scroll through web pages with your fingers. Touch makes Windows 11 feel more natural and instinctive, especially for creative tasks or casual browsing. The HD resolution provides clear text and snappy images for spreadsheets, presentations, and video playback, even if it’s not quite as crisp as Full HD screens on pricier models.</p>
<p>It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro which gives you access to features you don’t find in any Home edition, such as BitLocker encryption to keep sensitive files safe, Remote Desktop to access your laptop from elsewhere, and enhanced security tools designed for business. Thanks to fast charging technology, it gets your battery back to practical levels in a short time and minimizes any downtime when working on the go.</p>
<p>The <strong>$299 accessory kit that accompanies this deal</strong> throws in some practical extras, such as a laptop sleeve to keep it protected on the go, a wireless mouse for easier navigation, and other niceties that would cost you extra otherwise. For $626, this HP laptop gets you the specs and features most people actually need without the premium price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, over 30 developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">were fired from Rockstar Games</a>. A trade labor group claims the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> studio was union busting, but Rockstar Games now claims the employees were leaking sensitive information. The dispute comes just as the long-awaited blockbuster is getting ready to ship in May 2026.</p> <p>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,” a Rockstar spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying the nature of the confidential information that was allegedly disclosed.</p> <p>The ex-Rockstar developers were in a private message group on Discord with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) when they were fired last week for what parent company Take-Two called at the time “gross misconduct.” The IWGB has been seeking to organize developers across various UK-based gaming studios, including <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/"><em>Disco Elysium</em> maker ZA/UM</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><em>MindsEye</em> maker Build a Rocket Boy</a>.</p>

 <p>“Management are showing they don’t care about delays to <em>GTA 6</em>, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game,” IWGB president Alex Marshall told <em>Bloomberg</em> in response to Rockstar’s new allegations. He maintained the fired employees were only discussing issues related to “exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice.”</p> <p>The IWGB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date has already slipped once and some are <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/gta-6-launch-postponed">placing bets</a> that it could miss the new May 26 release date as well. The game has had one of the most secretive development cycles of any major blockbuster, outside of the details leaked in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">an unprecedented hack</a> back in 2022. Since then, Rockstar has only released two official trailers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-begins-black-friday-with-70-off-this-1tb-ssd-windows-laptop-prime-gets-nearly-2300-off-2000641504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-begins-black-friday-with-70-off-this-1tb-ssd-windows-laptop-prime-gets-nearly-2-300-off.1345186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually, finding a laptop that powers everything without slowing down means spending serious money. Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop rewrites that equation completely: This machine packs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">professional-grade specs into a package that now costs $995, down from its typical $3,299 price tag</a>. That is a <strong>$2,304 discount</strong> that brings enterprise-level performance within reach of students and anyone tired of their sluggish laptop holding them back.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Workload</h2>
<p>Inside is an Intel Core 7 150U processor that drives this machine up to 5.4 GHz across 10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. This hybrid architecture essentially means the laptop knows when to unleash full power for demanding tasks and when to dial back for basic browsing, really maximizing both speed and battery life.</p>
<p>The 12 threads enable the processor to juggle multiple operations at one time, so you can render a video while downloading files and streaming music without watching everything grind to a halt.<strong> Intel’s Core 7 also includes dedicated CPU, GPU, and NPU engines</strong> that accelerate AI-powered features in Windows 11.</p>



<p>That <strong>32GB of DDR5 memory</strong> makes a tangible difference in daily use. DDR5 is the latest memory standard that’s faster and more power-efficient than older DDR4. You can have 50 browser tabs open, run Adobe Creative Suite applications and have Spotify playing in the background, then jump between everything in an instant. The 1TB SSD provides ample room for your operating system without needing to constantly manage space or use external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen display runs at a 1920×1200 resolution</strong>, and provides more space vertically than the standard 1920×1080 screens. Those extra 120 pixels make spreadsheets easier to read and mean less scrolling when working with documents. With its 300-nit brightness, the screen can stay visible in bright rooms or near windows, and its anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections that cause eye strain during long work sessions. The touchscreen adds intuitive interaction: pinch fingers to zoom in on photos, swipe through documents, and navigate Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface with your fingers.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include: USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports for legacy peripherals, including mice and external hard drives; a Thunderbolt 4 port that enables 40Gbps data transfer to drives and enables the driving of high-resolution external monitors; an HDMI port suitable for presentations and second screens; and a universal audio jack for headphones.</p>
<p>With this Dell Inspiron laptop, performance that would normally cost three times more is available for 70% off.</p>

              <p>Apple doesn’t usually advertise big discounts on its own website but the company quietly drops deals through Amazon from time to time. The MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage (which launched in March 2025) is no exception to this pattern. For the first time ever, a MacBook Air this recent is getting a serious price cut just months after its release: We saw it hit $799 during Prime Day, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings it down to $749 which marks a brand new all-time low from its original $999 price tag</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Right MacBook for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>This is no ordinary laptop refresh: The 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip is <strong>Apple’s first consumer machine built from scratch for Apple Intelligence</strong>, the suite of AI-powered features transforming how you’ll interact with your Mac. The <strong>Retina display on this 13.6-inch gadget</strong> shows sharp text and brilliant colors at a resolution of 2560×1664, with 500 nits of brightness that makes everything from spreadsheets to Netflix binges look crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Beneath the cool Midnight aluminum chassis, you’ll find 16 GB of unified memory: <strong>That’s double what Apple offered in the base models</strong> until recently. That matters because unified memory is a little different from traditional RAM. It’s shared between the CPU and GPU so that both have instant access to the same pool of fast memory, without having to copy data back and forth. What this practically means is that you can keep dozens of browser tabs open, edit large photos, run many apps at once, and get zero slowdown. The 256GB SSD storage offers you enough room for your OS, most essential apps and a solid collection of files.</p>
<p>The M4 chip itself is a beast for everyday computing and <strong>touts an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU on a 3-nanometer process</strong> that handle everything from web browsing up to light video editing without breaking a sweat. You get up to 18 hours of web browsing and up to 15 hours of video playback from one charge, which means you really can work all day long without having to hunt down an outlet. The<strong> chip also contains a 16-core Neural Engine</strong> that’s exclusively designed to accelerate machine learning tasks, powering features such as real-time language translation, advanced photo editing and Apple Intelligence capabilities.</p>



<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera sits centered above the display and keeps you in frame during video calls: As you move around, the camera pans and zooms to follow you, making remote meetings feel more natural and professional. Touch ID is integrated into the keyboard, allowing you to unlock your Mac, authenticate purchases, and switch between user accounts using only your fingerprint<strong>. Two Thunderbolt USB 4 ports provide transfer speeds up to 40Gbps</strong>, support for external displays up to 6K resolution, as well as fast charging.</p>
<p>Weighing in at just 2.7 pounds and 0.44 inches thin, the MacBook Air slips into any bag without adding noticeable weight to your daily carry.</p>
<p>And you’re getting a machine at $749 that should stay relevant for years to come, with Apple’s history of providing software updates for seven years or more.</p>
