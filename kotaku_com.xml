            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, June 23, marked the 25th anniversary of what can convincingly be described as one of the best games of all time. <em>Deus Ex</em>, created by the distinct Austin branch of John Romero’s controversial studio Ion Storm, was a first-person RPG that would change how an entire generation of players and developers thought about video games. It was a game that was built from depths: depths of skill, knowledge, intelligence and narrative. It remains exactly as brilliant today as it was a quarter of a century ago.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196572" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="94" data-playlist="196572,196742,196049" data-current="196572"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22127.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In fact, it works better today than it did ten years back.

A decade ago, doing this required installing a handful of different mods, and there was no way to actually play it in its vanilla version. And right away, I was pulled back in, crazy clip-cloppy footstep sound effects and everything.

I feel like I could spend a dozen articles answering that question. In fact, ten years back, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-deus-ex-still-the-best-game-ever&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-deus-ex-still-the-best-game-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote six in a row</a></span> when revisiting the game. It’s a combination of so many factors coming together so superbly, with a dream team of developers, financial backing, an exquisitely good story, and a complete lack of expectation from its future audience.</p><p>In 1996, when the economy was booming in preparation for the colossal bursting of the dot-com bubble, John Romero and Tom Hall, flush with success from id Software and its massive gaming series <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em>, set out to create a new Texan developer: Ion Storm. Together, they spent lavishly, fought explosively, and created two compellingly dreadful games. First was <em>Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3</em>, and then the infamously disastrous FPS <em>Daikatana</em>. However, alongside all this, former Looking Glass (<em>Thief</em>, <em>System Shock</em>) developer Warren Ellis had been asked to create a parallel studio, Ion Storm Austin.</p><p>Distinct from Romero’s Dallas studio, Ellis had creative freedom and a pool of money, and quickly hired talent he knew from his days at Looking Glass, including Harvey Smith (<em>Dishonored</em>). In just 28 months, a tiny team of 20 pulled together (albeit with production troubles, serious frustrations, and “knock-down drag-out fights”) one of the most immersive, intricate games the world has ever known.</p><figure id="" data-id="ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-recommend-id="image://ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-recommend-id="image://ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the original <em>Deus Ex</em>, before its unfairly maligned Xbox-led sequel and its goth-eyed post-2010 prequels, you play as JC Denton, a cybernetically augmented human who works for a government agency called UNATCO. He discovers his brother Paul is working for a terrorist organization, the NSF, all amidst a global pandemic called the Grey Death. Very quickly, your assumptions about good and bad, right and wrong, are questioned, and you’re drawn into an intricate web of conspiracies and conflicting alliances.</p><p>This plays out...kinda how you want it to! There’s obviously a core, unavoidable plot, but how you approach it will dramatically affect the story you allow yourself to be told. It can be an ultra-violent FPS, where you blast through enemies with rockets and explosives, or a super-spy sim as you assassinate opponents, or you can be an unseen stealth pacifist, determined to kill no one, relying entirely on tranquilizers and stun guns. Every mission can be approached in multiple fashions, from spectacularly smashing through the roof of a building for an all-out gun fight, to slipping in through the vents such that no one ever knew you were there.</p><figure id="" data-id="6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-recommend-id="image://6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-format="jpg" data-width="2002" data-height="1127" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-recommend-id="image://6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-format="jpg" data-width="2002" data-height="1127" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve told this anecdote too many times before, so apologies, but it captures the essence of what makes <em>Deus Ex</em> quite so extraordinary: At the time of its 2000 release, I was writing for the UK version of <em>PC Gamer</em>, where the reviews editor was one Kieron Gillen (now best known for his comics work, but once my colleague at <em>RPS</em>). Gillen had played the game for his world-class review (I’d link to it, but Future Publishing treats people’s efforts to archive its magazines with hostility—instead I’m copying out of my physical edition), which contained the words:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Games—like most other forms of entertainment—have a terrible habit of making you less than you are normally, simplifying you into a stripped-down cartoon...<em>Deus Ex</em> is one of the few games that succeeds in making you more than you are. Because <em>Deus Ex</em>’s universe is, obviously, reduced, you feel as if you have more freedom than you do in reality, which, like <em>Fight Club </em>for example, reminds you of your own freedom in reality. It’s a slap in the face, it reminds us how good videoart can be. And this <em>is</em> art. It’s beautiful. And I’m going to stop now before I start to cry...</p></blockquote><p>I was playing it soon after, and occasionally calling Kieron to chat about what was happening. On one call I said to him, “I couldn’t believe it when my brother died.”</p><p>“My brother didn’t die!” Kieron responded in bemusement. And then we both had a moment in silence, realizing that this game was offering even more than we’d already thought.</p><p><em>Deus Ex </em>was a game in which the finest details rung with intelligence, in which every book you found contained provocative ideas or conflicting philosophies, in which characters responded to you in subtly different ways depending upon how you were playing the game; on this micro level it felt malleable and responsive to you and how you reacted to it. But to discover that it was also offering the same flexibility to massive story beats was just mindblowing.</p><figure id="" data-id="0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-recommend-id="image://0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-recommend-id="image://0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game’s influence on the industry is impossible to overstate. While the circumstances and relative creative freedom afforded to its development are extremely hard to come by twenty-five years on, you can see the game’s DNA in so many of the games we love today. Even beyond the more obvious, all the immersive sims born in its shadow (<em>BioShock</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Prey...</em>), so many developers cite <em>Deus Ex</em> as a major source. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s quest director Mateusz Tomaskiewicz named <em>Deus Ex</em> when asked for his main inspirations. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-quest-director-says-deus-ex-was-a-big-inspiration-and-not-just-the-sunglasses/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-quest-director-says-deus-ex-was-a-big-inspiration-and-not-just-the-sunglasses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>GamesRadar</em></a></span> he said,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This one had a great impact on me as a developer and player back when I played it for the first time many years ago. And what I really liked about that game was completing the missions in many ways. It was not only based on dialogue decisions, since you also had the things that were on the map and its different points of entry that allowed you to get into buildings, as well as elements that opened different paths in history.</p></blockquote><p>But most importantly, it’s still a hell of a game to play today. Sure, its art is a bit crummy—it was criticized for this when it was released! God, those wall textures. But it matters so very, very little once you’re deep in its story, learning what it has to teach, reacting against what you find abhorrent, embracing what draws you in. (I’ll never forget my moment of pure horror when, working as a youth worker as I also was during the game’s release, one of the teenagers told me how furious he was about being forced to leave UNATCO, as to him they were clearly the good guys. Uh-oh.) </p><p>It’s currently just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.49 on GOG</a></span> (although it often comes down to a lot less than that on both GOG and Steam), and if you’ve never played it, then prepare to have your life properly, actually changed.</p><p>Happy birthday, <em>Deus Ex</em>! Thanks for changing my life too.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985]]></content:encoded>

While Microsoft claimed that no games were canceled in that most recent round of layoffs, developers at studios like <em>State of Decay 3</em> maker Undead Labs were impacted.</p><p>The ongoing cuts come at the tail end of an acquisition spree that culminated in buying <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em> maker Activision Blizzard for $70 billion. The Xbox portfolio now constitutes the biggest gaming content publisher in the world, but at the cost of greater scrutiny and revenue expectations. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who usually prefers to talk about his favorite new games, has deflected blowback for the cuts over the last year by reiterating his responsibility to keep Xbox profitable. </p><p>  “Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest earlier this month</a></span> right after Xbox’s big summer showcase. “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because it is kind of we are the business that we are.”</p><p>The result has been not only bringing major first-party games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> to PS5, but also raising prices. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will be the company’s first $80 game this fall, and the price of the Xbox Series X/S recently spiked due to new tariffs amid Trump’s ongoing trade war with China. It feels like only a matter of time before Game Pass Ultimate, currently $20 a month, also goes up in price again.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-prices-layoffs-next-gen-hardware-ps5-1851784992]]></content:encoded>
