              <p>One of the main things that’s distinguished Nintendo 64 clone the M64 from rival device the Analogue 3D, beyond being sold <a href="https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895">by an international arms dealer</a>, was its playful shape and colorful, translucent shell. But now Analogue has revealed its own translucent variants. There’s competition to see not just which device can run Nintendo 64 games the best but also which one looks the coolest. And not everyone’s happy about it.</p> <p>There are some other important differences between the M64 and Analogue 3D, however. Fully revealed over Black Friday weekend, ModRetro’s M64 is $200 compared to the $250 for the base Analogue 3D (matte black or white) and it features compatible controllers that are actually shaped like the old N64 ones (Analogue’s look like their existing 8Bitdo line-up). The other important difference, of course, is that the M64 isn’t shipping yet (there’s a <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/m64-green">waitlist you can sign-up for</a>). The Analogue 3D is already out.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The body is ready!  We can finally show the final design of the M64.  Three translucent colors are in manufacturing right now, more than a dozen on the way – goes on sale online and retail soon, we are releasing upcoming colors as easily swappable low-cost body kits! <a href="https://t.co/CnbTSKf7yd">https://t.co/CnbTSKf7yd</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1994584120739950925?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But today, Analogue revealed the “Funtastic” variant of the 3D in “highly limited quantities.” This translucent version comes in eight different colors ranging from “Watermelon” magenta to see-through gold. Pre-orders go up on <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-funtastic">December 10 at 11:00 a.m. ET,</a> and the Funtastic versions will cost $50 extra, rounding out the total price to $300. And that’s before adding on the new translucent controller variants which match the material and color of the consoles. These come separately at $45 each.</p>

 <p>Understandably, some people who’d already pre-ordered one of the existing Analogue 3D consoles in black or white are pissed off. “I just got mine, and now you drop these awesome colors?” wrote one owner. “Seriously? It feels like a slap in the face to early supporters. And yes, I’m reposting because your previous post disappeared.”</p>

 <p>Another wrote, “Why on earth didn’t you launch with this? instead, you announce it a few weeks after the 7 day return window for those who pre-ordered. what a convenient cash grab.” At least a few recent Analogue 3D purchasers say they’re going to try to get a refund anyway.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nah this is bs straight up. Delay console for nearly 2 years and pull a rug under us early adopters who waited patiently only to see you released funtastic colors nearly 2 weeks after everyone is getting their white and black units..</p> <p>— Kodaxx (@Kodaxx88) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kodaxx88/status/1998089537499881745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It is an odd move for a boutique retro gaming company that often skirts the line between fan hype and hyperbolic marketing. Analogue has a record of releasing alternative color schemes for its hardware. The company’s earlier Pockets eventually came out with all sorts of versions that channeled different aesthetic eras of the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. Those didn’t get announced immediately after the initial launch, however.</p> <p>Part of the issue might be the Analogue 3D’s repeated delays this year. It was supposed to launch much earlier than it did, with mysterious manufacturing and shipping challenges, including likely hiccups around the president’s trade war with China, gumming up the original timeline. If so, however, it’s still unclear why the announcement of the “Funtastic” variants wasn’t pushed back to compensate.</p>

              <p>Court documents from a false advertising lawsuit filed against Lucasfilm Games and Aspyr over the failure to integrate a previously promised and popular fan mod into the Switch port of<em> Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</em> reveal something we didn’t know about: Lucasfilm was planning on making a<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake. And it might still be happening.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-gets-ps5-remake-1847646267">In 2021, Lucasfilm and Aspyr announced that a <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> remake</a> was in development. Then the RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-knights-republic-kotor-remake-ps5-canceled-1850885369">seemingly nuked from the internet in 2023, leading some to worry it was dead.</a> Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-interactive-joins-development-of-star-wars-kotor-remake">co-developer Saber Interactive</a> saying the project was alive and well <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">in 2024,</a> there has been mostly radio silence about the remake of one of the highest-reviewed <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made. And now, court docs indicate that its sequel was, and maybe still is, getting a similar remake.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney">As reported by <em>GameFile</em> on December 8</a>, court documents involved in a false advertising lawsuit against Aspyr and Lucasfilm include the mention of a “Project Juliet,” which is confirmed in a deposition with <span dir="ltr" role="presentation"> Lucasfilm Games </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">vice president Douglas Reilly to be a<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake. As pointed out by <em>GameFile</em>, the Switch port of<em> KOTOR 2</em> was codenamed “Capulet.” Here’s what Riley had to say about the project: </span></p>

 <p>“Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of <em>KOTOR 2</em>&nbsp;with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of <em>KOTOR 2</em>, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr.”</p>

 <p>When asked by a lawyer if the plan was to remake content featured in the fan-developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sith_Lords_Restored_Content_Modification"><em>KOTOR 2</em> Restored Content Mod</a>, Riley confirmed that was indeed the plan.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that’s all we got on this <em>KOTOR 2</em> remake. <em>GameFile’s</em> Stephen Totilo can’t confirm the status of the remake as of December 2025. The deposition cited above happened in March. At that time, Riley explained that the<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake was “<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">technically on the road map” but that the plan was to start with a remake of <em>KOTOR</em>, as previously announced. Riley also said that Aspyr is no longer working on either remake and instead Saber-owned Mad Head games was or is now handling development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>All mentioned parties and companies were contacted by <em>GameFile</em>, but didn’t respond or declined to comment. That means that, for now at least, we don’t really know what happened to either remake. It sounds like they are both still happening in some form, but until Disney or Lucasfilm confirms either way, fans will be left waiting to find out more about what will happen to these remakes of two of the most popular <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made.</p>
