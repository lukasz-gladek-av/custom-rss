            <title><![CDATA[The AI-Fueled PC Gaming Shortage Just Delayed Valve’s Steam Machine]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">The Steam Machine</a>, Valve’s ambitious new venture into living room console gaming, was supposed to begin shipping in “early” 2026. That’s no longer the case. The company announced on Wednesday that its original launch plans have been pushed back to later in the year due to memory and storage shortages as companies race to pivot to AI.</p> <p>“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” Valve wrote in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583">February 4 blog post</a>. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”</p>

 <p>The plan is still to ship the Steam Machine, a new Steam controller, and the new Steam Frame VR headset within the first half of 2026. That suggests the first units should still arrive in players’ hands sometime before June 30. But Valve adds that market conditions are currently shifting too quickly to confirm “concrete pricing and launch dates” at the start of 2026 as previously planned.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">First revealed back in November</a>, the Steam Machine is a small cube-shaped console with PC gaming specs somewhere between a PlayStation 5 and a PS5 Pro. The device is targeting the most common specs of the average Steam user with the goal of playing most games at 4K 60FPS with FSR enabled. This has led to lots of speculation about how much the device might actually cost, with Valve confirming it’s not planning to sell Steam Machines at a loss and declining to say whether it will be close to the current average console price of $500.</p>

 <p>And that was before PC components from RAM to graphics cards started significantly increasing in price as part supplies are monopolized by companies investing in AI datacenters. Employees at retailers like <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">GameStop and Target</a> have showed SSDs for PS5s and other upgrades spiking in price overnight, and some companies have shifted out of the consumer market altogether. While Valve seems to be waiting to see if things calm down at all, there’s no indication yet that this isn’t just the new normal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Blizzard Says It’s Been Making Overwatch Heroes Hotter]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-heroes-characters-hotter-young-skins-collab-2000665796</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Over the years </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s heroes</span></a><span>, which once included characters of various ages and (sometimes) shapes and sizes, have largely started conforming to a particular trend. Nowadays, a lot of its heroes are what most people would consider conventionally attractive, young, and ripe for dressing up in crossover skins. Why is this? Well, some fans theorize that it’s for the obvious draw that comes with putting hot people in your game, but Blizzard says there’s actually a little more to it than that.</span></p>  <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-overwatch-characters-have-been-getting-sexier-but-not-for-the-obvious-reason/1100-6537888/"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>senior producer Kenny Hudson was asked about whether or not this trend has taken hold of the game’s hero roster, with even four of its five upcoming heroes seeming to fit the bill as the game heads into its revamp next week with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>a new Season One</span></a><span>. According to him, it’s because such characters make designing skins easier, as opposed to doing so for characters like the robot-piloting hamster Wrecking Ball, which puts the team in “crisis” mode.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Something that we kind of look into when we’re doing our heroes is how can we make them unique, but still give them a good platform, proportionally, height, scale proportion to not only build cosmetics for them and future-proof things, but to stop the technical hurdles of other things,” Hudson said. “So, one of the things that really helps with that is if you give longer limbs, taller legs, a bigger core, it actually makes it easier for our artists to physically put new geometry on those models. And so, that’s how it kind of turns out.”</span></p> <p><span>Art director Dion Rogers gave us a similar answer when we asked </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-collab-skins-mercy-kiriko-juno-lucio-sanrio-2000665321"><span>why some characters get more skins than others</span></a><span>, saying that some of the collaboration skins the team designed were just easier to put on characters like Mercy or Kiriko. However, the team is hoping that that will be changing in 2026 and it can get back to more “oddball” heroes.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Now we’re in this realm where we can make more Jetpack Cats because we’ve learned all these lessons,” Hudson said.</span></p> <p><span>After </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from its name</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is getting a bit of a reboot next week on February 10, with a new season, story content, and five new heroes all dropping on day one.</span></p>

              <p>One of the creators behind <em>Doom</em> and one of the lead developers directing the franchise today replied to a terminally ill fan’s touching post about how he’s spending his final weeks alive playing <em>Doom Eternal</em> on a PS5 in a hospital room.</p> <p>On January 31, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/1qsei9w/my_days_are_nearing_and_my_local_hospital_allowed/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php">Wanderingrader123 posted a sad but powerful story to Reddit</a> explaining that he has been battling Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer since 2022. However, his situation hasn’t improved, and doctors say he possibly only has weeks to live. The Toronto hospital he is in offered to fulfill any request he had during his remaining time, and he asked if you could play <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839">2025’s <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a><em>,</em> saying he’s been a fan of the series since 2016, and the reboot and sequel, <em>Doom Eternal</em>, have helped him through some “tough times.” However, due to “financial issues” he has been unable to play through <em>Dark Ages.</em> Thankfully, the hospital got him a PS5 and a copy of the game, and he’s currently ripping and tearing his way through it.</p>

 <p>“I may not live to see the upcoming DLC, but I am nonetheless happy to finally play the game in my own hands,” said Wanderingrader123. “To the developers of ID Software, thank you for bringing such a beautiful piece of art that not only brought the FPS genre to its roots, but also revitalize and reinvented the wheel that no other game could. Not only that, but thank you for crafting such an awesome series for a fan like me.”</p>   <p>His post and story caught the attention of id game director Hugo Martin, who has served as the lead developer on the recent <em>Doom</em> games, including<em> Dark Ages.</em></p>

 <p>“Thank you so much for your support and know that all of id salutes you brother,” replied Martin on Reddit. “I tell the team all the time, people care about our games, we have to put the same amount of care into making them. It has been the honor of our professional lives making these past three games for fans like you. To make the Slayer feel STRONG in <em>DOOM</em>, we infuse him with all the attributes of a true old school hero: we give him strength, courage and heart… we make him like you. RIP AND TEAR, my friend. You are the real Slayer.”</p>

 <p>Wanderingrader123’s bittersweet post also caught the attention of John Romero himself, one of the original developers who helped create <em>Doom</em> and id Software back in the 1990s.</p> <p>“I am so moved and honored that you carried <em>DOOM</em> with you for a decade and chose to live in <em>DOOM</em> as your journey nears its end,” posted Romero. “You are the definition of bravery and courage. You are the reason <em>DOOM</em> exists.”</p> <p>“When we made <em>DOOM</em>, we wanted to create a world where you felt powerful even in the face of overwhelming odds. Knowing that it has been a companion to you, something familiar, something steady, something alive, means more to me than I can properly put into words. You are not alone in that hospital room. You are standing in a place millions of us have stood, fighting. Every enemy, every level, every moment matters because you do. Thank you for sharing this part of your life with us. Thank you for bringing <em>DOOM</em> with you. Rip and tear—with love and respect.”</p>

 <p>Beyond these <em>Doom</em> devs, the wider <em>Doom</em> community replied to Wanderingrader123’s post, sharing words of encouragement and commending the poster for his bravery.&nbsp; The outpouring of love and support led to Wanderingrader123 responding. Here’s his full reply:</p> <blockquote><p>“I want to thank you all for the kind support you have given over in the past 24 hours. I’ll admit, I was very hesitant and reluctant even to make such a post due to the nature of my condition. No amount of words can describe the overwhelming kindness you have given me since I posted. Not only from the fans but to also the developers as well. I have recieved massive amounts of DMs, which I am incredibly grateful of, though, I won’t be able to get through most. Still, I am grateful nonetheless. It is an extreme privilege to be in a welcoming community such as r/<em>Doom</em> and be able to share this post. I am currently having a blast beating up demons with the flail.”</p> <p>“And for people wondering, I am actually in the Toronto General Hospital in Downtown, Toronto, Ontario. But for the sake of both my privacy and my family, I will not divulge my location further than that. Please and thank you for respecting my privacy, as well as the massive support. I will use the time that I have left to not only enjoy myself but to also spend time with my family and friends. Thank you again, everyone!”</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo investors are taking <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s sales struggle hard.<em> Maybe Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Switch 2 can turn things around. And who is left to lead <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. I’m still bummed about <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-avowed-obsidian-rpgs-sales-outer-worlds-3-2000665352">yesterday’s report that <em>The Outer Worlds</em> franchise</a> is essentially on ice after last year’s entry struggled to sell. It’s an exceptionally solid immersive sim RPG that feels like it’s on the verge of being something truly special. But those <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">30-percent profit margins</a> on games given away for free on Game Pass are a killer.</p> <h2>Nintendo gets hammered</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many Japanese gaming companies' stocks took a big hit in the Japanese stock market today! via <a href="https://twitter.com/serkantoto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@serkantoto</a> </p> <p>• Nintendo -12.3%<br>• Capcom -9.1%<br>• Konami -7.7%<br>• Koei Tecmo -6.3%<br>• Sony -4.2%<br>• Kadokawa (FromSoftware parent) -3.9%<br>• Square Enix -3.4%<br>• Bandai Namco -3.4%<br>•… <a href="https://t.co/tnJuY2cZHG">https://t.co/tnJuY2cZHG</a> <a href="https://t.co/WxWBGrA4hq">pic.twitter.com/WxWBGrA4hq</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019025986139148481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Mario maker’s share price in Japan dropped 11 percent this week over worse-than-expected profitability despite the Switch 2 continuing to be a launch-year juggernaut. Fans might think the concerns stem from questions about the new device’s mixed year-one lineup, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/nintendo-dives-10-after-disappointing-profit-spurs-margin-fears">but <em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that it comes down to worries about increasing production costs and pressure from U.S. tariffs.</p>

 <p>But it’s not the only video game stock getting crushed. Many publishers continue to be down days after Google’s new Genie AI tool rollout <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594">sent share prices spiraling</a>. While Nintendo is the hardest hit, Capcom and Konami are all suffering as well, not to mention Roblox, Unity, and even Take-Two in the U.S.</p> <h2>Another <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> veteran is out</h2> <p>Luc Couture has been a level designer on the stealth action franchise since the beginning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-veteran-designer-leaves-ubisoft-two-decades/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>. “Today was my last day at Ubisoft Montreal,”&nbsp;he wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424588173462183936/">on LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;“It’s been an incredible journey that lasted more than 20 years….During that time, I have learned a lot about game development, relationships and myself. I even met my wife and mother of my children because of Ubisoft colleague…so how blessed am I….right? But I was recently in need for some change. So that’s why I will soon pivot to tackling new challenges as part of a smaller studio with other veterans. Times are exciting.”</p>
