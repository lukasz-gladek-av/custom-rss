            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is out now on PC via Steam and the Epic Store. And the looter shooter sequel is already the biggest <em>Borderlands</em> launch on Steam, with over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/">200,000 concurrent</a> players just a few hours after its release. But reviews on Steam aren’t great, as many players are struggling to even play the co-op FPS.</p> <p>On September 11, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched on PC. The long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">Gearbox’s<em> Borderlands 3</em></a> is a bigger, better, and wilder experience than the previous game, featuring a host of smart changes and additions to the classic looting-shooting formula. However, that’s only the case if you can actually play the game and enjoy it. And on PC, players are reporting lots of performance issues, even on hardware that Gearbox listed as meeting the needed specs.</p> <p>As of 4:30 pm EST on Steam, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Borderlands 4</a></em> has about 2,000 reviews that are perfectly divided between negative and positive, giving the game a 50 percent mixed status. That’s no good! Scrolling through reviews, the biggest complaints seem to be not about the content of the game, but about how poorly it performs on various hardware setups. Players are also complaining about stuttering and hitching, or being forced to use DLSS to play the game at a stable framerate. Others can’t even boot the game up, reporting crashes before they even get into the action.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are also plenty of reviews from people saying they had no issues at all and claiming that people complaining need to upgrade their PCs. This is the internet, so of course it devolved into a war with various sides and factions.</p> <p>In the reviews on Steam, the most popular culprits people are blaming for the bad performance include Unreal Engine 5 and DRM protection software Denuvo. Over the last year or so, Unreal Engine 5 has become a target online as players believe the engine isn’t well-suited to big games and is hard to optimize. The complaints have gotten so loud online that <a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-remake-capcom-2000620968#:~:text=Epic%20boss%20says,can%20step%20in.%E2%80%9D">Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a> even stepped in recently to defend the engine and lay the blame on devs who aren’t focused on optimization early enough in the cycle.</p>

 <h2>My experience playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC</h2> <p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> on PC for the last week, and my experience has been up and down. When I first got the game, I was playing on an RTX 3070 and struggled to run it at 1080p at 60FPS. I upgraded my rig to an RTX 5070 (something I had been planning to do for a few months now), and <em>Borderlands 4</em> ran much better. However, I still found that I needed to run the game with DLSS on and frame gen to reach 120 FPS at 1080 with some settings kicked down to medium.&nbsp; Considering the specs in the machine, I was surprised by how power hungry the game is, and I’ll admit that I continue to be disappointed with Unreal Engine 5 games.</p> <p>That said, ever since I found some settings that worked and downloaded the latest drivers, which weren’t available when I first got access to the game, I’ve been having a great time playing the game on PC. It mostly locks to 120 with my current settings and setup, and it feels great. I should also point out, though, that there’s been some chatter indicating that the day-one patch for the game, which arrived shortly before launch, may have caused problems that weren’t present when critics and content creators were playing it pre-release. In my quick tests, I’ve found the most recent patch, the one people are playing with on Steam right now, seems to bring with it some issues that weren’t present before the day-one patch. But I need to play more to really see if things are broken.</p> <p>I hope Gearbox issues a patch on PC soon to help improve things a bit. Or at the very least, get rid of Denuvo ASAP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have you seen this guy on TikTok playing games in the most serene places imaginable? <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thescenicgamer">The Scenic Gamer</a> travels all over playing games with iconic locations while he is set up in their real-life counterparts (or the closest thing he can find to it). He’s slaying <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>at the beach and&nbsp;<em>Firewatch</em> in the center of Yellowstone National Park — all on an old Toshiba CRT. Dude’s living the dream. But how’s he managing to power that TV and Nintendo GameCube without an outlet for miles? If you want to follow in his footsteps, <strong>you’ll need portable power station such as the Anker 521</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">The mini generator is normally listed at $200, but for a limited time you can get it for 20% off.</a> That brings the price down by $40 so you only have to pay $160.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Anker 521 portable power station comes equipped with six different ports to supply you with all your power needs when out in the wild. Along the front of the unit, you’ll find two AC ports, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a car outlet. You can recharge or power up to six devices at once.</p>

<p>The power station is capable of fast, reliable charging. The Anker 521 can keep a 40W mini fridge running for over five hours. Keep a fan going for nearly six. Or recharge a 13Wh camera more than 15 times over. A 12Wh smartphone can be brought back from zero to 100% 16.5 times over. Power times can be extended further by using power-saving mode. Featured on the front of the power station is a LED display providing info on the power output and remaining battery life of the anker 521 itself.</p>



<h2>Optional Solar Panel</h2>
<p>Then when the power station itself needs a recharge, it can be brought back up to at least 80% in just two and a half hours when plugged into the adapter that’s packaged with it. If you’re taking the power station on an extended getaway in the outdoors, you can also recharge it via solar energy. As an optional add-on, you can bundle your Anker 521 with a 100W solar panel. It can be adjusted to four different angles so you can maximize the energy it’s able to take in based on the sun’s position overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">For a limited time, you can save 20% on the Anker 521, grabbing it for just $160.</a> If you choose to bundle with the solar panel, it’s 30% off from $499 which brings it to just $350.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The next <em>Mario Bros.</em> movie is out April 2026 and it still doesn’t have an official title. Unofficially, however, the titles has seemingly leaked thanks to recently registered domain names, and all signs point to a riff on <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476">Per Wario64</a>, the domain name supermariogalaxy.movie was registered by NBCUniversal earlier this month, followed by&nbsp;supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com and supermariogalaxy-lapelicula.com on September 10. They <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/">redirect to Universal’s homepage</a> and match up with the conventions used for the domains for the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/EHknBYD082">https://t.co/EHknBYD082</a> (Super Mario Galaxy film) domain also registered by NBC Universal on Sept 3rd.</p> <p>For the first movie, Universal used <a href="https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS">https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS</a> for the movie's website (now points to VOD/Disc links since it's been out for years) <a href="https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI">https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI</a> <a href="https://t.co/2uvjPnIwJQ">pic.twitter.com/2uvjPnIwJQ</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This backs up a leak from months ago when a photo of labels featuring the title <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> on Old Spice deodorant <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1m2k08v/super_mario_2_old_spice_leak/">started making the rounds online</a>. It wasn’t clear at the time if it was an elaborate fake or not, though the renders showing Yoshi and Luigi looked authentic. The latest information about the domain names suggests it was legit.</p>

 <p>“Can’t believe that the <em>Mario</em> movie sequence was leaked by an Old Spice merch, of all things,” the YouTube account NintendoFan <a href="https://x.com/NFan_Official/status/1966200638213337371">posted on X</a>. “What a crazy timeline! I loved Yoshi’s look on that little can. Now it’s just a matter of waiting to see it in 4K.”</p> <p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> ended with Bowser defeated and Mario and Luigi returning to their lives in Brooklyn while a post-credits sequent revealed a hatching Yoshi egg somewhere in the sewers. There weren’t any other strong leads on where the second movie would take things, but the apparent title suggests at the very least the gang is headed into space. Maybe to try and find a home for Yoshi?</p>

   <p>2007’s <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> for the Wii sees the plumber hopping from planet to planet in order to free magical stars for Rosalina’s ship, called the Comet Observatory, which got messed up by Bowser. The game features a star character, Lumalee, who already appeared in the first movie. At the same time, <em>The Super </em><em>Mario Bros. Movie</em> was a reimagining of the series lore more than a remix of it, so <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> will likely have its own twist on the elements of the game, if it borrows directly from them at all.</p> <p>One last thing worth noting is that the Old Spice art showed a Tostarenan from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> hanging behind Luigi. So whatever Nintendo and Minions studio Illumination Entertainment are planning, it’s likely much bigger than any one <em>Mario</em> game. The second movie hits theaters on April 3, 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-makes-11-fantastic-changes-and-3-that-ain%E2%80%99t-great.1295172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launches on September 12 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Gearbox’s open-world looter-shooter sequel is a big game with a lot of quests to complete and plenty of endgame content to check out. As such, my review isn’t ready yet. But I’ve played nearly 40 hours so far, and I’ve enjoyed my time. A big reason why is that Gearbox has made some smart changes in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that make it easier than ever to manage, sell, and collect loot and get around the world.</p> <p>As a big <em>Borderlands</em> fan who has played all of the games multiple times, I have cataloged a list of changes and improvements in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that I think both longtime fans and newcomers alike are going to be excited about.</p> <h2>Finally, A Weapon Wheel</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624984"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624984">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For many, many years now, <em>Borderlands</em> fans, myself included, have longed for the franchise to add a real weapon wheel option. Past games have sometimes allowed you to use the d-pad on a controller to hot-swap between four guns, which is fine, I guess. But a true weapon wheel hasn’t been an option until now. <em>Borderlands 4</em> finally adds a real, honest-to-goodness weapon wheel, and it’s so nice. It makes quickly swapping to a gun easier and faster than ever!</p>

 <h2>Mark Loot As Junk When Picking Up</h2> <p>In <em>Borderlands 4</em>, like in past games, you’ll spend a lot of time collecting guns that are bad, or just not what you want. In the past, you’d have to manually sell each of these. And yes, you could mark them as loot in the inventory screen and then sell them all at once. But now, in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-everything-pre-order-dlc-release-date-time-ps5-switch-2-crossplay-2000624090"><em>Borderlands 4</em>,</a> you can junk loot as you pick it up. This ties into another great change…</p> <h2>Instantly Sell Junk At Vending Machines</h2> <p>All that loot you mark as junk can now be sold at any vending machine just by walking up and hitting a single button. You don’t even have to go into the store screen. It’s so nice, and this change, as well as the last one, has helped keep my inventory mostly empty and ready for more loot.</p>

 <h2>The Lost Loot Menu Is So Much Better</h2> <p>Speaking of loot, in some past <em>Borderlands</em> games, players were able to return to a hub area and activate a “Lost Loot” machine that would spit out some of the guns that dropped out in the world that the player didn’t pick up. This wasn’t a very efficient way to handle the process and made using the Lost Loot option annoying. In <em>Borderlands 4,</em> this is now handled through a menu screen that lets you easily trash stuff you don’t want and take stuff you do want.&nbsp; And you can hit a button to take it all without having to grab each item off the floor.</p> <h2>A Warning When Selling Equipped Gear And Guns</h2> <p>Sometimes, when dealing with lots of loot and similar guns, it’s easy to mark an equipped piece of loot as junk and sell it. This has happened to me in past games. Sure, you could favorite stuff you didn’t want to sell, which is still an option in<em> Borderlands 4,</em> but it was always weird how the games just let you sell equipped gear so easily. Not so in <em>Borderlands 4</em>! Now you get a pop-up warning when trying to sell equipped items marked as junk. Nifty!</p>

 <h2>Legendary Weapons Are Much Rarer To Find, And That’s Good</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624985"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624985">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the biggest problems I had with <em>Borderlands 3</em> was how easily and quickly you found legendary weapons and gear. On a recent playthrough, I was collecting and selling them within a few hours of starting a new character. By the end of the game, I had found well over 100. I lost count, really. This made them feel less special and made non-legendary purple gear less exciting to collect because better stuff was dropping all the time.</p> <p>Thankfully, this isn’t the case in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> After nearly 40 hours with the game, I’ve only collected 7 legendary weapons and items. And one of those I bought from a vending machine, something I’ve only seen once in my time with the game.&nbsp; Unlike in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, when legendaries drop in<em> Borderlands 4,</em> I get genuinely excited! It’s a rare event, and many of the items have been powerful and memorable.</p>

 <h2>Customize Your Character Anywhere And Anytime</h2> <p>In the past, if you wanted to put a new skin or hat on your <em>Borderlands</em> character, you’d have to find a specific machine in-game and use it. This was annoying. Now, you can just open up the customization menu whenever you want and freely change your character’s looks.</p> <h2>Upgrading Your Inventory And Ammo Capacity Isn’t A Boring Money Grind</h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s big open world has a lot of places to explore, things to do, items to collect, and activities to complete. And this time around, Gearbox has decided to tie the open world to upgrading your character. Instead of grinding for money and then going to an in-game store to buy SDU upgrades, which let you carry more stuff and ammo, you now earn SDU credits by exploring and completing activities. And this is all done via a menu that is available at all times. Need more loot space to collect more guns? Well, check to see if you have enough SDU credits to upgrade your inventory space, and if so, do it right then and there. So convenient!</p>

 <h2>An Optional Hologram Path That Helps You Go The Right Way</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624986">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I spent far too much time in past <em>Borderlands</em> games running around trying to figure out how to get to a specific place or a quest marker. The in-game maps have been helpful, but sometimes you just want someone to draw a line from where you are now to where you need to go. And good news: <em>Borderlands 4</em> does that now! At any point, you can hit a button to get an in-game holographic path showing how to reach your destination, which can be a quest or just a random point you marked on the map.</p> <h2>Repkits Offer Healing When You Need It Most</h2> <p>A new piece of loot introduced in<em> Borderlands 4</em> are repkits. These are small medical devices that players can activate every so often for some instant healing. No more hunting down health drops during tricky boss fights or big skirmishes. Those tiny bits of healing still drop and are still useful, but having a health gun at your side is great. And as with all loot in <em>Borderlands</em>, repkits come in various flavors with all sorts of weird, wacky, and useful bonuses and passive traits. Honestly, going back to any past <em>Borderlands</em> game is going to be hard after getting used to repkits.</p>

 <h2>Spawn Your Vehicle Whenever You Need It</h2> <p>A big theme when it comes to the changes and improvements made in <em>Borderlands 4</em> is convenience. And perhaps the best example of this is the removal of Catch-A-Ride stations, which previously were the only way to spawn in a vehicle. Now, every player has their own personal Digirunner (which are basically Sparrows from <em>Destiny</em>),&nbsp;and they are awesome. They move quickly, feel great to drive, and being able to call one in whenever you want is so handy. Plus, combining Digirunners with the new movement controls, like double jumping and gliding, lets you speed across the world in style.</p> <p><em><strong>And now, some changes that aren’t so good…</strong></em></p> <h2>Menus Feel Dark, Finicky, And Removed From The Game World</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624987">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Something I really loved about the menus in past <em>Borderlands</em> games was how vibrant they all were and how they existed in the world. When you opened your inventory or skills menu in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, you’d see your character standing in the world, and the menu would be hovering next to and behind them. That’s gone in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. Instead, all the menus and inventory screens exist in dark voids that feel disconnected from the world. And some of these menus are tricky to use or feel overly cluttered. The inventory, in particular, isn’t great to navigate when using a controller. This change doesn’t ruin <em>Borderlands 4</em>, but it does make me sad.</p>

 <h2>Loading Screens Are Dull</h2> <p>This is a silly complaint, I’ll admit, but the loading screens in <em>Borderlands 4 a</em>re so boring. In past games, which were filled with loading screens, you’d get these wonderful, colorful posters of the location you were loading into at that moment. In<em> Borderlands 4,</em> which has far fewer loading screens thanks to its (mostly) seamless open world, the screens just look like someone took concept art and tossed the location’s name on it. They seem stale, cold, and drab. Thankfully, stuff loads so quickly that you won’t have to look at them long.</p> <h2>Rewards For Challenges And Quests Are Hidden In Digital Boxes</h2> <p>When you complete a quest in <em>Borderlands 4</em> or when you finish an in-game challenge, you are rewarded with various goodies. But these goodies aren’t delivered directly to your inventory. Instead, you have to go into the character menu and open them up. Thankfully, you can open them all at once, but it’s so odd that this system is even in the game.</p> <p>Sure, it’s nice that guns or loot you earn from a quest aren’t dropped right in your limited inventory. But it’s annoying that cosmetic items are also locked in these chests. The game also does a terrible job of reminding you to check on your rewards. Sometimes I’d open my character screen and see, like, 10 of these chests waiting for me. I’d love an option to get notified every so often when I have more than two or three of these things waiting around to be opened.</p>

You have to know a lotta stuff off the top of your head, and be able to deliver reactions and facts with confidence and a bit of theatrical flair. It’s work! Konami has recently tried to cut the labor out of said work by creating AI-generated commentaries for its <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> World Championship matches. But this use of the tech has blown up in the company’s metaphorical face as an actress has caught wind of her voice being used for the AI-generated commentaries without her involvement or consent.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lara-croft-tomb-raider-francoise-cadol-aspyr-remaster-2000624934">French Voice Actress For Lara Croft Accuses Developer Of Using AI To Alter Her Voice</a></p> <p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/konamis-ai-project-backfires-yu-gi-oh-videos-deleted-over-unauthorized-use-of-popular-actress-voice/">reported by <i>Automaton West</i></a>, Konami’s deletion of two YouTube videos in which <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> World Championship duels are presented with AI-generated commentary follows the publisher’s announcement of a trial run of the tech. The video announcing that trial included a promise to <a href="https://youtu.be/OiXO1_Nw_lA">leverage training data based on “countless simulations”</a> of games using over 12,000 cards’ worth of data. <a href="https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/jp/ja/news/32">Konami alleges</a> that it understood the AI speech model it used–called “Anneli”–to be permitted for commercial use. But the company is now investigating whether the data used to train the model may have been “based on unauthorized learning.” That’s because voice actress and singer Hibiku Yamamura has asserted that it was her voice the AI had digested to produce the commentary tracks in question. In a post to X, <a href="https://x.com/hibiku_yamamura/status/1963944289014296826">the singer claims</a> that (as translated using the built-in function on X),“No matter how I listen, it’s unmistakably my voice. But it’s clearly not me–my voice is reading text I’ve never read before.” She adds, “countless people who don’t know this are listening to that narration.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">先日、自分の声が無断で生成AIナレーションとして使用されている動画を見つけてしまいました。<br>（該当の動画元には事務所経由で相談・ご対応頂いています）…</p> <p>— 山村響🍬やまむらひびく (@hibiku_yamamura) <a href="https://twitter.com/hibiku_yamamura/status/1963944289014296826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Yamamura was certainly onto something. As it turns out, it <i>was</i> her voice, which the AI had acquired by way of a character she voices in an adult <i>bishōjo</i> visual novel. The creator of Anneli <a href="https://huggingface.co/kaunista/style-bert-vits2-Anneli?not-for-all-audiences=true">admitted to scraping Yamamura’s performance</a> as <a href="https://youtu.be/wA1swkHeHb8">Esther Gealach Arnotts</a> in <i>Tsuki ni Yorisou Otome no Sahou 2</i>.</p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lara-croft-tomb-raider-francoise-cadol-aspyr-remaster-2000624934">Stories like this</a> are only going to become more commonplace as this kind of tech works its way through, well, <i>everything</i> if its creators have their way. Naturally, the ease with which creative talent can be so easily replaced now is unnerving from a pro-labor perspective, but I also found Yamamura’s post to add an important layer of humanity here as she speaks about the emotional impact of hearing your voice taken and used without your consent.</p>
