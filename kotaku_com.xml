              <p>Why is the old<em> Path of Exile</em> more popular than the sequel right now? How does co-op horror game Mimesis copy teammates’ voices? And what’s the real difference between a remake and remaster these days? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Digital Foundry has a new retro gaming podcast. It’s very good and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqtLH0MOkgI">go check it out</a>.</p> <h2>Where are all the puzzle award categories for games?</h2> <p>It’s a question bubbled up across my feed <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edmondtran.bsky.social/post/3m4pq7uz5yk2m">over the weekend</a>. The Game Awards has genre shout-outs for role-playing games, action games, and even family games, whatever that means (it’s usually shorthand for whatever Nintendo put out that year). But other popular genres like horror and even shooters don’t get any special consideration. With puzzle games, that short shrift feels especially acute, however.</p>

 <p>That’s because there are lots of great puzzle games lately that just don’t usually have a shot of winning Best Game or the indie categories they’re otherwise most often represented in, like “Games for Impact.” A puzzle category in 2025 would be full of strong contenders, including Blue Prince, <em>The Roottress are Dead</em>, and the recently launched <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-fantasy-kingdom-seance-blake-manor-dispatch-2000640533"><em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Even Double Fine’s excellent <em>Keeper</em> might be more likely to get an honorary mention with a best puzzle category than awkwardly shoving it into best indie game (that happens to be published by the largest game publisher in the world).</p> <h2>Fans discuss whether to boycott <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next game after layoffs</h2> <p>“Hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game,” wrote one user on the Steam discussion page for Possessor(s), <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/as-players-debate-whether-to-purchase-possessor-s-after-heart-machine-lays-off-staff-a-week-before-launch-its-creators-and-publisher-respond-as-a-developer-who-is-slated-for-lay-off-please-buy-this-game/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>. Heart Machine has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs over the last year and put its Early Access action-RPG <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> on ice. But publisher Devolver Digital said laid off staff are still eligible for revenue sharing from the game’s sales, and “As a developer who is slated for lay off—PLEASE BUY THIS GAME,” former narrative director Tyler Hutchinson told Steam players.</p>

 <p>This same issue has come up recently with news of <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">alleged union busting at Rockstar Games</a>. Some fans have immediately called for a boycott of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, despite no indication from any of the fired developers that that’s what they want to happen in response. Consumers can choose to spend their money however they want, but it’s usually good to check with the people you’re trying to support before launching a boycott in their name.</p>

 <h2>Remasters sell, but remakes sell better</h2> <p>That’s according to new research from Ampere Analysis as reported <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/consumers-spend-twice-as-much-on-video-game-remakes-than-remasters-according-to-research/">by<em> VGC</em></a>. The data firm counted 15 remakes and 27 remasters released between January 2024 and September 2025. It found that remakes generated 2.2 times the revenue of remasters, despite only being released half as often. Of course, the Ampere also counted games like <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> as, well, a remaster, even though it certainly veers more into the territory of a remake.</p>

 <h2><em>Peak</em> is getting a new Kashyyyk biome</h2>  <p>It’s called Roots. It’s full oe redwood trees. And it seems like there will be lots of spiders.</p> <h2><em>Mimesis</em> is a new co-op horror game that copies your voice</h2> <p>That’s one of the ways its enemies try to trick players into thinking they’re on the same team. It’s the latest crew-like to quietly have a big week on Steam after arriving in Early Access on October 27.</p>

 <p>“It’s pretty much a <em>Lethal Company</em> clone but with an LLM mimic feature that actually tries to make sense out of the voice clips it gets per session,” is how one user described it. There’s no generative-AI disclosure on Steam page so it’s unclear how the whole thing works.</p> <h2>The original <em>Path of Exile</em> has exploded on Steam again thanks to a new update</h2> <p>Patch 3.27 is called Keepers of the Flame and arrived on November 1. The action-RPG hit over 180,000 concurrents on Steam over the weekend after it went live. <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3869068">The massive update</a> focuses on an invasion of Breach Monster and includes tons of changes to skills, characters, and everything else in the game for what is essentially it’s next big season.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-crab-hand-small-penis-hateful-expression-apology-nikke-2000640487">The small penis pinching controversy, explained</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468">Nobody thinks<em> Silksong</em> has a chance at GOTY&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-lawsuit-streamer-2000640438">Switch streamer owes Nintendo $17,500 after trying to troll them</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p><span>Ever since choice-based games moved away from dialogue options in which you see exactly what your character will say before they say it in favor of little blurbs that try to sum up the general vibe of what you’re going to say or do before you watch it unfold on-screen, there’s been a loss of clarity between what we think we’re about to say and what we actually end up doing in video games. Part of me thinks this is just the consequence of a more cinematic approach to choice-based games, but poorly communicating what a player will do when they make a decision is a game design issue, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, the first project from AdHoc Studio, made up of several ex-Telltale developers, is one of the latest games to fall victim to this incongruity between what the screen says your characters will do and what actually ends up happening after you choose it.</span></p> <p><span>Studios have found different ways to circumvent this danger. BioWare uses emotive icons to communicate an emotional intent with different options, or has even started adding small pop-up windows to lay out exactly what you’re going to do alongside your dialogue option. However, games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>have the advantage of pausing dialogue to let players consider their actions before moving forward. </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, like many of the old Telltale games, including </span><i><span>The Walking Dead </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands, </span></i><span>has timed dialogue choices to create a sense of urgency and keep a scene flowing. That has its advantages, but it also means you can’t include a bunch of clarifying pop-ups like other games might because players won’t have time to read them all thoroughly. That said, you can also just write dialogue options that are straightforward, rather than obfuscating what you’re actually going to do. Minor spoilers for </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s third</span> <span>episode follow:</span></p>

  <p><span>In episode three, protagonist Robert Robertson III is gathering his crew of ex-villain dispatchees to let them know that, by the end of their shift, at least one of them will be off the team and in the unemployment line. Exactly who that ends up being is the final decision of the episode, but before you make any such call, the group gathers in a meeting room, and Golem, a sentient pile of mud and dirt, knocks Robert to the floor as he enters the room. The player is given two options here: kick him out, or “give him the chair.” That could be interpreted as you offering him a chair to sit down on, but if you choose that option, that’s not what happens. Instead, Robert throws the chair at Golem, which lodges in his shoulder. Robert gives him a very apt talking-to about being aware of his surroundings, but the violence to get there is not clearly communicated in the options you’re given. It makes for a funny streaming moment, at least, but given Telltale’s history with these kinds of ambiguous dialogue options, folks aren’t thrilled to see these interactions return in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>.</span></p>         <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is halfway through its eight-episode run, and while I’m enjoying parts of it, I have been feeling a bit railroaded by its decisions thus far. I’m curious to see just how much impact those choices can make by the time the game ends later this month, but for now, it’s mostly just felt like I’ve been on the ride.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mac-mini-rival-running-windows-hits-40-off-christmas-showed-up-early-on-amazon-2000640785</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s Mac Mini gets all the attention for compact computing but plenty of people need powerful Windows machines that don’t take up half a desk. Developers running Windows-only software, small business owners managing Microsoft ecosystems, content creators working with Adobe suites, and anyone tired of bulky tower PCs all face the same challenge: <strong>serious processing power in a tiny package that runs Windows natively</strong>.</p>
<p>The GMKtec M2 Pro S delivers exactly that: an Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor, 32GB RAM, and triple 4K display support, in a case smaller than most hardcover books. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/"> has slashed this mini PC from $639 to $409, placing legitimate desktop-class performance within reach at a price</a> that makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiger Lake Performance in a Desktop Form Factor</h2>
<p>Intel’s Tiger Lake is its 11th generation of Core i7 mobile chips but GMKtec adapted <strong>the Core i7-1185G7 chip for use in desktop mini PCs with great results</strong>. This quad-core chip runs at a base frequency of 3.0 GHz and turbos up to 4.8 GHz on single-core workloads with all four cores sustaining 4.3 GHz under full load. Those frequencies matter: They’re a determinant of how snappy your applications respond, how well your video-editing software scrubs through timelines, and how many browser tabs you can have open before things start crawling. Eight threads through Hyper-Threading technology allow the processor to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>



<p>It’s handled by the Intel Iris Xe Graphics with 96 execution units that deliver performance well above older integrated graphics and give even some entry-level dedicated GPUs a run for their money. That matters from smooth <strong>desktop animations to hardware-accelerated video encoding, plus casual gaming</strong> and the ability to run design software without throwing hundreds of dollars at a separate graphics card</p>
<p>The 32GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM comes properly configured from the factory, and gives both the CPU and GPU maximum memory bandwidth for the best performance. Dual-channel operation essentially doubles the speed at which data flows between RAM and processor compared to single-channel configurations, eliminating a common bottleneck that cripples many budget systems. The 1TB NVMe SSD connects via PCIe 3.0, delivering read speeds around 3,500 MB/s that make your entire system feel instantaneous compared to old SATA drives or mechanical hard drives.</p>



<p>The triple display capability transforms this mini PC into a serious multitasking powerhouse: <strong>Two HDMI 2.0 ports</strong> each output 4K resolution at 60Hz, while the <strong>USB-C port with DisplayPort</strong> alt mode handles the third 4K display at 60Hz. <strong>Running three 4K monitors simultaneously</strong> gives you over 24 million pixels of workspace, letting traders monitor multiple markets, developers keep code on one screen with documentation and testing on the others, or video editors spread their timeline across displays. The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures smooth motion and responsive cursor movement.</p>
<p>The GMKtec mini PC now costs $409, instead of $639, which makes it far cheaper than many standalone processors.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dual-14-laptop-screen-extender-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-stock-before-black-friday-2000640775</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Working on a single laptop screen is like trying to prepare a five-course meal in a studio apartment kitchen: constant minimizing of windows, lost tracking of tabs, and clicking back and forth between applications until your wrist hurts from all the mouse movement. There’s a great laptop screen extender on sale at Amazon that solves this by adding two full 14-inch displays that clip right onto your laptop, instantly creating a triple-screen setup: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/">Amazon has dropped it from $239 to $189 which makes this the cheapest route into serious screen real estate</a> without buying separate monitors and dealing with all that cabling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Display Quality in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>Each <strong>14-inch screen delivers full HD 1080P resolution through IPS panel technology</strong>&nbsp;which means you get consistent colors and clear text from almost any viewing angle. That’s where IPS panels make all the difference; they avoid that annoying color shift and brightness drop you get from cheaper TN screens just from tilting your head a little. The 1920×1080 resolution gives you enough pixel density to keep text sharp and images detailed without having that fuzzy look budget monitors often suffer from. <strong>Both displays boast blue light filtering technology</strong> that reduces eye strain during long work sessions. That means it cuts the harsh blue wavelengths that mess with your sleep cycle and tire your eyes. The <strong>anti-glare coating scatters ambient light</strong> instead of reflecting it straight back at you so you can actually see what’s on screen even when sitting near windows or under office lighting.</p>
<p>Built-in speakers mean you get audio from the extended displays without needing separate speakers or relying on your laptop’s often mediocre sound system. At just <strong>0.24 inches thick, these screens fold flat for transport</strong> and barely add bulk to your laptop bag.</p>



<p>The connectivity covers all the bases <strong>with two USB Type-C ports and one HDMI to USB-C port</strong>, which gives you flexibility in how you connect depending on what your laptop offers. Plug and play means exactly that-no driver downloads, no software installations, just connect the cables and your operating system immediately recognizes the extra displays. You can run both screens in extended mode to genuinely expand your workspace or switch into mirror mode for presentations where you want everyone seeing the same content. <strong>The triple-screen configuration legitimately increases your visible workspace by 200%</strong>, and lets you keep email open on one screen, your primary work on the laptop display and reference materials or chat windows on the third screen.</p>
<p>This extender <strong>works with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems</strong> and supports game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch to extend your game into multiple displays.</p>



<p>Studies regularly demonstrate that using a <strong>dual monitor setup increases productivity 20-42% over using a single screen</strong> and the gains are even higher when adding a third screen. This gain in productivity is realized by reduced window switching, better visibility for information, and the ability to retain tools, references, and communications visible all at once.</p>
<p>At $189, this extender is less than the cost of buying even one decent standalone portable monitor, yet you get two screens plus mounting hardware and all the necessary cables.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is it fair to call this the Big One? Of all the very many nerd conventions around the world, New York Comic Con certainly has claim to be one of the most defining events in the calendar. So of course&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>&nbsp;ensured Minerablu’s excellent team of photographers were at the event, capturing the best cosplay that appeared on the show floor.</p> <p>As you might imagine, New York Comic Con attracts a host of big-name actors and creators, with 2025 seeing the likes of Hollywood stars like James McAvoy, Elliot Page, Martin Sheen and Ming-Na Wen, alongside writers George R.R. Martin and Joe Hill, voice actors Laura Bailey and Ashley Johnson, and all-time heroes like Ernie Hudson, Seth Green and Peter Weller. But we’re not here for autographs; we’re after the most impressive cosplay to walk through the exhibition hall doors. And as ever, we have a mighty-fine selection.</p>

 <p>More unusual costumes include a spot-on Bad Bunny, a Supergirl/Sabrina Carpenter crossover, and—er—quite the Jeff Goldblum. There’s also the finest Predator I’ve ever seen, and what I hope will become a permanent fixture of these galleries:&nbsp;<em>Demon Hunters</em>‘ Derpy.</p> <p>We’ll have a video of the event soon, but meanwhile click on to enjoy the pics.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-ideapad-with-office-365-and-1tb-selling-cheaper-than-no-name-laptops-amazon-clears-stock-2000640767</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-ideapad-with-office-365-and-1tb-selling-cheaper-than-no-name-laptops-amazon-clears-stock.1342096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people just want a laptop that works without drama or over-engineering. Lenovo’s <em>IdeaPad</em> line is specifically designed with all the everyday scenarios in mind and peel away the extraneous gaming trim to focus on practical computing that normal people actually need. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/">has dropped the Lenovo IdeaPad 1i down to $279 from its regular $399 price</a>, bundling in a full <strong>year of Microsoft 365</strong> alongside an impressive combination of 12GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage plus 1TB of cloud storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Computing Power for Everyday Tasks</h2>
<p>The 12GB of RAM in this configuration changes everything about how budget laptops traditionally perform. Most entry-level machines ship with 4GB that starts choking the moment you open more than a few browser tabs but 12GB gives you real breathing room for multitasking across applications. You can run Word documents (you can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/word">download Word for free here</a>) while researching in Chrome with YouTube playing in the background, all without that frustrating slowdown that makes budget laptops feel ancient. The <strong>Intel Celeron processor handles everyday computing tasks</strong> like email, web browsing, document editing and video streaming without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Storage comes in two forms that work together beautifully: <strong>fast local storage and massive cloud storage</strong>. The 256GB SSD provides fast local storage for your operating system, applications, and files you access regularly, delivering quick boot times and snappy performance that makes modern computers feel responsive. That is complemented by the massive 1TB of cloud storage through Microsoft 365 for backing up photos and everything else you want to keep safe but don’t need instant access to.</p>



<p>The<strong> 14-inch HD anti-glare display</strong> hits that sweet spot for portability and usability-large enough to handle comfortable work sessions without the bulk of a 15.6-inch model that barely fits into backpacks: That anti-glare coating does wonders when you work near a window or under strong overhead lighting and cuts down on the reflections that otherwise drive you to push brightness to uncomfortable levels. The <strong>screen manages to achieve an 87% active area ratio</strong>&nbsp;which means Lenovo has been able to keep the surrounding bezels quite minimal to provide more screen area in a compact form factor. <strong>Two Dolby Audio speakers</strong> flank the keyboard and stream robust sound surprisingly well for video calls, streaming shows, or background music while working.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 11 hours on a full charge</strong> which is enough to get through a full workday or school day without hunting for outlets. WiFi-6 connectivity brings faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments like apartments or dorm buildings where dozens of devices compete for bandwidth. The Flip to Start feature powers on the laptop the instant you open the lid and shaves off those annoying seconds of waiting while Smart Noise Cancelling automatically filters out background sounds during video calls.</p>
<p>Windows 11 is preinstalled and it performs all the modern computing tasks you’d want, from productivity software to entertainment apps. The bundled Microsoft 365 subscription includes all the Office applications you’d want, <strong>including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, along with that 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage</strong> we mentioned earlier. This software package alone usually costs about $70 per year so getting a full year included with the laptop counts as genuine added value rather than marketing fluff.</p>
<p>At $279, this Lenovo undercuts generic no-name laptops that often cost $400 or more while delivering inferior build quality and zero brand support.</p>

              <p>Gaming sessions with friends hit different when everyone has a controller: There’s nothing worse than passing around one gamepad or having to troubleshoot compatibility across various devices. The Xbox wireless controller has become the go-to option for millions of gamers and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Amazon has it down to just $39 from its usual $64 price</a>. That’s practically half the cost of Sony’s DualSense controller, and it makes this deal all that much sweeter if you need to stock up on extra controllers for those multiplayer sessions.</p>

<h2>A Controller That Goes the Distance</h2>
<p>New in this 2025 edition of the Xbox controller are features that truly make for meaningful changes in your experience while gaming: The <strong>battery life runs as long as 40 hours on one set of two AA batteries</strong> which means you can game through several weekends without having to fear running out of power. This controller now <strong>includes a 9-foot USB-C cable right in the box</strong> for easy flexibility between wireless freedom and the reliability of a wired connection at any time.</p>
<p>These ergonomic updates to the controller have made marathon gaming sessions far more comfortable. Xbox has <strong>refined the sculpted surfaces and geometry</strong> for a better fit of various hand sizes while adding textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case. These grip enhancements give you more control in high-intensity moments when your palms start sweating and this <strong>hybrid D-pad provides a nice balance between precision and comfort</strong> in fighting games and menu navigation alike. The <strong>Share button integration is really handy</strong>, too: you can capture screenshots and recordings without having to fumble through menus or break focus during crucial gameplay moments.</p>



<p>In real-world practicality, the strength of this controller comes in with cross-platform compatibility: You can pair it<strong> wirelessly via Xbox Wireless or Bluetooth to your console, PC, phone, tablet, Fire TV Stick, smart TV, or even VR headsets</strong>. That means one controller works across your whole gaming ecosystem, not different gamepads for different devices. A <strong>3.5mm headset jack</strong> lets you plug any compatible headset directly into it, and a USB-C port supports direct plug-and-play connections to your console or PC without any setup hassle.</p>
<p>At $39, you’re getting a premium controller that normally sells for $64, and this represents the lowest price we’ve tracked for this model. With over 21,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars and more than 10,000 units purchased in the past month alone, this controller has proven itself in real-world use.</p>
