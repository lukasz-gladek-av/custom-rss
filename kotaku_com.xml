Once teams find it, they have to battle one another to extract. That can happen aboard spaceships or out in the void. But if a squad’s ship gets blown up, their journey will come to an abrupt end. It’s coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2025. </p><p>You can see where I’m getting the <em>Sea of Thieves </em>vibes from. The deep-dive trailer makes that even more apparent:</p><p>It’s an ambitious mashup of genres. <em>Wildgate</em> boasts “epic spaceship battles,” exploration through “cosmic storms,” plundering alien outposts for loot, and a unique cast of adventurers called Prospectors, each with their own arsenal of tools and abilities. The world and characters, which include a cat in a fish tank controlling a mech and a anthropomorphic goat warrior, are a bit all over the place, but I can see them growing on me if the gameplay loop is as fun as it sounds. </p><p>Whether <em>Wildgate</em> has the magic to put it over the top where so many other live-service multiplayer games have failed remains to be seen. Moonshot Games is helmed by some Blizzard vets who worked on <em>Hearthstone</em>, <em>StarCraft</em>, and other franchises, including producer Jason Chayes, designer Dustin Browder, and artist Ben Thompson. The team is part of Dreamhaven, the publishing label led by ex-Blizzard president Mike Morhaime. </p><p> “<em>Wildgate </em>rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” Morhaime said in a press release. “Since every match of <em>Wildgate </em>plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”</p><p>Today’s livestream also gave updates on Dreamhaven’s other partner projects. Secret Door’s tabletop-inspired RPG, <em>Sunderfolk</em>, will be $50 and is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on April 23. FuzzyBot’s <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em>, a loot-based action-RPG cozy sim (yes, really), is headed out of Early Access for PS5, Xbox, and PC on May 22. Finally, Game River’s <em>Mechabellum</em>, a  tactical mech auto battler with shades of <em>Total Annihilation</em> that launched on PC last year, recently launched season 3 and is currently on sale. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
