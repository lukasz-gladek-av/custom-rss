The brutal fighter has now been updated once again with the playable debut of Ghostface from the <em>Scream</em> franchise. While that is delightful in itself, there was an equally exciting feature introduced with Replay Takeover.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,195618,196394" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-towers-of-time-mode-guide-1851664040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-towers-of-time-mode-guide-1851664040"><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s Towers Of Time Mode Isn’t Explained Well, So We Made It Simple</a></span><br><strong>Buy <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmortal-kombat-1%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmortal-kombat-1%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Warner-Bros-Interactive-Entertainment-5051892243315/dp/B0C5DS8QJ7/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-replay-takeover-how-to-use-explained-1851708774&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0C5DS8QJ7" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span></p><p>This wonderful new tool has gained a lot of popularity this year, with a few other games in the genre launching with or adding it in an update. However, you might be in the dark if this is the main fighting game you play. The marketing push for Ghostface and subsequent glossing over this new tool probably hasn’t helped. Never fear, we’ve got you covered with a breakdown of Replay Takeover and how you can benefit from using it.</p><h2 id="h18"><a id="explained"></a>Replay Takeover, Explained</h2><figure id="" data-id="11d0b922c6653bf9f92e356a9c17dc54" data-recommend-id="image://11d0b922c6653bf9f92e356a9c17dc54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Replay Updates screen pops up after the recent patch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Match Replay Updates screen pops up after the recent patch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11d0b922c6653bf9f92e356a9c17dc54" data-recommend-id="image://11d0b922c6653bf9f92e356a9c17dc54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Replay Updates screen pops up after the recent patch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Replay Takeover is a feature in the Replay mode that allows you to take control of either character for 20 seconds.</strong></p><p>The primary incentive for this mode is to revisit your matches and try to find more effective techniques for any difficult moments. Instead of just wondering what the better response was when your opponent had you stuck in a corner, you can use Replay Takeover to visit that moment and figure out what other options you had. You can take over from any point in the match and restart there as much as needed until you’re satisfied. It’s a great learning tool that’s a lot more efficient than trying to recreate these situations in Training mode.</p><h2 id="h19"><a id="use"></a>How to Use Replay Takeover?</h2><figure id="" data-id="634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-recommend-id="image://634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-recommend-id="image://634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can access Replay Takeover anytime you’re watching a Replay against another player. Thankfully, accessing your replays is a lot easier than it was previously. Here are the steps to follow:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>On the Main Menu, go down to Learn and then select Replays.</li><li>Choose the Replay you want to see and select Watch.</li><li>Navigate to any part and press in the left or right analog sticks to take control of the Player One or Player Two characters respectively. Alternately, press the Pause button and select the options there.</li><li>Press Restart (View button for Xbox or Touch Pad for PlayStation) at any time to return to the moment you took control.</li><li>Once you’re satisfied, press in the left stick to end control and go back to watching the replay.</li></ul><p>It’s important to remember that while you have only 20 seconds to take control of one fighter, the other will stick to the same inputs of the replay. Unless you’re practicing how to get around a long combo string, you should get used to restarting. Things can start looking weird after interrupting the other player’s actions and changing the order and timing of their inputs.</p><hr><p>It’s exciting to see <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> embrace Replay Takeover, and I cannot recommend the feature highly enough. This is a wonderful tool that allows for more practical learning than most Training modes offer. No matter if you’re new to the game or playing online ranked every day, Replay Takeover is sure to help you improve.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nvidia graphics cards for building gaming PCs would see similar spikes, as would the growing line of PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus Rog Ally. The Switch 2, expected to arrive as early as March 2025, could see its year-one sales torpedoed by the sudden sticker shock of a hybrid console almost twice as expensive in the U.S. as its predecessor. </p><p>Nintendo is one gaming company that’s already started moving some manufacturing out of China and into neighboring Vietnam. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/gibbogame?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/gibbogame?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Gibson</a></span>, Senior Analyst at MST Financial, estimates that roughly 50 percent of Switches are made outside of China this point, but he still foresees prices going up by as much as 35 percent if the current proposed tariffs go into effect.</p><p>Alternatively, Nintendo could try to reserve its Switch stock made outside of China for the U.S. market, which makes up roughly 40 percent of the global console market.

Gibson suggests Nintendo, Sony and others will look to increase imports ahead of Trump being sworn in on January 20 and begin shifting even more manufacturing capacity to other countries like India. “I would expect a full shift to non-China production within 12-24 months of the news,” he wrote in an email to <em>Kotaku</em>. “[It] usually takes 6 months to put in equipment and longer to find or build facilities.” By that point, the costs could be closer to 10 percent above what they are now, and companies like Sony might look to absorb more of them in a hit to profit margins to continue growing the PS5 install base. Lovely, however, suggested other countries aren’t ready to absorb that demand. “India’s just not ready,” she said. </p><h2 id="h39555"><a id=""></a>Tariffs could radically alter gaming’s trajectory </h2><p>But higher hardware costs are just the start of how tariffs could reshape gaming in the U.S. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://superjoost.substack.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://superjoost.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joost Van Dreunen</a></span>, a lecturer at the NYU Stern School of Business, believes the most draconian tariffs would dramatically reshape the console landscape in the years ahead. “The data indicate that tariffs would not just affect sales volumes but could permanently alter the console industry’s role in U.S. gaming culture,” he wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://substack.com/home/post/p-151531315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-151531315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent edition of his <em>Super Joost Playlist</em> newsletter</a></span>. In the worst-case scenario, he estimates that total console sales in the U.S. would fall below early 2000s levels “despite two decades of market expansion and a substantially larger gaming population.”</p><p>One likely outcome of this scenario, Van Dreunen speculates, is that players in the U.S. start moving toward other ways of accessing games. “These tariffs could fast-track the industry’s shift toward cloud gaming, streaming services, and transmedia distribution, marking a classic transition from content innovation to distribution innovation in the pendulum cycle,” he wrote. </p><p>Physical games would also potentially die off even faster as players switch to tariff-exempt digital downloads and cheaper, digital-only versions of the existing PlayStation and Xbox consoles.

If history’s any indication, Trump could threaten major tariffs only to back off of them in return for minor trading concessions from other countries, declaring victory despite minimal changes to the status quo. Big tech and gaming companies could also once again successfully lobby the incoming administration for exclusions from the highest tariff rates as they did back in 2019.
