              <p>Did Tencent just stealthily try to walk itself back from the brink after getting sued by Sony for trying to rush a <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">brazen ripoff of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> to market? Will the PlayStation 6 be Sony’s least important console yet? And do we finally have our first real clue as to when <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will come out? Welcome to the latest Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news, trailers, and other fascinating curios, like how the proprietor of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-BU6keEUw">Mom’s Spaghetti</a> is totally chill with being known as “<a href="https://twitter.com/Shadyind/status/1953257598129717757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953257598129717757%7Ctwgr%5E7f954647bca4ad74de71348ad09444d1288fa6ec%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwatch-eminem-react-to-being-called-that-guy-from-fortnite%2F1100-6533781%2F">The guy from <em>Fortnite</em></a>.”</p> <h2>Tencent tries to pretend the <em>Light of Motiram</em> never happened</h2> <p>The Chinese conglomerate was recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163">sued by Sony,</a> who alleged that Tencent kept trying to license <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> for a survival crafting game and, when Sony kept saying no, turned around and made it anyway. A week later, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/"><em>The Game Post</em> noticed</a> that developer Polaris Quest has quietly been changing out the worst offending images, language, and key art from the game’s Steam page.&nbsp;References to “colossal machines” and “Mechanimals” were stripped from the description and the screenshots and art now focus on generic scenes instead of <em>Light of Motiram</em>‘s Temu version of Aloy. Now that Sony has called Tencent’s bluff, it’ll probably continue to strip out the most egregious <em>Horizon</em> copycat elements from the game. We’ll see if that’s enough to get the PS5 maker to settle.</p> <h2>Sony is moving away from a “hardware centric business model” ahead of the PS6</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony Senior Vice President Sadahiko Hayakawa says they are gradually shifting their gaming business from a hardware centric business model to a community and engagement based platform business model <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayStation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayStation</a></p> <p>“In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric… <a href="https://t.co/8xnKyihMHE">pic.twitter.com/8xnKyihMHE</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The console war is grinding to an end. With <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> on PlayStation and<em> Helldivers 2</em> coming to Xbox, the old rivalries are slowly, if not completely, fading into the background. “In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement,” senior Sony VP Sadahiko Hayakawa said this week. While in line with the company’s previous comments about focusing more on total players and engagement time over unit sales, the remark still raised eyebrows as the PS5 continues to dominate. Former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment of America Shawn Layden responded with a GIF of <em>God of War</em>‘s Kratos <a href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1953706271594397696">putting his head in his hands</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Xbox Rog Ally release date may have just leaked</h2> <p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Dealabs poster billbil-kun</a>, the new PC gaming handhelds aiming to deliver Xbox-like console experiences will come out in Europe on October 16. Neither the date nor the price of the upcoming hardware has been officially revealed yet, though billbil-kun previously claimed it would cost €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the more powerful Xbox Ally X in Europe. We’ll have to wait and see how those prices translate to the U.S. amid Trump’s current tariff war.</p> <h2>A very convincing theory for<em> Silksong</em>‘s possible release date</h2> <p>Xbox fans will remember that Microsoft used <em>Silksong</em> to hype the Xbox Rog Ally reveal back during its Xbox summer showcase. The most wishlisted game on Steam would be “available at launch and in Game Pass when Ally releases later this year,” Xbox president Sarah Bond said at the time. Based on this, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/we-might-actually-have-a-tenuous-silksong-release-date-absolutely-nobody-on-my-team-believes-me-and-i-think-i-can-hear-hornet-in-my-walls/"><em>PC Gamer</em>‘s Harvey Randall</a> speculates that, if the October 16 leak is accurate, that could also be <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch date. That day is also a Thursday, which is when most new Switch 1 and Switch 2 games come out. Hmmm. Or maybe Bond simply meant that <em>Silksong</em> would already be out by the time the Xbox ROG Ally arrives, which, if that’s the case, is even better!</p> <h2><em>Ashes of the Singularity 2</em> is happening</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ashes of the Singularity II  |  Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SV3k4yxWKS0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The real-time strategy game known for its massive armies will return with a sequel nearly a decade later, this time with a human faction. There’s no release date yet and my current PC will just barely be able to run it but as a huge fan of<em> Total Annihilation</em>, one of the series’ influences, I can’t wait.</p>

              <p>Late on August 7, <em>GTA</em> publisher Take Two put out its quarterly earnings report, accompanied by a shareholder Q&amp;A and interviews with CEO Strauss Zelnick appearing on various outlets. Obviously, the big question everyone had is: How much are you going to charge for <em>GTA 6</em>? Zelnick chose to deliver some extra-special corporate gloop instead of actually answering.</p> <p>Rumors have been flying back and forth over the price of next year’s&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>, with a recent round of “industry analyst” nonsense <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/analyst-says-i-expect-a-usd100-price-point-for-gta-6-estimates-rockstars-development-cost-is-over-usd1-5-billion-and-predicts-it-will-earn-usd10-billion-lifetime-and-another-usd500-million-annually-from-gta-online/">declaring that the game will cost $100</a>. However, while something around $70 to $80 seems far more likely, Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick avoided giving a price when speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p> <p>Game prices are in something of a hinterland, with many publishers wanting to follow Nintendo’s lead up to a standard price of $80 but seemingly being afraid to push the button. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">Microsoft recently backtracked on the plan</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">EA has made clear it intends to stick with $70 for the foreseeable future</a>, and perhaps most relevantly here, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">Take Two recently said&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> would be $70</a>, after <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-games-1851781445">Randy Pitchford made a twerp of himself on the subject</a>. Many, however, are predicting that if any game could push prices up, it’s&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>.</p>

 <p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, Zelnick put modesty aside and said of <em>GTA 6</em>, “I do think it’s fair to say that this is perhaps the most highly anticipated property pre-release in the history of entertainment.” Given this confidence, you might think the CEO would be willing to just state the intended price for the game. However, when&nbsp;<em>Variety&nbsp;</em>spoke to him, he instead prevaricated.</p> <p>“Our goal is always to deliver more value than we charge,” Zelnick told the outlet, which are words that <em>look</em> like they should mean something. He continued, “so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever.” Mentioning special editions and so on, the response finished, “I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it.” Yes, but how much will it cost?</p> <p>Zelnick was equally bemusing about <em>Borderlands 4</em> during August 8’s earnings call, responding to a shareholder question about why <em>that</em> game will be $70, “We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing. So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth.” Yes, but why is it $70?</p>

 <p>When 2020 prices were stepping up from $60 to $70 as a console standard, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-interactive-next-gen-software-price-increases-reflect-the-quality-of-the-experience">Zelnick wasn’t nearly so shy</a> about justifying the increased costs. “We think with the value we offer consumers…and the kind of experience you can really only have on these next-generation consoles, that the price is justified,” the CEO told <em>GI.biz</em> at the time. “But it’s easy to say that when you’re delivering extraordinary quality, and that’s what our company prides itself on doing.”</p> <p>So, we still have no idea what Take Two will be charging for May 26’s&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. Presumably there’s a desire to hold off and see which way the wind blows over the next nine months. Given Nintendo is sticking to its guns at $80 for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but then confusing everything by charging $70 for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, there’s no clear indication yet. Certainly Microsoft and Sony appear to be sticking to $70 for the upcoming holiday season, but it seems entirely possible that $80 will creep in during 2026.</p> <p>And yes, sure, Take Two&nbsp;<em>could</em> charge $100 for&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>, but it’d be a bad move that would do reputational damage to both the publisher and the game. Presumably there will be a “premium” version priced at around $100, and possibly another at $130 or more, but it seems vanishingly unlikely the vanilla game will cost more than eighty bucks.</p>

              <p>It’s time for your monthly reminder that your Amazon Prime subscription also comes with a bunch of free games. And in many cases, while that “free” perhaps deserves scarequotes for falling under a subscription fee for a monstrously evil corporation, they’re actually yours to keep forever, with no DRM, and no requirement to keep up your sub. That’s true for eight of this month’s offerings, including&nbsp;<em>Civilization III </em>and&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition.</em></p> <p>The reason for this proper, actual ownership is Prime partners with GOG for a lot of the games it includes in the subscription, meaning that you’re getting a code that allows you to download a DRM-free version of the game that boots from an .exe, rather than requiring any launchers or proprietary software. So while you may observe that&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> is a 24-year-old game, and as such perhaps not quite matching the sorts of games added to services like PS Plus or Game Pass, in this case you’re getting&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> to&nbsp;<em>keep</em>. You could also point out that the game is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">currently available on GOG for $0.75</a>, which is approximately 185 times cheaper than an annual Prime subscription, and there I couldn’t argue back.&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em>, however, is $25, so that’s definitely a sweeter deal. And, you know, as much as that game definitely shouldn’t have been called “<em>Thief</em>,” and as embarrassing as its <em>The Crow</em> cosplay may have been, it’s actually a pretty decent game in its own right.</p> <p>Amazon Prime likes to make it as confusing as possible to acquire your freebies, releasing the games in four separate batches across the month, guaranteeing you to forget at least some of them. It also removes other games from the selection at the same times, really keeping you on your toes. But the two headline games for August are <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">both there to grab right now</a>, along with big names added in July like&nbsp;<em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> and&nbsp;<em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em>. Also coming later this month are&nbsp;<em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em>–an expandalone entry in Travis Baldtree’s legendary&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like series–and last year’s deckbuilding roguelite&nbsp;<em>Necroking</em>. Here’s the full list of games for August:</p> <p><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>The Academy: The First Riddle</em> (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 14</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Filthy Animals – Heist Simulator</em> (Epic Games Store)</li> <li><em>Tin Hearts</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Necroking&nbsp;</em>(GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 21</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective&nbsp;</em>(Amazing Games App)</li> <li><em>Silver Box Classics</em> (GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 28</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Heroes of Loot 2</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Fantasy Empires</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>City Legends: The Ghost of Misty Hill Collector’s Edition</em> (Legacy Games)</li> </ul> <p>You also get a bunch of games via the Amazon cloud gaming doodad, Luna, which rotate in and out. It currently contains&nbsp;<em>Saints Row: The Third</em>,&nbsp;<em>SkateBIRD</em>,&nbsp;<em>Overcooked! 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, among others.</p>
