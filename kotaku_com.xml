This sound was attached to hundreds of videos on my feed before I ever actually saw one of these dolls, but now that the trend has broken containment, I see one of these little guys everywhere I look. Though Labubu were initially just dolls like any other, they’ve seen an uptick as a fashion accessory in the past couple of years, with Lisa, one of the members of K-pop group Blackpink, being cited as one of the major trendsetters who’s sparked the brand’s worldwide success.</p><p>Lisa has been considered one of the first trailblazers for the brand ever since she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted photos of herself sporting a Labubu keychain on her bag</a></span> on social media in April 2024, and then other huge celebrities followed suit. Artists like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dua Lipa </a></span>have also been spotted with these little monsters hanging off their bags, and over the past year the dolls have exploded in popularity. It may seem like Labubu is an overnight success, but the dolls have been in production for a decade. The brand was introduced in 2015 under the company How2Work, based on a character design by artist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasing Lung</a></span>, who illustrated children’s books with the company. The brand had another surge in popularity in 2019 when it started collaborating with Pop Mart, a Chinese blind box store. All of this was a perfect storm for Labubu to become not only a worldwide phenomenon, but the kind of collectathon craze that rivals something like <em>Pokémon </em>cards. How do you make something desirable? Make it harder to find. It’s also made unboxing videos a popular viral trend as people try to track down the rare “secret” doll in a blind box.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The craze has grown so much that Labubu is now collaborating with some huge brands.

A pilotable robot on the streets of West Hollywood starts out as a walking shitpost, then ends up being adapted into a mobile surveillance tool by a police department operating under a corrupt administration. The wine we drink is being curated by something that can’t taste it, and eventually, the food we eat is “optimized” by a program, and we just consume it like fuel. Art is already treated this way with manufactured AI movies, music, video games, and books all being churned out as capital C “Content” to be easily produced and force-fed to an audience in need of a distraction, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/netflix/netflix-chief-claims-generative-ai-will-make-their-content-better-and-a-show-with-a-near-perfect-rotten-tomatoes-score-is-already-using-it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/netflix/netflix-chief-claims-generative-ai-will-make-their-content-better-and-a-show-with-a-near-perfect-rotten-tomatoes-score-is-already-using-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">companies like Netflix see this as an absolute win</a></span>. We’re already seeing the devastating effects of people using programs as a replacement for human connection.

The world is getting dumber, and since the perpetuators of all this stupid shit are the ones in power, it’s growing harder to laugh at any of it, no matter how comically stupid it might be, because it’s impossible to ignore how it could all usher us into a slop-filled world where every expression of humanity is coded into an algorithm and turned into a program for someone else’s benefit.
