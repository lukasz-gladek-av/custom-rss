              <p>Entertainment upgrades can cost a pretty penny, whether you’re after a new screen or just want to add some nice speakers for fuller sound to your setup. That’s not the case today, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6881/">Right now, the 32-inch Insignia Class F20 Series smart Fire TV can be yours for just $70, after Amazon took a whopping 46% (or $60) off the usual price.</a> The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime shoppers. Delivery is free, too, so $70 is all you’ve got to pay. You might want to act fast, though. The retailer has marked this offer as a limited time one, so it’s likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6881/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great for Casual Viewing</h2>
<p>The 32-inch size isn’t huge, but it’s also not too small to make content feel cramped. It’s perfect for smaller living areas and also bedrooms if you want to catch up on shows in your cozy blanket. The modest 720p resolution offers bright, clear visuals for everything from shows to movies and games. Yes, it won’t match the level of Full HD or 4K picture quality, but it’s still better than standard definition, especially on a screen this size. Lower resolutions typically feel more noticeable on bigger screens, but it works just fine here. You’ll enjoy the latest TV shows, your all-time favorite movies, and even catch up with friends on video calls perfectly well!</p>
<p>Speaking of TV shows and movies, Fire TV integration offers instant access to thousands of popular streaming platforms, apps, and Alexa skills, including Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, YouTube, Apple TV+, Disney+, ESPN+, Sling TV, Paramount+, and other services. That translates into over 1.5 million movies and episodes ready to be watched. Some platforms require a subscription to get started, but a few free, ad-supported options are included, too. Maybe start the night with a classic thriller on Netflix, and switch to Prime Video later for a quick episode of a comedy show; the possibilities are endless.</p>



<p>There’s DTS Virtual-X sound to match the visuals. It’s an immersive sound format that delivers a three-dimensional audio that surrounds you. Expect footsteps, dialogs, whispers, mumbles, and laughter to come through clearly. Additionally, Alexa Voice Remote makes it easy to control content, adjust volume, switch inputs, and search across apps using just your voice. Just press and hold the microphone button on the remote to activate the assistant. You can say something like, “Alexa, show me the latest crime thrillers on Netflix”, or “Alexa, switch to Disney+”, without fiddling with the remote in the dark or getting up from your couch.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include two HDMI ports, composite (AV) jacks, digital optical output, USB port, headphone jack, coaxial jack, and Wi-Fi. This wide range lets you easily connect your home theater components, such as a Blu-ray player, game console, speakers, and cable, to the screen without feeling limited.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this 32-inch Insignia Smart Fire TV. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6881/">It normally sits at $130, which is already affordable, considering all that the screen offers. However, the current discount lets you pick one for just $70.</a> Grab it fast before it’s too late!</p>

              <p><em>FTL-</em>but-make-it-<em>40K</em> strategy roguelite <em>Void War</em> has been delisted from Steam for a very strange reason. The removal of the game from Valve’s store (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-game-pulled-from-steam-after-what-may-be-a-nuisance-dmca-takedown-from-a-troll-claiming-to-be-games-workshop"><em>IGN</em></a>) occurred after a DMCA takedown was purportedly sent by <em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>owners Games Workshop. Except it appears to have been written by <em>Firefly</em>‘s cowboy captain Mal Reynolds, who doesn’t work for Games Workshop on account of being a fictional character.</p> <p>It’s fair to say that&nbsp;<em>Void War</em> is not the most innovative of games. Very much inspired by 2012’s&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>, but delivered through the aesthetic (and a fair amount of the IP) of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, it’s the sort of indie project for which the word “derivative” was invented. Also, that sounds like a completely brilliant idea and I want to play it. Except right now I can’t do that via Steam, where the game’s store page has been removed. (It’s <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war">still available via Itch</a>, and ridiculously enough that comes with a Steam key that players are reporting still adds the game to your account.) <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/0/685243980153162137/">According to the indie game’s developers</a>, Tundra, this has happened because of a DMCA notice sent to Valve from Games Workshop over copyright infringement claims. Except, Tundra received no such communications from GW, and as parenthetically mentioned, the game remains available on Itch. So what’s going on?</p>

 <p>Tundra says that Valve’s evidence for the complaint from GW is “Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name ‘Mal Reynolds’.” The studio’s statement continues,</p> <blockquote><p>“We have not gotten any response from GW when we emailed that inbox. So right now we can’t independently verify who submitted it beyond what’s in the notice.</p> <p>We’re proceeding through the standard DMCA process to get the page back up, and we’ll post updates as soon as we have confirmed info.”</p></blockquote> <h2>Imperium Takedown</h2>   <p>Now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi5bOpBcD7g">Games Workshop is not shy</a> about <a href="https://copyrightaid.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3932">issuing DMCA notifications</a>, with some alleging this is performed by <a href="https://www.brandshield.com/">a third-party company’s AI</a> scouring the net for anything that might violate the company’s copyrights. Given the small scale of&nbsp;<em>Void War</em>, there’s a good chance it only survived this long because GW didn’t know about it, and it’s not impossible to imagine that this bogus takedown could result in the <em>Warhammer</em> corp turning its sights on the game. Heck, the owner of the Imperium also asks its own customers to snitch on copyright violations:</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663083" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663083"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663083">© Games Workshop / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>We’ve contacted Games Workshop to ask if the company has been involved at all, and indeed whether it currently employs space pirate Mal Reynolds to issue such takedowns. (Which would be a devastating fall for the once-proud rebel.)</p>

            <title><![CDATA[UGREEN’s Apple Find My Certified Tracker (4-Pack) Gets Cleared Out at an All-Time Low, Several Times Cheaper Than AirTags]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-apple-find-my-certified-tracker-4-pack-gets-cleared-out-at-an-all-time-low-several-times-cheaper-than-airtags-2000662875</link>

              <p>The last thing you want when you’re already running late is forgetting where you left your keys or wallet – again. Losing track of important stuff isn’t uncommon, but it is avoidable. An air tracker can be a true lifesaver in these situations, and you can now pick a pack of four without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6880/">Amazon has dropped the price of the 4-pack bundle of Ugreen FineTrack air tracker tags by 34%, offering it now for $23.</a> That works out to just over $5 per tracker. For comparison, Apple AirTags cost around $30 each, so you’re getting four with similar functionality for less than the price of one with this deal. It’s also a great time to snap more than one bundle to cover all your essentials without overpaying!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Track</h2>
<p>These mini trackers fit in the palm of your hand, and come with a built-in loop that makes it easy to attach them to keys, bags, and even your water bottle without needing extra accessories. Getting started is straightforward and doesn’t take much time. Simply pull out the insulation paper from the tracker, and press it for two seconds to turn it on. Enable “Find My” and Bluetooth on your iPhone. Then, head over to the “Items” page on the Find My app and click “Other supported items”. Locate the smart tracker and click Connect. You can now give your tracker a name, and it will be ready to use.</p>
<p>The tracker comes with a speaker built right into it. You can ring it using the Find My app to spot your essentials around the house. The alarm is quite loud, so you’ll hear it even when the tracker is buried under the cushions or is placed in another room. You even get a notification on your phone when you leave it behind and move out of the coverage range. This makes it easy to avoid forgetting essentials like your wallet in a cafe or your keys in a public restroom.</p>



<p>When something is out of the Bluetooth range of your phone, the Apple Find My network uses its vast ecosystem of Apple devices to provide the item’s latest location. If it still cannot be found, you can switch on Lost Mode and add your contact information. When the track is near an iPhone or Apple device in the Find My network, its location will automatically update in your app, and you will be notified immediately. Additionally, iOS 17 and later let you share your tracker’s location with family members, so everyone can keep an eye on the whereabouts of your luggage and more.</p>
<p>There’s an anti-tracking feature, too. With this, if someone else’s tracker finds its way into your stuff and the network notices that it’s traveling with you, it will send an alert on your phone. If you still can’t find it, the tracker will play a sound to let you know where it’s hiding.</p>
<p><strong>Ugreen’s Bluetooth trackers feature a replaceable battery that lasts up to 2 years</strong>. That means you can go up to 24 months without worrying about running out of it! When it’s time to replace, all you need to do is insert the included stuck needle into the dedicated hole from the top of the tag. Swap in a new battery with the positive side facing up, then align the cover into position and press until it’s closed. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6880/">You can now enjoy all these features (and ease of mind) for just $23. Be sure to grab the offer while the discount is still live!</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270</link>
            <guid>1416172</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Spending three hours with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span>, I wasn’t surprised to find that Capcom’s big 30th anniversary tentpole game feels like a Greatest Hits album for the long-running horror series. Between its two main characters’ shifting perspectives and the genre shakeups that come with them, </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>has a little bit of something for everyone.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>No matter what era of </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>you have the most attachment to, odds are you’ll get at least a fleeting glimpse of what first drew you to Spencer Mansion, Raccoon City, or anywhere else Capcom has sent Chris, Jill, Leon, and all these other poor saps who keep facing these zombie outbreaks with nothing but a handgun and a dream.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>You’d think that in an effort to please the folks who were drawn to the original game’s claustrophobic, isolating atmosphere, and the action aficionados who want to watch Leon do sick roundhouse kicks, </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>would feel like a discombobulated mismatch of disparate eras, but Capcom has put such a hard divide between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-leon-kennedy-is-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem-re9-game-awards-2000652755"><span>Leon’s over-the-top, campy action </span></a><span>and newcomer Grace’s methodical horror that swapping between them feels less like an interruption and more like enjoying the contrasting peanut butter and jelly in a Jill Sandwich.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662277">© Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I had already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849"><span>played a bit of Grace’s side</span></a><span> of the game, so I was particularly eager to get back in Leon’s combat boots. Leon’s third-person shooter segments are a stark contrast to Grace’s stealthy survival ones. Though Leon’s aim retains a bit of its shakiness from </span><i><span>Resident Evil 6</span></i><span>’, to the point where I found it useful to force myself to stop and shoot, </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>style, to line up my shots better, the man is an absolute tank, even in his old age. His action movie camp comes through not only in his cheesy one-liners but in just how silly and over the top his combat segments can get.</span></p>

 <p><span>The first Leon segment I played had the ex-Raccoon City cop arriving at the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center just as an outbreak of some unknown virus began spreading through the hospital. The hotel’s staff was rapidly turned into zombies, including one that swings a chainsaw around with reckless abandon. It was a close call, and I had to parry away the chainsaw with the hatchet I had on me a few times, but I managed to take him out with my handgun and the chainsaw fell to the floor…only for another zombie to pick it right back up and chase me around the arena’s corridors. This happened a few times before it finally hit me that </span><i><span>I</span></i><span> could pick up the chainsaw myself, and once I did that I made quick work of the remains of the horde.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Even when Leon is running low on ammo (an irregular occurrence in my time playing), dude just powers through zombies, almost like he’s done this before. The hatchet, which you can sharpen mid scrap, means you’re never without some tool at your disposal to take on even the biggest, most grotesque monstrosities in the hospital. Then, if you stun them with a well-placed gunshot or two, you can kick groups of zombies away to make space while you reload, run to a more fortified area, or pull out the whetstone. Or, if you’re lucky, you get an opening for one of Leon’s cunty-ass takedowns where he does some violent stunt that usually ends with a zombie losing its head and him doing a hair flip. Whether his back is against a wall or he’s tied up in a chair being interrogated, Leon always feels like he’s in control, and, in comparison, Grace’s sections are filled with long stretches of time in which you’re barely scraping by.</span></p> <p><span>I played one of Grace’s early segments last year and came away feeling like her sections were evocative of hide-and-seek games like Capcom’s 2005 hidden gem </span><i><span>Haunting Ground</span></i><span>. Now, having played about two hours as her, I can say that comparison was pretty apt. When I switched from Leon to Grace, the ex-cop gave a handgun to Grace in case she needed it, but while a gun in Leon’s hands is a weapon of mass destruction, in Grace’s, it’s…maybe more of a flyswatter?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>clearly wants you to view Leon and Grace as characters with different skillsets, but even so, it’s surprising just how differently the two play, even when using a similar tool. Grace’s segments are characterized by sneaking, puzzle-solving, and a dearth of bullets for the handgun. Using a full clip to try and kill a zombie is wasteful, and you’re better off firing a few warning shots into their head until they’re stunned enough for you to shove them to the ground and run past them. Grace does get some upgrades to her firepower and strength, but I’m doubtful she’ll reach the “walking tank” status of Leon by the end. </span></p> <p><span>The Grace section I played involved a lot of backtracking through the same area of the hospital for two hours, and I think I maybe actually killed only a handful of enemies in that time. Not from lack of trying, mind you. Bullets just don’t seem to hit as hard when they’re coming from Grace’s untrained hand. Navigating these spaces as </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s new heroine was more about remembering what threats were around each corner, and hoping I would be able to take advantage of the zombies’ one-track minds to get through unscathed.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662281">© Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Capcom says the dichotomy between Grace and Leon’s playstyles is meant to give the game a cadence of hours of tense atmosphere punctuated by flashes of violent catharsis, and that was most evident when I swapped back to Leon and walked through the same area I’d spent a long time sneaking around as Grace with a newfound confidence radiating from the shotgun in my hands. When playing as Grace, I kept finding cabinets that were “warped” beyond opening, and wondered why Capcom let me interact with them if they were all just going to be distractions, only to find that, when I returned here as Leon, they opened when I used my hatchet on them. These were never meant for her, and were instead a reminder that I would walk through these halls in a different context much later.</span></p>

 <p><span>Will these contrasting playstyles work over the course of a dozen hours, or will it make </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>one of the more uneven entries in a series already full of those? We’ll know when the game launches on February 27, but for now, I can get on board with a game that recognizes </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>has been a lot of things over the past 30 years and wants to pay tribute to eras old and new. </span></p>
