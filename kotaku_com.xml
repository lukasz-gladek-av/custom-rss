But what about the Switch 2? More than two-years after Microsoft and Nintendo entered into an agreement to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to Switch, nothing has materialized. Sources close to the matter tell <em>Kotaku</em> that both sides are still working on it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Microsoft and Nintendo have now negotiated and signed a binding 10-year legal agreement to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to Nintendo players—the same day as Xbox, with full features and content parity—so they can experience <em>Call of Duty</em> just as Xbox and PlayStation games enjoy <em>Call of Duty</em>,” Microsoft president Brad Smith <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1629180356359495680&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1629180356359495680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced back in February 2023</a></span>. We are committed to providing long term equal access to Call of Duty to other gaming platforms, bringing more choice to more players and more competition to the gaming market.” </p><p>That deal, the details of which have never been made public, was inked backed when Microsoft was trying to consolidate regulatory approval for its roughly $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. To assuage concerns that it might take one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world and make it exclusive to Xbox, Microsoft made agreements with other companies, including eventually Sony, promising that at least for the first 10 years it would continue bringing <em>Call of Duty</em> to other platforms, including ones it hadn’t been in years like the Switch.</p><p>So where is it? The list of platforms for <em>Black Ops 7</em> revealed today does not include Nintendo older hardware or the recently launched Switch 2, even though the latter has performance capability on par with the PlayStation 4, which is getting the game this fall. While sources tell <em>Kotaku</em> that both Microsoft and Nintendo are still committed to getting the franchise on the latter’s hardware, it’s unclear what the hold up is or what the final result will be. </p><p><em>Call of Duty </em>hasn’t appeared on a Nintendo platform since 2013's <em>Ghosts</em> came to the Wii U. While the ports of the multiplayer shooter never ran particularly great on the <em>Mario</em> maker’s underpowered consoles, it at least provided an option for fans to access the annual blockbuster. One obvious avenue for getting <em>Call of Duty</em> on weaker hardware is using cloud gaming. <em>Black Ops 6</em> is currently available to stream with Game Pass Ultimate but cloud gaming hasn’t been used to bring last year’s entry to Switch. </p><p><em>Black Ops 7</em> isn’t the only Microsoft first-party game that’s currently a no show on Switch 2. Despite the increased horsepower of the handheld hybrid, games like <em>Sea of Thieves </em>and <em>Grounded</em> which were previously ported to PS5 remain MIA. That might be because Microsoft doesn’t currently have plans to bring either of them over, or it could simply be that Nintendo wants to announce those plans on its own time. For now, the Switch 2 remains conspicuously absent from Microsoft’s recent multiplatform shift. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the Xbox event wasn’t full of big first-party reveals, we saw plenty of neat-looking games that showed the breadth and depth of the acquisition-spree and Game Pass supported Xbox bench, ranging from Double Fine’s next game to the reveal of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. </p><p>The hour-long showcase followed by a deep-dive into <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-xbox-80-price-tag-sgf-rpg-mario-kart-1851784014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-xbox-80-price-tag-sgf-rpg-mario-kart-1851784014">which will be Microsoft’s first $80 game</a></span>) also included plenty of surprises from outside the world of Xbox. <em>Persona 4</em> is getting a remake, though Atlus barely showed anything from it. And a personal favorite indie platformer of mine, <em>Planet of Lana</em>, is getting a beautiful-looking sequel. Plus <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is finally coming to Xbox. It only took nearly six years and Square Enix hemorrhaging money to make that happen. Plus Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer capped everything off with a fun tease for what certainly sounds like a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975">remaster of<em> Halo: Combat Evolved</em></a></span>. </p></div></div><div><p>Obsidian Entertainment’s sci-fi shooter RPG got a new story trailer showing its bigger scope and grander stakes. The new launch date positions it as Microsoft’s big non-<em>Call of Duty </em>game this fall, though it will also be day-and-date on PS5. </p></div><div><p> More guns, more quips, and a bigger, bolder-looking sci-fi playground to mess around in. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-trailer-teaser-xbox-game-pass-sgf-2025-1851783996&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-trailer-teaser-xbox-game-pass-sgf-2025-1851783996"><em>High on Life 2</em></a></span><em> </em>brings the comedic,<em> Rick and Morty</em>-esque alien romp to Xbox in the near future (sans Justin Roiland this time). </p></div><div><p><em>A Plague Tale</em> is getting mythical. The cinematic stealth adventure series is getting a prequel that looks a bit more action-focused and will dive into the smuggler Sophia’s past as she embarks on a quest on the Minotaur’s Island. <em>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</em> is set to arrive in 2026. </p></div><div><p> Everything’s an Xbox, but this PC gaming portable is REALLY an Xbox. That was Microsoft’s messaging around its reveal of the Xbox ROG Ally and Ally X, the platform’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">new plunge yet into the world of high-end portable gaming</a></span>. There’s no price or release date yet, but Microsoft is hyping it up as its latest hardware launch in partnership with Asus and promising a seamless console to PC to handheld experience across the Xbox ecosystem. </p></div><div><p> What if The Witcher was more action game than RPG and led by a vampire that could walk up walls and do other cool stuff at night? <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em> is from Rebel Wolves,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blood-dawnwalker-trailer-rpg-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2077-1851739294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blood-dawnwalker-trailer-rpg-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2077-1851739294"> a studio led by some ex-CD Projekt Red devs that’s creating a new fantasy sandbox</a></span>. It looks a bit dark, like literally I had trouble seeing some of the stuff in the trailer, but the vibes are perfect. </p></div><div><p> Sluggerfly and Headup Games are working together on a sequel to the iconic side-scrolling platformer that looks like its cooking up all sorts of new ways to kill and torment players. It’s scheduled to release in 2026. </p></div><div><p> The latest look at <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-ryu-xbox-game-pass-release-date-1851746372&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-ryu-xbox-game-pass-release-date-1851746372">announced earlier this year</a></span>, included slick new combat mechanics and boss fights while also shedding more light on the swirl of mystery surrounding the fate of the franchise’s legendary Ryu Hayabusa and what that has to do with a near-future Tokyo taken over by evil demons. It’s landing right in that fall release sweet spot recently exited by <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. </p></div><div><p> Arriving September 4, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-locks-doors-breath-1851718447?_gl=1*13a075l*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk0MTIzMzQkbzI4NCRnMSR0MTc0OTQxMzc1NiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-locks-doors-breath-1851718447?_gl=1*13a075l*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk0MTIzMzQkbzI4NCRnMSR0MTc0OTQxMzc1NiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">the <em>Indiana Jones</em> expansion</a></span> explores the story behind the Nephilim Order and takes players to Italy’s capital, including a stealth mission set in The Vatican. It’ll seemingly be out day-and-date on PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox and PC. I hope you get to punch more Nazis. </p></div><div><p><em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is a fantastical third-person action game about taking out bosses using very <em>Souls</em>-looking combat. How does the Japanese studio find the time between all of its other <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-game-freak-switch-2-upgrade-fee-kalos-1851782651?_gl=1*jfcnyk*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk0MTIzMzQkbzI4NCRnMSR0MTc0OTQxMzc4MyRqMzMkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-game-freak-switch-2-upgrade-fee-kalos-1851782651?_gl=1*jfcnyk*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk0MTIzMzQkbzI4NCRnMSR0MTc0OTQxMzc4MyRqMzMkbDAkaDA."><em>Pokémon</em> sequels and spin-offs</a></span>? Beast of Reincarnation puts you in the shoes of cursed outcast Emma as she battles giant monsters in post-apocalyptic Japan. I’m <em>Souls</em>-ed out but maybe this one will have the juice, or actually turn out to be more of a classic arcade action game than a FromSoftware-inspired dodge-fest. </p></div><div><p><em>Clockwork Revolution</em> is a <em>BioShock</em>-looking immersive action-RPG where everyone is having fun with their cockney accents. I was hoping for a release window but it seems to be shaping up nicely. The core mechanic is the power to manipulate time to fight enemies or solve puzzles by visually altering the environment. Players will also have an arsenal of gadgets, weapons, and a companion steampunk drones called Prentice.</p></div><div><p> The <em>Honey, I Shrunk The Kids</em>-style survival sim is getting what looks like a bigger, more polished sequel Grounded 2 is coming to Xbox and PC via Early Access on July 29 with new systems, bugs, and stories to tell. How is Obsidian releasing three games this year? Well for this one it’s getting help from <em>Deus Ex</em> maker Eidos-Montréal. </p></div><div><p>Bloober Team is wasting no time doubling-down on the third-person action survival horror genre. Following its dutiful remake of Silent Hill 2, <em>Cronos: The New Dawn </em>arrives just one year later. Players have to travel through time to save humanity from crippling horrors of the past. It looks incredibly eerie as long as it can sport polished gameplay to match. </p></div><div><p><em>The Elder Scrolls Online: Seasons of the Worm Cult Part 1 </em>and update 46 go live on June 18. While that bit continues story quests from the game’s first year a decade ago, <em>ESO</em> is also getting it’s first world altering in-game event in October. </p></div><div><p>The cinematic action puzzle game promises to make players utilize solutions based in real-world science to survive after crash landing on a giant rock of ice. There will be platforming and stealth as players uncover the mystery haunting the frosty planet of Persephone.</p></div><div><p>Become an interior decorator who also hunt ghosts in this cozy sim where you can use a vacuum gun to suck up books or magically arrange them perfectly back on the shelf. </p></div><div><p> Heavenly Spear brings the Japanese Pantheon to the real-time strategy game in the fall. In addition to 12 new gods with unique powers there will be a new 12-mission campaign as well.</p></div><div><p> MUDANG could be all Unreal Engine 5 flash and no tactical gameplay substance, but it seems like it at least has a shot of filing the stealth takedown void left by Splinter Cell. Intriguingly, you play as a bunch of different characters ranging from a as a North Korean special forces operative to a K-pop idol.</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Planet of Lana </em>was excellent, and had some of the best visual flourishes of any 2D cinematic action game, but it was easy to underrate it as just “another good one of those,” so it’s rad to see <em>Planet of Lana 2</em> is happening and only a year away.</p></div><div><p> “Gone Fission” is <em>Fallout 76</em>'s latest life sim update adding all sorts of fishing rods to customize and fish heads to collect as players in the Wasteland continue to thrive years after the shooter MMO’s rocky launch. It’s live across all platforms starting today.</p></div><div><p><em>Solo Leveling</em> is a “global phenomenon” based on a “hit webtoon.” If you, like me, were also unaware of that, just know that <em>Arise Overdrive</em> is an anime action-RPG you can play with friends. It’s coming to PC in 2025 and Xbox in 2026. </p></div><div><p>No, it’s not<em> Palword</em>, but it sure does have that energy!<em> Aniimo</em> will arrive next year and looks like another survival game with fun creatures to befriend, except you can take control of them directly in this game instead of putting them into indentured servitude. </p></div><div><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> isn’t out until July 11 but there’s a demo you can start playing today.</p></div><div><p>Unlike <em>Spiritfarer</em>, the excellent narrative cozy sim about death, <em>At Fate’s End</em> is an action game where you solve emotional trauma with duels. It looks very tight. </p></div><div><p> Prepare for all your sweaty Xbox friends to chainsaw you in half when <em>Gears of War </em>multiplayer gets its pre-release betas stating June 13. A new trailer, meanwhile, showed off the extra enhancements going into the modern, multiplatform remaster. </p></div><div><p>The rumored remake of <em>Persona 4</em>, whose excellent <em>Golden</em> port only just arrived On Switch not too long ago, exists and is coming...eventually. Atlus teased fans with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-4-revival-trailer-teaser-remake-jrpg-xbox-ps5-1851784003&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-4-revival-trailer-teaser-remake-jrpg-xbox-ps5-1851784003">the briefest of glimpses</a></span> of at the PS2 game’s completely overhauled world and graphics. Considering how good the<em> Persona 3</em> remake was, I have high hopes. </p></div><div><p>Sea of Thieves season 17 arrives in August with an emphasis on explosives. Players can recruit new pirate allies to salvage for new weapons. It really feels like the game should be on <em>Switch 2</em> after it came to PS5 last year but Microsoft hasn’t announced a port yet. </p></div><div><p>Mark, Thula, Bulletproof, Atom Eve and more will square off in a 3v3 tag fighting game based on the hit comic series that’s also a gore-filled cartoon. The series first made its fighting game debut with Omni man’s cameo in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. <br></p></div><div><p>Fans have been waiting so long that some had given up all hope that Square Enix’s exclusivity deals with Sony for <em>Final Fantasy </em>would ever expire. But it turns out the biggest entries in the franchise in recent years will come to Microsoft’s platform after all starting with <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>which shadow dropped today. The wait isn’t quite over just yet for <em>FFVII Remake Intergrade</em> though. That one arrives this winter.<br></p></div><div><p>Double Fine’s next game is just a month away. <em>Keeper</em> tells a story with no words about a light house and sea bird going on a journey of self-discovery. It’s out October 17. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a7eabe142c3deb449a8dd4772c26b5cc" data-recommend-id="image://a7eabe142c3deb449a8dd4772c26b5cc" data-format="png" data-width="1036" data-height="568" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Phil Spencer appears at the Xbox showcase.
