              <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <em>Battlefield 6</em> recently, and during nearly every session, my friends and I run into at least one group of players taking advantage of an easy-to-pull-off drone glitch that lets you get to areas that are normally impossible to reach. It’s been a problem basically since EA’s FPS launched last month, and it’s shocking that it’s still an issue weeks later.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched on October 10. And less than a week later, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o83uar/friends_reaction_to_the_drone_exploit_is_priceless/">there were already posts on Reddit</a> of people using a newly discovered glitch to reach rooftops that shouldn’t be accessible on maps like Iberian Offensive. All you have to do is have a recon player plop down their remote drone, get another player (or two) to stand on the drone, and then smack it with the sledgehammer as the drone flies up. This will send the players and the drone upward, allowing people to then hop off the drone onto roofs, towers, and other out-of-the-way spots easily. Then squadmates can spawn on that player, drop ammo, respawn beacons, and rain lead and explosives down on players below who have very limited ways to counter.</p>

  <p>After numerous <em>Battlefield 6</em> updates and patches, nearly four weeks after it was discovered, the drone glitch is still a problem. The bug isn’t useful on every map or mode, but it can ruin certain maps if many squads are doing the glitch. I played one match where running around on the ground was like exploring a ghost town, as most players were drone glitching and sniping.</p>

 <p>Another recent match with friends on Iberian Offensive saw two enemy squads use the drone glitch to start racking up kills. Eventually, we decided to become rooftop police and used the glitch ourselves to hunt the other players down, and then hid a beacon up there so we could periodically check in and make sure they weren’t using the drone glitch. It was kind of funny, but when it happened again after that night, we were all so tired of it. Players in chat were also fed up, sharing angry messages about how it was annoying that EA and Battlefield Studios hadn’t fixed this bug or at least turned off the sledgehammer or drone while a fix is developed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oj4ai3/drone_exploit_is_still_in_the_game_i_have_no_words/">You can find similar posts on the BF subreddit</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq26f/this_glitch_is_ruining_battlefield_6_experience/">where players frequently complain</a> that the bug is still a problem after weeks of <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/battlefield-6-bug-reports-en/drone-glitch---iberian-offensive-map---to-fix/12874527">players sharing videos and screenshots of it in action.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>At the very least, we know the drone glitch is going to be removed eventually. On November 5, <em>Battlefield 6</em> lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986037795308343366">confirmed that it had been fixed</a> and that the fix would be applied in <em>BF6</em>‘s next patch. He wouldn’t say when to expect that patch, but considering how frequently EA has been updating the shooter since launch, I doubt the wait will be long. And that’s great, as <em>BF6</em>‘s drone glitch has been a problem for too long.</p>
