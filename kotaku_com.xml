              <p>LEGO has endured for a reason. It’s rare to find a brand that speaks just as clearly to kids exploring creativity and adults rediscovering it later in life. There’s something calming about opening a LEGO box, dropping out all the individual pieces across the carpet, sorting them out, and then getting started with the build. I personally like to pop on music or a podcast as I connect brick to brick, zoning out for a bit and enjoying the break from every day life for a moment.</p>
<p>Though putting together LEGO doesn’t have to be a lonely activity. It’s something you and your partner can do together, perhaps even as a Valentine’s Day date at home. And LEGO has the perfect set for the occasion. This art collectible set spells out in four letters, L-O-V-E to remind each other why you’re doing it. Show you love someone by gifting them this home decor LEGO set, then putting it together with them. It even happens to be one sale ahead of the special holiday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">Normally sold for $80, it’s now marked down 20%. That ends up shaving off $16, bringing the price to just $64 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Celebration of an Icon</h2>
<p>Now this isn’t just some design LEGO cooked up themselves. This is based on artist Robert Indiana’s iconic pop art. He first created it as a card back in 1964. Later in 1970, he adapted it into a 144-inch tall sculpture, now located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. Since then, many different incarnations have been created, finding homes in cities including Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, but now potentially your living room too.</p>
<p>This 791-piece LEGO set is thankfully not as tall as the original. No, this one only measures in at a humble 10 inches tall by 10 inches wide, by 2.5 inches deep. It has the same vibrant red, blue and green colors. Just looking at pictures of this has me wondering when LEGO is going to make a set of the Nintendo 64 start-up screen logo. One day, hopefully.</p>



<h2>Build With a Loved One</h2>
<p>Really leaning into the Valentine’s Day theming of this set, it is even packed with two copies of the instructions, encouraging couples or duos of any kinds to work together on the build.</p>
<p>The set is even popular enough that a number of third party vendors on Amazon are selling <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6895/">LED kits custom made to line up with the outer edge of each letter, turning your lovely LEGO set into a cute lamp.</a></p>

              <p>As spotted by the fine folks over at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-switch-online-gamecube-releases-might-have-been-leaked"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a>, it appears Walmart may have rather given away a couple of big Nintendo secrets. On the retail giant’s <a href="https://www.walmart.com/brand/nintendo/10030719">Nintendo section of its website</a> there’s a section called “Unlock more” which sells you a $35 gift card unlocking the Nintendo Online Family Membership subscription deal. The image promoting this looks like the usual array of box covers used by Nintendo, except in among them appears two games we didn’t know were on the way, and they’re doozies.</p> <p>Between the likes of all-time classics like <em>F-Zero</em>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong: Country</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 64</em> are GameCube games&nbsp;<em>Pikmin 2</em> and&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime: Echoes</em>. Neither are listed among Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-gamecube-nintendo-classics-switch-2/">GameCube collection</a> for the subscription service, which currently includes just eight games, most recently adding&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663433"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663433">© Walmart / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>GameCube games are exclusive to the Switch 2 version of the ludicrously named Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, so the small number of games added over what’s rapidly becoming the first year of the new console has been pretty disappointing. It certainly offers some stone-cold classics, like&nbsp;<em>SoulCailbur II</em>,&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Windwaker</em> and&nbsp;<em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, but it’s perhaps harder to get overly excited about&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Srtikers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo: Plug Into Adventure!</em> Given Nintendo could already have included <em>Zelda: Twilight Princess</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>, they do seem very odd choices.</p> <p>Of course, a lot of the best Nintendo-published GameCube games become tricky prospects for the company to add, as Nintendo’s endless recycling of its properties becomes a little starkly revealed if it does. <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Party 4, 5, 6 </em>and<em> 7</em>,&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Mario Power Tennis</em>,&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime</em>,&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em>,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>…any of them might eat into attempts to sell either recent remasters or current sequels.</p>

 <p>Even the two Walmart has seemingly revealed are on the edge of this phenomenon, although a <em>Pikmin 5&nbsp;</em>appears to still only exist in Miyamoto’s animation-obsessed mind, and perhaps the addition of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime II</em> suggests we’re not likely to see a remaster of the sequel any time soon. Given just how brilliantly 2023’s <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> worked out, that’s a proper shame if the case.</p>

 <p>Let’s hope these two titles are for real, and not just an over-excited Walmart employee getting slap-happy with Photoshop. Given the image is still up on Walmart’s site many hours after&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Life</em> broke the story it seems Nintendo hasn’t scrambled, although it could be because everyone involved is in bed.</p>
