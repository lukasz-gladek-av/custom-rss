            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="98" data-end="647">If you spend a lot of time gaming on a PlayStation 5, now might be one of the best moments all year to give your console a serious storage upgrade. Seagate has quietly rolled out discounts on one of its officially licensed PS5 expansion SSDs ahead of Black Friday, and the savings are pretty substantial. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5846/">Right now, the 2TB Game Drive PS5 NVMe SSD—complete with a built-in heatsink for PlayStation 5 compatibility—is going for 21% off.</a> Instead of its usual $215 price tag, it’s temporarily down to $170, which is a solid $45 cut for a drive that’s tailor-made for Sony’s latest console.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5846/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="98" data-end="647">Triple Your Games Downloaded</h2>
<p data-start="649" data-end="1250">Anyone who owns a launch PS5 is probably familiar this one drawback… the built-in storage fills up fast. Although Sony advertises an 825GB internal drive, a good chunk of that space is reserved for system software, leaving you with about 667GB for your actual games. Considering that many modern titles push well past the 100GB mark, it doesn’t take long before you’re staring at that “storage full” message yet again. Adding a Seagate Game Drive more than triples your usable space, which means far fewer hard choices about which games to delete when something new drops.</p>
<p data-start="1252" data-end="1751">Performance-wise, these SSDs keep up with the specs needed to support use with a PlayStation 5 (it is officially licensed Afterall). With read speeds reaching up to 7,300 MB/s and write speeds reaching up to 6,000 MB/s, they’re more than capable of handling the PS5’s fast load times. Games launch quickly, transitions feel smoother, and you can keep your entire library at your fingertips instead of constantly juggling downloads.</p>


<p data-start="1252" data-end="1751">The custom heatsink is there to help minimize thermal throttling so your PS5 can maintain peak performance over long play sessions. It’s also marked with the official PlayStation logo, though you’ll never see that again after installing.</p>
<p data-start="1753" data-end="2465">Seagate is also sweetening the deal with a little bonus. Every purchase includes a 14-day trial of PlayStation Plus Premium. That gives you access to a huge catalog of games you can immediately start downloading to that new drive. If you want to dive into something big, you can try titles like <em data-start="2048" data-end="2064">Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em data-start="2068" data-end="2090">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> without spending an extra dime. And if you prefer something a bit more offbeat, consider checking out <em data-start="2193" data-end="2218">Another Crab’s Treasure</em>. It’s a quirky indie take on the souls-like formula, blending colorful, retro-inspired visuals with surprisingly challenging combat. For anyone who hasn’t dipped into <em data-start="2388" data-end="2400">Dark Souls</em>-style games yet, it’s a wonderfully approachable starting point.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-quietly-dumps-ipad-air-on-amazon-only-selling-for-pocket-change-where-early-buyers-wont-look-2000646655</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-quietly-dumps-ipad-air-on-amazon-only-selling-for-pocket-change-where-early-buyers-won%E2%80%99t-look.1362115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple never does Black Friday sales on its site or in its retail stores, instead quietly passing discounts through Amazon. For example, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/">iPad Air 11-inch with M3 chip, 128GB storage and WiFi connectivity just hit an all-time low of $449 from the usual $599 price tag</a>.</p>
<p>This model fits perfectly between the base iPad and the Pro lineup and<strong> gives you pro-level performance with the M3 chip without paying for the OLED display and extra features</strong> most people never use. You get Apple Intelligence baked in, a gorgeous Liquid Retina screen, and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. This Black Friday deal makes the iPad Air the obvious choice if you need more power than the base iPad offers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M3 Performance Meets Everyday Portability</h2>
<p>The M3 chip provides desktop-class performance, <strong>all in an 11-inch tablet that weighs just over a pound</strong>. It’s the same processor architecture that lies at the heart of MacBook Air laptops for smooth multitasking across demanding apps and graphic-intensive games. You can edit 4K video, work with multiple layers in photo editing apps, and run complex productivity software without slowdowns. The chip also enables Apple Intelligence, which helps you write better, organize information, and get tasks done faster with AI features built directly into the operating system.<strong> All-day battery life</strong> means you can work through meetings, flights, and coffee shop sessions without hunting for an outlet.</p>



<p>This <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display offers razor-sharp visuals</strong>&nbsp;including P3 wide color gamut and True Tone technology. Colors appear accurate whether you’re editing photos, watching movies, or reviewing design mockups. <strong>Ultralow reflectivity coating</strong> keeps glare down in very bright locations like outdoor patios or offices with big windows. It <strong>refreshes the screen at 60Hz</strong> which is otherwise fast enough for just about everything one would do on an iPad despite lacking the 120Hz ProMotion smoothness of the Pros.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6E connects to the latest router technology for faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments. The 6GHz band reduces interference from neighboring networks and translates into more stable connections during video calls and quicker file transfers. The USB-C port takes care of charging, data transfer, and connections to external displays or storage drives.</p>



<p>The 12MP front camera features Center Stage technology and allows the camera to automatically pan and zoom during video calls, keeping you properly centered as you move about. That shines during presentations or family calls when you need to move naturally. The rear 12MP camera takes sharp photos and 4K video, making it surprisingly capable for document scanning and quick content creation.</p>
<p>The iPad Air slots between the $349 base iPad with its older A14 chip and the $999 iPad Pro with its OLED screen and M4 processor. You get the modern M3 chip and Apple Intelligence features the base model lacks but you skip the premium display tech and extra cameras most folks don’t need. At $449, this configuration delivers pro-level performance at a price that makes sense for anyone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Pushes the TP-Link WiFi Extender to Peanuts as It Dumps Remaining Stock After 10K+ Sold Last Month]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-pushes-the-tp-link-wifi-extender-to-peanuts-as-it-dumps-remaining-stock-after-10k-sold-last-month-2000645602</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-pushes-the-tp-link-wifi-extender-to-peanuts-as-it-dumps-remaining-stock-after-10k-sold-last-month.1362109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Pictures taking minutes to download? Social media feed doesn’t refresh as much as it should? Struggling to send messages? That’s not just frustrating, but can also affect your productivity when you’re trying to work or study at home. Heck, it even makes relaxing while watching some fun reels hard. If you have been facing all this and more while paying for speedy internet, the issue might not be with your internet service provider, but something at home – the router.</p>
<p>This is especially common in bigger homes, where everyone is trying to enjoy a fast, stable connection (as they should). The solution is simple. A WiFi extender can provide the boost you’re looking for, and these devices aren’t really on the expensive side, either. Most standard options sit around or under $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/">Thanks to an early Black Friday sale, the TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender has dropped by 37%</a>. It normally retails for $30, but after the discount, you can snap it up for just $19. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast, which also shows how common the slow internet issue is. It’s best to grab it as soon as you can, since we don’t expect it to drop any further during the main event. In fact, there’s a good chance the stock will run out by then.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No More Dead Zones</h2>
<p>One thing to note before proceeding is that WiFi extenders are made to improve/increase the WiFi coverage around your house, so they won’t have an effect on the internet speed directly. In most cases, getting stronger signals gives you the performance you’re paying for, but if there’s a speed issue on your internet provider’s end, it won’t fix that.</p>
<p>This extender offers coverage up to 1600 sq. ft., which makes it great for apartments, condos, and even homes. There are two adjustable external antennas that offer a reliable connection and fast speeds to up to 32 devices at the same time. You can connect your smartphone, laptop, tablet, computer, gaming consoles, and more, and still enjoy an impressive, strong connection on each.</p>



<p>Dual-band support gets you speeds of up to 300 Mbps on 2.4GHz and 867 Mbps on 5GHz, which means a combined 1.2 Gbps of total bandwidth. That translates into much faster browsing, lag-free streaming, better video calls, and more efficient gaming. Want an even stronger connection on one of your devices? There’s a fast Ethernet port for an improved wireless connection. This comes in handy for when you want to play a game or hop on an important video call and don’t want to leave anything to chance.</p>
<p>Access Point Mode support lets you convert a wired internet line into a WiFi hotspot, while EasyMesh compatibility lets you expand the network by connecting the extender to any EasyMesh-compatible router for a bigger setup.</p>
<p>Setting things up is quite straightforward. TP-Link’s intelligent signal indicator helps you find the ideal place to position your extender for maximum coverage. Once you have installed it into place, head over to the TP-Link Tether app on your phone and follow the on-screen instructions to get started. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to get everything going, even if it’s your first time doing this!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/">It was already quite affordable at $30, but this deal lets you grab it for $19.</a> That’s practically nothing, considering the features and peace of mind it gets you. It’s better to get your orders in quickly, as the price can shoot back up anytime.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackery-decided-margins-dont-matter-300w-power-station-now-cheaper-than-fancy-power-banks-2000646676</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Jackery Explorer 300 has become the <strong>best-selling portable power station on Amazon this Black Friday</strong>, and here’s why. This compact unit creates backup power during winter outages, camping trips and emergencies and only <strong>weighs a mere 7.1 pounds</strong>.</p>
<p>And the good news is, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/">just dropped it to an all-time low of $159 from its usual $259 price tag</a>. The 293Wh lithium-ion battery packs enough capacity to charge laptops, phones and small appliances without requiring a noisy gas generator.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious power in a grab-and-go package</h2>
<p>The 293Wh battery capacity gives you real runtime that you can actually plan around. You will have enough to <strong>recharge a smartphone about 24 times</strong>, power a laptop for about 4 to 5 hours, or run a small LED light for days.<strong> Two Pure Sine Wave AC outlets deliver clean 300W power</strong> that’s safe for sensitive electronics like medical devices and modern computers. Pure sine wave output matches the quality of electricity from your wall outlets to prevent the voltage spikes and fluctuations that damage equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Recharging takes just 2 hours to reach 80% capacity</strong> when you plug into a wall outlet and use the 60W PD USB-C port simultaneously. This dual-charging approach gets the battery ready fast when you need to head out quickly. You can also recharge through your car’s 12V outlet during road trips, slowly building capacity while you drive.</p>



<p><strong>Six output ports</strong> support multiple devices simultaneously with no need for adapters or splitters. Two AC outlets power standard household devices such as fans, portable heaters, or small appliances. A <strong>60W PD USB-C port</strong> quickly charges laptops, tablets, and modern smartphones and can double as an input to recharge the power station itself. A Quick Charge 3.0 USB-A port supports rapid charging in compatible phones and accessories. Additionally, <strong>a standard USB-A port</strong> supports older devices, and the DC car port powers 12V equipment such as portable coolers or tire inflators.</p>
<p>At 7.1 pounds, this power station is really portable compared to the much heavier models that require two hands to carry. You can grab it with one hand and move it around your campsite, vehicle, or home during power outages. The compact footprint fits within car trunks, under seats, or within closets without occupying any valuable space.</p>



<p>Winter power outages become less stressful when you have backup power for essential devices. You can keep your phone charged to stay connected, power a small space heater for warmth, or run medical equipment that can’t go offline. Silent operation means you can use it indoors without the noise and exhaust fumes of gas generators. An LCD screen displays remaining battery percentage, input/output wattage, and charging status at a glance, so you always know how much power you have left.</p>
<p>At $159 during Black Friday, this portable power station provides peace of mind and practical backup power for $100 less than usual. You’re getting enough capacity for emergency situations and weekend camping trips in a package that actually stays portable.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/shokz-openfit-2-headphones-feels-practically-free-compared-to-past-prices-likely-black-friday-clear-out-2000645845</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shokz-openfit-2-headphones-feels-practically-free-compared-to-past-prices-likely-black-friday-clear-out.1362097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over-ear and noise-canceling headphones are not for everyone. Sure, these block all external noise for a more immersive experience, but if you prefer a more minimal design and like to stay aware of your surroundings, in-ear headphones can be a better fit for you. Best of all, now is a great time to treat yourself to a top-rated option without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a week away, but you don’t have to wait till then to start saving. Almost all big retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart are offering plenty of early deals already, and we’re spotting deep discounts on some of the best earbuds out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5843/">Amazon, in particular, is being the most generous right now and has dropped the price of Shokz OpenFit 2 to just $125.</a> That’s after a nice 31% discount on the usual price of $180, and the deal applies to the black option. It’s open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their orders, as well.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to grab yourself a pair, it’s best to do it as soon as you can, as early deals tend to disappear fast. We’re not expecting this one to last more than a couple of days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5843/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable to Wear, Plus Powerful</h2>
<p>This pair is super lightweight and comfortable to wear. Each earbud weighs just 9.4g, and is designed using Shokz Ultra-Soft Silicon 2.0 for a natural fit. The flexible nickel-titanium ear hooks contour to your ears for a personalized fit, meaning you can wear them for hours without feeling uneasy. The secure fit also makes them great for physical activities like workouts or runs, as you won’t have to constantly worry about them slipping and falling out.</p>
<p>There are multifunction buttons on the earbuds that let you adjust volume, manage music, take calls, and more with a single tap, without reaching out for your phone. As for the performance, you will enjoy detailed, rich sound that’s made possible with the Shokz DualBoost composite drivers and OpenBass 2.0 algorithm. Expect bass to remain clear and deep even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. Songs will come to life, and podcasts will feel more engaging. In fact, calls will get better, too. The four built-in beamforming microphones are paired with smart noise canceling technology and AI algorithms to cut out the background noise as you hop on meetings or catch up with friends; great for when you’re out and about.</p>



<p>Battery life is better than any other option in this range. A full charge gives you 48 whole hours of continuous jamming with the charging case. Without it, you can enjoy 11 hours of battery in total. Running low and don’t have the time to fully juice them up? No worries. A quick 10-minute top-up gets you an additional two hours of listening.</p>
<p>Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds also offer IP55-rated water resistance, so sweat while working out or light rain on the way back home won’t hurt. Multipoint pairing is supported as well, which means you can connect to up to two devices at the same time, and switch between them within seconds. Those who prefer having a bit more control over their music will appreciate how the Shokz app lets you tailor your listening experience with four preset EQ modes or create your own. You can also customize the physical button’s actions through the app.</p>
<p>A handy carrying case is thrown in for free with your purchase, too! Just place your order before the sale expires or the stock runs out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-g305-gaming-mouse-goes-for-pocket-change-amazon-dumps-leftover-stock-for-black-friday-2000646646</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no reason gamers need to spend big bucks on a Logitech MX Master for office productivity when all they want is pure gaming performance. The <strong>G305 Lightspeed mouse</strong> delivers everything competitive players actually need without the ergonomic bells and whistles you’d use for spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Right now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/">it’s hit an all-time low at $27 on Amazon, down from its usual $49 price tag for Black Friday</a>. This wireless gaming mouse packs Logitech’s Hero 12K sensor, Lightspeed wireless technology with 1ms response time and runs for 250 hours on a single AA battery.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wireless That Performs Like Wired</h2>
<p>Lightspeed wireless technology eliminates the lag that plagued older wireless mice. The <strong>1ms report rate matches what you’d get from a wired connection</strong> which means your cursor moves exactly when you move the mouse. You won’t notice any delay during flick shots or quick building edits in competitive games. The wireless receiver stores inside the mouse body when you’re traveling, so you won’t lose that tiny USB dongle in your bag.</p>



<p>The <strong>Hero 12K sensor tracks up to 400 IPS</strong> and offers <strong>adjustable sensitivity up to 12,000 DPI</strong>. High IPS ratings come in handy when one is making fast swipes across the mousepad in the heat of an intense firefight. It retains its accuracy even when you’re making those swift moves that would confuse cheaper optical sensors. You’ll be able to dial in your preferred DPI settings and save them to the mouse’s onboard memory.</p>
<p>The <strong>weight of 99 grams keeps the mouse agile</strong> without feeling cheap or flimsy. Lightweight mice reduce fatigue during marathon gaming sessions and allow for easier and quicker adjustments. Pro players who want to shave off even more remove the AA battery cover and install much lighter AAA batteries with foil adapters to do so. The shape works well for different grip styles from palm to claw down to fingertip, though smaller hands might find it more comfortable than larger ones.</p>



<p><strong>Six programmable buttons</strong> are enough to provide options for most games without overcomplicating the design. You can use Logitech’s G Hub software to map things like abilities, building modes, or weapon swaps to the side buttons. Your button configurations are stored in the onboard memory, so you don’t need to install software on every computer you’re using it with.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life extends to 250 hours of continuous use on a single AA battery</strong>. You can game for months before needing to swap batteries, and the mouse warns you when power runs low. Using standard AA batteries means you can grab replacements anywhere instead of hunting for proprietary charging cables. This extended battery life is possible without sacrificing tracking performance thanks to the efficient Hero sensor.</p>
<p>At $27, this mouse delivers professional-level wireless performance for less than half its normal price. You’re getting the same sensor and wireless tech that Logitech puts in its $150 flagship mice.</p>

              <p>Space (or the universe as a whole) never ceases to amaze me, and I’m sure it’s the same for everyone who likes looking up at the sky and wondering about all that could be out there. Well, a couple of us (humans) have actually been to the moon, and while the rest can’t exactly visit it as of now, there’s definitely a way to celebrate one of our biggest celestial achievements by bringing the iconic rover from the Apollo 17 mission home.</p>
<p>Lego’s Technic NASA Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle LRV building set lets you build a detailed replica of the rover, plus includes a wealth of accessories to pay the mission a tribute. On a regular day, this set would run you around $220, which isn’t exactly budget-friendly, but that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5842/">Thanks to an early Black Friday deal, you can grab it for $154, after a whopping 30% off its retail price.</a></p>
<p>The discount is available to all shoppers, whether you’re a Prime member or not. There are no long coupons to worry about, and no complicated procedures to follow. The catch? The deal is selling out fast, which means it’s likely going to wrap up soon. If you’re a space freak, now is the time to build your very own collection of NASA-themed builds. Have an enthusiast in your life who just can’t stop talking about all the cool possibilities out there? Gift it to them for holidays; it’s going to make their entire year!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5842/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Authentic Details</h2>
<p>At this point, I am convinced there is a Lego set for every cool thing that exists out there; which is a good thing. This set, in particular, isn’t really a small one. You’re getting 1,913 pieces in total, but don’t let that overwhelm you. Building it is going to be fun, and you can even invite friends over to join the project!</p>
<p>The model, once made, measures over 5.5 in. (14 cm) high, 15 in. (38 cm) long, and 10 in. (25 cm) wide, so it’s going to be display-worthy. You will be building the main rover with its seats, steering, suspension, and scientific tools, plus three detailed equipment attachments. There’s a battery pack with heating and cooling elements, a dedicated communications unit, and even tools to collect the samples. You can attach all of these to the rover, or place them nearby; whichever you prefer. Lego even includes a model interpretation of the famous rock sample in the set! The attention to detail is truly impressive, as you’re literally getting everything that played a part in the mission.</p>



<p>It’s quite detailed on its own, but you can also pair it with the Lego Creator 31152 Space Astronaut set to create a bigger, more detailed display to appreciate our heroes. Like most Lego sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If the book feels hard to follow, you can also install the Lego Builder app. This platform offers 3D instructions where you can zoom in from every angle, track your progress, save sets, and more.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this set, especially now that you can bring it home without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5842/">The current Black Friday deal drops it to $154, which is quite affordable considering all that you’re getting</a>. It won’t last forever, though, which is why it’s best to act fast to grab it. Once the discount or the stock is gone, it might not even come back for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-makes-zero-profit-play-on-dualsense-edge-sonys-pro-controller-drops-to-black-friday-chaos-2000646641</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is slashing prices across Sony’s entire gaming lineup this Black Friday, from the PS5 Slim and PS5 Pro consoles to the PS Portal and every controller in between. And the good news is that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">DualSense <em>Edge</em> just hit an all-time low at $169, down from its usual $199 price tag</a>. This is the <strong>pro-level controller that separates serious players from casual gamers</strong>&nbsp;and it fixes the biggest complaint about the standard DualSense: <strong>limited customization</strong>.</p>
<p>You get mappable back buttons, swappable stick modules and deep control customization that the regular $74 DualSense (now on sale at $54) simply can’t offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the Edge Different</h2>
<p>The standard DualSense works just fine for most gamers but the Edge takes things several levels further. You get <strong>two mappable back buttons</strong> that sit right under your middle fingers, ready to handle actions you’d normally stretch your thumbs to reach. These buttons let you jump, crouch, reload or activate abilities without taking your thumbs off the analog sticks. For competitive players, this means never having to break their aim during heated firefights. You can <strong>save multiple control profiles and swap between them</strong> depending on which game you are playing.</p>
<p>When drift inevitably happens, the stick modules pop out and swap in seconds. You don’t have to buy a whole new controller or go through warranty claims, just switch out that single affected module and you’re good to go. Sony <strong>includes different stick cap options</strong> in the box: standard, high dome, and low dome variations that change how the sticks feel under your thumbs. The low dome caps are preferred by many fighting game players for quick, precise inputs while FPS fans like the high dome for finer aim control.</p>



<p>The<strong> trigger customization goes even deeper</strong> than the standard DualSense’s simple trigger effect toggle: You can adjust the travel distance of the triggers along with the dead zones to perfectly suit your playstyle. For racing games, it feels more responsive with shorter trigger pulls, and for shooters, longer pulls seem better, enabling accuracy more.</p>
<p><strong>All the core DualSense features are present in the Edge model</strong>: The haptic feedback still delivers those subtle vibrations that make you feel raindrops or footsteps through the controller. Adaptive triggers dynamically resist your fingers to create tension when drawing a bow or accelerating a vehicle. A built-in speaker and microphone handle quick voice chat without needing a headset. The <strong>controller connects to your PS5 via USB-C or wirelessly</strong>, and the included braided cable charges while you play.</p>
<p>At $169, this controller is a $30 savings off the usual price for a pro-grade set of features. You’re paying nearly twice what the standard DualSense hardware costs, but the customization options and replaceable parts are so much worth the premium. For competitive players, this controller offers precision control and longevity not found in the basic model.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-going-nuts-on-govee-uplighter-lamp-now-selling-for-pocket-change-at-black-friday-2000646562</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Govee has been giving Philips Hue a run for its money with its suite of affordable smart lighting products. This <strong>uplighter floor lamp</strong> is a perfect example of what Govee does best, marrying ambient lighting, RGBIC effects and practical task lighting in one sleek device. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5844/"> it has dropped to a record-low $125 on Amazon, down from $179</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tri-Zone Lighting That Transforms Any Room</h2>
<p>This floor lamp is impressive with its tri-zone system: <strong>the upper section projects dynamic ripple effects onto your ceiling, the middle zone delivers colorful RGBIC lighting, and the lower section provides 1000 lumens of focused task lighting</strong>. Control each zone independently or combine them for layered effects. Set up movie nights, work sessions, and parties with their perfect lighting.</p>
<p>The ripple projector creates mesmerizing, water-like patterns that dance across your ceiling and walls. The lamp head rotates 330 degrees, letting you aim the projection exactly where you want it. You<strong> can cover up to 215 square feet</strong> with these dynamic effects, which fills most living rooms and bedrooms easily. Govee includes more than 80 preset scenes in their app, or you can create your own custom patterns.</p>



<p>Circadian rhythm lighting is a feature that actually enhances your daily life once it’s setup: The <strong>lamp adjusts color temperature from 2700K warm tones to 6500K cool white throughout the day</strong>. Cool, energizing light in the morning helps you wake up and stay productive. Warm sunset hues in the evening signal your body to start winding down for sleep. The <strong>auto-run feature handles those transitions automatically</strong> so you don’t have to think about it.</p>
<p>Integration with smart homes works smoothly on all major platforms. The lamp is Matter compatible, meaning it plays nicely with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. With Voice Control, one can change scenes, adjust brightness, or turn the lamp on and off-all without reaching for the phone. The Govee Home app unlocks the full potential with DIY light shows and music-reactive modes.</p>



<p>The build quality is excellent for a lamp in its category: The <strong>solidly built rust-proof aluminum construction</strong> should last for years to come. The transparent black shade accents give it a modern look that suits most décor styles. The motors responsible for the rotating projector head work at under 25 decibels, meaning they are basically silent. This means you won’t have any disturbing mechanical noises when you’re relaxing or working.</p>
<p>Setting everything up with the Govee app takes only a few minutes: Connect to your 2.4GHz WiFi network, and it seems like the lamp is ready for customization. The interface of the app is intuitively simple to navigate, with easy access to scenes, schedules, and manual controls. Firmware updates unlock new features over time, including the combo mode for upper and lower sections.</p>
<p>The Govee uplighter floor lamp is an incredible value at $125 this Black Friday. This is Philips Hue-level smart lighting for a fraction of the price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-chose-market-share-over-margins-airpods-pro-3-crash-to-record-low-days-after-launch-2000646557</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-chose-market-share-over-margins-airpods-pro-3-crash-to-record-low-days-after-launch.1361968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and they’re already discounted on Amazon. That’s unusual for brand-new Apple products which typically hold their full price for months after launch. Apple isn’t offering any discount on their website or in Apple Stores so Amazon is clearly absorbing the cost to drive Black Friday traffic: You’re saving $30 on earbuds that haven’t even been on shelves for a full month, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">and at $219 down from $249, this is the lowest price we’ve seen</a> and likely the best deal you’ll find on these new earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Next-Level Audio</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on AirPods Pro 3 <strong>removes up to twice as much unwanted noise as the previous generation</strong>. And airplane engines, office chatter, and city traffic just fade away so you can focus on your music or podcast. The new acoustic architecture delivers transformed bass response with detailed clarity across all frequencies. Vocals sound stunningly vivid, and you can pick out individual instruments in complex recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Spatial audio immerses you in a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> where movies and music feel more real than ever. When you turn your head, the sound shifts around you, placing you in the heart of the action. Of course, this only works with compatible content on Apple Music, Apple TV+, and select other streaming services. It also extends to gaming, providing you with better spatial awareness so you know exactly where sounds are coming from.</p>



<p>These health features are genuinely groundbreaking for a product of this size. Integrated heart rate sensing keeps track of your pulse and calories burned across 50 different workout types. You get access to your Move ring, step count, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The hearing health suite includes a home hearing test and a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost.</p>
<p>Live Translation is one of those features that sounds like science fiction until you try it. Firing on all cylinders thanks to Apple Intelligence, the feature translates conversations in real-time directly through your earbuds. You can communicate across language barriers during travel or international business meetings and <strong>the translation is local on your device for privacy and speed</strong>.</p>



<p>Battery life is significantly better compared to previous generations: You get up to <strong>8 hours of listening time with active noise cancellation enabled</strong> or up to 10 hours in Transparency mode using the Hearing Aid feature. The USB-C charging case provides additional charges when you’re on the go. A quick charge gives you hours of listening from just minutes in the case.</p>
<p>The <strong>new ear tips come in five sizes, up from the previous three</strong>, to provide a much more personalized and secure fit. A better seal means improved noise isolation and bass response sans cranking the volume up. The buds stay put during workouts, runs, and active daily use. Apple’s fit test in the Settings app will help you find the perfect size for your ears. Comfort matters when you are wearing earbuds for hours at a time.</p>
<p>At $219, the AirPods Pro 3 offer fantastic value on brand new Apple hardware. Amazon’s taking the hit on margins that Apple won’t match in their own stores. If you want the latest AirPods Pro at a price below retail, this record-low Black Friday deal is the opportunity to grab them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-shows-no-pride-v11-vacuum-cleaner-now-sells-cheaper-than-mid-range-generic-alternatives-2000646571</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson vacuums are known to be pricey, but they’ve also gained a reputation for being worth the price. One of Dyson’s most recent cordless models, <strong>the V11 Origin</strong>, packs serious suction and smart features into a lightweight design. There’s a reason this has been Dyson’s best-seller since Black Friday started on Thursday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">At $399, down from $629, you’re saving $230 on a premium cleaning machine</a> that will revolutionize the way you do housework. And, with this record-low price, Dyson quality is now accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Suction That Handles Every Surface</h2>
<p>The <strong>185 air watts of suction power places the V11 Origin</strong> among the most powerful cordless vacuums you can buy. This is a full 60% more power than previous Dyson generations, and you instantly tell the difference on carpets. Deep-embedded dirt, pet hair, and fine dust get pulled up from fibers that other vacuums leave behind. The same power works brilliantly on hard floors without scattering debris around.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head automatically<strong> adjusts to different floor types</strong> as you work your way through your house. Firm nylon bristles dig into carpets, while softer carbon fiber filaments capture fine dust on hard floors. The brilliant part is the de-tangling technology that stops long hair and pet hair from wrapping around the brush bar. You won’t spend time cutting hair out of the roller after every cleaning session.</p>



<p>Three power modes allow you to customize suction for what you’re cleaning. Auto mode intelligently adjusts the power as it senses different floor types and dirt levels. Eco mode makes the most of battery life for lighter cleaning tasks around the home. Boost mode unleashes full suction for stubborn messes and high-traffic areas. The <strong>LCD screen shows your current mode</strong>, remaining runtime down to the second and maintenance alerts.</p>
<p>It reaches up to <strong>60 minutes on a single charge in Eco mode</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to cover most homes. The removable lithium-ion battery charges in an included docking station that mounts on your wall. Having a dedicated home for the vacuum keeps it charged and ready whenever you need it. The accessories store neatly on the dock, too, so everything stays organized. Just grab, clean, and dock back in seconds.</p>



<p>Turn this floor vacuum into a portable cleaning machine <strong>with the handheld conversion</strong>. Pop off the wand and attach the various tools directly to the main unit: The crevice tool reaches into tight spaces, car seats, and between cushions. The mini soft dusting brush handles delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching. The hair screw tool tackles upholstery and stairs where pet hair tends to accumulate.</p>
<p><strong>At just 6.6 pounds</strong>, the V11 Origin feels manageable even during extended cleaning sessions. The weight balance keeps it comfortable to maneuver around furniture and up stairs. You can easily lift it to clean ceiling corners, curtains, and high shelves. The cordless freedom means no more unplugging and re-plugging as you move between rooms.</p>
<p>HEPA filtration captures allergens and microscopic particles that cheaper vacuums blow back into your air. This matters if anyone in your household deals with allergies or asthma. Whole-machine<strong> filtration traps 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong>. You’re improving your indoor air quality while you clean your floors.</p>
<p>The Dyson V11 Origin offers unparalleled value at $399 this Black Friday and this is the best-selling Dyson vacuum for a reason.</p>

              <p>Beats has been owned by Apple since 2014 but the brand has maintained its own identity and signature sound that fans love. The<strong> Beats Pill is one of the most iconic portable speakers</strong> ever made and it continues to deliver impressive audio in a compact package. This Black Friday, it <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/">has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $149</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this legendary speaker, now is the time to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Seriously Loud Sound in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>audio quality on the Beats Pill punches far above its weight class</strong>. A custom acoustic architecture produces rich, balanced sound with deep bass that fills a room. You get that signature Beats warmth without any of the muddiness that tends to plague cheaper portable speakers. It gets genuinely very loud while remaining clear, so outdoor gatherings and beach days can sound great.</p>
<p>Where the Beats Pill really impresses is in its battery life: it <strong>gives you as much as 24 hours of playback</strong> from one charge, so weekend trips and all-day events are covered without having to hunt for an outlet. The USB-C charging keeps things simple since you’re probably already carrying that cable for your phone. A quick 10-minute charge gives you enough juice for a couple more hours when you’re running low.</p>



<p><strong>Water resistance adds durability</strong> that makes the Beats Pill ready for real-life adventures. Splashes by the pool, rain at a picnic, or spills at a party won’t damage this speaker. You can take it out to places where you wouldn’t want to take more fragile electronics. The build quality feels solid and premium in your hands without being heavy or awkward to carry. This is gear designed for people who actually use their speakers outside of the living room.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> works seamlessly with both Apple and Android devices. For the iPhone, one gets extra benefits, such as one tap pairing and Find My integration to locate the speaker in case it goes missing. Android users, on the other hand, get the same excellent sound quality and reliable wireless connection. Pairing only takes seconds, and the connection stays stable even when you move around. You can also connect two Beats Pills together for stereo sound or amplified mode when one speaker isn’t enough.</p>



<p>The compact design makes this speaker truly portable in a way larger Bluetooth speakers just aren’t. It fits in a backpack, beach bag, or even a large jacket pocket without weighing you down. The cylindrical shape looks clean and modern while<strong> providing 360-degree sound dispersion</strong>. The matte black finish resists fingerprints and looks sleek in any setting. You’ll actually want to bring this speaker with you rather than leaving it at home because it’s too bulky.</p>
<p>The Beats Pill, at $99, is a seriously good Black Friday value. At the record-low price, an already great speaker becomes an incredible deal that’s hard to pass up.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch-2000646578</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch.1361950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google bought up Fitbit back in 2021 and the brand has been incrementally improving ever since. The <strong>Charge 6</strong> is Google’s direct challenge to Apple Watch in the fitness tracker space, albeit at a much friendlier price. This tracker packs serious health monitoring features including built-in GPS and Google app integration, into a slim wristband design. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/"> it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $159</a>. You also get <strong>six months of Fitbit Premium included</strong>, adding even more value to an already great deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Google-Powered Fitness Tracking on Your Wrist</h2>
<p>The Google integration changes how you interact with your fitness tracker throughout the day. On walks and runs, Google Maps gives turn-by-turn directions right from your wrist. With Google Wallet, you’re able to make contactless payments without having to pull out your phone or card. And control from YouTube Music lets you manage your workout playlist sans breaking stride.</p>
<p>That makes heart rate monitoring on the Fitbit Charge 6 a game-changer for indoor workouts, especially with compatible gym equipment. Connect to Bluetooth-enabled treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes that can broadcast your heart rate. Your real-time pulse data appears on the machine’s display to help you stay in your target zone. Previously, this type of gym equipment compatibility had been limited to higher-end fitness watches. You get the premium features without the premium price tag.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in GPS tracks your runs, cycling routes, and hikes</strong> accurately without needing your phone nearby. Afterwards, you can see your pace, distance, and elevation changes in the Fitbit app. The GPS locks in quickly, so you are not standing around waiting before your run.</p>

              <p>Gamers who also create content, edit videos, or work long hours at their desk need a mouse that handles everything. Your gaming mouse might be great for fragging but it’s probably not ideal for those 10-hour editing sessions or browsing between matches. The <strong>Logitech MX Master 3S</strong> bridges that gap with an 8K DPI sensor, ergonomic design and features that make productivity feel effortless. This Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/">it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $119</a>. If you want one mouse that dominates both work and play, this is the one to grab.</p>

<h2>Precision and Comfort Built for Marathon Sessions</h2>
<p>The <strong>8000 DPI sensor</strong> inside the MX Master 3S tracks on virtually any surface, including glass. You can game on your desk, work from a coffee shop table or use it on your couch armrest with no need for a mousepad. Whichever you choose, the tracking remains accurate and responsive. Sensitivity is fully customizable through the <em>Logi Options+</em> software, so you can really dial in just the feel you want.</p>
<p>The ergonomics of this mouse are really impressive for long sessions of gaming and work: The <strong>sculpted shape fits naturally in your hand</strong>&nbsp;and reduces strain through those marathon streams or nights of editing. Your wrist and fingers stay comfortable even after hours of continuous use. The thumb rest provides support that cheaper mice simply don’t offer. If you have ever felt hand fatigue after extended time at the desk, this design makes a noticeable difference.</p>



<p>The <em>Quiet Clicks</em> feature cuts down the noise by 90% compared to the regular mice and becomes a game-changer in streamers’ and content developers’ lives. Your microphone will not catch any kind of annoying click sound while recording or on Discord with your buddies. They are still satisfying and tactile clicks, just without the audible snap.</p>
<p><em>MagSpeed</em> scrolling is one of those features you don’t know you need until you experience it. The scroll wheel moves with electromagnetic precision, allowing you to scroll through long documents or web pages in a single flick. It’s <strong>90% faster and 87% more precise than conventional scroll wheels</strong>. When you need fine control, it shifts automatically to a ratcheted mode that clicks through line by line.</p>



<p>Multi-device connectivity allows you to <strong>connect the MX Master 3S to up to three computers or devices at once</strong>. Switch between your gaming rig, work laptop, and tablet with the press of a button. Flow takes this a step further by allowing you to move your cursor seamlessly across computers and drag files across them. This is incredible if one runs a dual-system setup for streaming and gaming. The <strong>mouse connects via Bluetooth</strong> or the included Logi Bolt USB receiver for a great wireless connection.</p>
<p>And the battery life won’t leave you stranded mid-session: <strong>a full charge lasts up to 70 days of regular use</strong> and a quick one-minute charge gives you three hours of power when you’re in a pinch. The USB-C charging port also means you can use the same cable as your phone or controller.</p>
<p>The Logitech MX Master 3S is an unbelievable deal at $99 this Black Friday, make sure you don’t miss that opportunity.</p>
