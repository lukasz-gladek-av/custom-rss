              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism-1851787197">controversy erupted</a> around the art for an animated card in <em>Pok√©mon TCG Pocket</em>‚Äòs latest set, Wisdom of Sea and Sky, where a drawing of legendary monster Ho-Oh looked almost identical to that of a piece of commissioned art by a Chinese creator. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">The Pok√©mon Company swiftly apologized</a>, and announced the art for both the ‚Äúimmersive‚Äù Ho-Oh and Lugia cards would be temporarily pulled from the new set, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1950406273150693652%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">while making it extremely clear</a> that the fault for the issue did not lie with the artist. Now, both cards have been added to the mobile app, with new art by the same artist.</p> <p>Every set of cards in&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> comes with at least one so-called immersive card: a card that when tapped on comes to life, showing a short but elaborate animation that eventually loops back around to the original image. They‚Äôre absolutely magical, and offer something real-life cards could obviously never do. For Wisdom of Sea, those cards were intended to feature legendary Pok√©mon Ho-oh and Lugia, the two mascot characters from 2000‚Äôs <em>Pok√©mon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>. However, when the artist whose Ho-Oh drawing had been so clearly been copied drew attention to this, both immersive cards were pulled from the set at the eleventh hour‚Äìthe result being both cards featuring nothing but some placeholder text and a black screen instead of an animation. It was clearly embarrassing for the company. TPCi made it clear at the time that the responsibility for the issue lay entirely with themselves, providing dodgy reference materials for the artist to work with.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616592"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616592">¬© The Pok√©mon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It was odd at the time that both cards were pulled, given no accusations had been made about the Lugia art, but today‚Äôs new cards feature a brand new piece of art for that Pok√©mon too, suggesting TPCi noticed something had been amiss there.</p>

 <p>That‚Äôs all been fixed now, with both cards added to the set overnight, featuring a brand new pieces of Ho-Oh and Lugia art from the same artist, the excellent Sie Nanahara. When you launch the app today, a very small patch will be added, and if you already pulled the cards you‚Äôll find the new art and animations will appear.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We'd like to share a new update with you. Please take a look. üôá <a href="https://t.co/Gh6wgL7G3Z">pic.twitter.com/Gh6wgL7G3Z</a></p> <p>‚Äî Pok√©mon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1953683542182924568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>By sheer luck I‚Äôd pulled both immersive cards already, so when I started&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> first thing this morning, as is my routine, I was able to watch both animations, and they‚Äôre both utterly splendid. Each shows the legendary pocket monster either descending from the sky or rising from the sea to meet their counterpart, with all manner of other Pok√©mon appearing along the way. (Including, in the Lugia animation, my beloved Mantine.) Oddly enough, those strange rectangular artifacts on the original Ho-Oh card remain, the elements sliding apart as the animation begins.</p> <p>Sie Nanahara is responsible for all the incredible art in both cards, which is clearly a stunning amount of work, and includes a brand new rendition of Ho-Oh and Lugia. While <em>Pok√©mon</em> card art is usually based on each artist‚Äôs own vision, when it comes to the immersive cards it‚Äôs become clear that far more precise instructions are provided, and this is how things went wrong. It‚Äôs excellent that Nanahara has been able to react so quickly to demonstrate her skill, and hopefully this whole messy incident will result in her receiving far more work.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-4-isn%E2%80%99t-getting-canceled-despite-%E2%80%98some-ups-and-downs%E2%80%99.1265214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>It‚Äôs been <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-games-officially-announces-its-working-on-a-new-bios-1840310449">almost six years</a> since 2K revealed that a new <em>BioShock</em> was in development with recently minted Canada-based studio Cloud Chamber at the helm. But the only real news about the game since then was a report last week <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that <em>BioShock 4</em> has changed leaders after failing an internal review. But amid questions from fans about whether the game could ultimately be canceled and concerns about future layoffs at Cloud Chamber, parent publisher Take-Two is adamant it won‚Äôt be. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to come out,‚Äù CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">told <em>IGN</em></a> this week. ‚ÄúThat I can say hand on heart, without question.‚Äù</p> <p>When it comes out is another question entirely. The executive admitted that things haven‚Äôt gone smoothly with the sequel‚Äìit‚Äôs been over a decade now since <em>BioShock Infinite</em>‚Äìbut steered clear of addressing any specific issues with the game‚Äôs development. ‚ÄúWe have had some ups and downs along the way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership. That said, we have very big shoes to fill on<em> BioShock</em> because of the legacy of Ken Levine, the legacy of what has gone before, which has been so successful. And we need to make sure that this experience is true to the <em>BioShock</em> DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand. That‚Äôs always challenging. We think we‚Äôre up to the challenge, but it has not been seamless.‚Äù</p> <p>What‚Äôs especially odd about the situation is that Take-Two is currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-ken-levines-ghost-story-studio-is-nowhere-near-1848297126">paying Ken Levine</a> to make another game <a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642">called <em>Judas</em></a> which has also been in development for years and looks suspiciously like <em>BioShock</em> in space. It‚Äôs clear these games need more time. What‚Äôs not clear is if more time will be enough. ‚ÄúI think some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay,‚Äù Zelnick said. ‚ÄúGood is the new bad, great is the new great. And our goal here is to make everything exceptional.‚Äù</p> <p>2K Games reiterated this sentiment in its statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">to<em> IGN</em></a> about <em>BioShock 4</em>‚Äòs recent troubles. ‚ÄúWe are working hard to set <em>BioShock</em> up for the best possible future,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúRight now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.‚Äù Great games, it seems, can now take decades to make.&nbsp;The publisher had previously contracted with Certain Affinity for a sequel back in 2015, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-the-new-bioshock-has-been-in-the-works-for-yea-1840314561"><em>Kotaku</em> reported in 2019</a>. That project, codenamed Parkside, was also rebooted, though never officially announced. With the next <em>BioShock</em> out in the open this time, 2K sounds committed to keeping the franchise alive. A <em>BioShock</em> movie is also in the works at Netflix, though reportedly on a <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-bioshock-movie-adaptation-budget-lowered-1851606225">much smaller scale than once planned</a>.</p>

              <p>Shoot ‚Äôem ups were one of the first video game sensations to sweep through arcades. The novelist Martin Amis became so obsessed with 1978‚Äôs <em>Space Invaders</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/05/martin-amis-invasion-of-the-space-invaders-1982-gaming-book-republished">he wrote an entire guide/appreciation of sorts for it</a> long before the idea of games criticism was considered anything worth thinking about. From fixed-screen shooters like <em>Galaxian</em> and <em>Galaga</em> were born side-scrolling shooters like <em>Defender</em> and vertical scrollers like <em>Xevious</em>. Modern shooters prioritize precision aiming but old-school shoot ‚Äôem ups are all about precision positioning. The result is a series of spatial awareness puzzles infused with the nail-biting tension of futuristic guns, close calls, and endless carnage.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gradius-iii-was-fun-and-hard-as-bullet-hell-1840017080">When Konami‚Äôs <em>Gradius</em> arrived in 1985</a> it quickly became one of the cornerstones of the genre thanks to its novel upgrade system, catchy music, and memorable boss fights. While its success, especially in the West, was short-lived, its cult status, which includes admiration for its unflinching difficulty, lives on. The road from <em>Space Invaders</em> to<em> Doom</em> to <em>Call of Duty</em> runs through <em>Gradius</em>. It‚Äôs an important legacy that‚Äôs now been admirably preserved thanks to the excellent <em>Gradius Origins</em> collection.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GRADIUS ORIGINS Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yA3UFCx8nqQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Out August 7 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, Konami‚Äôs tribute to its shmup history was developed by emulation experts M2 and contains <em>Gradius</em>, <em>Gradius II</em>, <em>Gradius III</em>, <em>Life Force</em>, <em>Salamander</em>, <em>Salamander 2</em>, and <em>Salamander 3</em>, an entirely new game in that lineage that satisfyingly recreates the old magic with new levels (M2 was also responsible for 2007‚Äôs franchise reimagining, <em>Gradius ReBirth</em>). It‚Äôs hard not to notice what‚Äôs missing.<em> Gradius</em> <em>Gaiden</em>, <em>Gradius IV</em>, <em>Gradius V</em>, and more are all MIA. Perhaps Konami is holding out for a second collection. At $40, <em>Gradius Origins</em> isn‚Äôt cheap, but what‚Äôs there is a polished and fulsome assembly of the past that doesn‚Äôt cut corners.</p>

 <p>You can consult <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2mBaTEjmVE">Digital Foundry‚Äôs fantastic breakdown</a> for more on the series‚Äô history and M2‚Äôs emulation in this collection. The games are tough as nails, especially for anyone unfamiliar with the unforgiving grind of quarter-based gameplay. Thankfully, the new collection includes modern aids like gameplay rewinding and quick-save reloads. Crisp presentation and quality-of-life additions are only half the story, though.<em> Gradius Origins</em> also includes alternative arcade versions of every game, with helpful documentation explaining what was changed between releases, including updates to make the game easier for American players or to fix high score exploits being taken advantage of in Japan. Console editions are unfortunately missing, but it‚Äôs still a really neat window into ‚Äô80s arcade gaming history.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Earthion | Digital Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBJmYcrMx-4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While <em>Gradius Origins</em> is a great, authentic look at the shoot ‚Äôem up genre‚Äôs past,<em> Earthion</em> brings it forward into the present with a new entry that oozes retro charm. Arriving on PC last week (console versions will be available in September), <em>Earthion</em> is a 16-bit shmup directed by famous<em> Streets of Rage</em> composer Yuzo Koshiro and developed natively for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive (cartridges won‚Äôt be available until next year). All I can say is it‚Äôs the real deal: crunchy pixel art, snappy controls, and tight gameplay balanced to be approachable (at least if you‚Äôre playing on normal difficulty) with a top-notch soundtrack that keeps you coming back.</p> <p>The art is what stands out most, with gorgeous backgrounds full of parallax scrolling effects that remind you what true ‚Äúnext-gen‚Äù upgrades used to feel like back in the ‚Äô90s. <em>Earthion</em> is also much more forgiving than its inspirations like <em>Gradius</em> and <em>R-Type</em>. Health bars and shield meters make it much easier to stay alive and snowball your upgrades. It‚Äôs a great debut game from Koshiro‚Äôs new studio, Ancient Corporation. There are apparently pirated ROMs of it going around, which the composer <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/08/please-support-us-pleads-yuzo-koshiro-as-pirated-earthion-rom-appears-online">has begged</a> people to avoid so the group can stick around long enough to make its next game.</p> <p>The back-to-back releases are fitting considering <em>Gradius</em>‚Äò soundtrack was <a href="https://games.kikizo.com/features/yuzo_koshiro_iv_oct05_p1.asp">one Koshiro has cited</a> as a powerful inspiration for his own work. As a genre, the shmup hasn‚Äôt gotten the same classic revival some other retro genres have over the last decade, but taken together, these games are a great start.</p>
