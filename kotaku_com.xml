              <p>Traditional light switches offer exactly two settings: on and off, which leaves you stuck with whatever harsh overhead lighting the previous homeowner installed. The Philips Hue 3-pack <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/">just dropped to a record low of $69 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from the usual $109 price</a>.</p>
<p>Philips maintains strict pricing on Hue products throughout the year which makes Black Friday the only time these smart bulbs receive meaningful discounts. <strong>Smart lighting completely changes room ambiance</strong> by letting you tune color temperature, brightness and even hue to match your activity or mood rather than accepting whatever your builder-grade fixtures emit.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors</h2>
<p>The <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> range reproduces millions of distinct colors alongside the full spectrum of white light, <strong>from 2000K warm amber to 6500K cool daylight</strong>. You can bathe your living room in deep blue for movie nights, shift to energizing daylight white for morning routines or create warm orange tones for dinner ambiance. The color accuracy spans the entire visible spectrum, giving you precise control over the exact shade you want rather than cycling through preset options. Each bulb can display different colors simultaneously, so you might have blue accent lighting in one lamp while maintaining warm white in overhead fixtures. The 60W-<strong>equivalent brightness delivers 800 lumens at full power,</strong> and provides enough light for reading or detailed work rather than just mood lighting.</p>



<p>The<strong> bulbs connect directly to your home Wi-Fi network without needing a separate hub</strong>, but with the addition of a Hue Bridge come more advanced features: remote control from anywhere and more stable connections that don’t tax your router. Matter compatibility integrates Hue bulbs with other smart home devices across manufacturers, creating unified automation regardless of which ecosystem you’ve invested in. You can trigger lights based on motion sensors, door contacts, or time schedules without maintaining separate apps for each device brand. Secure connection protocols block unauthorized access to your lighting system while maintaining responsive control.</p>
<p><strong>Preset scenes</strong> offer one-touch lighting setups for frequent activities and times of day. The 24-hour natural light scene automatically adjusts color temperature throughout the day to simulate sunlight, gradually changing from warm tones at sunrise to bright daylight in the afternoon and back to amber hues at sunset. Such circadian lighting supports your body’s natural rhythm and could give you better sleep quality by reducing blue light exposure before going to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Voice control via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit</strong> means you won’t have to reach for your phone every time you want to issue basic lighting commands. The voice commands work with individual bulbs, rooms or zones that group multiple lights together. This is pretty handy when you’ve got messy hands from cooking, are settling into bed, or trying to get through the door while carrying groceries.</p>
<p>The <strong>standard A19 form factor fits any fixture</strong> designed for traditional bulbs, from table lamps to ceiling fixtures to bathroom vanities. The bulb screws into E26 sockets designed for standard medium-base bulbs, requiring no special adapters or modifications. LED technology remains cool to the touch and uses a mere 9 watts while delivering <strong>brightness equivalent to 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong>, and reduces electricity costs while lasting 25,000 hours or roughly 22 years at three hours daily use.</p>
<p>At $69 for three bulbs, this Black Friday deal brings the per-bulb cost down to $23, which undercuts Philips’s regular single-bulb pricing of $49. You’re getting full-color smart bulbs from the industry leader in smart lighting for less than many color-changing bulbs from unknown brands.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-dumps-its-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-with-4-ports-now-going-for-pocket-change-2000645791</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ugreen-dumps-its-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-with-4-ports-now-going-for-pocket-change.1359919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wall outlets disappear fast when every device needs its own charging brick cluttering power strips and blocking adjacent sockets. The <strong>Ugreen</strong> <em>Nexode</em> 65W GaN charger <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">just hit a record low of $24 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from its usual $39 price</a>. This four-port charger consolidates multiple charging bricks into a single compact unit that occupies one outlet while powering your laptop, phone, tablet, and wireless earbuds simultaneously. When traveling, carrying four separate chargers involves dedicating a lot of valuable bag space to power adapters, whereas this single charger handles everything. GaN technology keeps the charger cool and efficient while intelligently outputting a total 65W across three USB-C ports and one USB-A port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Powers Your MacBook at Full Speed</h2>
<p>The<strong> 65W maximum output is enough to fast-charge a MacBook Air at its full charging rate,</strong> and reach 51% battery in just 30 minutes. This matches the charging speed you’d get from Apple’s own 61W charger, so you’re not settling with the Ugreen as some kind of compromise. Power delivery is via USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 protocol that negotiates optimal charging rates with compatible devices automatically.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-port configuration includes three USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong> that can cover modern devices alongside legacy gadgets. That three-USB-C setup means you can charge your laptop, phone, and tablet simultaneously using the same type of cable without hunting for different connectors. This design leaves the USB-A port for older devices, wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and accessories that haven’t transitioned to USB-C yet. Dynamic distribution of the total 65W output by intelligent power distribution allows for the <strong>charger to adjust the output based on what devices you plug in</strong> and their power requirements.</p>
<p>Gallium nitride technology replaces traditional silicon components found in the charger with more efficient materials that conduct electricity much better while generating less heat. This efficiency enables Ugreen to pack 65W of charging power<strong> into a charger that is significantly smaller than older silicon-based 65W adapters</strong>.</p>



<p>At compact dimensions,<strong> it measures just 2.64 by 1.65 by 1.5 inches</strong> and this charger is smaller than Apple’s single-port 67W adapter despite offering four ports and comparable power. This reduction in size matters enormously for travel: the charger easily fits into laptop bags, toiletry pouches, or jacket pockets without consuming excessive space. The foldable prongs collapse flat against the charger body and prevents them from snagging on bag contents or poking holes in pouches.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility includes MacBook Pro and Air series, iPhone 17/16/… series, Samsung Galaxy S25/S24/…, Pixel 10/9/…, iPad Pro, Steam Deck, and quite basically everything that charges via USB. It’s compatible across manufacturers and platforms without the need for brand-specific adapters or configurations. Charge Apple devices from USB-C ports and charge Android devices from the same ports without any compatibility issues.</p>
<p>At $24, this Ugreen 65W charger is 39% off retail while bringing features and performance that are in line with chargers costing upwards of $60 from premium brands.</p>

              <p>Now that we’re in the thick of the holiday season, there is much gift shopping to be done. While it makes sense to hold out until Black Friday and Cyber Monday to see what sorts of deals all the major retailers are showcasing, you can actually get ahead of things and find some excellent savings opportunities right now. Perhaps it’s time to help your parents finally update their home Wi-Fi. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/">Amazon has its Eero 7 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi routers on sale right now for about 20% off.</a> For a limited time, you can save $35 on the one router which brings the price down from $170 to just $135.</p>
<p>Now the real value of a mesh Wi-Fi router can be attained with only one of them. You want to create a mesh Wi-Fi network by having multiple units working together. Luckily, Amazon has the Eero 7 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi routers available in bundles of two and three. The 2-pack normally goes for $280, but has been discounted down to $220 — saving you $60. then we have the 3-pack which is usually sitting at $350 now going for just $280 — saving you $70. So at its best value, you can secure yourself three of these mesh Wi-Fi routers for as little as $93 per router.</p>

<h2>Total Coverage of Your Home</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="655">Unreliable internet can be one of the most annoying things to deal with at home. Few things are more frustrating than web pages that won’t load or devices constantly dropping their connection. A Wi-Fi 7 mesh system can make a huge difference. The Eero 7 mesh network is designed to deliver stable, high-speed coverage throughout your home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/">Each Eero 7 node can cover up to 2,000 square feet and handle more than 120 connected devices.</a> With a three-pack, you can blanket up to 6,000 square feet and connect over 360 devices at once. And if your home needs even more range, you can easily expand your network later by adding additional nodes.</p>


<p data-start="657" data-end="1188">Between the three router units, you’ll get six Ethernet ports in total, giving you plenty of wired connection options. The Eero 7 can deliver speeds of up to 2.5Gbps (that’s 2,500Mbps), so streaming 4K video from anywhere in your house is no problem. Even cloud gaming becomes smooth and consistent, especially with the growing number of devices that support the Xbox app, such as Fire TV sticks and Samsung smart TVs. You can play games with minimal lag — even without owning a console — thanks to the strong, fast Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p data-start="1190" data-end="1393" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Setup is also a breeze. The Eero app walks you through every step, making it quick and easy to get your mesh network running smoothly so you can finally say goodbye to dead zones and dropped connections.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-vampire-survivors-sequel-turns-it-into-an-awesome-looking-dungeon-crawler.1359802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, during Xbox’s latest digital showcase event, Poncle announced <em>Vampire Crawlers</em>, a <em>Vampire Survivors</em> follow-up coming to Xbox and PC in 2026. But instead of being a top-down idle shooter or “reverse bullet hell” game like <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308">2021’s <em>Vampire Survivors,</em></a> this newly revealed game is a dungeon crawler with roguelike elements and cards.</p> <p>On November 20, during Xbox’s Partner Preview event, Poncle revealed the first look at<em> Vampire Crawlers.</em>&nbsp;Here’s the trailer, which is filled with a lot of the same enemies, jokes, and chaos you’d expect from <em>Vampire Survivors.&nbsp;</em></p>

  <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">In an Xbox interview with Poncle founder &amp; CEO Luca,</a> the creator behind <em>Vampire Survivors</em> explains that they have been working on this sequel/spin-off for roughly four years, starting work on it shortly after the OG game exploded on Steam. It is one of many possible spin-offs and experiments the team is working on. This just happened to be the first one to “hit its goal,” hence why it’s getting released first in 2026.</p>

 <p>When asked what kind of game <em>Vampire Crawlers</em> is, Luca joked that it’s a totally new genre called “Action TurboTurn™ Game (Turbo Turn System).”</p> <p>“Jokes aside, this game is just a dungeon crawler you play with cards,” admitted Luca. “It’s about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer. You can take your time and be tactical, or play cards as fast as you humanly can, because the game is built to always provide accurate logical outcomes, regardless of the visual chaos that your abilities might cause.”</p>

 <p>Interestingly, Luca tells Xbox that <em>Vampire Crawlers</em> will launch as a full game, and not in early access, though Poncle does have plans to update it after launch if players like <em>Crawlers</em> and want more content and features.</p> <p>“Just like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, we’ve built the game so that it could eventually be expanded,” said Luca. “We’ll leave it to the community to tell us if they want even more, and what they actually want from it going forward.”</p> <p><em>Vampire Crawlers</em> launches sometime in 2026 on Xbox, Game Pass, and PC. It will be available day one on Game Pass and will support Xbox Play Anywhere.</p>
