              <p>Samsung’s M5 Series FHD smart monitor is on sale over at Amazon. There are two different size models. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/">The 27-inch is normally $280, but after a 46% discount it comes to just $150.</a> The 32-inch has come down from $300 by 27% to just $220. Those prices are for the black option. You can also choose a sleek all-white version. The price and discount for that one are the same as the black for the 32-inch. However, the 27-inch white model is onl;y down to $230 which is notably $10 more than the 32-inch is going for. So unless space is that much of a concern, there’s really no good reason to choose the 27-inch white over the 32-inch white.</p>
<p>As a smart monitor, this display is equipped with a full Samsung TV interface which you can stream movies and shows to. You can even get live TV channels at no extra cost. Essentially it’s a small HD TV that you can also control with a mouse and keyboard. It does also come with a remote.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Samsung M5 smart monitor has embedded productivity apps including the full Microsoft 365 suite. You can bypass needing a PC by just accessing Word, PowerPoint, or Excel on the monitor directly.</p>
<p>The display is fully adjustable on a swivel and tilt stand so you can always have it position optimally depending on where you’re sitting and where you have it set up.</p>



<h2>Samsung Gaming Hub</h2>
<p>A real selling point is Gaming Hub. This is Samsung’s built-in interface to stream popular video game titles right to your TV, or rather in this case, right to your monitor. It doesn’t even require an Xbox consoles — just get yourself a controller and subscription to Xbox Game Pass and you’ll be ready to play. Nothing to download either. All the titles can be streamed from the cloud.</p>
<p>As a subscriber to Xbox Game Pass, you’ll gain access to hundreds of awesome games ranging from indie darlings like <em>Celeste</em>&nbsp;to giant AAA hits like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. Or pop on over into a new <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server with some friends. The long-awaited <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>is finally here and yes, it too is on Game Pass. New titles arrive to the service every month and you will gain access to even more games as it includes an EA Play membership.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/">Grab you Samsung M5 smart monitor for as low as $150 for a limited time over at Amazon.</a></p>

              <p>Amazon is kicking off back-to-school season with an offer on a Meta Quest 3 VR bundle that’s hard to pass up:<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4029/"> It is $499, but included is the headset, Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and three months of Meta Horizon+ trial</a>. Normally, you’d pay almost as much for the headset alone so getting all this extra content included in a bundle is a valuable bargain.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Resolution</h2>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 offers nearly a 30% resolution increase over old models with much sharper images and a <strong>stunning 4K Infinite display</strong> that makes all the details pop. That is to say that everything that you view in the virtual world looks sharp and real and your gaming and exploratory experience looks incredibly real. The graphics enhancement helps you perceive every last detail and adds depth to your experience.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages is that the Meta Quest 3 is cable-free: There is <strong>no fumbling with cables</strong> or clamping it to a separate screen, and that gives you the freedom to move, play games, exercise and travel within virtual environments without restriction. This untethered method makes VR more natural and enjoyable to experience, and keeps you engaged without being restricted by cords.</p>



<p>Powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, this headset has<strong> double the graphical processing power of its predecessors</strong>. This means scorching load times and smooth next-generation graphics that render gaming smooth and life-like. The 8GB RAM (33% more than before) helps to manage sharper visuals and quick response so you get the best out of it without any lag.</p>
<p>The headset also includes mixed reality features that overlay virtual objects over your real world: Dual RGB color cameras capture full-color, high-definition passthrough photos and enable you to co-interact with digital objects as well as your own physical world. This feature offers new ways of experiencing and exploring both worlds simultaneously.</p>
<p>Battery life has also been extended with the capacity to<strong> supply more than two hours of uninterrupted gameplay</strong>. This enables you to dive into prolonged sessions, recharge less frequently, and pick up where you left off.</p>
<p><strong>With 512GB storage</strong>, this Meta Quest 3 bundle gives you plenty of space to download games, applications and content without worrying about running out of space. And, with the Batman experience and Meta Horizon+ subscription thrown in, you gain access to even more content, so you have a full VR experience right from the start.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hps-2025-laptop-bundle-crashes-to-nearly-80-off-likely-triggered-by-apples-latest-launch-2000624470</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp%E2%80%99s-2025-laptop-bundle-crashes-to-nearly-80-off-likely-triggered-by-apple%E2%80%99s-latest-launch.1293630/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fall is here which means school is back in sessions. If you’re still in need of a laptop for the new semester, first of all, what are you doing? Classes started weeks ago. Thankfully, you’re not out of luck just yet. Multiple retailers still have their back-to-school deals live and many opportunities to save on a new computer can still be found. Take this HP everyday laptop for example. <strong>This 2025 model is designed for students and businesses and it comes bundled with a bunch of goodies including a year of Microsoft Office 365</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4019/">Amazon normally has it listed for $1,500, but for a limited time, the price is down 76% which brings it to just $360.</a></p>
<p>This 2025 HP 14 laptop is working with an Intel N150 processor capable of up to 3.4Hz and uses an integrated Intel UHD graphics card. It comes with 16GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. It comes pre-installed with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro</a> and Microsoft Copilot.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The HP 14 is super light, weighing in at only 3.24 lbs. It only 0.71 inches thin. These together make the laptop highly portable as they should have no issue slipping into most backpacks. Great for schlepping back and forth between classes.</p>
<p>Battery life is solid. You’ll get up to 11 hours of use on a single charge. When it dies, it only takes 45 minutes of charging to bring it back over 50%. You can comfortably bring it to your classes without worrying about packing the charger every day.</p>



<h2>Free Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Alrighty, let’s get to the freebies. With this HP laptop, you’ll get a handful of accessories that will help you on campus. You get a wireless mouse, some dust plugs to keep your ports dust free, a pack of webcam covers to maintain your privacy, and a 256GB microSD card to expand your storage even further.</p>
<p>Most notably, the bundle includes a one year subscription to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</a>. With this, you’ll gain access Microsoft’s full suite of apps such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and more — all things you’ll likely be regularly using for your classwork depending on your major.</p>
<p>You also will have OneDrive storage. This is great for being able to access all your files from a number of devices. Forgot to submit a homework assignment, but now you’ve already left the dorm? Just pull it up on your phone and send it to your professor from there. Easy peasy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4019/">For a limited time, you can score this HP 14 laptop for students at the discounted price of just $360.</a></p>
