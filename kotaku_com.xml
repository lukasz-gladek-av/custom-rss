              <p>Most people don’t realize how exposed they are when browsing online until something goes wrong. The truth is, <strong>every click, search, and connection leaves a trace that can be tracked or exploited</strong>. That’s why so many users turn to VPNs (<em>Virtual Private Networks</em>) to protect their digital lives.</p>
<p>And right now, NordVPN (the world’s leading VPN) has an incredible offer that feels like getting nearly two years of service for free: Thanks to a 73% discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">it’s as if you only pay for 7 months at the regular rate and get 20 months free</a>. Spread across the entire 27-month duration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">that works out to just $3.09 a month</a> instead of the usual $11.59. In practical terms, you’re<strong> locking down your online safety for pennies a day</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why a VPN Matters More Than Ever</h2>
<p>Think of a VPN as your <strong>own personal shield when you’re on the internet</strong>: Instead of leaving your browsing open to hackers, advertisers or your internet provider, NordVPN protects your data with military-grade encryption (check out Gizmodo’s full review <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn">here</a>). That means no one can peep into your history or watch over your online activities.</p>
<p>NordVPN is especially trustworthy because of its <strong>no-logs policy.</strong> Other providers log your activity, while NordVPN does not record your browsing history at all. And if you want even more protection, its Double VPN mode sends your connection through two different servers and double the encryption but still with your speed kept surprisingly fast.</p>
<p>Aside from simple browsing privacy, <strong>a VPN unlocks doors you might not have considered</strong>: Ever been stuck mid-stream because the show you wanted to watch was geo-restricted where you are? With NordVPN, you can stream off one of its 7,000+ servers in more than 120 locations across the globe, which makes geo-blocked content accessible and video streaming sharp.</p>
<p>Another reassuring touch: speed. Some VPNs are notorious for slowing down your speed, but NordVPN is built to remain fast. Its huge server network means you’ll always be able to get one close by so streaming HD content or video calling remains smooth.</p>
<p>NordVPN doesn’t end at VPN fundamentals either: The Plus plan, currently reduced to about $3.99 monthly also features improvements like Threat Protection Pro. It operates close to antivirus, eliminating malware, irritating ads and trackers that bog down your system otherwise. Aside from this, you are given NordPass, a built-in password manager that protects your logins and puts them under control behind strong encryption.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about how many devices can be covered, NordVPN makes it simple: <strong>you can protect up to 10 devices simultaneously</strong> on a single account.</p>
<p>Best of all, NordVPN comes with a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong>. That means you can try it without risk, and if you don’t believe so, you simply get your money back. Ultimately, the numbers make this deal impossible to refuse: You pay 7 months at the standard rate, and NordVPN adds 20 extra months on top, for free.</p>

              <p>Apple’s grand keynote happened only two days ago, and though <a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-blur-the-line-between-health-wearable-and-wireless-earbuds-2000655557">the AirPods Pro 3 were the highlight</a>, Amazon had a different idea: clear out the remaining AirPods Pro 2 at an unbeatable price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">they’re down to $199 instead of the usual $249, and that’s as low as it gets for one of Apple’s most popular earbuds</a>. Amazon wants to move the last of its stock, and if you don’t care about extras like heart rate monitoring or calorie tracking, the AirPods Pro 2 are more than enough.</p>

<h2>Advanced ANC Earbuds</h2>
<p>The reason the drop is so tempting is that <strong>these earbuds remain some of the most advanced true wireless earphones</strong> Apple has ever produced. They pack the H2 chip which powers improved sound quality and smarter noise cancellation. Active noise cancellation works to block out the hum of traffic, chatter on your commute, or background noise in the office, and Transparency Mode lets the world back in whenever you need to stay aware. On top of that, Personalized Spatial Audio adapts sound to the shape of your ears for a immersive surround-like feel.</p>



<p>The earbuds’ sound profile is accurate and detailed, with bright, even balance between highs, mids, and bass. If you’re looking for audio quality without the bulk of over-ear headphones, this remains one of the best everyday choices.</p>
<p>Apple overhauled the fit to be more comfortable with several ear tip sizes in the box that help create a snug seal. That makes it more effective at noise reduction and reduces ear fatigue during extended listening sessions. Battery life is more than adequate for daily use, <strong>with up to six hours of continuous use on one charge and 30 hours total if you count the charging case</strong>. The case itself charges through USB-C now, so you can charge it with the same cord you’re using for a MacBook or iPad.</p>
<p>There’s the convenience factor, too: <strong>Pairing with iPhone, iPad, and Mac is virtually instantaneous</strong> and technologies like automatic switching mean you’ll remain connected without further tapping or change-of-setting crap. If you’re engaged in a FaceTime call on your MacBook and then get up to answer a call on your phone, the AirPods Pro 2 switch just along with you.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see Amazon cut the price this aggressively on a flagship Apple product. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab a pair, this is pretty much it. At $199 instead of $249, the AirPods Pro 2 bring high-end Apple features to your daily routine without asking you to overspend.</p>
