            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wizards of the Coast is going to turn as much <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817">paper into gold</a> as it can with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and leading the way is its best-selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set. The company recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">announced at MagicCon Atlanta 2025</a> that it will be releasing additional <em>Final Fantasy</em> box sets with new cards featuring more beautiful art spanning the Square Enix RPG franchise’s history. If you’re worried about your wallet, relax! The initial wave of pre-orders sold out instantly.</p> <p>This mini-expansion includes a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">Chocobo Bundle</a>, a new Commander Deck, and four new Scene Boxes. They all arrive on December 5 and all of them are basically impossible to find online right now. Hopefully, fans have better luck with the inventory that comes directly to their local hobby shops. The Chocobo Bundle is $110 and comes with a bunch of booster packs, Chocobo-themed lands, alt-art reprints, a new promo card, and an incredibly neat life total click-wheel:</p>

   <p>Then there’s the new $100<em> FFVII</em> Limit Break Commander Deck that comes with a PC download code for the HD remaster of the original game and an exclusive Traditional Foil promo card that shows Cloud looking up at Shinra HQ. It seems way over-priced but is also completely sold out right now on Amazon.</p>

 <p>The new Scene Boxes are what really have my attention. There’s one each for <em>Final Fantasy</em>,<em> Final Fantasy VIII</em>,<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy XV</em>. Each comes with six Foil Borderless Scene Cards, six Art Cards, three Play Boosters, and one Display Easel for $42. The six cards go together to recreate scenes from each game. These new cards aren’t legal in standard play but look cool as heck. The art on the boxes alone makes me want one.</p>

   <p>There was no shortage of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Scene Boxes when they arrived in 2023, offering hope that after the initial frenzy subsides, fans will be able to get access to the new<em> Final Fantasy</em> ones without too much trouble, and without paying over MSRP for them. Are the boxes worth even that? In the grand scheme of things, probably not. But that’s the whole point of Universes Beyond: subverting logic with passion.</p> <p>The result has been very lucrative for Wizards but a pain for many fans. “This whole collab has been so confusing,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">wrote</a> one after the latest <em>Final Fantasy</em> products were announced. “Every attempt I’ve made at actually purchasing cards has shown that the set is sold out everywhere, and they don’t seem to be printing any new ones. But there’s new cards still coming out too?” Yes. And I suspect these won’t be the last ones either.</p>

              <p>Amazon’s Prime Day sales event starts next week on October 7. But the online retailer has already marked down a ton of products ahead of its made-up holiday, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox?tag=kotaku01-20">including a long list of 4K UHD Blu-ray movies</a>. As streaming becomes more expensive and content is split up across more platforms and hidden behind more paywalls, owning a movie on Blu-ray is the best way to ensure you can watch it anytime you want at no extra cost. And, assuming you have the proper cables and setup, with 4K UHD Blu-rays, you get a picture quality that is better than compressed streaming content, too!</p> <p>Remember, you’ll need a UHD player to watch any of these movies. Your PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid UHD players, assuming they have disc slots and you are using the correct HDMI cable.</p> <p>With that all out of the way, here are the UHD movies currently on sale on Amazon. Heads up that in the past, popular movies have sometimes sold out during these big UHD sales, so if something catches your eye, don’t wait too long to snag it. And if you’re looking for spooky movies ahead of Halloween, I’ve included plenty on the list below.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>A Quiet Place</em> -$15 ($35)</li> <li>A Quiet Place Part II – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Air Force One</em> – $15 ($27)</li> <li><em>Batman Begins</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight</em> – $14 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> – $13 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Returns</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Forever</em> – $13 ($25)</li> <li><em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Clueless</em> – $14 ($26)</li> <li><em>Cloverfield</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Dredd</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> – $15 ($34)</li> <li><em>E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</em> – $14 ($30)</li> <li><em>Evil Dead Rise</em> – $14 ($17)</li> <li><em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Friday the 13th</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Get Out</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Gladiator II</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Inglorious Basterds</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Mother!</em> – $11 ($24)</li> <li><em>Poltergeist</em> – $13.72 ($34)</li> <li><em>Reservoir Dogs</em> – $11 ($13)</li> <li><em>Saturday Night Fever</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Split</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture: Director’s Cut</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home –</em> $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek First Contact</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Insurrection</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Nemesis</em>— $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em> – $15 ($23)</li> <li><em>The Thing</em> – $12 ($30)</li> <li><em>Titanic</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>TMNT: Mutant Mayhem</em> – $15 ($38)</li> <li><em>Top Gun</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Transformers One</em> – $15 ($36)</li> <li><em>Transformers Bumblebee</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>The Untouchables</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Us</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Van Helsing</em> – $10 ($23)</li> <li><em>Wayne’s World</em> – $11 ($26)</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Capcom Cup started in 2013 with <i>Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition</i> as the Japanese publisher sought to professionalize and take more direct ownership of its hit fighting franchise’s competitive scene. It expanded into multi-month tours leading up to the big finals, with all of the biggest matches streamed for free online. And it’s continued that way, until now. Capcom announced this week that the 2026 finals for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> will be a pay-per-view event, and fans are not happy. “No one should be deprived of the opportunity to enjoy the pinnacle of <em>Street Fighter</em>,” Evo 2025 winner Saul Leonardo “MenaRD” Mena II <a href="https://x.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376">wrote on X</a> in response to the news.</p> <p>The two-time Capcom Cup champion hails from the Dominican Republic and noted, as many pros have, that locking esports behind a paywall particularly impacts fans from regions where the financial barriers are already higher. “I find it hard to accept,” he wrote. “I understand that in Japan, this is considered normal, and fortunately, the community is still able to support each other in this way. However, in many regions, including my own, there is hardly even the leeway to play this game.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">納得しがたいです</p> <p>日本ではこれが普通だと理解していますし、ありがたいことにコミュニティはまだこの方法で支え合えています。</p> <p>しかし、私の地域を含む多くの地域では、このゲームをプレイする余裕すらほとんどない。ストリートファイターの頂点を楽しむ機会を阻まれるべきではない。… <a href="https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu">https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu</a></p> <p>— WBG MenaRD🇩🇴 (@_MenaRD__) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/capcomcup/cc12/en/">Capcom Cup 12 Finals</a> will take place on March 14, followed by the <em>Street Fighter</em> League World Championship on March 15. Both will take place live at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in Tokyo, Japan, where front row seats will cost roughly $135. In a major break with the past, however, even virtual viewership will be ticketed this time around. The pay-per-view ticket price will be roughly $40 for both days. Anyone who doesn’t want to pay will have to wait until a week later to stream the matches online for free.</p>

 <p>The move caught many competitive<em> Street Fighter</em> pros by surprise. Next year’s Capcom Cup sports a $1,282,000 prize pool, unchanged from the prior year, despite the new income stream. “If this decision is final, then I hope at the very least a % of the PPV earnings be used to support the prize pool to improve the payout distribution for the players,” Arman “Phenom” Hanjani <a href="https://x.com/PhenomSF/status/1972393910438883538">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The issue is that while Capcom funds the CC Finals, they absolutely do not pay to run all of the tournaments where people qualify for Capcom Cup. Individual TOs and communities in countries around the world operate those events. Capcom benefits from the hardwork of those TOs and…</p> <p>— 女 Molly_Bee (@MollyAmberBee) <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyAmberBee/status/1972796918666260953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also unclear how the PPV requirement will impact the rest of the competitive scene’s content creators who traditionally co-stream events. Others have wondered why Capcom doesn’t just try to extract more money through Capcom Cup-specific in-game outfits and other cosmetics. “I don’t know why they’re not doing this anymore. I used to buy the CPT costume pack every year, everyone wins and everyone is happy,” <a href="https://x.com/Bigbird_fgc/status/1972303220908417059">wrote</a> Adel&nbsp;“Big Bird” Anouche.</p>

 <p>Fans are equally bewildered, pointing to all of the local events that feed into the Capcom Pro Tour but aren’t directly financed by the publisher. “I thought Capcom organized this circuit as a marketing tool for the game,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nss7ou/capcom_announces_that_capcom_cup_12_finals_stream/">wrote</a> on Reddit. “Makes no sense to charge viewers to watch it. And esports is, unfortunately, still way too niche for that to be profitable.”</p> <p>While <em>Street Fighter</em> is massive in Japan, many are worried the move to PPV for such a big event will just end up excluding people in other parts of the world. Does Capcom care? Apparently not.</p>
