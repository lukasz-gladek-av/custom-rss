Chances are you’ve been forced out of every major city in Cyrodiil by overzealous guards who see your fangs and red eyes and want to slaughter your vampire butt, right? Well, if that’s the case, where else can you hide? The Vile Lair, with its Dark Brotherhood-esque decorations and monuments to Sithis, feels like an extension of the assassin’s guild, but it’s definitely designed with creatures of the night in mind. Here’s where to find this unique player home!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197585" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="120" data-playlist="197585,197583,197582" data-current="197585"><div><p>A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23106.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h841541"><a id=""></a>How to find and claim the Vile Lair in<em> Oblivion Remastered</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="152635cbbc3bc83c7456976633c4ad13" data-recommend-id="image://152635cbbc3bc83c7456976633c4ad13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The map marker location of the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The map marker location of the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="152635cbbc3bc83c7456976633c4ad13" data-recommend-id="image://152635cbbc3bc83c7456976633c4ad13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The map marker location of the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like with the Thieves’ Den and Fighters’ Stronghold, you’ll discover Vile Lair either through various rumors in the surrounding area, like from the citizens of Leyawiin, or via exploration. Whichever path you take, it’s quite the trek through Blackwood to uncover this hidden den of infamy.</p><p>You’ll find the Vile Lair southeast of Leyawiin, at the southernmost tip of Blackwood. There, you’ll note a small island connected via a thin strip on the map, and that’s your destination.</p><p>Upon arrival, however, you’ll find nothing more than a burnt out town, slaughtered by unknown forces, some of it still smoking. If you dig through the wreckage, you’ll find a few chests with basic random loot spawns. But look to the south to the crumbling stone structures: That’s your target. Dive into the water, then swim down to where the stone meets the slope leading to deeper water. You’ll find a large tree trunk, open on one end, leading to a hidden door.</p><figure id="" data-id="be53a9778e36ae4661deef20a58fbb4c" data-recommend-id="image://be53a9778e36ae4661deef20a58fbb4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The secret underwater entrance to the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The secret underwater entrance to the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be53a9778e36ae4661deef20a58fbb4c" data-recommend-id="image://be53a9778e36ae4661deef20a58fbb4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The secret underwater entrance to the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s murky down there, but I promise, the door’s there.

When a fan asked him on social media about a possible $80 price tag on <em>Borderlands 4</em>, he infamously replied: “If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.” This went over poorly with the internet. A few days later he said he didn’t mean to sound like an asshole. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">A week later, he posted a 573-word tweet</a></span> apologizing and explaining that he just meant that <em>Borderlands 4</em> would be  fine even with the higher price tag, and that he didn’t intend to set off a firestorm of controversy and discourse. </p><p>That brings us to today, where 2K has finally confirmed that <em>Borderlands 4</em> is only $70. After all that hoopla and online drama, it turns out the game is going to cost what nearly every other AAA video game in 2025 costs: $70, plus tax. Was any of that worth it in the end? Not really. But hey, at least <em>Borderlands 4</em> isn’t going to hold the game hostage and force you to pay a ransom fee to play a few days early. That’s nice! </p><p><em>Borderlands 4 </em>launches (for everyone, at the same time) September 12 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. </p><p>&nbsp;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whenever a new game comes out, be it big like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> or small like <em>Blue Prince</em>, mods quickly become available on Nexus for everything from helping with inventory management to enhancing visuals. It’s been a cornerstone of PC gaming for many players for decades now, though Dark0ne suggested nothing much will change in the day-to-day now that he’s no longer running it. </p><p>“I started this project back in 2001, in my bedroom, with a 56k modem, an excitement for the upcoming release of <em>Morrowind</em> and with no grand ambitions or intentions,” he wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an update on the Nexus Mods website</a></span>. “I didn’t set out to build a business, I just wanted to make a place where modders could share their work without worrying it would vanish into the internet either [<em>sic</em>] the next time a fansite went offline or a publisher decided they were done with it. That idea grew legs, sprouted arms, and turned into Nexus Mods.”<br></p><p>Dark0ne said he’s been looking for someone else to take over management of Nexus Mods for a while now due to all the stress of running a small online social network, but it wasn’t until recently that he found someone to take over who “really ‘gets’ the modding community the way I do.” He didn’t reveal who that someone is, though, or the price tag for the deal. Is Nexus Mods about to get way worse? Some users are already freaking out about paid subscriptions coming. Dark0ne claims not much will change in the immediate future, though. <br></p><p>“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” he wrote. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era. That includes some structural updates to the company ownership that we aren’t shouting about, but I want to be transparent: they’re about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform. Nexus Mods is community-first and mod-author focused, that’s not up for negotiation.”</p><p>Some shifts have already been underway at Nexus Mods, which is run by a team of 40 people. A big one was moving to ease rules on modders <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13501488-publisher-approved-paid-modding-policy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13501488-publisher-approved-paid-modding-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting paid for their work</a></span>. Some modders now link to Patreons and other places where people can donate to them directly for ongoing updates to certain popular mods in games like <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. Nexus Mods community managers said at the time that the goal was to find a way to balance compensation incentives with the desire to keep the modding scene free and open, even as companies like Bethesda try to monetize creator work in their games. </p><p>Nexus Mods has also recently taken stands again bigotry.

So with <em>Mario Kart World </em>kicking off the Switch 2’s launch this month, why not see if we can end a few more by trying to rank these games from worst to best?</p><p>The series has evolved over the years, from a simple racer based on the Mushroom Kingdom to a motorized <em>Smash Bros.,</em> drawing in racers and tracks from across the Nintendo universe. And as it’s got older it’s got bigger, going from a mere karting game to something that let us drive quads, bikes, hovercars and even two-seat mobile weapons platforms, and now to a full open world.</p><p>As is often the case with Pecking Orders, the idea here isn’t <em>really </em>to rank these games from worst to best, because even the ones down the bottom of the list are still loads of fun. It’s to pit these classics against one another, to not just see which one comes out on top, but <em>why</em>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-super-circuit-yoshi-bowser-mario-peach-luigi-1850155523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-super-circuit-yoshi-bowser-mario-peach-luigi-1850155523"><em>Mario Kart</em> Fans Aghast To Learn About Secret Points That Tilt The Scales</a></span></p><p>Note that we’ve excluded the arcade games on two grounds: one, that loads of us (and you) haven’t played them, and two, because so much of their content, from tracks to sound effects, is recycled content from mainline games (in a more literal way than newer console games including older tracks).</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-recommend-id="image://xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-recommend-id="image://xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We’ve got to start somewhere, and this is easiest place. Concessions had to be made to make the game work on mobile in an <em>economic</em> sense, we get that. You can’t release a phone game in the last decade without tying it to some kind of bizarre money-making scheme.</p><p>But the game itself could have been so much better. Emulation of classic Nintendo games is at the point where many people could play <em>Double Dash</em> on their phones if they wanted to, so to offer up such a compromised version of the series as an official release is a crushing disappointment.</p><p>By the standards of 2019 mobile game releases, it’s fine? But by the standards set by the rest of this series, <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> is a comfortable last-place finish, no red shell required.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-recommend-id="image://wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-recommend-id="image://wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s many people’s least favourite (at least proper) <em>Mario Kart</em> game because it’s both so old and there’s so little to recommend it. The original has the purity of its vision and nostalgia to play on, while later games are just, well, better. <em>Super Circuit</em>, caught between the original’s pioneering release and releasing long after the series’ 3D debut, is trapped and a little lost, at least when we’re looking back on the series as a whole from our contemporary vantage point.</p><p>Know what’s really cool about it though? The original’s visuals haven’t aged that great, but <em>Super Circuit’s</em> cheery pixel art is one of the Game Boy Advance’s most underrated achievements. Everything is just so damn colourful and cute and pretty in the same way so many first-party SNES and GBA platformers were, only here it’s moving real real fast as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-recommend-id="image://h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-format="jpg" data-width="2050" data-height="1153" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-recommend-id="image://h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-format="jpg" data-width="2050" data-height="1153" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This game was so damn popular! It sold <em>37 million </em>copies! And you’d think, from the size of it to the funky motion controls, that it’d be higher up on this list. But again, like <em>Super Circuit</em>, <em>Wii </em>gets a little lost in the passage of time, as there’s very little reason to play this when <em>Mario Kart 7</em>, and then <em>8</em>, came along and did everything it did but so much better.</p><p>Not helping it here is that, despite the game being perfectly positioned to cash in on the Wii’s motion control hype with its iconic plastic steering wheel, the game’s motion controls—the one defining feature of the game that anyone remembers—were actually straight garbage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-recommend-id="image://xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-recommend-id="image://xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In many ways the most limited mainline <em>Mario Kart</em> game, this could have been down the bottom of this list after all these years, as subsequent games have some along and slowly improved and built upon the foundations it laid.</p><p>But man, there’s still so much to love, and respect. While its lack of 3D terrain is a little jarring in this post-Nintendo 64 world, the slippery, slidey cornering might still be the best in the series, from its exaggerated reach to the way the entire camera is wrenched around to accommodate it.</p><p>It’s not the fastest, smartest of even the most fun <em>Mario Kart</em> game, not by a long stretch, but it’s somehow still the most kart-y game of the lot. And being the instigator of the entire series, in many ways the purest expression of the original vision, it felt wrong putting it any lower.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-recommend-id="image://fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-recommend-id="image://fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is going to start harsh for a game that’s a lot of people’s sentimental fave, but time has not been kind to this game. Where once it was a pioneer of 3D multiplayer gaming, now it just looks like shit and has a surprisingly high number of empty, boring tracks. </p><p>As we’re going to find as we get further into this list, though, even the weakest <em>Mario Kart</em> games (by 21st century standards, anyway) can often be saved by moments of inspirational course design, and while like I’ve just said many of <em>Mario Kart 64's</em> are a snooze fest, when it shines—like Toad’s Turnpike—it <em>shines</em>. </p><p>Also, this is the game that introduced the blue shell. We weren’t sure whether to praise or punish the game for that, so in very un-blue shell fashion it ends up dropping it in the middle of the pack.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-recommend-id="image://it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-format="jpg" data-width="917" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-recommend-id="image://it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-format="jpg" data-width="917" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a pattern emerging here, born of the series taking relatively few major advances over the years: this is yet another entry that was ridiculously popular, and another where there isn’t much reason to play it today, coming as it did between everyone’s childhood favourites and the more expansive offerings on the Wii U and Switch.</p><p>But can we just take a step back and appreciate its online play? This was a DS game, from 2005, made by Nintendo, and to play it online was both a breeze and an absolute joy.<br></p><p><em>Mario Kart DS</em> was the first game in the series to open us up to a whole world, quite literally, of <em>Mario Kart</em> in a way that not even some more recent home console titles have managed.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-recommend-id="image://mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-recommend-id="image://mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Can we just start this one by saying that more <em>Mario Karts</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-vr-looks-nuts-1796865368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-vr-looks-nuts-1796865368">outside of VR experiences</a></span>) need first-person racing? This game had it, and it sucks that more don’t!</p><p>Anyway, <em>Mario Kart 7</em> had a lot more to offer than just that gimmick. <em>Mario Kart 7 </em>made some big innovations for a handheld game, most importantly in the way players were now able to drastically customise their cars, and also how you could drive underwater.</p><p>The game is often criticised for leaning a little heavily on the rest of the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula (as if every game barring <em>64</em> hasn’t done the same thing), but that was always a little unfair, coming as it did on a handheld system whose primary innovation—3D visuals—could never really be taken advantage of in a way that could have fundamentally changed the <em>Mario Kart experience</em>.</p><p>Indeed, for a game that at the time felt a little derivative, its introductions ultimately paved the way for a lot of the stuff that <em>Mario Kart 8</em>—which you’ll note we haven’t got to yet—does so well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-recommend-id="image://bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="999" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-recommend-id="image://bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="999" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Wait, what? Yes, you’re reading this right. <em>Double Dash</em>, baby. The first fully-3D <em>Mario Kart</em> game. It’s up here for two reasons.</p><p>Firstly, the two-player thing was great, and it’s a shame it hasn’t returned (outside of an arcade cameo) since, even as a secondary mode. Having one player concentrate on driving while the other handled the timing and direction of weapons might not have been ideal in every multiplayer circumstance, but when it did—whether your partner was less skilled than you or just wasted—it was glorious.</p><p>And secondly, as you’d expect from a game coming out on the GameCube, <em>Double Dash’s</em> course design is some of the wackiest—and thus best—of the series. From Baby Park through to DK Mountain, it’s not until you cycle through some of these tracks again in later <em>Mario Karts</em> that you realise so many of the absolute classics are from this one release.</p><p>But its GameCube-ness extends beyond just the course design (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D3DC6664BCC050F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D3DC6664BCC050F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and its killer soundtrack!</a></span>). This is just so much <em>fun</em>, one of the shining examples of the weirdness prevalent in Nintendo games throughout the GameCube’s lifespan, where it was able to build on its cutesy past and polish it into a mirror-like sheen, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-dlc-is-so-gross-1616697911&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-dlc-is-so-gross-1616697911">wasn’t yet having to run commercial tie-ins for Mercedes DLC</a></span>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-recommend-id="image://0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-recommend-id="image://0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The latest entry in Mario’s kart-racing jamboree is a rollicking good time, and also a somewhat frustrating one. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the best the actual driving and control has ever felt, and all the new maneuvers Nintendo has added this time around make it the most expressive and freeing in the series. But as the game gets bigger, with more players and entire modes that feel like they are meant to showcase the multi-track-spanning open world at the expense of more condensed races on bespoke tracks, playing the game requires you to get past some growing pains. It’s more experimental than it might seem at a glance, and for that, it deserves its flowers for injecting some really cool ideas into a 30-year-old franchise.</p><p>With 24-player races that let you ride on just about any surface you can reasonably get your wheels on, <em>World </em>is the most chaotic <em>Mario Kart </em>has ever been.

There are so many players on the track at once that you can spend several minutes of a race doing alright, just driving along your designated path, then suddenly face an onslaught of item-based attacks that will send you back a dozen places in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This all then needs to be weighed against the new inclusion of a vast, open world, around which you can freely drive, finding bonus items, mini-missions, hidden secrets, and so many coins. It’s the biggest shake-up the <em>Mario Kart </em>series<em> </em>has seen in decades, but time will tell if it sticks as a favorite racing game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-recommend-id="image://pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-recommend-id="image://pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Can you believe <em>Mario Kart 8</em> came out nearly a decade ago? That’s a mighty long and uninterrupted reign for a <em>Mario Kar</em>t game when you look at the release timeframe of so many of the games before this, but really, Nintendo hasn’t had to replace it, and might not need to for a while yet. An upgraded version on the Switch and some DLC has been enough to keep this one of the finest ever games, <em>Mario Kart</em> or otherwise. </p><p>And now, with all the sudden updates that have added a whopping 48 additional retro and unseen courses, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-4-dlc-birdo-yoshi-s-island-1850091298&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-4-dlc-birdo-yoshi-s-island-1850091298">alongside new characters like Birdo</a></span> (and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-five-new-characters-drivers-switch-nintendo-1850205794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-five-new-characters-drivers-switch-nintendo-1850205794">five more mysterious additions to come</a></span>), the undying game has further cemented its spot as the number one <em>Mario Kart </em>ever. </p><p>Everything we’ve discussed previously on this list, from characters to courses, is done better here than anywhere else. It’s innovations are rare, but its perfections are everywhere, particularly in its course design, which features truly breathtaking moments as gravity is inverted, whole sections of track disappear and coins are turned into rupees.</p><p>Quite simply, if you want to play <em>Mario Kart</em>, online or solo, with traditional characters or newer introductions, classic tracks or modern masterpieces, this is the game to play.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the Red Woods, you’ll find a Nevron named Benisseur who’ll ask you for a lot of Chroma.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><h2 id="h156375"><a id="1"></a>Finding the Red Woods</h2><figure id="" data-id="d38636dd653480cc02c908cf57076c5d" data-recommend-id="image://d38636dd653480cc02c908cf57076c5d" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows several locations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows several locations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d38636dd653480cc02c908cf57076c5d" data-recommend-id="image://d38636dd653480cc02c908cf57076c5d" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows several locations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Red Woods can be found after exiting the Flying Waters.

Bennisseur will tell you a story, and then you can donate even more Chroma. The second time will be 10,000 Chroma, the third time will be 25,000 Chroma, and the last payment will be 50,000 Chroma.
