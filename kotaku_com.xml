              <p>On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security posted a <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">gross video of ICE making multiple arrests</a> set to the original <em>Poké</em><em>mon&nbsp;</em>anime’s theme song, as well as using interstitial cuts of the show, and creating mock-ups of trading cards for several of the individuals arrested.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How many cables do you have running across your desk right now? The more smart devices we have the more clutter we accumulate as each needs its own cable and adapter to keep it’s battery charged up. My nightstand is a nightmare. Having to plug in my phone, earbuds, and smartwatch at the end of the day leaves barely any room for eave a glass of water. And when I reach to check a notification on my phone, the cables get tangled, pulling stuff off the stand. At least that was the case before I got myself a dedicated charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/">Take a look at this 3-in-1 wireless charger from Acer. It’s normally selling for $70, but Amazon has it in a limited time deal, bringing the price down by 32%.</a> That equates to a savings of $22 having you only need to pay $48.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Acer MagSafe charging station is designed with Apple in mind, making use of Qi2 wireless charging. Modern Apple devices all are equipped with wireless charging capability. If you have an iPhone 12 or later, your phone will be compatible. The 3-in-1 charger’s three dedicated charging platforms are each made for you iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, magnetically adhering to your devices. This keeps clutter down and you’re devices still easily accessible while charging. No more knocking things off the nightstand when you get a late night text.</p>
<p>The cylindrical base is made for stability, keeping it always upright even when you phone is providing some extra weight on top while charging. The anti-slip pads along the bottom keep it firmly planted in place. The charger also doubles as a stand. If you choose to keep the Acer charger on your desktop, you phone when mounted is set at an ideal viewing angle so you can scroll with it in place or just keep it there next to you in view in case a notification pops up.</p>



<h2>Portability in Mind</h2>
<p>The charging stand is made to be portable. The iPhone charging platform can rotate around to for a cylinder while the AirPod and Apple Watch platforms can retract into the base. This leaves you with a little capsule about the size and shape of a soda can which you can easily fit into your bag while traveling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/">Get the Acer 3-in-1 charger and eliminated clutter on your desk for a hefty discount for a limited time</a>. Right now, you’ll save 32% while the sale is still active.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/annapurna-showcase-tgs-trailers-zelda-kpop-ai-puzzle-2000628182</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-stray-alan-wake-tv-control-2-1851647950">Annapurna Interactive</a> kicked of Tokyo Game Show 2025 with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXf5t1MC1k">brief showcase</a> last night that highlighted three new indies joining its <a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-steam-cat-game-god-of-war-powerwash-simulator-1849339513">impressive list of published games</a> which includes <em>Donut County</em>, <em>Stray</em>, and <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. The upcoming releases hail from a variety of teams and feature unusual genre mashups. Could one or more of them be a 2026 GOTY contender? Here’s a brief breakdown of each.</p> <h2><em>People of Note</em> is an RPG for theater kids</h2>  <p>I’ll admit, I usually try to stay as far away from theater kids as possible, doubly so if they start singing (which I’m allowed to say as a reformed theater kid myself). But <em>People of Note</em>, a musical RPG, is boasting turn-based battles and some really pretty-looking environments.</p> <p>You travel around to different musically themed cities recruiting new band mates, but the real draw is the rhythm-based combat that evolves over the course of each fight as the music being played shifts. “Did you like <em>Expedition 33</em>? Did you like <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em>? Well…” is the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sunshineduk.bsky.social/post/3lzkfq2fylc2j">best pitch</a> for it I’ve heard yet. It’s made by Iridium Studios and is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.</p>

 <h2><em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em> is a <em>Zelda</em>-like for Dungeon nerds</h2>  <p>Okay, we’re getting a little warmer to my personal tastes with <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em>, a pretty familiar-looking riff on the classic <em>Zelda</em> puzzle action formula. You play as an antlered “voidsent” trying to lift a mysterious curse who travels to a bunch of different biomes to do that, including one that looks very <em>Journey.</em></p>

 <p>The draw here is the<em> Devil May Cry</em> sword combos and 3D dungeon exploration. There’s even a backwards flip just like in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. <em>Zelda</em> homages are a dime a dozen at this point, but I’m as hungry as anyone else for clever 3D puzzles. It’s being made by Yarn Owl and it’s coming to Switch 1/2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.</p>

 <h2><em>D-topia</em> is a cozy puzzle adventure for people terrified of the future</h2>  <p>This is by far the game I came away from the showcase most excited to check out. <em>D-topia</em> takes place in a future where, instead of drowning us in meme-slop and cooking the planet’s atmosphere, highly advanced AI has actually helped to take care of humanity’s every seeming need. If there’s a grim <em>Black Mirror</em>-style lining to this sci-fi story, it’s not apparent from the first trailer.</p> <p>Your job is to help the AI help make people’s lives better, exploring their personal relationships and unique life situations along the way. There’s logic puzzles, branching convos, and a very cute, very thick cat in the mix. It’s being made by Marumittu Games and coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Maybe it’s just because nothing could possibly live up to the cultural takeover of last year’s </span><i><span>Wicked</span></i><span> that the promotional campaign for </span><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>, the second and final part of the </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> stage musical’s movie adaptation, has felt a bit understated. We’re still two months away from the movie’s premiere in November, but this far out from the release of the first film, I was already being inundated with videos and memes of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo on a press tour, and nothing like that has happened yet with this one.. So it was surprising to me to see that, this morning, Universal released the final trailer for </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>. Maybe I’ve just been in an unintentional media blackout, but what was more surprising to me than the arrival of the trailer itself was that it pretty much spoils some of the biggest twists in the musical’s second act.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>fans have spent much of the last year trying to obscure some of the major reveals yet to come after Erivo’s showstopping “Defying Gravity” closed out the first movie, but the final trailer for the sequel pretty much gives away some of those details just months before the movie hits theaters. Specifically, the first film</span> <span>sows the seeds for iconic characters from the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>to appear in </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, but you might not catch on if you weren’t already privy to the musical’s second act. The most obvious is the lion cub Elphaba and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) rescue, who grows up to be the Cowardly Lion who accompanies Dorothy. But what about the Tin Man and Scarecrow who make up the rest of their crew? Well, viewers are quite familiar with both of these characters, actually. Boq, played by Ethan Slater, is turned into the Tin Man by Elphaba in an attempt to save his life. Fiyero suffers a similar fate, with Elphaba’s magic turning him into a scarecrow after he is tortured by the Wizard’s guards.</span></p>  <p><span>All of that had been mostly kept under wraps, until this new trailer. Boq’s fate is much more spelled out, as we see him turned into the Tin Man and shouting at Elphaba for what she’s done. Fiyero’s fate is more implied, as we see Elphaba stroking his face, but Bailey is facing away from the camera, so people who aren’t paying a ton of attention might miss that one. If you somehow didn’t catch it and are still reading this article anyway, sorry?</span></p> <p><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span> heads to theaters on November 21, when we will finally get to hear Erivo’s rendition of “No Good Deed,” resulting in world peace and happiness across the land.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/quake-2-brazilian-drug-dealer-3-favela-steam-review-fps-boomer-shooter-weird-2000628167</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-new-3-boomer-shooter-is-an-incredible-fever-dream-you-should-play.1307160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sometimes I discover a new game by looking at what’s trending on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3191050/">SteamDB</a>. That’s how I first learned about<em> BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT,</em> a game which I will now only refer to as <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> or <em>BDD3</em> to save us all a lot of time. Of course, the long and wild name caught my eye, but it also has a very high Steam review rating. So I paid $2 and checked it out, and folks, it’s a wild but oddly charming experience.</p> <p><em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> is best described as <a href="https://kotaku.com/more-tips-than-you-probably-need-for-the-quake-remaster-1847616427">a heavily modded and twisted version of <em>Quake</em>.</a> It uses that classic shooter’s engine as its foundation, as well as reskinned enemies and weapons from Id’s fantastic FPS. But while it plays a lot like that classic shooter, this definitely ain’t <em>Quake</em> anymore. At least, I don’t remember <em>Quake</em> containing so many hellish favela levels and evil soccer players.</p>  <p><em>BDD3 </em>plays, looks, and sounds like a retro fever dream, complete with loud, ear-piercing music, random sound effects, bizarre textures everywhere you look, and oddly shaped levels based on real-life locations, like a grocery store and a soccer stadium. Filling these levels are reskinned <em>Quake</em> enemies, now replaced with demonic soccer fans armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers. Oh, there are also demons and other monsters, too. I’m not sure if they like soccer. To rip through these enemies, you’ll use gold-plated handguns, assault rifles, dual shotguns, a simple sandal, a staff that shoots electrical beams, and other strange stuff I won’t spoil here. Every gun is very loud and feels like it would kill an elephant. And because this is the OG <em>Quake</em> engine, you move fast and hit hard, and it all runs perfectly on a modern, powerful PC. In other words, I had a blast playing <em>BDD3.</em></p>

 <p>As the game’s very long name suggests, <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> (loosely) tells the story of a person who, in trying to revive their favorite musician, accidentally opened a portal to hell and is now desperately fighting back against the demonic invaders while trying to close it and save the world. You know, that ol’ chestnut. Trying to follow the story is tricky, and&nbsp; I’m not even sure the game’s main developer is aiming to provide a coherent narrative. But whatever, the real appeal of <em>BDD3</em> is its fast-paced action and fever dream vibes. It’s the kind of game in which I was excited to play the next level just to see what nightmarish music or mess of textures awaited me.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628184">©Joeveno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, to <em>BDD3</em>‘s credit, while it might look like a giant mess of nonsense, there’s actually a well-made shooter under all that chaos. Levels are perfectly paced, providing you with a mixture of big fights and smaller encounters that tend to flow really well together. Though it may look slapdash, I think that aspect was carefully cultivated, and that a lot more thought than you might expect went into crafting every level.&nbsp; For example, each one is filled with strategically placed (and very odd-looking) quick save machines,&nbsp; so even less-experienced FPS players will have no trouble at all progressing.</p>

 <p>The other reason I’ve really enjoyed playing<em> Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> is that it’s quite a charming experience. It’s clear that the game’s lead developer, <a href="https://x.com/JoevenoYT">Joeveno</a>, is channeling his experience as a Brazilian gamer and developer to create something that, from the outside, might seem weird for weird’s sake. And to be sure, <a href="https://x.com/get_glizzy/status/1965638844910633266">if you listen to the dev talk about the game</a>, some of what’s in <em>BDD3</em> is just meant to be odd and make you laugh. But it’s also recreating the kind of bizarre <em>Quake</em> and <em>Doom</em> mods that used to be all over the internet back in the early 2000s, as well as the various foreign bootlegs of popular shooters that were passed around via forums or floppy disks long ago.</p> <p>On<em> Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em>‘s Steam page, Joeveno calls the trippy game a “Tribute to the Brazilian mods” and “bootleg games” from that era, and while I might not be as familiar with the source material as the dev is, I can still feel the passion and care that was put into nailing a very specific and chaotic vibe. <em>BDD3</em> won’t be for everyone, but for players looking for something different that is also well-made and fun, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3191050/BRAZILIAN_DRUG_DEALER_3_I_OPENED_A_PORTAL_TO_HELL_IN_THE_FAVELA_TRYING_TO_REVIVE_MIT_AIA_I_NEED_TO_CLOSE_IT/">I’d recommend spending $3 to check it out.</a> (The game’s price will jump to $5 on October 1.) And hey, at the very least, in the future, if someone says they own a game on Steam with a long name, you can make a bet with them that you know you’ll likely win.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-problem-with-switch-2-game-key-cards-isn%E2%80%99t-going-away.1307157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Did Sega just completely change the spirit of <em>Yakuza 3</em> by recasting its lead in the remake? Does <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> really look prettier without fog? And when will Nintendo finally support smaller SD express card sizes and ditch those dreaded game key cards? It’s another edition of <em>Morning Checkpoint</em>, <em>Kotaku’</em>s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Fed chair Jerome Powell <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1970606369578590451">says tariffs aren’t driving up inflation just yet</a> as companies eat the cost of the new taxes. I guess he’s not trying to buy a new game console!</p> <h2>Game devs aren’t happy about Switch 2 game key cards either, apparently</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2025-09-24/T2T62TGP493K00?srnd=cojp-v2"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> some backroom grumblings ahead of Tokyo Game Show 2025 this week regarding the health of game development in Japan and also, interestingly enough, anecdotal frustration with Nintendo’s game key cards for the Switch 2. It also confirms that Nintendo currently only offers 64GB sizes for all games, which increases the cost and appears to be the primary reason so many third-party publishers are opting for the plastic DRM keys instead.</p> <p>It’s clear, however, that paying the higher cost of going physical on Switch 2 can pay dividends for some games. <em>Bloomberg</em> points to the recent example of <em>Daemon Ex Machina: Titanic Scion</em>. “In the UK, it was released as a standard physical cartridge, ready to play straight out of the box. According to Nielsen IQ, 72% of physical sales in the UK were for the Switch 2,” it reports. “In Japan, however, it was sold as a key card, and the results were reversed. According to<em> Famitsu,</em> only 40% of sales were for the Switch 2.”</p>

 <p>Nintendo recently surveyed fans about their feelings on game key cards, and at least some publishers say requiring downloads helps with performance for more taxing games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>.</p> <h2>A <em>Yakuza 3</em> remake and more are on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm watching the Kiwami 3 Summit but seeing the new Rikiya is pissin me off <a href="https://t.co/qDZE7covQn">pic.twitter.com/qDZE7covQn</a></p> <p>— Jtastic (@JtasticVA) <a href="https://twitter.com/JtasticVA/status/1970696209749746121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Announced during the Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit livestream, <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> will bring the last PS3-era entry in the series to modern platforms on February 12. It recasts a key character, Rikiya Shimabukuro, with the guy from <em>Tokyo Vice</em> (Sho Kasamatsu), however, and fans are not happy.</p>

 <p>It’ll come bundled with a new spin-off called <em>Yakuza 3 Gaiden: Dark Ties</em> that follows main villain Yoshitaka Mine. <em>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</em> and remakes of the first two games are also getting upgraded ports for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

 <h2>PlayStation will now make you work to unlock special merch</h2> <p>Sony unveiled <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-photo-mode-features-detailed-tips-guide/">Franchise Rewards</a> this week, a new program through which popping certain trophies in games will qualify you to pay the company money for select swag. It’s kicking off with a pin and T-shirt for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> that cost a combined $55.</p>

 <p>This will be familiar to <em>Destiny 2</em> fans since Bungie has been running this exact type of program, offering special swag to day-one raid players, for some time. The reason it works <em>there</em> is that it’s a limited-time group achievement. I’m confused as to why Sony seems to be having so much trouble figuring out cool rewards initiatives.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill f</em> players are already nuking the fog</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone already removed fog in Silent Hill F lol <a href="https://t.co/K6daHORlZ7">pic.twitter.com/K6daHORlZ7</a></p> <p>— Besk (@BeskInfinity) <a href="https://twitter.com/BeskInfinity/status/1970526109851648178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Konami’s latest survival horror game isn’t technically even out yet and it’s already getting the mod treatment. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-modders-add-ray-tracing-cheats-and-remove-the-hud-and-the-series-signature-fog-a-day-after-advanced-access-went-live-on-steam"><em>IGN</em> notes</a>, fans are already adding cheats and ray-tracing while erasing the HUD and any other immersion-breaking elements. Now if only they could mod in a proper PS5 Pro mode for the console version.</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>Team Ninja’s upcoming Soulslike is coming soon, according to a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026">leaked store page</a> on Amazon Japan. The PS5 console exclusive arrives February 6 (on PC too). In addition to its samurai combat, the sequel is adding a new ninja playstyle. Who’s ready for some “Soulsgaiden?”</p> <h2>Here are some <em>Mega Man</em> RPGs you probably never knew existed</h2>  <p>Was I alone in never having heard of the <em>Mega Man Star Force</em> trilogy before? They were spiritual successors to <em>Mega Man Battle Network</em> that came to the Nintendo DS in the second half of the aughts and were mostly panned by reviewers at the time for failing to change up the formula much. Capcom is clearly still riding the high of the <em>Battle Network</em> collection selling over 1 million copies, and I applaud the effort to bring lost niche games to modern platforms.
