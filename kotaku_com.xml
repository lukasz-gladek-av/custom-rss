              <p><span>Reader, do you know what frotting is? Don’t Google it if you’re on a work computer because the image results might get you in trouble, but </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>, HBO Max’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-book-watch-cast-hockey-2000649249"><span>gay hockey romance</span></a><span>, revealed to me that a lot of people don’t know what that word means, and it was only when the hockey-playing twinks performed this sexual act on an episode of the show that some people were made aware that there was an actual word for two men rubbing their dicks together that wasn’t some joke like “sword fighting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As a gay man who has a lot of straight friends, a not-insignificant part of my longest friendships has been basically acting as a sex ed teacher for men who don’t know what sex looks like when the people involved have the same hardware. Now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-episodes-book-gq-ratings-2000655368"><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>has become such a cultural phenomenon</span></a><span> that it’s bridging the gap, especially for those who are mostly interested in the hockey side of it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3mba5dhe2bc2h"><i><span>Empty Netters</span></i></a><span> is a hockey podcast, and naturally when one of the biggest shows on streaming is about hockey players who also are knocking around sticks of a different kind, the hosts have gotta take advantage of the moment and cover the show. Hearing a group of straight men unpack the logistics of gay sex, such as roles like top, bottom, and versatile, and just being genuinely fascinated and non-judgmental, is easily a best-case scenario from fans of a sport that has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/opinions/nhl-pride-tape-ban-coming-out-day-de-la-cretaz"><span>its history of homophobia</span></a><span>. Shoutout to these guys for the idea of making a custom coin for picking who’s going to do what in a verse couple. And they say imagination is dead.</span></p>   <p><span>A big part of </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>is watching its leads in a constant, years-long push and pull as their paths infrequently cross due to hockey careers that have them traveling all over. Eventually, however, they end up in the same city, and then they have at it. It’s all presented with so much tension and drama that everyone watching the show, even straight men, are rooting for them to get it together and be more than a secret romance. There’s also a second couple with a similar struggle that gets its own dedicated episode, and seeing them finally reconcile is one of the few moments of unabashed catharsis the show, whose central couple is trapped in a will they/won’t they dynamic, has delivered. And it’s got straight men crying! Me too, brother.</span></p>         <p><span>Unfortunately, it’s not all positivity. If you search anywhere long enough, you’ll find homophobia directed at the show, and even on the queer side of things, some fans are questioning whether or not the actors playing the main roles are </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/heated-rivalry-actors-gay-creator-shuts-down-question-1236596915/"><span>actually queer themselves</span></a><span>. Neither of these things are new for queer media, but you would think after </span><i><span>Heartstopper </span></i><span>fans essentially </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221031234200/https://twitter.com/kit_connor/status/1587218539236188160"><span>dragged one of its stars out of the closet</span></a><span>, these people would know better. As for me, I’ll enjoy the show on its own merits without having to interrogate strangers on their personal lives.</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>has been renewed for a second season, but if you want a glimpse into what comes next, the series is based on the </span><i><span>Game Changers</span></i><span> books by Rachel Reid.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[We’re Already Getting Our First Gaming Price Hike Of 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448</link>
            <guid>1396015</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asus has cracked the seal on price hikes just ahead of CES 2026. The electronics maker, which is responsible for a range of PC gaming hardware including the already $1,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, warned partners of “strategic price adjustments” for certain products starting January 5.</p> <p>The company didn’t specify which products would get more expensive or by how much, but it did blame the current AI arms race for the upwards pressure on pricing. “These changes reflect shifts in capacity allocation by upstream suppliers, higher investment costs for advanced manufacturing processes, and structural supply gaps created by rising AI compute demand,” executive Liao Yi-Xiang wrote in a December 30 letter that was <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-officially-announces-price-hikes-from-january-5-right-before-ces-2026">translated by <em>Videocardz</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The company directly points to DRAM, NAND, and SSD component shortages as part of the issue. The announcement comes just days ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas where Asus and other hardware manufacturers will be revealing new hardware updates and other tech products.</p>

 <h2>Gaming shortages, price hikes, and next-gen console delays</h2> <p>Asus’ warning is the first hard evidence that 2026 will continue to see gaming get more expensive across the spectrum as major tech firms pivot to supplying ever-increasing demands for generative AI compute capacity. There were rumors throughout the end of 2025 that AMD and other companies were going to face shortages, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">s</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">ome hardware insiders</a> claiming that Microsoft’s Xbox would be among the hardest hit due to poor inventory management.</p>

 <p>According to<em> Insider Gaming</em>, the problem has gotten so bad that some hardware manufacturers are already discussing potential delays to next-gen hardware launches like the PlayStation 6 and new Xbox. “The situation has led console manufacturers to debate whether the next generation of consoles should be delayed from their intended 2027-2028 release window, with the hope that RAM manufacturers will be able to build out their infrastructure to produce more RAM, thereby allowing prices to drop,” it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/">reported last month</a>.</p>

 <p>More recently, <a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273#_endPass">South Korea outlet <em>Newsis</em> reported</a> that Nvidia and AMD are already looking at significantly increasing GPU prices in 2026. The most eye-popping claim was that graphics cards like the $2,000 RTX 5090 could more than double in price to $5,000 by the end of the year. But even much smaller price increases of just a few hundred dollars would make PC gaming’s current affordability crisis continue to spiral out of control.</p>

 <p>Whatever the short-term impact on pricing for gaming components, the AI race has already remade companies like Microsoft and Nvidia, to the point where their non-AI business appears as a relative rounding error on the larger enterprise’s P&amp;L. Without a complete implosion of the gen AI market (never say never), <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-nvda-ai-graphics-card-microsoft-stock-record-1851610332">it’s hard to see that changing any time soon</a>.</p>

              <p>When you want to share sound with others at a party or just enjoy music on your own with a great-sounding speaker, a portable speaker is the way to go. And while there are plenty of premium options, you can get by with spending a small amount on one that’ll really knock your socks off. Case in point: the Bose SoundLink Max Bluetooth Portable Speaker.</p>

              <p>Will we ever get a new <em>Deus Ex</em>? Could Ascend be the mechanical centerpiece of the next <em>Zelda</em>? And can speedrunning wash away all the bad sulfates still swimming around in our systems <a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-review-ea-gaza-microsoft-trump-2000656422">from 2025</a>? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, brought to you from my in-laws’ basement in western PA where the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3mbhb6xyphs2v">wind chill has temps near zero</a>. I’m currently blogging with an original Xbox to my right and the Sega Genesis version of <em>Shaq Fu</em> to my left. I am trying to put the finishing touches on my January backlog plans. They include getting at least one of the Celestial weapons in <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p> <h2>The most obnoxious way to beat an ultra-hard <em>Clair Obscur</em> boss</h2> <p>It took Reddit user&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/recordbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">Recordbreaks</a> 10,545 successful parries to beat the RPG’s new Duolistest boss from the recent free update, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fan-wins-ridiculous-8-hour-boss-battle-with-10545-successful-parries-and-no-dodges"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. The whole thing took over eight hours to complete, including one short break.</p> <p>“Only reason it took me this long is because I haven’t properly built Verso for damage in the millions yet,” Recordbreaks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pynsh7/if_it_can_bleed_it_can_die/">wrote</a>. “He was doing maybe 200,000 damage per hit and that’s if Roulette was working in my favor which it wasn’t most of the time.”</p>

 <h2>Don’t expect a new <em>Deus Ex</em> in 2026</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">….no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths.</p> <p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The voice of Adam Jensen, Elias Toufexis, <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057">recently previewed</a> his upcoming projects for 2026, including three mystery games. “No <em>Deus Ex</em> because the people in charge are psychopaths,” he added to cut off fan speculation. A new game in the sci-fi franchise was r<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/embracer-lays-off-97-people-at-eidos-montreal-reportedly-cancels-new-deus-ex-game/">eportedly cancelled</a> back in 2024 amid a wave of layoffs at Eidos Montreal.</p>

 <h2>A neat idea for the next <em>Zelda</em> game</h2> <p><em>Xboxera</em> cofounder Nick&nbsp;‘Shpeshal Nick’ Baker shared an alleged rumor about the next mainline <em>Zelda</em> game for Switch 2 on a <a href="https://youtu.be/CI8dpwlLOB4?t=4937">recent crossover podcast</a> with <em>Giant Bomb</em>‘s Jeff Grubb. Whether it’s accurate or not (I’m prone to disbelieve any Nintendo-related rumor unless it’s a multi-sourced report or comes from a supply chain warehouse), it still makes for a neat concept.</p>

 <p>Baker suggests the next <em>Zelda</em> will revolve around dimensional shifting using tears to transport between worlds. The mechanic would impact puzzle solving and other parts of the game, which would carry over a lot of the open-world concepts from <em>BotW</em> and <em>TotK</em>. It might be fan fiction, but it would also make for a neat-sounding game.</p>

 <p>I can totally imagine Nintendo taking the Ascend ability from the last game, which began life <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-ascend-cheat-code-escape-dungeon-1850432148">essentially as a development cheat code</a>, and creating a whole game around it. Whatever the next <em>Zelda</em> ends up being, it’s probably still years away.</p>

But the decade-long wait for an ending for the Hawkins kids is finally over. To some, the series finale seems to have gone over pretty alright. People in my group chat called it “fine,” another said they “absolutely crushed” it, and another remarked that they “did the best with what they had.” Those are reactions in private, rather than ones said publicly to get social media engagement, so I wasn’t surprised when I looked elsewhere and saw people were raking this episode through the coals.</span></p>  <p><span>The fifth and final season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>has been divisive, as it’s received criticism </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>for bad, overly simplistic writing</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>awkward, corny sentimentality</span></a><span>. At this point, it’s entirely possible that the wave of critical reactions could just be bleedover from what many consider a subpar final season, but there have been a few pain points that fans are harping on, whether that be quippy writing, bad performances, or the special effects several people independently compared to those in Linkin Park’s 25-year-old music video for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4"><span>“In The End.”</span></a><span> Hell, there are even a few comments in the video’s YouTube comments referencing the bland, awkward CGI backdrops of some of the finale’s sequences.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond the way the episode looks, the performances of several members of the cast have received some significant criticism, with much of it being directed to Finn Wolfhard. Some fans feel he couldn’t pull off what were supposed to be the episode’s biggest emotional swings, such as reacting to the “death” of Milly Bobby Brown’s Eleven, with whom his character has been romantically entangled for most of the show.</span></p>
