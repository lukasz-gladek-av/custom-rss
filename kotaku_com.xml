              <p>Don’t worry, podracing fans. While <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer’</em>s debut trailer didn’t feature any podracers, the iconic fast-moving space chariots will be a part of the full game.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced last year at the Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is an upcoming racing game set in that galaxy far, far away. <em>Galactic Racer</em> is being developed by some former <em>Burnout</em> devs at Fuse Games, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games">a new studio created in 2023</a>. The game looks awesome and features Sebulba at the very end of its teaser trailer. However, there was not a single podracing vehicle to be seen in that first teaser, which had fans like me worried that we wouldn’t get to recreate the best part of 1999’s <em>The Phantom Menace,</em> aka the podracing scene. Thankfully, there will indeed be podracers in <em>Galactic Racer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/">In a recent interview with <em>Gamesradar</em>,</a> &nbsp;Fuse Games CEO and co-founder Matt Webster told the outlet that yes, of course podracing will be a part of the studio’s <em>Star Wars</em> racing game.</p>  <p id="6d1737fa-b5a4-42f5-8eb9-7604d114ba62">“You can’t really make a <em>Star Wars</em> racing experience and not have podracing, can you?” said Webster. “The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy.”</p>

 <p>“However, when we set out to create <em>Galactic Racer,</em> we wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. <em>Galactic Racer</em> offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes.”</p> <p>More good news: <em>Galactic Racer</em> will feature the option to drive around in first-person, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-star-wars-episode-i-racer-remaster-is-a-little-ugl-1844206400">which is my preferred way to play podracing games</a>.&nbsp;Now, I just need Webster or someone else at Fuse Games to confirm the Boonta Eve Classic race course featured in past podracing games, like<em> Star Wars Racer’s Revenge,</em> will be playable in <em>Galactic Racer</em>, and I’ll be a happy wookkiee when the game arrives on consoles and PC later this year.</p>
