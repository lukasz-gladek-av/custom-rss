Fans have long thought <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, the last game in the venerated series before it switched to polygons, would be a perfect candidate for the retro-feeling visual overhaul, and the producer of the <em>Dragon Quest III </em>remake agrees.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196086" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196086,195519,195905" data-current="196086"><div><p>The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21614.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “It’s not that we have concrete plans for this, but personally I would have to say <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>,” Square Enix’s Masaaki Hayasaka <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dragon-quest-3-remake-interview-hd-2d-final-fantasy-vi&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dragon-quest-3-remake-interview-hd-2d-final-fantasy-vi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently told <em>Inverse</em></a></span> when asked what other game he felt deserves the HD-2D treatment. “<em>Octopath Traveler</em>—the first HD-2D title—was developed while referencing <em>FFVI</em>, as it had the highest-quality pixel art. I would love to see how the game we referenced would look with the HD-2D art style.”</p><p><em>Final Fantasy VI</em> was the last <em>Final Fantasy </em>to appear on SNES and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695">considered by some to be the series peak</a></span>, with a sprawling cast of nuanced characters, a grand continent-hopping campaign, and meaty but traditional turn-based combat that sports a unique progression system based around ancient magical creatures collected throughout the journey. It represents the height of a timeless art style and the pinnacle of craftsmanship from the series’ early development team. </p><p>That’s part of why <em>Final Fantasy VI </em>seems like a better candidate for a retro-infused makeover rather than a full-scale Unreal Engine update in the style of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy. Plus, Kitase Yoshinori, <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>’s original director who now overseas the <em>FFVII </em>remakes, previously suggested doing the same thing to the SNES classic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1751840614952698239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1751840614952698239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would require a 20-year timeline</a></span> to rebuild the dense 16-bit RPG in modern terms. </p><p>That doesn’t mean that giving it the HD-2D treatment wouldn’t require several years of work. While some fans treat it like a simple filter that can be applied to the original game, Hayasaka explained to <em>Inverse</em> that the process of transforming <em>Dragon Quest III</em> required a lot of time, learning, and attention to detail. He pointed to how different the remake’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFkbeCsEDrk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFkbeCsEDrk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first trailer in 2021</a></span> looked compared to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwFNq06bQk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwFNq06bQk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent launch one</a></span>. </p><p>“Some say that because HD-2D is pixel-based and this game is a remake, it should be easier to produce, but that is far from the truth!” he said. “In my opinion, this style requires a higher level of artistic sensibility, and a remake faces more project-level limitations compared to a brand-new title, making the difficulty extremely high. After all, the expectations from the fans of the original game are a monumental hurdle we must work hard to meet.”</p><p>Ideally, the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake could serve as a training grounds of sorts for an HD-2D overhaul of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. With four years of experience on the project under the team’s belt, maybe the pieces are finally in place to make the long-standing fan dream become a reality. That is, if the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake meets or surpasses Square Enix’s sales expectations, arguably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NotQuiteHereTSM/status/1836948159039238604&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NotQuiteHereTSM/status/1836948159039238604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a harder task</a></span> than any individual remake. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
