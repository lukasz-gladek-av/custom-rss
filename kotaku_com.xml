              <p>Wizards of the Coast is going to turn as much <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817">paper into gold</a> as it can with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and leading the way is its best-selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set. The company recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">announced at MagicCon Atlanta 2025</a> that it will be releasing additional <em>Final Fantasy</em> box sets with new cards featuring more beautiful art spanning the Square Enix RPG franchise’s history. If you’re worried about your wallet, relax! The initial wave of pre-orders sold out instantly.</p> <p>This mini-expansion includes a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">Chocobo Bundle</a>, a new Commander Deck, and four new Scene Boxes. They all arrive on December 5 and all of them are basically impossible to find online right now. Hopefully, fans have better luck with the inventory that comes directly to their local hobby shops. The Chocobo Bundle is $110 and comes with a bunch of booster packs, Chocobo-themed lands, alt-art reprints, a new promo card, and an incredibly neat life total click-wheel:</p>

   <p>Then there’s the new $100<em> FFVII</em> Limit Break Commander Deck that comes with a PC download code for the HD remaster of the original game and an exclusive Traditional Foil promo card that shows Cloud looking up at Shinra HQ. It seems way over-priced but is also completely sold out right now on Amazon.</p>

 <p>The new Scene Boxes are what really have my attention. There’s one each for <em>Final Fantasy</em>,<em> Final Fantasy VIII</em>,<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy XV</em>. Each comes with six Foil Borderless Scene Cards, six Art Cards, three Play Boosters, and one Display Easel for $42. The six cards go together to recreate scenes from each game. These new cards aren’t legal in standard play but look cool as heck. The art on the boxes alone makes me want one.</p>

   <p>There was no shortage of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Scene Boxes when they arrived in 2023, offering hope that after the initial frenzy subsides, fans will be able to get access to the new<em> Final Fantasy</em> ones without too much trouble, and without paying over MSRP for them. Are the boxes worth even that? In the grand scheme of things, probably not. But that’s the whole point of Universes Beyond: subverting logic with passion.</p> <p>The result has been very lucrative for Wizards but a pain for many fans. “This whole collab has been so confusing,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">wrote</a> one after the latest <em>Final Fantasy</em> products were announced. “Every attempt I’ve made at actually purchasing cards has shown that the set is sold out everywhere, and they don’t seem to be printing any new ones. But there’s new cards still coming out too?” Yes. And I suspect these won’t be the last ones either.</p>
