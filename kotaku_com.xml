              <p><em>The Outfoxies</em> arrives on consoles 30 years later. Tencent invests in its own version of <em>Ready or Not</em>. And could we finally get a <em>Kingdom Three Crowns</em>? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. All I can think about right now is how there’s a perfect <em>Simpsons</em> screenshot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/backpagepod.bsky.social/post/3ma6eg5h26c2a">for every major game</a> released in 2025. And no one had to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danarndtwrites.bsky.social/post/3mabjnlygj22d">use AI to make them</a>.</p>    <p>Activision <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2001351763375325384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001351763375325384%7Ctwgr%5E50868c1df8a9b754e43f660097df3e98a413ed04%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcall-of-duty-is-crossing-over-with-fallout-tv-show-in-season-1-reloaded%2F1100-6537059%2F">teased</a> the latest post-apocalyptic<em> Call of Duty</em> crossover with silhouettes of the Amazon show’s main characters, including Walton Goggins’ Ghoul and Aaron Moten’s Maximus in his Brotherhood Power Armor. The skins come just in time for the release of <em>Fallout</em> season 2 and an underwhelming launch for <em>Black Ops 7</em>. It’s not yet clear if players who want to run around Nuketown in Power Armor will be able to unlock it as part of the event pass or need to buy it separately.</p> <h2>Two years later, viral police-cam-footage game gets a big backer</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bodycam-fps-police-shooting-unrecord-unreal-engine-1850358473"><em>Unrecord</em> blew up</a> thanks to a 2023 trailer that made the FPS look almost indistinguishable from a found-footage movie. The game that some were skeptical even really existed is now being funded by Tencent. Will it be the next <em>Ready or Not</em>?</p> <p>“In Tencent, we’ve found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision,” Theo Hiribarne wrote (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/unrecord/bodycam-fps-game-tencent-backing"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in <em>Unrecord</em> early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>

 <h2>A cult arcade classic comes to home consoles 30 years later</h2>  <p><em>The Outfoxies</em>, a Namco arena fighter for arcades that was directed by <em>Soul Calibur</em> producer Masuya Ohishi<em>,&nbsp;</em>is finally playable on modern machines. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-cult-namco-arcade-game-which-may-have-inspired-smash-bros-has-been-given-its-first-ever-home-release/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that the game was potentially one of the inspirations behind Nintendo’s own platform fighter <em>Smash Bros</em>. The new Arcade Classics version from Hamster Corporation is single-player on Switch 1 and PS4 but has split-screen and additional modes on Switch 2 and PS5.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo wins a 15-year-old lawsuit over the Wii Remote</h2> <p>It sued BigBen Interactive, now owned by Nacon, for infringing on its Wii Remote technology with unlicensed third-party controllers. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/"><em>The Games Fray</em> reports</a> that Nintendo secured $8.2 million in damages in a recent ruling after years of BigBen successfully delaying proceedings. Nacon will still appeal the ruling, however, so this cold case will drag on a bit more.</p>

 <h2><em>Kingdom Two Crowns</em> might get a spiritual successor</h2> <p>Developer Stumpysquid has been resurrected by Raw Fury cofounder Gordon Van Dyke, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/raw-fury-co-founder-resurrects-kingdom-two-crowns-developer-stumpysquid-seeks-partners-and-investors-for-new-game"><em>Gamesindustry.biz</em> reports</a>. It’s looking for investors and probably developers to make a “micro-strategy survival game” which “builds on the same design fundamentals that shaped <em>Kingdom Two Crowns</em>, while exploring new mechanics, themes, and systems to deliver a distinct and contemporary experience.”</p> <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-two-crowns-doesn-t-feel-like-a-sequel-but-it-s-1831052985"><em>Kingdom</em> games’ 2D pixel-art take</a> on tower defense was great and I’d love to see a new one draft off the current explosion in <a href="https://kotaku.com/thronefall-islanders-tower-defense-strategy-steam-pc-1850701534">great minimalist strategy games</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-many-dudes-crashlands-butterscotch-shenanigans-interview-2000652567">The <em>Crashlands</em> devs are back with something new and it looks really neat</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">Video game consoles are crashing out to 1995 levels.

            <title><![CDATA[These 12 Movies Have A Higher RT Score Than Avatar 3]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-score-spongebob-squarepants-2000654602</link>
            <guid>1387432</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look out, Neytiri, you’ve got some competition in the form of a yellow talking sponge that lives under the sea and wears pants that are quite square in shape. At least that’s what Rotten Tomatoes indicates, with the site showing <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> performing worse with critics than a bunch of films that might surprise you.</p> <p>Releasing December 19 nationwide, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> continues the story of those blue cat alien people on that planet that looks like the coolest Unreal Engine 5 demo you’ve ever seen. This time, however, there are other alien cat people who aren’t all chill and into nature. These wild ones are into fire and destruction, and are causing chaos in the third entry in the blockbuster series. But perhaps more chaotic than that is the fact that <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_fire_and_ash"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> is sitting at 68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes</a> with 187 reviews, a drop compared to past installments. The first <em>Avatar</em> in 2009 sits at 81 percent and its 2022 sequel, <em>Way of Water</em>, has a solid 76 percent. I wonder if the lack of a big gap between releases and the tech not seeming as wild in this latest film has hurt perceptions of it.</p>

 <p>Here are some recent films that have higher Rotten Tomatoes scores. And yeah, RT is just an aggregation site and shouldn’t be treated as the gospel, but a lower score might throw a wrench in the works for the third <em>Avatar</em> movie, hurting its chances of making the billions the past films have, though I fully expect it to still do gangbusters over the weekend.</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair – 100%</em></li> <li><em>The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants – 91%</em></li> <li><em>Zootopia 2 – 91%</em></li> <li><em>Thunderbolts – 88%</em></li> <li><em>Bad Guys 2 -87%</em></li> <li><em>Predator Badlands – 86%</em></li> <li><em>Superman – 83%</em></li> <li><em>Dog Man – 82%</em></li> <li><em>Ballerina: From the World of John Wick – 75%</em></li> <li><em>Black Phone 2 – 72%</em></li> <li><em>Lilo + Stitch – 72%</em></li> </ul> <p>So yeah, the latest <em>Avatar</em> movie is losing critically to the newest <em>SpongeBob</em> movie. Perhaps movie critics just love that new tie-in song from Ice Spice, “Big Guy.”</p>  <p>Or perhaps SpongeBob truly is the big guy, and indeed, when compared to Cameron and his blue cat people, his pants are okay. But hey, at least Cameron can take solace in the fact that<em> Avatar 3</em> is better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><em>Wicked: For Good.</em> </a>Oh, and the fact that this new <em>Avatar</em> installment is likely to be the biggest movie of the year, like the past films were in 2009 and 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you want to make sure you have power no matter what, a power station is something you should absolutely invest in. It doesn’t matter if you’re dealing with a storm or another type of emergency, it can help you ensure you’ve got enough power to at least keep food warm, make sure you have a phone to use, or other small electronics that you need to survive.</p>
<p>That’s why the EF ECOFLOW Portable Power Station RIVER 2 Pro is a great choice. Not only is it a compact and versatile power solution that brings reliable energy to almost any situation, but it’s made even more affordable with the recent discount we found at Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Right now, it’s just $315, down from its usual price of $530. That’s a discount of $215 and 40% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable power station perfect for emergencies</h2>
<p>This power station has enough capacity to keep things like phones, laptops, lights, small appliances, and even medical devices running when you need them. You get a full suite of outlets, including AC ports for larger electronics and USB ports for smaller gadgets. That means you can charge or power several things at once without needing a bunch of adapters or cords.</p>
<p>Once the power station has been depleted, you can charge it up super quickly. All you have to do is plug it into a wall outlet, use a car charger while you are on the road, or hook it up to compatible solar panels if you are off the grid. Fast recharge means you are not stuck waiting for power to come back after it drains. It also gives you more flexibility to adapt to different situations no matter where you are.</p>



<p>Another practical benefit is the LCD screen on the front that shows how much power you have left. You can check battery levels quickly and easily, so you can plan how long the unit will last for your devices.</p>
<p>The RIVER 2 Pro also feels sturdy and well made. The case is easy to grip and looks like it can stand up to road trips, camping gear, or daily use in a workshop or garage. It does not matter if you are an occasional user or someone who really needs power on the go, the build quality gives you confidence.</p>
<p>Overall, the EF ECOFLOW Portable Power Station RIVER 2 Pro offers a lot of useful features in a compact package. And it’s really a solid deal for anyone looking to add reliable portable power to their gear list. For this price, you’ll get something you can keep and use in an emergency. And if you just need it for an inconvenience, it’s helpful for that as well. Now that it’s time for cold weather that could culminate in emergencies, you might think about grabbing one just in case.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Party Game (Just Dance 2026 Edition) Is 50% Off After 80K+ Sold, Still Arrives Before Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-party-game-just-dance-2026-edition-is-50-off-after-80k-sold-still-arrives-before-christmas-2000654283</link>
            <guid>1387321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="906">With the holiday season right around the corner, many people are preparing to spend long afternoons and evenings gathered with extended family under one roof. While that time together can be meaningful, it can also be challenging to keep everyone entertained for hours on end. After the big meals are finished and the conversations start looping, it helps to have a fun activity ready that can pull everyone together. A lively party game is often the perfect solution, and <strong><em data-start="473" data-end="498">Just Dance 2026 Edition</em></strong> fits that role beautifully. Instead of sitting around scrolling on phones or drifting into awkward debates, family members of all ages can jump up, move their bodies, and share a few laughs. Even better, there’s a timely deal that makes it easier to justify adding it to your holiday lineup. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5869/">Amazon is currently offering the Nintendo Switch version at half off, dropping the price from $50 down to just $25.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="906">A Party Games Everyone Can Enjoy</h2>
<p data-start="908" data-end="1716">One of the biggest draws of <em data-start="936" data-end="961">Just Dance 2026 Edition</em> is its impressive music lineup. The <em data-start="998" data-end="1010">Just Dance</em> franchise has been a staple of rhythm and dance gaming since its debut in 2009 during the Wii era, and its longevity speaks to how well the formula still works. Year after year, Ubisoft continues to refresh the experience with new tracks that appeal to a wide audience. This latest entry includes 40 new songs spanning modern pop hits, beloved throwbacks, and internet-fueled favorites. Players can dance along to chart-toppers like “APT.” by ROSÉ &amp; Bruno Mars and “Houdini” by Dua Lipa, as well as classics such as “Counting Stars” by OneRepublic and Madonna’s “Hung Up.” I’m personally most excited by the inclusion of “All Star” by Smash Mouth.</p>
<p>If you already own older versions of the game like <em>Just Dance 2024 Edition </em>or<em> Just Dance 2025 Edition</em>, you don’t have to worry about splitting your content across different menus. All your songs are accessible in one unified platform. Online play is also streamlined, allowing friends to dance together regardless of which yearly edition they own. On top of that, players can subscribe to Just Dance+, which unlocks hundreds of additional tracks and rotating in-game events.</p>



<p>Beyond being a crowd-pleasing party game, <em>Just Dance</em> also doubles as a surprisingly effective fitness tool. For those looking to stay active during the colder months, Workout Mode offers a fun way to build movement into daily routines. Instead of forcing yourself through a repetitive exercise plan, you can burn calories while dancing to music you enjoy. It’s a great option for players who want something more engaging than traditional workouts, whether they’re dancing solo or with others.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the physical version of<em> Just Dance 2026 Edition</em> doesn’t include a game cartridge. Instead, the box contains a download code that you redeem on your Nintendo Switch, after which the game is downloaded directly to your console.&nbsp;If you don’t want to wait and just want the code, you can order the digital version. Though it is still full price at $50, so it might be better to just wait for the empty box to ship.</p>
