            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s some good news for folks wanting an update on Sony’s previously announced <em>Helldivers</em> feature film. Justin Lin, best known for his work on the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">Fast &amp; Furious </a></em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">franchise</a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">,</a></em> is set to direct the cinematic adaptation of PlayStation and Arrowhead’s massively popular online co-op shooter.</p> <p>On December 1, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported that Justin Lin is going to both direct and produce</a> the <em>Helldivers</em> movie via his Perfect Storm Entertainment media company. He’ll be working alongside PlayStation Productions on the live-action adaptation, which was first announced in January 2025.&nbsp;The upcoming Helldivers movie has a script written by <em>Annabelle</em> and <em>It</em> writer Gary Dauberman.</p>

 <p>Justin Lin is a perfect choice for <em>Helldivers</em>. He has experience working on big-budget action movies, having directed <em>The Fast And Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast &amp; Furious 4, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6,</em> and <em>F9: The Fast Saga.</em> He also directed <em>Star Trek: Beyond,</em> the third and presumably last film in the JJ Abrams-produced modern Star Trek reboot trilogy. While the Fast movies can be over-the-top nonsense, the action and visuals within the movies are top-notch notch and each one is fast-paced. This resume feels like the perfect fit for Helldivers, especially with a solid script that leans into the absurd space-facism of the series.</p>

 <p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> says that Lin isn’t a gamer, but used that fact to his advantage when pitching his take on <em>Helldivers</em> to Sony and PlayStation. He reportedly wants to focus on the humanity in the characters and feature a “timely” story as well as build up what could be a future franchise for the studio.</p> <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-ghost-tsushima-1851733809"> Sony has plenty of other PlayStation adaptations in the works</a>, including a <em>God of War</em> series, <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> movie adaptations, and a <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> anime spin-off. And let’s not forget the <em>Last of Us</em> series on HBO, which has proven to be a massive hit for all involved. Get ready, because this is just the start of Sony and other game studios digging into their vaults filled with old IP to find the next big blockbuster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Six years ago, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> was published by author Rachel Reid, the second novel in the popular hockey-rivals-turned-lovers series </span><i><span>Game Changers</span></i><span>. Now, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> is a Canadian TV series airing on HBO Max here in the US, and though it’s only been out for a few days, the internet is about to put itself in the penalty box with how openly horny viewers are getting about it.</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>, which stars Hudson Williams as Asian-Canadian hockey player Shane Hollander and Connor Storrie as his Russian-born rival, Ilya Rozanov, is what some may consider a yaoi series. The Japanese term is used for a hyperspecific media genre focused on male characters in sexual relationships, also known as Boy Love, and the series certainly seems to be leaning into that concept. There’s a lot of loaded looks, barely there caresses, heavy breathing, and, eventually, very hot sex.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> premiered on November 28, and I have texted every single one of my friends about it over the course of the last few days (when describing the premise of “gay hockey men on rival teams” to my friend, she wrote back, “Did someone steal your diary?”). The show follows two players in the fictitious Major League Hockey league as they rise from ambitious rookies to superstars on the ice, all while navigating a searing hot attraction to each other. It’s currently sitting at an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, and it seems to be all anyone (read: women, gay men) can talk about.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I will admit that I am a huge hockey fan, so my algorithm may be slightly skewed, but both my TikTok and Twitter For You pages have been filled with people reacting to </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>. Fans are posting their reactions to certain sexually explicit scenes (including one that takes place in the locker room) and others that are demure but filled with more tension than when two dudes have to sit in adjacent penalty boxes after beating the piss out of each other.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the only appropriate reaction to ilya in this moment <a href="https://t.co/EbH0UgQujx">pic.twitter.com/EbH0UgQujx</a></p> <p>— Rosie 💖 (@fangirl000777) <a href="https://twitter.com/fangirl000777/status/1995341190238249354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All you horny bitches keep tweeting about is Heated Rivalry or is my algorithm just very homosexual… the thirst is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before dear lord</p> <p>— Lushious Massacr (@LushiousMassacr) <a href="https://twitter.com/LushiousMassacr/status/1994989655993766396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there’s gonna be a lot of “no mom, I just love hockey” happening across the US family HBO Max plans</p> <p>— spencer (top 0.1% of spencers) (@hoddsuspenders) <a href="https://twitter.com/hoddsuspenders/status/1995251268059865542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">you’d have to put me in an involuntary psychiatric hold if i was hollander <a href="https://t.co/a3xrMvcodA">https://t.co/a3xrMvcodA</a></p> <p>— cooper (@marnieapologist) <a href="https://twitter.com/marnieapologist/status/1994806070544666766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/qhLPJBRjHL">pic.twitter.com/qhLPJBRjHL</a></p> <p>— CINEMA 505 (@CINEMA505) <a href="https://twitter.com/CINEMA505/status/1994491724761370840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>That the lead actors are leaning into the show’s horniess is helping to increase the </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>hype.

Ilya and Hudson have to keep their romance a secret not just because they play for rival teams, but because of the frustratingly regressive ideologies that plague professional hockey. The NHL, as of writing, has zero openly gay players, and has waffled back-and-forth between supporting its LGBTQ+ fans and ignoring them—or, if you’re the Staal brothers, </span><a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/35927172/brothers-eric-marc-staal-decline-wear-panthers-pride-night-jerseys"><span>refusing to participate in a Pride Night</span></a><span> because of their “Christian beliefs.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ok so unfortunately heated rivalry is incredible. was hoping i would not fall down the gay smut pipeline but my eyes are not deceiving me. the characters are multi-dimensional, the plot is intense, and the smut? yeah, i need more.</p> <p>— spencer thomas (@byspencerthomas) <a href="https://twitter.com/byspencerthomas/status/1994668899401712047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> takes an incredibly straight sport and injects some queerness into it, and from what everyone is saying, it does so deftly and sexily. I have it queued up to start watching tonight for…research purposes.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> sells you the fantasy of being either a lone wanderer or part of a ragtag crew, rummaging through the wreckage of a fallen civilization to rebuild something better. Along the way, you can expect brutal gunfights with deadly machines and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">traitorous fellow raiders</a>. It <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">makes for a great adrenaline rush</a> as you exchange fire with man and machine.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is So Good I Keep Playing No Matter How Much I Suck</a></p> <p>But recently, I had the pleasure of chatting with a player who’s found a different role to play in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ post-apocalyptic Italy: that of a fruit salesman.</p>

 <p>Reddit user GrumbleGrits recently shared a video of this experience, putting down firearms in exchange for fruit and other harmless goods. Check it out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oxoism/welcome_to_the_fruit_shop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">here</a>:</p>   <p>This moment speaks to what I love about the extraction shooter genre and how it breaks open the expected routine of what we do in these kinds of games. The simple premise of getting in, grabbing loot, and getting out leaves a wide open space in between for unexpected emergent outcomes and creative playstyles, and that includes subversive ways of interacting with others. In a game where you can just as easily <i>not</i> shoot other players as you can otherwise murder them, why not consider peace? Why not find a new way to ascend the game’s meta?</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Fans Have A New Tool For Revenge Against Assholes</a></p> <p>That’s what GrumbleGrits and others have done. We recently chatted a bit over DM on Reddit about his experience as a post-apocalyptic fruit farmer setting up shop in an abandoned newsstand.</p>

 <p>Though he was quick to point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/wGr0f4vxfic">there are others in <i>Arc Raiders</i> setting up trade shops</a> (and many people coordinate on Reddit and elsewhere to arrange a trade for various hide-to-find pieces of loot) and insisted that he doesn’t want to receive any special credit for his efforts, setting up a fruit stand in the game certainly requires work.</p>

  <p>“I always try to have different stock each time,” he told me. “Sometimes I bring as many harvestable plants as I can, typically focusing on the materials needed to train Scrappy.” He’ll even trade non-edible goods as well, such as the many forms of loot that exist for no other reason than to sell to the in-game NPCs.</p>

 <p>But fruits and plants, which are needed to level up the player’s pet rooster that dispenses materials after every match, are important and, critically, often hard to come by. <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ typically unexpected and excessive violence can make holding on to these materials all the way to extraction hard enough as it is. That violence is something GrumbleGrits has to contend with when trading his goods.</p>

 <p>“It’s not all sunshine and rainbows,” he said, “getting to the chosen location for my storefront, clearing out Arc, and surviving any aggressive raiders along the way can be really difficult and occasionally results in tragedy. Once I reach the spot and get situated, I usually don’t have much issue with being attacked by other raiders.”</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Field Depot In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>It’s a very different kind of fantasy than many are used to when it comes to <i>Arc Raiders</i>: venturing out not to just find what you can and keep it for yourself, but doing so with the intention to trade it with others, and putting in the work to establish a safe trading zone.</p> <p>It’s not the only way GrumbleGrits plays, of course. “Between working a real-world job and engaging with all the various other systems of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and collecting items to trade away in the first place, it can be difficult to find time to goof off and set up these little shops,” he said. While trading fruit makes for a unique way to interact with others and use the game’s loot system, GrumbleGrits isn’t throwing down his weapons permanently any time soon. Just recently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pb39k2/goodbye_big_lady_my_first_queen_kill/">he shared some footage of his first Queen kill</a>. But who knows, maybe the loot he’ll earn from this battle might show up on a store shelf soon.</p>

 <p>Of course, the experience is not without its theatrics. “I once had a couple of guys duel to the death with their melee weapons for a stack of mushrooms,” he said, recounting one of the more unique situations. “It was a violent and quick battle,” he said, “a testament to how sought-after mushrooms can be. They’re difficult to find if you don’t know where to look.”</p> <p>Thankfully, GrumbleGrits and other players not only know where to look for hard-to-find loot, but they’re also willing to share the wealth.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle Just Got A Surprise Discount]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232</link>
            <guid>1369747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo revealed its Black Friday 2025 deals last month and there was no <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-is-on-amazon-pre-order-invite-usa-available-1851785835">discounted Switch 2 among them</a>. This was not surprising, given that the new hardware became the fastest-selling console launch ever this year. What is surprising is that Walmart decided to do its own discounted Switch 2 <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle for Cyber Monday, and Amazon followed suit.</p> <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-plus-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle/16422361549">Walmart</a> crashed the fake internet retail holiday with the best deal on a Switch 2 yet. It was $50 off the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle, which includes the $80 game and is usually priced at $500. At just $450, it essentially gave customers the game for free. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-Pok%C3%A9monTM-Legends-Switch-2/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon</a> then followed up with its own match, and at least as of the time of writing, I was able to get one in my shopping cart for the discounted price (the Walmart one wasn’t working).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle still available for $449 at Walmart (price in cart) <a href="https://t.co/BHwEEWL35g">https://t.co/BHwEEWL35g</a> <a href="https://t.co/eqFxtps9Kk">pic.twitter.com/eqFxtps9Kk</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1995527157121224954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s unclear how much longer the deal will last, or if it might sporadically come back throughout the holiday season. Is it an extremely limited discount, or are Walmart and Amazon just that desperate to get people through their online doors? Or maybe it was a last-minute decision in a hyper-competitive holiday season, as people get more discerning about their purchases while everything shoots up in price.</p>

 <p>The only other console maker doing big discounts this year is Sony, which took $100 off the price of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-black-friday-deals-dualsense-edge-controller-2000645182">PS5 Pro and standard model</a>, both of which had already been marked up due to recent tariff-fueled pricing adjustments. Nintendo, on the other hand, seems happy to have customers pay full price for most of its new games and even its old consoles.</p> <p>A Switch <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle that had been a mainstay of the company’s Black Friday sale lineup for years <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413">was MIA this year</a>. I guess it didn’t want to be caught competing with itself. The Xbox Series X/S, more expensive than ever, didn’t get a discount either.</p>

              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-film-sequel-confirmed-march-spring-2027-sega-1851744323"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</span></i></a> <span>is coming in 2027, but it looks like another live-action </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>movie is coming not too long after. Is this the rumored Shadow-centric spin-off we’ve been hearing about? It better be, Paramount.</span></p> <p><span>According to </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>, Paramount has added a new “Sonic Universe Event Film” to its schedule that will premiere on December 22, 2028, four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a> <span>debuted last December. </span><i><span>Variety </span></i><span>notes this movie will be a spin-off, which means it likely won’t follow the blue blur and his friends. There have been longstanding </span><a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/articles/sonic/rumor-shadow-movie-officially-in-development-at-paramount-they-want-to-do-an-amy-rose-project-r3181/"><span>rumors</span></a><span> that a spin-off movie about Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic’s black-and-red rival played by Keanu Reeves, was on the table if </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </span></i><span>did well, and it got around half a billion at the box office.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Shadow was the antagonist of most of </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>, and seemingly sacrificed himself to stop his original plan to destroy the world. The movie’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285"><span>final post-credits scene</span></a><span> shows him recovering his inhibitor rings that fell to Earth in the film’s climactic space battle, implying that he would return in a future movie or television series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What we know so far about </span><i><span>Sonic 4 </span></i><span>makes it sound like Shadow won’t be in the next numbered film, so a spin-off starring him would be the next best thing. Could this be when the film series finally introduces the other members of Shadow’s Team Dark: treasure hunter Rouge the Bat and Eggman’s estranged robot Omega E-123? Please, Paramount. I need Shadow to find his new family after losing everything in </span><i><span>Sonic 3</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever this movie is, it will premiere just about a year and a half after </span><i><span>Sonic 4</span></i><span>, which is set for theaters on March 19, 2027.

              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s first DLC, <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101">is out later this week</a>. Ahead of its release, publisher Bandai Namco spilled the beans on which of the roguelike multiplayer game’s field bosses have killed players the most. Anyone who has played for any length of time probably expected Bell Bearing Hunter to be crowned the most deadly, but that honor has actually gone to the Royal Carian Knight. Quiet frankly, I don’t believe it.</p> <p>The newly released info graphic lists the “<a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-eye-of-the-storm-infographic">8 most deadly field bosses</a>.” Field bosses are the major enemies that exist at various points on the map during the day. Strong ones give players better loot and more levels. Also an early grave. Here’s the ranking according to Bandai Namco:</p>

 <ol> <li>Royal Carian Knight</li> <li>Draconic Tree Sentinel</li> <li>Erdtree Avatar</li> <li>Bell Bearing Hunter</li> <li>Pot-Troll</li> <li>Black Blade Kindered</li> <li>Death Rite Bird</li> <li>Ulcerated Tree Spirit</li> </ol> <figure id="attachment_2000649223" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649223"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649223">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>The top two aren’t completely out of left field. Both horseback bosses have tons of mobility, are brutal up close, and will wreck you with long-ranged magic attacks, especially if you’re trying to escape. Most of the times I’ve died to one of them, I wasn’t even trying to fight them, just climb up a cliff. Erdtree Avatar is a little more surprising to me. He’s brutal if you’re not ready to fight him, but pretty predictable and easy to avoid once you’ve got decent levels and equipment. So is Death Rite Bird at number seven. I always avoid the Bird at all costs.</p>

 <p>Speaking of avoiding bosses, that brings us to Bell Bearing Hunter. The unsuspecting field boss walks softly but carries a big sword. Many a <em>Nightreign</em> player has encountered him, though “oh yeah, I got this,” and then after landing their first attack and nearly being one-shotted in response, immediately realized “oh no, I actually don’t got this at all.” He’s become a meme in the community for being the one boss everyone knows to avoid. You can tell you’re playing with a new player if you encounter Bell Bearing and they don’t immediately keep running.</p>

 <p>So what’s he doing at number four? There are two possibilities here. 1.) He’s not actually the hardest, and despite his legendary status on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit and Discord, players have a way harder time with the Royal Carian Knight and Draconic Tree Sentinel. Or 2.) Bell Bearing has killed fewer players because they never bother fighting him to begin with. It all comes down to whether Bandai Namco is measuring total body count or averaging those proportional to the actual number of encounters. Carian Knight might have killed more players, while Bell Bearing actually has a higher win-rate against them.</p> <p>I’ve asked Bandai Namco for clarification. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">mythmaking around <em>Nightreign</em>‘s most legendary boss</a> is at stake. All I know for sure is that when <em>The Forsaken</em> <em>Hollows</em> goes live on December 4, I’m running past both Carian Knight <em>and</em> Bell Bearing.</p>
