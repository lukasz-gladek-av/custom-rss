In fact, the fourth game in the franchise only imports three choices from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, a stark departure from its predecessor which used a whole separate app to let you craft a world state based on hundreds of previous decisions. While that limitation lingers over <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare says this shouldn’t signal to fans that choices from games as far back as the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> can’t factor into a future game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

The final game only implements three decisions specifically regarding the Inquisitor, the protagonist of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. These choices mainly end up affecting a few lines of dialogue, and meanwhile, <em>The Veilguard </em>goes out of its way to avoid actually addressing anything else the player may have done in previous games. Every returning character’s dialogue is written in a way that they could have feasibly ended up where they do in the sequel regardless of whatever choices you may have made. Some minutiae falls through the cracks, like Isabela talking as if she joined the player in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, when it was possible to play that game without recruiting her. But broadly, BioWare chose to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112">take more care to not contradict players’ choices</a></span> than to represent them. This was a far cry from the studio’s previous work, and while I appreciate the care the team took to not step on toes, I think most fans were surprised to find something that felt so severed from previous games, especially as <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story ties up so many loose ends from across the franchise.</p><p>The studio has said that it planned on using the geographical distance between the events of the southern regions of Thedas in previous games and the northern setting of <em>The Veilguard</em> to get narrative distance. However, Busche explained to <em>IGN </em>that just because a decision from <em>Origins</em>, <em>DAII</em>, or <em>Inquisition</em> didn’t factor into <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story, that doesn’t mean it can’t be imported in a future game.</p><p>“The big thing for us is we wanted to make this story, every single choice you make, feel relevant to it,” Busche said. “One thing that we could have stated more clearly or maybe alluded to more clearly in the game is the idea that just because these choices from the past library of games didn’t necessarily impact this particular story, that doesn’t mean they’re gone. This is a chance for us to really key in to what matters with these events and what’s happening in Northern Thedas. I do fully expect that these choices going clear back to <em>Dragon Age Origins</em> will again matter. So just wanted to be on record with that. Every one of your choices that people have made throughout their <em>Dragon Age</em> journey, those are still your choices. And if you’ve seen the secret 2D ending we talked about, some of these events being quite pertinent. It’s easy to see how those choices can and will be relevant into the future.”</p><p>While a hypothetical <em>Dragon Age 5</em> is years away at this point, what we do know about the future of the series implies that old choices could be more relevant down the road. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439">secret ending</a></span> in particular has ramifications for the whole franchise, rather than just that game, so I could see BioWare circling around to older game decisions while plotting the series’ path forward. Will it be enough to make up for <em>The Veilguard</em>’s relative disconnect? We’ll see in a few years, as for now, BioWare has pivoted its focus to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417">next <em>Mass Effect </em>game</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It would be a simple, harmless error if wicked.com didn’t direct people to Wicked Pictures, a pornographic production studio that’s been around for over 30 years (and has had that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domain=Wicked.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domain=Wicked.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website domain</a></span> for just as long). The lawsuit, filed by South Carolina mom Holly Ricketson, alleges that on or around November 11, she purchased one of those <em>Wicked </em>dolls for her young daughter and was shocked when her child showed her the Wicked.com site which, she says, “pasted scenes of pornographic advertisements across her phone screen.”</p><p>She claims her child was exposed to full-on nude sex scenes. Mattel issued a recall of the dolls but didn’t offer a refund. By explicitly advertising the toys to children aged as young as four, the lawsuit alleges the company neglected its duty to produce an appropriate product, packaging and all.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>While the toy giant didn’t directly address the lawsuit, it did argue that erroneously including a porn website on its packaging “in no way impacts the value or play experience provided by the product itself in the limited number of units sold before the correction.”</p><p>While Mattel appears to want to separate the packaging from the actual product, in terms of what the company is actually selling to children, there may be another way out of culpability.<strong> </strong>When you visit wicked.com, the first image you get is an age gate prompt that explains how the content on the page is restricted and only intended for viewing by those 18 years of age or older, with no pornographic images visible. Let’s say her child aimlessly clicked “enter,” as we all do when provided with a list of terms and conditions that could literally involve us consenting to giving our data to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/tech/x-twitter-terms-of-service/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/tech/x-twitter-terms-of-service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI overlords</a></span> for all we know. When I checked (for purely journalistic reasons), no advertisements flashed on my screen, and everyone depicted on the home page was fully clothed, even if they were scantily clad. It’s possible the child could have continued clicking through screens in search of <em>Wicked</em> content, and eventually stumbled upon the type of content her mother alleges she was exposed to on the site. But, this might be a case of principle vs practicality where, to the mom, the fact her child was directed to a site that contained pornography trumped the possibility<strong> </strong>that her child maybe didn’t “immediately” show her mom when she got on the site, as the lawsuit claims,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and rather showed her mom the results of her going through the site on her own. </p><p>Even with the doll recall happening 11 days before the movie debuted, the Broadway adaptation still raked in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-wicked-shatters-expectations-gladiator-2-starts-strong-1236221979/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-wicked-shatters-expectations-gladiator-2-starts-strong-1236221979/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$114 million</a></span> at the box office in the United States alone in its opening weekend. With a <em>Wicked Part II </em>set to hit theaters next year, Mattel should definitely invest in a spell check to save itself any future legal headaches, and prevent the possibility of minors stumbling upon porn. Just a thought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This removes them from your party for the remainder of the game, as they are blighted and controlled during the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-suicide-mission-choice-1851712586&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-suicide-mission-choice-1851712586">final battle in the city of Minrathous</a></span>. Whoever is kidnapped does defy the elven gods in the end, and as painful as it might be to pick between two of your faves, BioWare says this was all in service of the two’s respective stories, whether that be as an elven historian or a Tevinter reformist. As Epler explained to <em>IGN</em>:</p><figure id="" data-id="8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-recommend-id="image://8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-recommend-id="image://8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So for Neve and Bellara, the two groups that have been the most directly affected by the gods up to this point are obviously the elves – it’s their gods that are back – and Tevinter, Minrathous. You know, the Venatori have either fully seized power or have made some pretty big inroads in Minrathous, depending on which city you save. And the gods have come back and brought their dragons and proclaimed them as the gods of the Tevinter people. So both Bellara and Neve have a direct investment. Not that everyone else doesn’t, but they have the most direct investment in stopping the gods at this point. We wanted to give you that choice between these two characters who, again, have a very personal score to settle with the gods and are both mages whereas Emmrich obviously wants to stop the end of the world, but doesn’t have quite that same connection to the events that are going on. So those two made the most sense as to who would disable them.</p><p>The other thing is something that shows up in the visuals. Minrathous, Tevinter in general has always been kind of...there’s echoes of ancient elven magic in everything to Tevinter and Minrathous does because it’s meant as almost a cargo cult imitation of what the ancient elves were capable of. The ancient elves worked lyrium into their buildings, Tevinter uses gold and jewels because they don’t have the capacity to work lyrium. So it made the most sense for them.”</p><p>But that’s not the only sacrifice you’re forced to make in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s final push. The more (potentially) permanent choice is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-team-decision-davrin-harding-save-1851694983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-team-decision-davrin-harding-save-1851694983">between the dwarven scout Harding or the elven warrior Davrin</a></span>. At the beginning of the final mission, the player must pick one of the two to lead a distraction team as the party begins an assault on the elven god’s base. At the end of this first act, whoever you chose will sacrifice themselves to give the rest of the team an opening and kill one of the gods. According to Epler, Harding was always one of the characters the team planned on putting at risk, while Davrin became the second choice as his story as a Grey Warden formed during development.</p><figure id="" data-id="466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-recommend-id="image://466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-recommend-id="image://466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“We knew Harding had to be one of them, and then we had to ask ourselves: we’ve got a fan favorite returning character from <em>Inquisition</em>,” Epler said. “Who could possibly equal that in terms of making this difficult choice? It’s like, well, Assan. Assan and Davrin. Davrin obviously has a direct link to this at this point because of Weisshaupt. He’s got a very personal stake in it, and it made sense for the two of them to be the ones to be the choice to lead the distraction team, because again, we want to find those personal connections between the characters and the events that are going on. And, you know, the case of Harding, she has so much investment in this story because she’s been living it since <em>Inquisition</em>. And then Davrin. Davrin’s entire order just fell at the end of the previous act. He’s going to have a real strong investment in stopping the guys too here.”</p><p>The choices are impactful in and of themselves, of course, but as Epler and Busche noted, they can also be complicated further by other things happening in your party when the time comes to make your last stand.</p><p>“One thing that’s so interesting about that choice too, the Harding and Davrin choice is it actually presented some interesting complexity and some emotional investment we could tie into, which always makes for a more satisfying, I will say harder choice to make,” Busche said. “I’ll say in one of my playthroughs, Taash and Harding were in a relationship together and I happened to be romancing Davrin.
