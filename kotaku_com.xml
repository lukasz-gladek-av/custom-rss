              <p><span>Most live-service games don’t get as many chances as </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has gotten, but most of them aren’t made by Blizzard, which can afford to fumble, refocus, and rise from the ashes. The problem any game that’s gone on for 10 years faces is that different versions of it exist in the minds of everyone who’s ever played it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you stopped pushing payloads during the height of the game’s domination, you may have a rosy image in your mind of a game that doesn’t really exist anymore. Those of us who came in later have only really known </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>as a fallen titan struggling to get back on its feet. When the sequel came out and never actually delivered the cooperative campaign Blizzard had promised, plenty of people dismissed </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>as a failed experiment and a fumbled bag. Even I, a person who has put over 1000 hours into Blizzard’s hero shooter, fell off for a brief period, though I kept my Soldier: 76 keychain on my ring even when I wasn’t playing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000002089" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002089"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002089">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919"><span>But last year, something shifted</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>may not have become the story-driven sequel I wanted, but Blizzard showed that even if its original plan had fallen through, it wasn’t going to leave the game as a skin-driven cash cow doing nothing more than giving Mercy fans another one hundred outfits in which to dress up their favorite medic. The introduction of Perks, or character-specific tweaks that change or lean into different playstyles on typically one-note heroes, and the build-driven Stadium mode, showed that all that work on skill trees and buildcrafting hadn’t been a complete waste of time.</span></p> <p><span>Now, in 2026, Blizzard is integrating the story in a way that’s probably more sustainable than a PvE campaign microtransactioned out over the course of years would have been. It’s taking its seasonal rollout and completely restructuring it to accommodate a linear story, rather than just leaning on character-setting lore drops with no forward momentum. It’s not the game we were pitched in 2019, but the Blizzard team that was leading the charge on that has been desecrated over the past few years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Game director Jeff Kaplan </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-director-jeff-kaplan-leaves-blizzard-1846723205"><span>left Blizzard before </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>launched</span></a><span>, the narrative and events teams were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192"><span>subjected to layoffs</span></a><span> that left the story in limbo </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720"><span>until the campaign was canceled</span></a><span>, and for a while, it felt like </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>was back on life support similar to how it was during the years-long content drought leading up to </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005813" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005813"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005813">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For some, it doesn’t matter that </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has grown, changed, and gotten more than simply better, instead reaching a level of greatness some thought lost. For those people, that moment of disappointment when they stopped playing it remains too vivid, that betrayal too great, for them to so much as reinstall the game. People love a </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></i><span> moment in which games that stumble in the beginning get their shit together. Those are becoming less common, however, in an industry that invests millions of dollars into service games it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-review-sci-fi-hero-shooter-ps5-overwatch-1851630481"><span>unwilling to support longterm.</span></a><span> Players, meanwhile, are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><span>growing tired of live games</span></a><span> that feel like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>obvious ploys for their time and money</span></a><span> at a time when both of those things are becoming more scarce and precious.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In our modern, post-patch world in which games sometimes launch broken and get fixed later, people are becoming more jaded to the notion of bad or just lackluster games becoming good ones months or years down the line. There are too many games to play to waste time on one that isn’t giving you what you want right out of the gate. Most live-service games are sent out to die, Blizzard just has the institutional resources and stubbornness to not let a game like </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> slip through the cracks. In the past decade, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has become a symbol of both the potential live games have to reach and even surpass their former glory, and the fact that only the biggest companies can afford to fail now.</span></p>

 <p><span>I talk to friends who stopped playing </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>years ago and feel like I’m running up against versions of the game that haven’t existed in years. Age-old complaints that were long patched out or reworked still linger in their minds, or major overhauls merely exist as passing headlines they read once but never actually played for themselves.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665015"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665015">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Live games are kind of like the friend you had growing up that let you down in one way or another, and if you’ve gone no contact, you might not know they’ve turned their life around. But the people who left for slights from years ago are often defining the narrative about the state of the game just as much as the people who are still playing and know what the game is like now.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whether it’s because actual competition in the form of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> showed up kicking Blizzard in the ass or because the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team has finally been able to rebuild itself after years of strife, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is in the best state it’s been in the past decade, and finally has a pipeline that is letting the team take massive swings like releasing ten heroes in one year and giving the story the momentum and direction it’s desperately needed, even if it’s not what we once thought we were getting. There will always be skin imbalances to complain about, “what ifs” to ponder, and potential it feels like Blizzard failed to live up to. But the game we have now is the best version Blizzard’s ever given us. I guess we’ll see if it’s enough to correct the narrative in the months and years to come.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s Why Some Overwatch Heroes Get More Skins Than Others]]></title>

              <p><span>Debates about who gets <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893">the most cosmetics in </a></span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> are as old as the game itself, but these arguments have only gotten worse as the hero shooter has implemented <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-collaborations-survey-pokemon-star-wars-1851787277">collaborations with other brands</a>. It feels like a crossover can’t come and go without Kiriko, Mercy, or Juno getting some love while some heroes like Baptiste, Lúcio, and many, many others go without. Why? Well, many </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans hypothesize that it’s because Kiriko and Mercy mains are always willing to pony up cash, but according to Blizzard, it’s a bit more complicated than that.</span></p> <p><span>During a group interview with the art team on Blizzard’s Irvine campus, art director Dion Rogers explained that some of the characters who have historically been spoiled in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s many collaborations are just easier to conceptualize in different outfits and accessories than others, but as the team has gotten more experienced at adapting outside looks for its heroes, they hope to better serve some of the neglected characters, like Lúcio.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our team, we draw a bunch of stuff and it just works better with some heroes than others,” Rogers said. “It’s just the nature of the hero itself. I know Lúcio mains are hungry. We’ve got some stuff coming for Lúcio as you just saw with </span><i><span>Hello Kitty</span></i><span>. There’s even more coming for him. So as we become better at the work and more efficient, we’re nearing 50 heroes, also, so it’s really hard to get to certain guys. It is the nature of there are some characters that are easier to do things for than others.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“There’s some guys, you do it, and you see it, and you’re like, ‘that looks cursed. That’s not gonna work.’ Some of them actually slip out and make it out into the game. So that’s been a lot of the conversations we have sometimes. It’s more of, ‘does a fantasy truly work for a character or not, or are we making some sort of cursed thing?’ But now, 2026, you’re going to see the kind of fruits of our labor over the past two years of building a better pipeline, building more efficiency. We’ll be able to hit more heroes than before with broader concepting and stuff for the guys that feel a little underserved. We’ll get to them.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Character artist Melissa Kelly added that, as a Zarya fan, she sympathizes with the plight of those who play underserved heroes. That said, while Lúcio is getting some love in the Sanrio crossover, Kiriko, Juno, and Mercy are also in the line-up. So some old habits die hard.</span></p>
