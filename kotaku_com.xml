              <p>Clickout Media is a group that buys up gaming sites and then forces them to host endless unmarked advertorial content for gambling sites and casinos. Now the owner of <em>The Escapist</em>, <em>Adventure Gamers</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Esports Insider&nbsp;</em>is, according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clickout-media-owner-of-the-escapist-pivots-to-ai-holds-mass-layoffs/">reporting by&nbsp;<em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, going to “pivot to AI,” and of course that means firing swathes of staff and demolishing the remains of all the sites it’s ruined.</p> <p>“Sad to say that my role at <em>The Escapist</em> is up for redundancy,” wrote that site’s&nbsp;contributing editor Lloyd Coombes on BlueSky. On LinkedIn he added, “<span><span dir="ltr">that means a lot of things that I’m still not quite getting my head around.” Coombes is just one of many people who are losing their jobs as a result of ClickOut’s ridiculous folly. <em>Insider Gaming</em> reports, “It was said that Clickout Media will be maintaining a skeleton crew of ‘AI Editors.'”</span></span></p>   <p>“That’s me and my team gone from&nbsp;<em>VideoGamer</em>,” says Cat Bussell. “Very sad day. I’ll probably do a bigger post on this later on down the line. Still reeling.”</p>   <p>It seems that all these sites might be completely wiped out with so many job losses, all to be replaced by the illusion of AI.</p>

 <p>ClickOut is a peculiarly shy company, describing itself as a “PR and marketing agency” despite its acquisition of gaming sites, and focus on crypto and web 3. It’s so shy, in fact, that it keeps its company’s name off the sites it buys, and goes out of its way to hide its ownership, as we discovered last year when the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/adventure-gamers-forums-gambling-ads-jack-allin-1851784764">bought the beloved&nbsp;<em>Adventure Gamers</em></a> and reduced it to shilling for online casinos. The site is almost abandoned now, after 27 years of passionate adventure gaming coverage, with the last couple of stories from mid-2025 sitting ghost-like at the top above “reviews” of online slot machines.</p> <p>The same is true on&nbsp;<em>The Escapist</em>, a site that’s been through many iterations from its highbrow beginnings as an online magazine, through its grim pro-GamerGate era, to its most recent form as a solid, well-written gaming news site from people who genuinely care. The staff has demonstrated a special knack for covering lesser-known games among the big hitters, albeit one that is constantly undermined by the enforced inclusion of “guides” for online gambling that all read suspiciously like a robot might have helped. The same is true all over again on <em>Esports Insider</em>, which continues to put out solid journalism about the esports world, in between wildly incongruous articles about stock prices of betting firms. And then there’s the esteemed <em>VideoGamer</em>, which has battled on despite being plagued with casino ad shite.</p>

 <p>It’s not just gaming sites to which ClickOut commits this vandalism.&nbsp;<em>ReadWriteWeb</em> was once a web tech site, launched in 2003 and well-respected, but now it’s just a site pushing sports betting, casinos and poker. It also spent last year <a href="https://pokerindustrypro.com/news/article/222041-cardplayer-pokerscout-pokerstrategy-clickout-finixio">buying many, many poker sites</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.igbaffiliate.com/en/articles/mergers-and-acquisitions/clickout-media-buys-gambling-insider-for-up-to-14-million/"><em>Gambling Insider</em></a>.</p>

 <p>We’re not able to confirm how many people have lost their jobs today, because as&nbsp;<em>Insider Gaming</em> reports, those affected have been required to sign NDAs in order to ensure they receive their severance. We’ve reached out to ClickOut, but based on previous experience, their shyness seems to prevent them from replying to emails, too.</p> <p>We wish all the best to everyone affected, in a continuingly grim era for games journalists.</p>

              <p><span>According to Rémi Verschelde, project manager of Godot Engine and co-founder of the platform’s financial backer W4 Games, the never-ending wave of “AI slop” pull requests on Godot’s GitHub is becoming “increasingly draining and demoralizing” for its maintainers, to the point that over 4,600 pull requests are currently open on the engine’s GitHub page.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-co-founder-says-ai-slop-pull-requests-have-become-overwhelming"><i><span>Game Developer</span></i></a><span>, Verschelde’s comment on Bluesky was made in response to a post by Adriaan de Jongh, the developer and publisher of the 2017 indie puzzle hit </span><i><span>Hidden Folks</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adriaan.games/post/3mexoxyaui22x"><span>which stated</span></a><span> that Godot’s GitHub has been overrun with countless undisclosed AI-generated pull requests. “Changes often make no sense, descriptions are extremely verbose, users don’t understand their own changes…It’s a total shitshow.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/app.bsky.feed.post/3meyerixvhs2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifnwjboai3ml34oyyl7f2o3d7dtktxqmqrbt5hepzzs4xebfw2qea"> <p lang="en">Honestly, AI slop PRs are becoming increasingly draining and demoralizing for #Godot maintainers.</p> <p>If you want to help, more funding so we can pay more maintainers to deal with the slop (on top of everything we do already) is the only viable solution I can think of:</p> <p>fund.godotengine.org</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz?ref_src=embed">Rémi Verschelde (@akien.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/post/3meyerixvhs2p?ref_src=embed">2026-02-16T15:33:57.699Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyerixvhs2p"><span>In reply</span></a><span>, Verschelde noted that the problem has become such an issue that Godot’s GitHub maintainers are being forced to “second guess every [pull request] from new contributors, multiple times per day.” Although he stated that Godot prides itself on “being welcoming to new contributors,” Verschelde also doesn’t see a way out of the situation, beyond further donations to help pay more maintainers. “Maintainers spend a lot of time assisting new contributors to help them get PRs in a mergeable state. I don’t know how long we can keep it up.”</span></p>

 <p><span>A cursory glance at the </span><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"><span>closed pull requests</span></a><span> on Godot’s GitHub page proves that this isn’t an exaggeration, as dozens of pull requests have been denied or reported as spam by Godot’s maintainers within the past month alone, with comments left by maintainers pointing out AI-written code appearing on a daily basis. Godot has been used to ship a bunch of hit indie games over the last few years like <em>Brotato</em> and <em>Until Then</em> and is a valuable alternative to proprietary game engines like Unity, which have been <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-promises-deluge-of-new-games-prompted-into-existence-by-ai-as-its-stock-tanks-2000669483">rolling out their own genAI tools</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Verschelde stated that paying more maintainers would be the simplest option, he also stated that Godot may have to raise “the barrier to entry” for its contributors instead. When quizzed about the possibility of automating the process, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyf4t77ds2p"><span>he replied</span></a><span> that it “seems horribly ironic to have to run an AI on our CI to detect AI slop.” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3mextjgn2g22i"><span>Chet Faliszek</span></a><span>, writer for several Valve titles including </span><i><span>Left 4 Dead</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Portal 2</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Half-Life 2: Episode One</span></i><span>, believes that the onus to fix the system should be on GitHub instead. “Really is just exhausting to watch all this playout and github promoting this, not fighting it.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Disney and Lucasfilm released the latest trailer for <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, the first new <em>Star Wars</em> movie since <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> hit theaters back in 2019, and it includes everything I want from a movie set in this famous galaxy: eierd aliens, sci-fi action, deep cut references, and a voice cameo from famed director Martin Scorsese.</p> <p>The upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> flick stars Pedro Pascal as fan-favorite bounty hunter Din Djarin alongside his faithful little buddy Grogu, aka Baby Yoda. Set after the events of the original trilogy and the <em>Mandalorian</em> TV series, this new movie, which hits theaters on May 22, is set to tie up plot threads involving the remnants of the Empire trying to destroy the New Republic. It will also likely provide more answers about Grogu, a member of Yoda’s species. Here’s the trailer:</p>

   <p>And yes, that shopkeeper alien we see at the start who gets spooked when asked to provide information about a Hutt is voiced by the one and only Martin Scorsese, the director behind films like <em>Goodfellas</em> and <em>The Wolf of Wall Street.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/martin-scorsese-joinins-star-wars-universe/">Disney confirmed as much with <em>Polygon</em></a>. I can’t wait to see how angry online commenters who can’t stop yelling about the famous director’s MCU comments will react to him appearing in what looks to be a big, dumb, super-expensive <em>Star Wars</em> summer blockbuster.</p> <p>As for the rest of the trailer, I’m super into all the weird, goofy aliens and monsters that appear in it. The fact that a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mantellian_Savrip">Mantellian Savrip</a> shows up at the very end of the trailer as the big monster alien Mando and Grogu fight in the city made me giggle a little, I have to admit. This is an alien that first appeared as one of the holochess pieces in the very first <em>Star Wars</em> movie. Cool to see it here in the flesh. <a href="https://x.com/sw_holocron/status/2023761695026577621">Meanwhile, seeing Embo</a>, a bounty hunter from the<em> Clone Wars</em> animated series, pop up was fun, as was seeing Zeb from <em>Rebels</em> show up again after first appearing in live action back in the original <em>Mando</em> show on Disney+.</p>

 <p>Will all these silly cameos and references be enough in and of themselves to make<em> Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> a good movie? Nope. But at least this thing seems like a big movie, and I’m happy about that. <em>Star Wars</em> belongs in theaters, even when it’s bad, and I’m happy that after a few years away, we are finally getting a new cinematic <em>Star Wars</em> adventure. Let’s just hope it’s halfway decent when it arrives in May.</p>
