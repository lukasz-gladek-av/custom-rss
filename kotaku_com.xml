This removes them from your party for the remainder of the game, as they are blighted and controlled during the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-suicide-mission-choice-1851712586&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-suicide-mission-choice-1851712586">final battle in the city of Minrathous</a></span>. Whoever is kidnapped does defy the elven gods in the end, and as painful as it might be to pick between two of your faves, BioWare says this was all in service of the two’s respective stories, whether that be as an elven historian or a Tevinter reformist. As Epler explained to <em>IGN</em>:</p><figure id="" data-id="8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-recommend-id="image://8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-recommend-id="image://8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So for Neve and Bellara, the two groups that have been the most directly affected by the gods up to this point are obviously the elves – it’s their gods that are back – and Tevinter, Minrathous. You know, the Venatori have either fully seized power or have made some pretty big inroads in Minrathous, depending on which city you save. And the gods have come back and brought their dragons and proclaimed them as the gods of the Tevinter people. So both Bellara and Neve have a direct investment. Not that everyone else doesn’t, but they have the most direct investment in stopping the gods at this point. We wanted to give you that choice between these two characters who, again, have a very personal score to settle with the gods and are both mages whereas Emmrich obviously wants to stop the end of the world, but doesn’t have quite that same connection to the events that are going on. So those two made the most sense as to who would disable them.</p><p>The other thing is something that shows up in the visuals. Minrathous, Tevinter in general has always been kind of...there’s echoes of ancient elven magic in everything to Tevinter and Minrathous does because it’s meant as almost a cargo cult imitation of what the ancient elves were capable of. The ancient elves worked lyrium into their buildings, Tevinter uses gold and jewels because they don’t have the capacity to work lyrium. So it made the most sense for them.”</p><p>But that’s not the only sacrifice you’re forced to make in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s final push. The more (potentially) permanent choice is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-team-decision-davrin-harding-save-1851694983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-team-decision-davrin-harding-save-1851694983">between the dwarven scout Harding or the elven warrior Davrin</a></span>. At the beginning of the final mission, the player must pick one of the two to lead a distraction team as the party begins an assault on the elven god’s base. At the end of this first act, whoever you chose will sacrifice themselves to give the rest of the team an opening and kill one of the gods. According to Epler, Harding was always one of the characters the team planned on putting at risk, while Davrin became the second choice as his story as a Grey Warden formed during development.</p><figure id="" data-id="466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-recommend-id="image://466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-recommend-id="image://466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“We knew Harding had to be one of them, and then we had to ask ourselves: we’ve got a fan favorite returning character from <em>Inquisition</em>,” Epler said. “Who could possibly equal that in terms of making this difficult choice? It’s like, well, Assan. Assan and Davrin. Davrin obviously has a direct link to this at this point because of Weisshaupt. He’s got a very personal stake in it, and it made sense for the two of them to be the ones to be the choice to lead the distraction team, because again, we want to find those personal connections between the characters and the events that are going on. And, you know, the case of Harding, she has so much investment in this story because she’s been living it since <em>Inquisition</em>. And then Davrin. Davrin’s entire order just fell at the end of the previous act. He’s going to have a real strong investment in stopping the guys too here.”</p><p>The choices are impactful in and of themselves, of course, but as Epler and Busche noted, they can also be complicated further by other things happening in your party when the time comes to make your last stand.</p><p>“One thing that’s so interesting about that choice too, the Harding and Davrin choice is it actually presented some interesting complexity and some emotional investment we could tie into, which always makes for a more satisfying, I will say harder choice to make,” Busche said. “I’ll say in one of my playthroughs, Taash and Harding were in a relationship together and I happened to be romancing Davrin. Impossible. Impossible decision in that moment.”</p><p>While either Bellara or Neve can definitively survive if they’re chosen, the ultimate consequences of the Davrin or Harding choice seem a little ambiguous right now. While neither appears for the rest of the game, fans are latching onto codex entries and dialogue that implies they might still be alive as they look for hope that whoever is lost in the fight may return in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496">the next <em>Dragon Age</em></a></span>.

The standalone download for PS4 and PS5, which won’t be locked behind a PS Plus subscription, includes the following:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Three Race Events</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Three Time Trials</li><li>Three Music Rally stage</li><li>A full suite of License Tests</li><li> 18 unique cars</li><li>Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit</li><li>Support for PS VR2 (on PS5)﻿</li></ul></blockquote><p>“This experience holds a special place in my heart, as it pays tribute to the origins of the first <em>Gran Turismo</em>, where players of all generations discovered the joys of driving,” wrote franchise head Kazunori Yamauchi <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over on the PlayStation Blog</a></span>. “Whether it’s introducing kids to the joy of racing for the first time or reigniting a forgotten passion for driving, <em>My First Gran Turismo </em>was designed to be both approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level.”</p><p>The release comes alongside <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-update-ps1-boot-up-screen-ps2-30th-anniversary-ps3-1851711154&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-update-ps1-boot-up-screen-ps2-30th-anniversary-ps3-1851711154">PlayStation’s ongoing 30th anniversary event</a></span>. The original <em>Gran Turismo</em> was one of the games that help put PlayStation on the map back when it entered the console race against Sega and Nintendo in 1994. The first game went on to sell over 10 million copies. <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> is also a great game outside of its modern car economy grind and microtransactions. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gran-turismo-7-gt7-1-4-update-split-screen-new-cars-ps5-1850981590&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gran-turismo-7-gt7-1-4-update-split-screen-new-cars-ps5-1850981590">It even has four-player splitscreen</a></span>. The full game is normally $70 on PS5, but is currently marked down to $30 for the next couple of weeks. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
