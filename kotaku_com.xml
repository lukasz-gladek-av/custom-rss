            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Revealed weeks ago <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">in a datamine</a>, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> publisher Bandai Namco has officially confirmed a new endgame difficulty mode coming to the multiplayer roguelite next month. Deep of Night features new relics, randomized challenges, and an endless mode for those able to reach it.</p> <p>“‘Deep of Night’ is a high-difficulty challenge mode designed for seasoned players who have navigated through the Night many times,” the publisher writes <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared">in a new blog post</a>. The mode arrives on September 10 during the game’s usual update time and changes up the usual <em>Nightreign</em> run in a few ways. Players won’t be able to select the Nightlord they face or which Shifting Earth event is active, and enemies will all be stronger.</p> <p>The “high-difficulty mode” is separated by various depths. Depth 1 is the easiest. Depths 2 and 3 are harder. Depths 4 and 5, meanwhile, feature an “endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills” so you can just play until you die. A skill-based matchmaking system will rank players and group them accordingly. Plus, new Relics and additional Vessel slots will give players more buildcrafting opportunities.</p>

 <h2>What does <em>Nightreign</em> change in Deep of Night?</h2> <p>The most challenging bit of Deep of Night might not be the boss fights either. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">Players who have already been exploring the mode early</a>, thanks to mods, have found that the Night’s Tide storm, which slowly engulfs the map, does more damage. And that’s even before players suffer from a new debuff exclusive to gear discovered in the Deep of Night mode, which makes players more susceptible to the toxic rainfall. The rarest loot players pick up can come with other drawbacks as well to make surviving that much harder.</p> <p>For now, players have two more weeks to try and beat any Everdark Sovereigns that are still on their to-do list. For many, that’s probably Libra, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-libra-summons-everdark-tips-2000617780">a fight that’s equal parts clever and chaotic</a>. Fans have also already discovered clues for additional upcoming <em>Nightreign</em> content in the form of new subclasses. It’s unclear if those will be part of another free update or paid DLC in the future. There’s still so much of <em>Elden Ring</em> that could be repurposed into new content for the multiplayer spin-off.</p> <p>One thing that I’d love to see FromSoftware do, and which presumably wouldn’t cost any extra money, is just flip a switch to make all of <em>Nightreign</em>‘s random events spawn more frequently. Some players have spent 100 hours in the game and still only encountered them <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wandering-mausoleum-meteor-1851784652">once or twice</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mini-crossword-paywall-free-new-york-times-games-angry-fans-wordle-2000620987</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nyt%E2%80%99s-mini-crossword-no-longer-free-to-play-and-fans-are-pissed.1283214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <em>Mini Crossword</em> is one of the most popular games offered by <a href="https://kotaku.com/nyt-connections-hint-fie-crossword-1850941717"><em>The New York Times.</em></a> And for years, it was free. But that changed recently, and fans aren’t happy about it at all, calling the newspaper company “greedy” for putting the game behind a paywall.</p> <p>In 2014, <em>The New York Times</em> launched a new, mini version of its famous crossword. The Mini Crossword became a popular hit for the newspaper as it only took a few minutes to solve, was updated daily, and was a perfect, tiny experience that became a part of many people’s morning routines. It also helped that the Mini Crossword was completely free to play. That just changed, however, and as you might expect, a lot of word-loving gamers aren’t happy about it.</p> <p>On August 27, <a href="https://parade.com/living/new-york-times-mini-crossword-placed-behind-paywall">with seemingly no warning</a>, thousands of players opened up the Mini Crossword as usual on their browser or phone, only to discover that the fun little word game was no longer free and was now locked behind a paywall. As of Wednesday, only those who have an NYT Games or newspaper subscription can access the Mini Crossword.&nbsp; And while not as popular as the Mini Crossword, two other NYT Games are also now locked behind a subscription: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NYTgames/comments/1n29sn6/mini_tiles_and_letter_boxed_behind_a_paywall/"><em>Tiles</em> and <em>Letter Boxed</em>.</a> But don’t worry, <em>The New York Times</em> has conveniently made sure to offer a discount on subscriptions to its games service right as it made this controversial change.</p>

 <p>Over on Twitter,&nbsp; posts from the NYT Games account often receive no more than seven or eight replies. <a href="https://x.com/NYTGames/status/1957482240948006914">But a recent tweet mentioning the Mini Crossword</a> has received over 60 replies. Most of them are from very angry players who are upset about the sudden change. Here are just some of the replies under that tweet:</p> <ul> <li>“You greedy fucks give me my free Mini Crossword.”</li> <li>“Y’all are evil putting the Mini behind a paywall…”</li> <li>“Ask your bosses how it feels to ruin a small part of thousands of people’s daily routines.”</li> <li>“GIVE US THE MINI CROSSWORD BACK YOU GREEDY SCUMBAGS”</li> </ul> <p>In recent years, <em>The New York Times</em> has become more of a video game company than a newspaper. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">Data shows that more people are paying the newspaper to play its games</a> than to read its news or consume any of its other content. While that has likely helped keep the paper afloat at a time when online and traditional media are struggling, it also means they are now beholden to gamers. So <em>The New York Times</em> should probably get used to having its mentions filled with angry people yelling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Welcome back, gamers. I can call you that, right? Cool. Anyway, this is Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have more layoffs, Unreal Engine 5 optimization information, details on how <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> runs on Xbox, and someone claiming Capcom has tried to remake <em>Dino Crisis</em> a few times, but keeps failing. Oh, and congrats, internet, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce835lry896o">you bullied Cracker Barrel hard enough</a> that it’s not changing its logo after all.</p> <h2>Capcom leaker claims the publisher has been trying and failing to remake <em>Dino Crisis</em></h2> <p>Fans have been begging Capcom for a new <em>Dino Crisis</em> for many, <em>many</em> years, and it just hasn’t happened. Even when Capcom publishes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/swikajakiin.bsky.social/post/3lxhsf5m5ss2x">a game with dinosaurs</a>, it’s not actually the one fans really want. But it sounds like the lack of <em>Dino Crisis</em> isn’t because Capcom has given up on the series. According to reliable Capcom leaker Dusk Golem, Capcom has actually tried twice before to revive the dinosaur-themed horror franchise.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1960763450801709199">The leaker claims</a> that Capcom Vancouver, the studio that developed all of the<em> Dead Rising</em> sequels, was working on a remake of <em>Dino Crisis</em> before the studio was closed. Another version was apparently being worked on by an unnamed studio at a later date, but was canned because it “wasn’t turning out so good.” So Capcom is reportedly trying, but struggling, to make more <em>Dino Crisis. </em>Hopefully, in the same way Capcom got <em>Resident Evil</em> back on track with RE7, the publisher can get <em>Dino Crisis</em> going again.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>‘s Xbox port is very different than the PS5 version</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Black Myth: Wukong Xbox Series X|S - DF Review - A Bizarre Port vs PlayStation 5" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-10490qd8s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Here’s something odd: <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X and Series S looks quite different from the PS5 version. According to a new analysis video from Digital Foundry, <em>Wukong</em> on Xbox can look extremely different due to the fact that the game doesn’t use frame-gen tech like the PS5 does in some modes.</p> <p>This can create a cleaner image. But it also lacks some of the fancier lighting techniques seen in the PS5 port, which can result in a drastically different image as well. The Xbox version also has other quirks that, in some modes, lead to a softer image. Yet the much weaker Series S appears to have rock-solid performance numbers. It’s an odd situation in 2025. These days, most games run and look about the same across the PS5 and Xbox. Not so with <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>

 <h2>Crystal Dynamics announces another round of layoffs</h2> <p>On August 27, Crystal Dynamics, the studio currently working on the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game for Amazon, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">announced another round of layoffs.</a> The news came via a post on the company’s LinkedIn page, which didn’t specify how many people lost their jobs during this round of cuts. The studio says that “the future of <em>Tomb Raider</em>” is “unaffected by this decision.” This is the second round of layoffs to happen at Crystal Dynamics this year, coming after some employees were previously let go in March.</p> <p>“Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market,” the studio posted.</p>

 <h2><strong>Epic boss says devs need more Unreal Engine 5 education to avoid optimization issues</strong></h2> <p>There has been a lot of criticism aimed at video game development engine Unreal 5 over the last year or so, as some believe it isn’t optimized properly. Epic boss Tim Sweeney pushed back on these claims during an interview that happened <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/tim-sweeney-on-unreal-engine-5-optimization-issues-the-main-cause-is-order-of-development/">at the recent Unreal Fest in South Korea</a>. The boss blamed “order of development” for games running poorly on consoles and PC.</p> <p>“Many studios build for top-tier hardware first and leave optimization and low-spec testing for the end,” said Sweeney. “Ideally, optimization should begin early—before full content build-out. We’re doing two things: strengthening engine support with more automated optimization across devices, and expanding developer education so ‘optimize early’ becomes standard practice. If needed, our engineers can step in.”</p>

 <h2><strong>Laid-off <em>Black Panther</em> game devs join Wizards of the Coast</strong></h2> <p>Wizards of the Coast president John Hight revealed, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/part-of-the-team-behind-eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-joins-wizards-of-the-coast">in an interview with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, that a team of developers who were previously working on EA’s <em>Black Panther</em> game, which was canned earlier this year, have joined the company to work on a new project. The team of former Cliffhanger devs is led by creative director Michael de Plater, a veteran dev whose resume includes<em> Shadow of Mordor</em> and <em>Rome: Total War.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“We were actually able to bring [de Plater] and 14 key people that he’s worked with there – and many of them at Monolith – to incubate a new game for us,” Hight told the outlet. “He’ll be starting concept development on something very cool and new – and that part I can’t tell you yet.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-creator-still-not-sure-when-his-next-game-is-coming-out-2000620743"><em>Bioshock’s</em> creator still doesn’t have a release date for <em>Judas</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-out-now-on-iphone-for-70-or-3-a-level-2000620693"><em>Hitman</em> is out now on phones, but it will cost you $70</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-patch-cassidy-wrecking-ball-bug-2000620763"><em>Overwatch 2′</em>s latest update broke its famous cowboy character</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>If you have an hour or so to kill, watch this shockingly deep dive into M&amp;M lore.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Many Unique M&amp;M's Characters Exist?" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yzYtUue5Y4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>
