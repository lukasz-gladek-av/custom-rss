              <p>If you read <em>Kotaku</em> even semi-regularly, you already know that Xbox has been in a weird spot for some time now. And with today’s news that both <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084">Xbox boss Phil Spencer and President Sarah Bond are leaving</a> and the new head of the brand will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">a former Meta exec who previously lead Microsoft’s AI division</a>, I think it’s time to call it. Xbox is dead. Time of death: February 20, 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911">This death is far from sudden or surprising</a>. If anything, we’ve all seen it coming for a while now. Reading the news about Xbox often felt like checking in on someone battling a terminal disease and whose fight wasn’t going well. Looking at the endless layoffs, impossible demands from leadership, canceled projects, flops, games getting ported to PlayStation, and loads of mismanagement, it seemed clear that in recent years, Xbox wasn’t doing well.</p>

 <h2>The beginning of the end</h2> <p>If I had to pick the moment when things truly got bad, it would be when <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-xbox-merger-timeline-call-of-duty-1850108022">Xbox bought Activision Blizzard</a>. After spending $70 billion and enduring years of legal challenges to its efforts to buy the <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Warcraft</em> publisher, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-finally-completes-activision-blizzard-deal-1850924662">Xbox finally pulled it off in 2023.</a> But suddenly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">Xbox found itself under much more pressure to deliver</a>. Xbox was no longer just a console created by Microsoft as a small side hustle; instead it had morphed into a massive publisher with a huge suite of studios, franchises, and employees to manage. Over the next two years, everything started to change at Xbox.</p> <p>The company began de-emphasizing the idea that you even needed to own an Xbox to play Xbox games. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This is an Xbox, remember?</a> Want to play <em>Halo</em> or <em>Gears of War</em> but don’t own an Xbox? Don’t worry, the games are launching on PC. Don’t want to play on PC? It’s fine, you can stream them via your phone or TV. You don’t even have to buy the games, just pay for this monthly subscription. When a console brand stops trying to sell consoles, you can probably stick a fork in it.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">We here at <em>Kotaku</em> called the end of the console war around this time.</a> But we didn’t call the death of the Xbox just then. That’s because, despite all the signs, there was always that chance that Phil Spencer would right the ship again, as he had done before, and keep Xbox alive.</p>

 <h2>AI and porting <em>Halo</em></h2> <p>And then Microsoft, like all big tech giants these days, began investing even more billions of dollars into AI. And here was Xbox, a pricey side project that never made the company much money, but was costing the company a ton on massive deals to buy Bethesda and Activision. That was cash that could be spent on datacenters and Copilot, damn it!</p> <p>This is around the time that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">Microsoft began trying to shove AI into Xbox</a> in a very awkward fashion, one that felt removed from Spencer’s stewardship of the brand. In 2025, after already porting some of its smaller games, like <em>Sea of Thieves </em>and <em>Grounded</em>, to PlayStation and Switch, Xbox did the unthinkable. <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">It announced plans to bring <em>Halo</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, yet one more big sign that it was all over. Spencer would never promote this news on social media.</p>

 <p>That brings us to today. Xbox will no longer be run by a “gamer.” Instead, Asha Sharma, an AI executive who previously worked at Meta and InstaCart and who has no video game industry experience at all, has been put in charge of the brand despite another person, Sarah Bond, being seemingly the perfect successor to Spencer. Sharma’s hiring has generated a lot of speculation, with some theorizing that she’s a temp pick until Microsoft completely devours Xbox and turns it into nothing more than an icon on your desktop that you never click. Others have suggested she’s been put in place to help bring AI to Xbox in a big way, which seems very likely, too.</p> <p>Regardless of why she’s been made the new Xbox boss, it is now very clear: Xbox is dead. The corpse will linger around for a bit longer, but the odds of a new Xbox console hitting shelves are low. I suspect all future hardware will be rebranded PCs, like the ROG Ally X handheld from last year. A slow death for a console that once was huge, but was sunk by tech executives who had no idea what they were doing.</p>

              <p><span>After over 20 years at Xbox, Phil Spencer, the face of the brand for more than a decade, has announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059"><span>he’s retiring from the company</span></a><span>. Sarah Bond, the president at Xbox, is also out and Asha Sharma, the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, is taking over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</span></p> <p><span>It sounds bleak for Microsoft’s long-struggling gaming brand, though Sharma said in her initial email to employees that her goal was not to flood the Xbox ecosystem with “soulless AI slop.” Is that the truth or just something you say to placate your workers? Only time will tell, but Microsoft has been notoriously pushing for AI integration in its workflow, so do with that information what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now that Spencer is out, however, the internet is looking back on his tenure at the company, speculating about whether or not he and Bond were forced out of their leadership positions, and wondering what all this means for the future of Xbox. The forecast is not great.</span></p>     <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5rqrieckrxohygpkhnsar5nf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfcycdzan22d" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiggsxageu3ctmjfpdyumw76h7klcvwfw7lyloqtnf2zlxyykeetbi"> <p lang="en">The fact that the only ms/Xbox letter mentioning Sarah Bond is Phil’s, along with the fact that she didn’t release a statement, suggests that this was all actually messy as hell, and the story is going to get out faster than leadership could plan for.
