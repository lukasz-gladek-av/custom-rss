(<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-prime-character-special-stats-lucy-1851411135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-prime-character-special-stats-lucy-1851411135">The mobile game got a tiny tie-in update.</a></span>) This time around, it sounds like Bethesda has some actual crossover plans with the show and at least one game. </p><p> “We’re always focused on the game,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fallout 76</em> creative director Jon Rush told <em>Variety</em>.</a></span> “I think a distinct trait of the ‘<em>Fallout 76’</em> game is that we’re the furthest back in time. And it’s kind of funny, because the [<em>Fallout </em>show] is the furthest into the future. So there’s a lot of room where we don’t necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories, that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple.”</p><p>Rush explained that the show is “great” at telling a <em>Fallout </em>story as it is made by “big fans” of the franchise. As such, the games and shows go “together really well.” And that brings people from the Amazon series to the games. And some of these people will likely be expecting some content from the series, which Rush teased might be happening. </p><p>“Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it’s stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there,” said Rush. “I’m not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another.” </p><p>So I doubt Lucy will appear in <em>Fallout 76</em>, the timeline doesn’t support it. And fans are already mad about the <em>Fallout</em> timeline as it is. But it does sound like everyone involved with the show and games understands this time around how huge the series is and that doing some crossover content would be smart. There have been rumors for a while now about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>or <em>New Vegas</em> remaster. And season two of <em>Fallout </em>will feature New Vegas. Hmmm... something to think about. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-fallout-76-crossover-new-vegas-update-1851786026]]></content:encoded>

Their answer was a perfect window into how game development often seems to work at Nintendo, with each new decision occurring as a response to previous ones rather than as a top-down structure superimposed upon the project from the start. While Pauline was suggested as a possible sidekick for the game early on, she wasn’t there from the beginning (<em>Bananza </em>started development as a Switch game, the pair confirmed). </p><p>“I think the moment we actually realized we would go in that direction came about as a result of an artist who created some concept art of the zebra transformation,” Motokura said. “We saw that image and thought it was really fun, so we immediately prototyped it to try it out in the game. And when our composer saw that, they decided to create specific music just for that transformation.”</p><p>He continued, “And the music for it was so good, we thought we could expand on this and turn it into a song and maybe Pauline would be a good choice to sing that song. And so we then asked the composer to create songs for each of the transformations and I think that’s what really cemented Pauline’s place.”</p><p>From there, a lot of other parts of the game started falling into place. <em>Donkey Kong</em> can’t speak but Pauline can, providing a narrative guide to Ingot Isle where the game takes place. Pauline’s music also became a clever way to mask game mechanics like pointing out which direction the player is supposed to go in. Co-op, meanwhile, lets a second player control her voice to stun enemies as DK is running along. Pauline is in the game because her character fits with cool gameplay ideas, not because Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745?_gl=1*wduhkz*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIxNjAyNTckbzQxJGcwJHQxNzUyMTYwMjYwJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745?_gl=1*wduhkz*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIxNjAyNTckbzQxJGcwJHQxNzUyMTYwMjYwJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..">cares about the <em>Donkey Kong</em> timeline</a></span>. </p><p>That doesn’t mean there’s no room for fun speculation about characters and crossovers, like whether <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is secretly a prequel to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Motokura was asked point blank how old <em>Donkey Kong</em> is, but he demurred. “I think that’s another one that maybe is good fodder for player theories,” he said. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019]]></content:encoded>
