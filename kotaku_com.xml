The idea of getting a new game in the franchise, even after the woefully irrelevant <em>Thief </em>(2014), is thrilling. But god, no, not as some VR gimmick. But no, I’m not going to wallow! Instead, I’m going to take this opportunity to celebrate what we already have, and what we can still enjoy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,195922,196345" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Look, I’ll be honest.

Covering the embarrassing awfulness of Embracer Group’s handling of every property it mindlessly snaffled up, and indeed the mediocrity of 2014's peculiarly missing-the-point Eidos-Montreal-made entry, Fraser articulates why this is the opposite of what anyone should want to do with the franchise. So kudos there, and go give it a read. Although I will repeat the vital point here: sure, <em>Half-Life Alyx </em>and <em>Superhot VR</em> are great, and maybe by some miracle <em>Thief VR</em> will be the third game worth owning the tech for, but if you don’t own a PSVR2 hat, then this is a game that’s going to cost you $400+ minimum!</p><p>(And can I make clear, this is no qualitative judgement on <em>Thief VR</em> which I obviously haven’t played, nor is it one on the no doubt enormously talented, incredibly hard-working people who are making this game. I wish them the very best. I also wish they’d been given the chance to make a full <em>Thief</em> game that everyone could play.)</p><p>But we’re here to be optimistic! Yes, it’s horrendous that the rights to one of gaming’s greatest franchises—the games that began the stealth genre, and indeed inspired everything from <em>Deus Ex</em> to <em>Hitman </em>to <em>Dishonored</em>—are in the hands of a management so inept that the only ambition they have for it is to waste it on a VR game that only a handful of people will play. But that doesn’t make the original games disappear. They’re still with us. And they’re still utterly amazing.</p><p><em>Thief </em>is about a guy named Garrett. Growing up as a homeless orphan, Garrett is now a master thief, living in The City, set in a fantasy version of the Middle Ages; part steampunk, part wizardry. There are three factions: The Keepers, the Pagans and the Hammerites, with Garrett assigned to none, and willing to steal from all. The games see Garrett reluctantly get involved in the complex storylines betwixt the trio of groups vying for power, doing his best to have nothing to do with any of them, but profiting from the mayhem.</p><figure id="" data-id="1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-recommend-id="image://1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-recommend-id="image://1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>1998's <em>Thief: The Dark Project</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is an astonishing creation</a></span>. You might think, being 27 years old, that it has long since stopped being playable, but I’m delighted to tell you that you’re wrong. Thanks to the wonderful work of modders, the definitive version of the original game—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/211600/Thief_Gold/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211600/Thief_Gold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Thief Gold</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>(which, by the way, is 97c on Steam at the time of writing)—plays in glorious widescreen and works on modern machines with projects like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewDark</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/forum/thief_series/legacy_olddark_patches_for_thief_1_2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/forum/thief_series/legacy_olddark_patches_for_thief_1_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OldDark</a></span>. As with any classic game, it’s always worth checking the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCGamingWiki page</a></span> for all the best patches and improvements before starting to play.</p><p>That done, believe me, the incredibly dated graphics matter for about 13 seconds. Heck, <em>Thief</em>’s graphics were criticized for being dated when it was released in ‘98, and it didn’t matter then any more than it does now. Because <em>Thief</em> is a game about atmosphere, and by “atmosphere” I mean “darkness,” and it has that by the metric ton. Seriously, the textures on the walls in the Hammerite temples matter very little when the first thing you do on entering any room or corridor is snuff out all the torches. Light is your enemy, shadows your only safety, and you’ll immediately embrace the darkness.</p><p>It’s incredible how quickly this draws you in, how soon you’re entirely in the role, scooping up every piece of loot as you nip from corner to corner, bonking an enemy on the back of the head to slip through to a passageway. It’s totally absorbing, and absolutely compelling.</p><p>But what I think makes <em>Thief</em> such a stand-out game almost 30 years later is a philosophy that far too few games have had the courage to try: this is a game where the higher you make the difficulty, the fewer people you’re allowed to kill. Garrett absolutely <em>can </em>murder in these games, and should you choose to, you can go through a level killing each and every guard you encounter. But turn up the difficulty, and rather than the enemies getting stronger or more difficult to kill, you’re not allowed to hurt them at all! That’s revolutionary! It’s still revolutionary 27 years on. Instead of demanding better twitch reflexes or greater amounts of durability, the harder the game, the better you had to be at being a thief.</p><p><em>Thief II: The Metal Age</em> is very similar game, but in the best possible way. It’s more! It’s more of one of the best games ever! Where the first <em>Thief</em> rather over-relied on the presence of zombies (it was as if developers Looking Glass didn’t quite dare not to include a traditional gaming enemy), here there are fewer monsters and instead more humans to avoid, set in larger, more sprawling levels with astonishing variety in how you can approach a challenge. It was, I would argue, the emergence of the immersive sim.</p><p><em>Thief II</em> came out in 2000, when I was at university, and one of my most profound memories of the game took place outside of it. I had been playing it a great deal, just delighted to be back in The City, loving every second. On this particular evening, I was going to see a friend, and so I walked into town. As I went down the street, I found myself walking only in shadows, looking ahead to see where streetlights were shining, and calculating a path that would avoid them as best as possible. It was a concerningly long time before I realized what I was doing. (Another real-world symptom was starting to view the world by the potential of its rooftops, looking out windows to plan paths where I could get between buildings, before remembering that I probably ought not.)</p><figure id="" data-id="a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-recommend-id="image://a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-recommend-id="image://a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>2004's <em>Thief: The Dark Shadows</em> was, on its release, embroiled in some woefully unnecessary complaining. At this point, with the voice of the internet becoming an unavoidable thing, people were determined to find everything they could to be pre-emptively cross about. Looking Glass Studios, the legendary development studio that gave us <em>Ultima Underworld</em>, <em>System Shock</em> and <em>Thief</em>, had tragically come to an end in 2000. Ion Storm Austin may have given us the extraordinary <em>Deus Ex</em> in 2000, but they’d also given us follow-up <em>Deus Ex: Invisible War</em> just a year before <em>Thief III</em>, a game that had unquestionably been restricted in scope by 2003's need to co-develop for the fledgling Xbox. (It remains massively underrated, but it also undeniably didn’t match its predecessor due to the wild constraints and tiny levels imposed by the weakness of the Xbox as a machine.) So people were ready to absolutely unload on <em>Deadly Shadows</em>.</p><p>Yes, the levels were smaller than in <em>Thief II</em>. Yes—and dear god, it’s incredible to remember just how much stupid asinine fuss was made about this some two decades on—the loot did glint. But <em>oh my goodness</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thief-deadly-shadows-will-still-have-you-fearing-the-light-some-16-years-on&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thief-deadly-shadows-will-still-have-you-fearing-the-light-some-16-years-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is an extraordinarily good game</a></span>. <em>Deadly Shadows</em> may not have had the acres-wide playing areas, but instead it sported some of the finest level design in all of gaming, boosted by stunning storytelling, and one of the most memorable levels ever created in any game ever, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cradle</a></span>. It was, and is, one of the most all-consuming games you’ll ever play, where you’ll lose yourself into the character you’re playing like nothing else, fearing all forms of light for weeks after you play.</p><p>So yes, it sucks beyond all belief that Embracer has the rights to this greatest of series. The company could be offering established indie teams the opportunity to craft a new <em>Thief</em> game in the spirit of the original three, or even trying to get the band back together and offering Looking Glass/Ion Storm alumni the chance. It could be doing so much, and instead its decision is to make a VR game that’s already buried under the logo of the unloved 2014 game that had so little to do with the games before it, for a format that most people are long over.</p><p>But it cannot take away what we already have, and that is something to be treasured. And right this moment, by sheer lovely coincidence, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1459/Thief_Collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1459/Thief_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can get all three games for less than a dollar each!</a></span> That’s <em>incredible</em>! (You can even get the daft, goth-ridden, watched-<em>The-Crow</em>-too-much-as-a-kid 2014 <em>Thief </em>for $3.)</p><p>And you should. You’ll be so glad you did.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The pictures showed the receipt stapled to the front of the box, the puncture holes it left in both the cardboard and the plastic wrap, and the ensuing dents in the Switch 2's screen. </p><p>The GameStop in question was reportedly located in Staten Island, New York. Like at most of the company’s stores, the midnight launch brought out tons of Nintendo fans excited to be some of the first in the world to go hands-on with the new hardware. It’s unclear if the stapling was being done by everyone at the store or just one person, and how many people were ultimately affected. Other users who were at the event shared similar horror stories, though. </p><p>“GameStop stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box, FML,” Oadhan Lynch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a></span>. “Genuinely insane now I’m gonna have to wait 3 months for the restock. And yes we were there for the midnight release so I bet everyone in this line is gonna have this same issue.” Another customer from the same location who faced a similar situation commiserated with them in the comments. </p><p>While stapling anything to a video game console box is unnecessary and lowkey unhinged, anyone working a console midnight launch at GameStop is probably part-time and making barely $15 an hour, especially as store closures and high turnover have continued to hollow out more seasoned staff. For many employees across the company at thousands of locations, this was probably the first console launch they’d ever worked through. It was certainly the biggest. </p><p>Nintendo, on the other hand, has experience not just with launching new consoles but boxing and shipping hundreds of millions of them all around the world. So it should be noted that it’s equally wild that the company known for its meticulous attention to detail would box the Switch 2 with the screen facing up and only covered by 1.5cm of light cardboard. </p><p>I know because I measured. I was surprised by just how exposed the Switch 2 seemed after I unboxed mine last night. The packaging is so thin that even the box falling from a certain height onto the wrong object might be equally damaging. Others were kind of horrified, too. “You’re going to hear about a few damaged screens in the coming days,” one new Switch 2 owner <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AncientArgonaut/status/1930552016545390644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AncientArgonaut/status/1930552016545390644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted on X</a></span>. “They are at risk just being stacked in shipping.”</p><p>Maybe not. Maybe Nintendo actually did testing on the box layout and found that, for structural reasons not obvious to the naked eye, the Switch 2 remains safe from just about anything that might normally happen to it during transit, except, clearly, someone taking a stapler to it. The consoles can be replaced but the wait will be a pain for those who thought they’d finally gotten their hands on a console that would last them for another eight years. “Totally killed the excitement of the night,” wrote Oadhan Lynch.</p><p> It’s worth noting that at least some Switch 2 consoles ordered directly from Nintendo came packaged in a second, much sturdier outer box, as contributing editor John Walker discovered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ht7hc64fzee5fhoo456t3t2v/post/3lqu4kjeq7s2w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ht7hc64fzee5fhoo456t3t2v/post/3lqu4kjeq7s2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when his arrived earlier today</a></span>.

There are four of them: magic, fire, lightning, and holy. When Recluse hits an enemy with a Magic attack, a Magic elemental residue will appear around the enemy. You can tell which kind of residue an enemy has by the color of your targeting reticle. Blue is magic, red is fire, yellow is lightning and gold is holy.</p><figure id="" data-id="53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-recommend-id="image://53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-recommend-id="image://53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Residues can also be collected from teammates as well</strong>. If they get hit with a fire attack, they’ll accumulate fire residues. Elemental Defense works in tandem with Recluse’s Character Skill called Magic Cocktail, as it augments her offensive power and helps restore FP.</p><h2 id="h131832"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Magic Cocktail</h2><p>Recluse’s character skill is Magic Cocktail. Here, she absorbs the residues to create a unique spell that doesn’t cost FP to unleash on enemies or give support to allies. The cocktail’s composition is entirely dependent on the combination of three residues absorbed. You can tell which residues you have by the three smaller icons on top of the character Skill icon.</p><p>For example, two fire residues and a holy one creates a torch that raises max HP and reduces status ailment buildup in allies. Having three separate elemental residues results in the most powerful cocktails. For example, a Magic/Fire/Lightning cocktail creates a giant gravity orb that pulls in enemies before exploding, dealing massive damage.</p><figure id="" data-id="33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-recommend-id="image://33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1073" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-recommend-id="image://33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1073" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You don’t necessarily always have control of which elemental residues appear. However, it can be manipulated through coordination with your teammates. If your entire squad is decked out with fire elemental weapons, then you’ll be able to cast fire elemental cocktails frequently. But if one of your allies has a holy weapon, then you’ll sometimes absorb holy residues from enemies, leading to some variations on what cocktails you’ll create.</p><p>This ability is also the key way of restoring FP in the middle of a fight. Every time Recluse absorbs residues, she’ll replenish her FP. This keeps her from becoming a sitting duck and lets her keep the offensive pressure on. You will still need to manage your FP carefully, however, as running out completely means you’re going to have to use a consumable item or wait for an ally to get hit so that you can absorb their residue.</p><h2 id="h131833"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Soulblood Song</h2><p>Recluse’s Ultimate Art is Soulblood Song, which causes her to create a red sigil with blood runes on the ground. While in the sigil, you and your allies will restore HP and FP by attacking any enemies within its range. This will help increase your squad’s survivability.</p><figure id="" data-id="e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-recommend-id="image://e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->cc</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-recommend-id="image://e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The most opportune time to use Soulblood Song against a boss is when its stance is about to break and it doubles over, leaving it vulnerable to critical hits. This allows Recluse to maximize the amount of time Soulbood Song is out on the field while the boss is briefly incapacitated. This attack can also be augmented with other effects through passive buffs dropped by bosses, such as increasing Recluse’s max HP.</p><h2 id="h131834"><a id="4"></a>A look at Recluse’s attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: D</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: C</li></ul><p>As expected, Recluse’s FP and intelligence are her highest stats, which makes sense since she’s a magic-based character. Her best weapons include staves which scale perfectly with her high intelligence.</p><p>Since her HP and stamina stats are low in comparison, she heavily relies on her teammates to distract enemies while she builds up elemental residues and casts spells. Additionally, Recluse should take full advantage of consumable and throwable items like Starlight Shards and elemental pots. The former lets her replenish FP in a pinch while the latter like Fire Pots and Lightning Pots let her create residues to mix Magic Cocktails and restore FP.</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Seth curb stomped his former Shield brother, pinned him, and ran away with the title—the first of his career—in jaw-dropping fashion. The “heist” denied Reigns the same accomplishment, much to the delight of the WWE Universe.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25ab8b179ea47edb4b383caf6cfcb876" data-recommend-id="image://25ab8b179ea47edb4b383caf6cfcb876" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Stratton winning the WWE Women's Title" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tiffany Stratton winning the WWE Women's Title" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="25ab8b179ea47edb4b383caf6cfcb876" data-recommend-id="image://25ab8b179ea47edb4b383caf6cfcb876" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Stratton winning the WWE Women's Title" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s not a coincidence that we’re fast-forwarding 10 years into the future to reach our next moment on the list. Before it was Tiffy’s time to cash in her Money In The Bank briefcase, 37 other superstars had done the same. There are only so many new ways to shock the WWE Universe, but Tiffany Stratton did just that.</p><p>On the January 3 episode of Smackdown, Tiffy’s friend Nia Jax defended her WWE Women’s Championship in a match against Naomi. As the contest was coming to a head, Stratton’s music hit, and she ran down to the ring holding her briefcase in one hand and the ref’s hand in another.</p><p>Despite the telltale signs of a cash-in, Tiffy instead hit Naomi in the head with her briefcase, aiding Jax to victory as she’d done several times previously.</p><p>We were swerved. And then, we were swerved again. As Bianca Belair went to check on Naomi, Jax attacked Belair and set her up for The Annihilator. Before she could execute it, Stratton whacked Jax with the briefcase, Belair followed up with a massive Kiss of Death and Tiffy took advantage, landing the Prettiest Moonsault Ever on Jax for the 1-2-3.</p><p>Betraying a friend—who was also the champion—with a cash-in is something we’d never seen. The soft face turn and exuberant crowd reaction helped solidify the moment in MITB lore.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
