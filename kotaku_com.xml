The new version of <em>Fortnite </em>will support mouse controls, a higher framerate, and more on the new Nintendo hardware.

This is a big increase over the laggy 30 FPS on the older Switch. Epic also confirmed that <em>Fortnite</em> on Switch 2 will boast a higher resolution in both docked and undocked play, as well as a significantly improved draw distance, allowing players to see more detail from further away. And clothing will now have physics, something seen in the other versions of <em>Fortnite </em>on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p><figure id="" data-id="042c57312168ce7f0b3d934a535bf03f" data-recommend-id="image://042c57312168ce7f0b3d934a535bf03f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fortnite running on a Switch 2.

Epic says if you do a console transfer from Switch to Switch 2, you’ll need to delete the old port of <em>Fortnite</em>, download the new version, and log in. Then all your skins and goodies should be waiting for you. </p><p>Epic also says that <em>Fortnite </em>will support mouse controls on Switch 2 via the console’s advanced Joy-Cons. All modes in <em>Fortnite</em>, including Battle Royale, will support mouse controls on Switch 2. The new port works with the Switch 2's capture button and GameChat system, letting you stream your game while chatting with friends.</p><p>And for you super nerds out there, like myself, Epic shared a few more techy details about the new port: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>For the hardcore tech folks: full “desktop” renderer, high-detail geometry, distance field ambient occlusion in docked mode, shadow casting point lights, high-quality effects.</p></blockquote><p>All in all, it seems like the Switch 2 port of <em>Fortnite </em>will be a comparable experience to playing on PS4 Pro or Xbox Series S, though it won’t be as graphically advanced as the PS5, PS5 Pro, PC, or Xbox Series X ports of the popular game. Still, it’s nice that Nintendo players will have a better way to play <em>Fortnite </em>in the near future, assuming they can get their hands on a Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan) return to their hometown in the Mississippi Delta with dreams of building a juke joint for all the sweaty late-night dancing, and revenue, that comes with it. Before a vampiric threat descends upon the tale, the early parts of the film show the brothers using their charm, guile, and gun-toting intimidation tactics to assemble a team to help build and run  the juke joint for one night. While the original film gives glimpses into its creation as Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) extols the magic of the Blues, the deleted scene presents a streamlined, uninterrupted look at the juke joint’s construction.</p><p>Watching the joy on everyone’s faces as they toil away to build a utopia of their own in the middle of the racist South is bittersweet since that very juke joint is where most of them  lose their lives at the hands (and teeth) of the undead later that night. Just spending a little more time with these characters frying catfish, marveling at the possibilities of the gigantic structure, and helping one another makes you want to stay in that world a bit longer. It also makes you want a sequel that will likely never happen.</p><p>When a film is as big a cultural and box office success as <em>Sinners</em>, you expect fans and film studios to clamor for more.

This one is actually a bit more active than most passive abilities and is different from a normal guard. By holding the guard button, tilting the left stick on the controller, and tapping the dodge button Guardian will plant his feet into the ground for a sturdier block, in exchange for your capabilities to dodge and run.</p><p>While his stamina will slowly drain in this stance, any attacks blocked while in Steel Guard will deplete much less stamina than usual. Attacks that would usually break his guard can now be more easily reflected back with Guard Counters. Steel Guard is particularly helpful against aggressive bosses as it makes them vulnerable to counter attacks from you and your teammates.</p><h2 id="h2823"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Whirlwind</h2><p>Guardian’s Character Skill is Whirlwind, where he whips up a giant storm to sweep enemies off their feet. This skill is amazing at crowd control, as smaller enemies within range will be thrust into the air, helpless as your teammates finish them off. Additionally, any physical projectiles like arrows will be deflected.</p><figure id="" data-id="352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-recommend-id="image://352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-recommend-id="image://352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can charge Whirlwind to make its blast radius bigger, which is well worth it since it’s a very safe move.</p><p>Unfortunately, it does little against large enemies like bosses, although it can sometimes stagger them. Large enemies that move around a lot or fly will be able to avoid Whirlwind pretty easily.</p><h2 id="h2824"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Wings of Salvation</h2><p>Guardian’s Ultimate Art is Wings of Salvation, where it flies up into the air before diving down to strike the ground.

Smaller enemies will be eviscerated and you can influence the direction of the attack before Guardian dives down. While Guardian charges this attack, he will remain mobile for a few seconds afterwards and generate an aura that grants invulnerability. Wings of Salvation is also one of the best revival tools in the game.
