              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663#:~:text=The%20Simpsons%20are%20seemingly%20on%20their%20way%20to%20Fornite%C2%A0">After rumors and leaks</a>, <em>Fortnite’s</em> new <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season went live over the weekend, and I had a giant smile on my face as I ran around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296">new Springfield map</a>, no matter how many times I got sniped by random Gokus and Peelys.</p> <p>Over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">I’ve made it very clear that I’m not a fan of the growing trend of crossovers in video games</a>. Sticking Master Chief in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> or jamming Godzilla into <em>Call of Duty</em> has always been weird and nasty to me. It feels like all of pop culture is merging into a giant grey blob. It makes me sad. Yet, I always give <em>Fortnite</em> a pass because, for many years now, it has been an IP playground. <em>Fortnite</em> is just a giant mess of stuff, a new internet for the next generation. So what if they add Luke Skywalker or Ariana Grande to it? But even if I wasn’t willing to give <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299"><em>Fortnite</em></a> a pass, I’d still be playing this new <em>Simpsons</em> season because it’s so dang good.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-simpsons-drop-into-springfield-in-br-and-delulu?lang=en-US">Launched on November 1</a>, the<em> Fortnite x Simpsons</em> mini-season turns the entire battle royale into a <em>Simpsons</em> video game, something we haven’t gotten in over a decade. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796">it’s been nearly 20 years since the last console-based <em>Simpsons</em> game</a> and over two decades since 2005’s beloved <em>Simpsons Hit and Run</em>. That alone makes this new <em>Fortnite</em> season super special. The first time I landed at Evergreen Terrace in <em>Fortnite</em> and explored the Simpsons’ house, I had the biggest grin on my face and was excited to just poke at each room and detail. I was quickly killed by someone actually playing the game, but I didn’t care. I was finally playing a new, modern 3D <em>Simpsons</em> game in 2025, even if it was just a <em>Fortnite</em> event.</p>

  <p>Exploring beyond the Simpsons’ home, I found so many locations and details from the show. Want to visit Moe’s Bar? It’s here, and you can even hear a prank call from Bart. The first time I visited the Nuclear Power Plant, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Trivia">I heard a crow squawk, a detail that is always included when the location appears in an episode</a>. The Aztec Theatre is here. Mr. Burns’ massive mansion is fully explorable. Kamp Krusty is falling apart, but still explorable and properly dilapidated. Even the tire fire and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Tomacco">tomacco farm</a> can be found in <em>Fortnite’s</em> new Springfield map. I even found a store selling Poochie merch. If you’re a big fan of the show like me, you’ll likely die a lot this season because you’ll be too distracted by Easter eggs, references, and details to notice the enemy players hunting you down.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640879"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640879">©Epic / Disney</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, beyond the map are skins based on characters from the show. At the moment, the battle pass has added Marge and Homer, and Bart is for sale in the store. Bart is wearing a strange mech exo-suit thing, which I get is the only way to make that character work within <em>Fortnite’s</em> proportions, but it does look odd. Based on leaks and trailers, we know that Krusty, Moe, Ned, Scratchy, and a <em>Simpsons</em>&nbsp;spin on Peely are coming, too. Personally, I hope a few more characters are coming as well, but my wallet is begging for the opposite.</p>

 <p>We are even getting a series of animated <em>Simpsons</em> shorts that connect to this new <em>Fortnite</em> season, with many of the original voice actors involved. And the main series on Fox included a grisly bit involving Peely in the show’s latest episode. It’s full-on media synergy, baby!</p>

  <p>But yeah, a few days into this new <em>Fortnite</em> x <em>Simpsons</em> season, I’m hugely impressed with what Epic has pulled off. The new island is not only fun to play on and filled with tons of details, but it also looks gorgeous. Everything has this show-accurate cel-shaded look, from random pieces of flooring to iconic buildings and more. I really hope Epic lets people tinker with this map within <em>Fortnite’s</em> content creation tools in the future because it feels like a waste to throw it all away at the end of this month when the mini-season wraps up.</p> <p>Until then, I’ll be dropping in on Springfield, saying thanks to Otto (the season’s bus driver) and finding more Easter eggs and silly details from my favorite comedy series of all time. And hey, maybe this season’s popularity will remind Disney that people want <em>Simpsons</em>-themed video games? One can hope.</p>

 <p><span>“Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again,” Pondsmith said on the stream. “I have ways to do that, Keanu.

            <title><![CDATA[Why Battlefield 6 Maps Feel So Dang Tiny]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-maps-size-small-big-2000640832</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-battlefield-6-maps-feel-so-dang-tiny.1342393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A viral Reddit post on the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit this week gave a lot of angry fans and longtime vets of the series the proof they needed to back up their fears: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803"><em>Battlefield 6</em> has the franchise’s smallest maps.</a> The data is clear in showing that the recently released FPS does indeed have a lot of comparatively small maps, but a map being small doesn’t inherently mean it will feel tiny when played. And a past <em>Battlefield</em> game that many, myself included, adore proves this.</p> <p>When digging through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bfmaps-in-the-series/">newly shared map comparison data from Reddit user ClaratheRed</a>, the part that surprised me the most was learning how <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-the-kotaku-review-1788052226"><em>Battlefield 1</em>‘s maps aren’t as big as I expected</a>. If you had asked me, before looking at this data, which <em>Battlefield</em> game had the biggest levels, I probably would have mentioned <em>BF1</em>. Battles in EA’s 2016 WW1-themed FPS felt epic and massive. Yet the data shows that most of the maps in that game were around the same size as what’s on offer in <em>BF6. </em>So what’s going on?</p>

 <h2>Why maps feel bigger in <em>Battlefield 1</em></h2> <p>I think there are two main reasons my memory<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and judging by the comments on Reddit, that of many others as well<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->seems so distorted when it comes to <em>BF1</em>‘s maps. Number one: Combat and transport in <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-year-in-battlefield-1-is-still-going-strong-1820886816"><em>Battlefield 1</em></a> were much slower and more limited due to its WW1 setting. Tanks back then moved slowly, guns were inaccurate at far distances, and aerial vehicles were limited in what they could do. Getting anywhere in that game took time, and fights rarely happened across long distances. This made even “small” maps feel big, and made the few genuinely huge maps in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-s-multiplayer-undercuts-its-dramatic-sing-1787804290"><em>BF1</em></a> feel like small countries.</p>

 <p>And that leads me to the second reason <em>BF1</em> and most other <em>Battlefield</em> games feel so massive compared to <em>BF6</em> in my brain: Because they all actually did have some big maps, whereas <em>BF6</em>, at the moment, does not. While <em>BF1</em> arguably only had two or maybe three truly BIG maps, that was enough. These much larger levels provided players with the giant all-out warfare they so craved from <em>Battlefield,</em> and helped obfuscate the fact that the rest of the maps weren’t enormous. And other <em>BF</em> games often had even more really big maps, meaning you spent more time bouncing between small, medium, and big maps.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, when we look at<em> Battlefield 6</em>, our perception of its map size doesn’t benefit from slower, WW1 combat and tech. It’s set in the modern era, with jets, fast tanks, and powerful snipers that can reach out and pop someone from hundreds of meters away. So even the few medium-sized maps in <em>BF6</em> feel tiny, while small maps feel downright cramped. And <em>BF6</em> also lacks the one or two impressively big battlegrounds it needs that would let players really stretch their legs.</p>

 <p>Add that all up, and it means that every time you play <em>BF6</em> you’re playing on maps that feel small, and you never get to experience a bigger area to help cleanse the palette, or to provide those epic memories that get passed around friend groups for years and help a game like <em>Battlefield 1</em> feel bigger than it was.</p> <p>I truly do believe that if <em>BF6</em> had even one actually massive map, a lot of the doom and gloom in the game’s online community surrounding map size would start to go away simply because they’d have something big to break things up. It would also give them the all-out chaos they demand from the series at least once or twice a session. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">And while I really enjoyed <em>BF6</em>‘s next map, which is arriving later this month as part of season one</a>, I’m not sure it will be anywhere near big enough to help win back players who are fed up with all of the shooter’s small warzones. But hopefully, somewhere inside Battlefield Studios, that truly giant map is being designed or built and will see the light of day in a future update.</p>
