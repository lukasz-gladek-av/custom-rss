You begin with a township. A town is a small settlement, held back by its size, incapable of fielding multiple specialists or building certain structures. But it’s your footprint on the world.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196539,195301" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h2857266"><a id=""></a><strong>Should you convert towns to cities in Civ VII?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="27f7e7b886819d6cca45ed1cbb89c6c4" data-recommend-id="image://27f7e7b886819d6cca45ed1cbb89c6c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The building or production queue in Civilization VII." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The building or production queue in Civilization VII." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Firaxis Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27f7e7b886819d6cca45ed1cbb89c6c4" data-recommend-id="image://27f7e7b886819d6cca45ed1cbb89c6c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The building or production queue in Civilization VII." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve always been the type to build tall when playing a 4X strategy game, as it allows me to consolidate my power within a small handful of cities. All of my income, my military units, and my borders remain within my reach, and I can send reactionary forces at a moment’s notice. But if you’d prefer to play wide, you’ll quickly learn that <em>Civilization VII</em> revitalized its city system to include towns, which you may upgrade. But why would you want to? Cities come with additional costs and responsibilities, but there’s a purpose behind the madness.</p><p>In time, as you expand and bring in more gold, you can convert a town into a city—a central hub—where you may construct wonders, additional buildings, and even units. As such, it’s often best to spread your cities out but not too far; you want the ability to send units to the frontlines quickly.</p><p>So, why would you keep a town instead of upgrading to a city?</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Towns produce goods and services culminating in gold, feeding your empire’s coffers each turn</li><li>A town requires less micromanagement, as you don’t need to constantly keep tabs on production and maintenance</li><li>You can specialize a town to focus on food, which is then distributed throughout your empire, allowing your cities to focus on the grand scheme instead of minute details, like sustenance and keeping people happy</li></ul><h2 id="h2857267"><a id=""></a><strong>Types of town specializations</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Growing Town</strong>: Increases a town’s growth by 25 percent</li><li><strong>Fort Town</strong>: Additional healing to nearby units and +25 Health to Walls</li><li><strong>Urban Center</strong>: +1 Culture and Science with Quarters</li><li><strong>Farming Tow</strong>n: +1 Food to Farms, Pastures, Plantations, and Fishing Boats</li><li><strong>Mining Town</strong>: +1 Production to Camps, Woodcutters, Clay Pits, Mines, and Quarries</li><li><strong>Religious Site</strong>: +2 Happiness and +1 Relic Slot to Temples</li><li><strong>Hub Town</strong>: +2 Influence per Settlement connected to this town</li><li><strong>Trade Outpost</strong>: +2 Happiness per Resource tile in the town and +5 Trade Route range</li></ul><h2 id="h2857268"><a id=""></a><strong>How and why to upgrade a town to a city</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="45f1aa716e18848466886abb3e4d8f71" data-recommend-id="image://45f1aa716e18848466886abb3e4d8f71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade details to convert a town to a city in Civilization VII." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The upgrade details to convert a town to a city in Civilization VII." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Firaxis Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45f1aa716e18848466886abb3e4d8f71" data-recommend-id="image://45f1aa716e18848466886abb3e4d8f71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade details to convert a town to a city in Civilization VII." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you expand and progress, you’ll find that your towns stop growing.

With the unique thrills of great cooperative play so fresh in our minds, we wanted to look back at some other great co-op games that you can play with relative ease if you’re looking for something to play with a friend, family member, lover, or sworn enemy. Here are our picks for the 18 best co-op games you can play right now.</p></div><div><p>Hazelight got its start as a force in co-op games with <em>A Way Out</em>,<em> </em>which follows two criminals who escape from prison and are on the run. That could easily be a setup for a generic third-person crime shooter, but <em>A Way Out </em>marks the beginning of Hazelight’s inventive and varied co-op design. Everything you do in <em>A Way Out </em>is a team effort, whether it be setting things in motion for your prison break or escaping to freedom with the cops on your tail. The studio’s later offerings lean harder into fantastical premises and riff on more interesting cooperative ideas, but <em>A Way Out </em>is where it all began and it still holds up. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>  <em>A Way Out </em>established that Hazelight was skilled at creating memorable co-op experiences, but <em>It Takes Two </em>is where the studio really found its footing. The charming platformer puts you and a friend into the shoes of an estranged couple whose daughter wants them to remember why they fell in love in the first place, and that means using a spell to turn them into toys who have to overcome a series of challenges by working together. <em>It Takes Two </em>is constantly changing things up, giving both players different tools to use in wildly varied segments that are smooth, intuitive, and could easily have been extrapolated into separate, standalone games. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><p><em>Split Fiction </em>is the culmination of everything Hazelight has done up to this point, taking the co-op action platformer structure of <em>It Takes Two</em> up a notch as it shifts nimbly between sci-fi and fantasy worlds to pay tribute to different pieces of genre fiction as well as a wide array of video games. The game is a bit more challenging than <em>It Takes Two</em>, however, so if you’re looking to ease someone into format, maybe start with the previous game before jumping right into Hazelight’s latest. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Often imitated but never duplicated, <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> is still the best co-op shooter around some 15 years after its release. Many have tried to copy its format, but none have come close to beating<em> L4D2</em>’s mix of amazing level design, intuitive UI, fast-paced action, and perfect pacing. I’ve played so many memorable matches of<em> Left 4 Dead 2</em> with complete strangers who had no mics. Didn’t matter. We still had an amazing time mowing down zombies or killing survivors as special infected. Truly one of the all time greats. Pick this up ASAP, get some friends together on Steam, and have a blast. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>For most of its run, <em>Splinter Cell Conviction</em>’s cooperative campaign plays like most others in Ubisoft’s stealth franchise. It’s two players sneaking, shooting, and interrogating guards with a gun to their heads. However, what separates <em>Conviction </em>from its predecessors is its incredible and subversive ending, one that other games on this list would also go on to emulate. If you want a rock-solid stealth game with an intriguing espionage story full of twists and turns, you can’t go wrong with <em>Splinter Cell Conviction</em>. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Studio MDHR’s run-and-gun platformer <em>Cuphead </em>is notoriously challenging. But you know what makes it less so? Having a friend running and gunning by your side. Playing <em>Cuphead </em>with a friend is a surefire way to cut down your play time, as you’re able to revive one another after a death you’re sure was bullshit and you don’t even know what killed you. Co-op <em>Cuphead </em>is basically giving yourself a second, third, and fourth life. Playing it alone is just making it harder on yourself. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s<em> </em>tabletop inspirations are most apparent when you play it with friends. Yeah, hanging out with Larian’s party of would-be mind flayers makes for an incredible single-player RPG, but journeying through Faerûn with a group of friends playing as custom characters, getting into hijinks, and coordinating battle strategies together is the game’s chaotic potential realized. Like a good tabletop session, playing <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>with friends can either be filled with incredible moments of creative problem-solving and synergy, or it can be an absolute dumpster fire of everyone sabotaging each other and creating new problems. Sure, it’s still limited by the finite possibilities of Larian’s code, but it does a great job of emulating the concept. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Super Mario 3D World </em>is another co-op game that can easily see the action devolve from jolly cooperation to playful trolling, with its ample opportunities to wreak havoc on each other. But even when the most annoying player is throwing you off the side of the map, you can’t beat four friends running and jumping around in a <em>Mario </em>level. <em>3D World</em>’s co-op brings the multiplayer madness of the <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>sidescrollers to a 3D space. You’ll probably reach the goal pole faster on your own, but it won’t be nearly as memorable without a few hours of laughing together on the couch. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>What’s more cooperative than building something together? <em>Minecraft </em>needs no introduction as the best-selling video game of all time, but if you somehow don’t know about the game that spawned an upcoming Jack Black-led film <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve-jason-momoa-trailer-1851639338&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve-jason-momoa-trailer-1851639338">that looks pretty bad</a></span>, it’s equal parts survival adventure and creative suite. So many incredible things have been made in <em>Minecraft</em> that you might be intimidated by the game and hesitant to jump in. But in my experience, the best <em>Minecraft </em>experience is having a chill hangout with friends as you explore and build. It’s calming and therapeutic, almost like gardening with your pals. It gives you a digital space to hang out in without the stress of objectives or puzzle-solving. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Oh look, another Valve game is on the list. This time we’re spotlighting <em>Portal 2</em>, a game that shipped with a fantastic single-player campaign and didn’t need more. Yet, Valve also tossed in a damn fine co-op mode, too, complete with its own story, characters, levels, and mechanics. You’ll probably need to play this one with someone who has patience, loves puzzles, and has a strong stomach, as portal hopping can cause some motion sickness. But with the perfect person, <em>Portal 2</em> co-op is an amazing experience that is both immensely satisfying and fun. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>The <em>Lego </em>games aren’t the most complex of co-op experiences, but they are reliable and very easy to pick up and play, and there are so many different games and franchise adaptations that there’s bound to be something you and your friend are both interested in. Are you a <em>Star Wars</em> fan hoping to journey to that galaxy far far away? Looking for something <em>Marvel </em>you can play with your friends that isn’t as sweaty as <em>Rivals</em>? Or maybe you want to play a good <em>Horizon </em>game to help you and your buddy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-ai-aloy-ps5-horizon-zero-dawn-1851769086&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ai-aloy-ps5-horizon-zero-dawn-1851769086">forget about the AI monstrosity Sony is cooking up</a></span>? You can find all of the above in the <em>Lego</em> games, so you and a friend can beat up blocky baddies and usually enjoy a funny spoof of your favorite franchises. They’re a fun, uncomplicated romp. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>My favorite kind of cooperative games are the ones that give everyone a role to play. <em>Operation: Tango </em>is one of the best examples of asynchronous co-op I’ve played because the tools it gives its two players could not be more different. One player is a field agent doing espionage and sick spy tricks, the other is a hacker who only sees what’s on their computer. Both players have to be locked in, communicating, and telling each other what they see to solve problems and accomplish their mission. There’s something incredibly satisfying about finding the answer to your field agent’s problem by solving puzzles and hacking into a system. <em>Operation: Tango </em>exemplifies teamwork better than most co-op games and can be completed in a sitting or two. Just make sure you play with someone who will be patient while you’re scrolling through all the hacking UI. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Journey </em>is a little different than most of the games on this list in that you can’t queue up with a friend and guarantee that you’ll play through Thatgamecompany’s gorgeous playable screensaver together. You can play <em>Journey </em>by yourself, but throughout your trek through a desert up to a mountain in the distance, you’ll pass by other players making their own pilgrimage; you’re free to heed them as they try to help you find your way, or you can ignore them. However, <em>Journey</em>’s only form of communication is through chirps that don’t have a specific meaning, so you and your traveling partner will essentially create your own language by wordlessly chirping at one another as you move through the world. The expedition to the mountain is arduous, emotional, and beautiful to behold, and it’s also one that’s better when walking alongside another. Even if you don’t know just who it is you’ve been paired up with. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>When talking awesome co-op experiences, it’s too hard to pick one <em>Halo </em>game. And luckily, in the year 2025 we don’t have to because we have the<em> Master Chief Collection.</em> Now you and a friend (or a few more, depending on the game) can play through all of <em>Halo</em>,<em> Halo 2</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>ODST, Halo Reach</em>, and <em>Halo 4</em> together without having to swap games or consoles. And thanks to plenty of updates, the <em>MCC </em>is the best way to enjoy the action-packed and bombastic campaigns found in each game. Sure, you can play them solo, but having a buddy in your Warthog is always better. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Halo</em>, all of the <em>Gears </em>games—even <em>Judgement</em>—are fun co-op games. However, I’m going to specify<em> Gears of War 3</em> for this list as I think it’s still the best game in the series and it features 4-player co-op, too. This was only seen one other time, in the previously mentioned <em>Judgement</em>, and while I can imagine it was a pain to implement, it makes <em>Gears 3</em> so much fun to go back to in 2025. You can bring your whole crew and play <em>Gears of War 3 </em>all at the same time. And thanks to Xbox’s backwards compatibility and FPS boost, playing this aging cover shooter is as easy as chainsawing a Locust drone’s head off. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Really, any <em>Borderlands </em>game is made 10,000 times better when you bring a friend or two along for the ride. But personally, <em>Borderlands 3</em> is my favorite to replay with friends these days and that’s mainly because of how good the combat and movement feel in this one. However, you could also check out <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands,</em> which plays just as well as <em>Borderlands 3</em> but also supports crossplay and features a lot of cool magic and fantasy melee weapons. And best of all, when playing any <em>Borderlands </em>game in co-op, you will all be too distracted by each other to hear the cringey jokes. A win-win situation! — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><p>When the original <em>Diablo </em>arrived in 1997, the alluring pull of the Lord of Terror wreaked havoc on the work and school schedules of thousands, who couldn’t resist diving into the dungeons beneath the cathedral in Tristram with friends to slaughter monsters and score some sweet loot. The series and its emphasis on co-op continue to this day, of course, but if you ask me, the fun factor for co-op play peaked with the second game, 2000’s <em>Diablo II</em>. (To be clear, I like the tone, story, and core experience of <em>Diablo IV</em>, the series’ latest entry, but I also think the game is bogged down with live-service elements and obnoxious endgame grinds designed to keep you playing for the sake of keeping you playing, rather than because those grinds are actually fun or meaningful.)</p><p> Thankfully, <em>Diablo II </em>got a great modern refresh with <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em>, a 2021 remaster of the 2000 game and its excellent <em>Lord of Destruction </em>expansion that makes hopping into Sanctuary with a friend and fighting the forces of evil on modern platforms a piece of cake. <em>Diablo II </em>is one of the most influential games of all time, cementing the very way we think about in-game loot in everything from <em>Borderlands </em>to <em>Fortnite </em>as having different color-coded quality tiers, and the appeal of its incredible classes, weapons, combat, and world is as apparent today as it was a quarter century ago. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
