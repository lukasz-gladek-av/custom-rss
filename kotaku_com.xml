The film is being directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who also directed 2022’s <em>Prey</em>, a fantastic Hulu-exclusive <em>Predator </em>sequel. So we know Trachtenberg is doing <em>Badlands,</em> but apparently before that releases, he has a surprise, different <em>Predator </em>film that might be an animated anthology. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an October 24 interview with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span><em>,</em> Asbell answered a host of questions about upcoming 20th Century projects, like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>Alien</em>, and even <em>Speed 3</em>. But the most interesting bit of news was the confirmation that a secret, previously unknown <em>Predator </em>movie is going to arrive sometime next year before <em>Badlands</em>. </p><p>“After <em>Prey </em>became a success, Dan [Trachtenberg] came back and said he didn’t want to do <em>Prey 2,” </em>said Asbell,<em> “</em>And we’re like, ‘What do you want to do?’ And he rattled off a bunch of ideas that were really crazy but really cool.”</p><p>“We’ve actually done two of them. Two are coming out next year. One I can’t talk about yet, but the other one is the live-action <em>Predator </em>film with Elle Fanning that just wrapped in New Zealand. That’ll be out theatrically sometime next year. It’s titled <em>Badlands </em>and it is an absolutely bonkers idea. It is a sci-fi thing, but it’s not what everybody thinks it is. And I mean, it’s awesome. It is so nuts. But in Dan, we trust.”</p><p>Asbell didn’t say much about the other <em>Predator </em>movie, but did suggest it won’t be released in theaters and confirmed Tractenberg also directed it. </p><h2 id="h144118"><a id=""></a>An animated <em>Predator </em>movie and more <em>AVP</em></h2><p>On Friday<em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/secret-predator-movie-dan-trachtenberg-badlands-prey-2000516609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/secret-predator-movie-dan-trachtenberg-badlands-prey-2000516609"><em>IO9 </em>further reported</a></span> that they had heard from sources that the surprise <em>Predator </em>movie is an animated anthology featuring three different stories involving different warriors throughout history fighting Predators. One is possibly about pirates, one is reportedly about samurai, and no details were shared about the third story. Disney didn’t provide a comment to the outlet before publication. </p><p>Still, an animated <em>Predator </em>anthology about various warriors from the past taking on the intergalactic bounty hunter sounds similar to <em>Prey </em>and would likely be something released only on Hulu and not in theaters, which lines up with what Asbell told <em>THR</em>. </p><p>Meanwhile, in that same interview with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, the 20th Century Studios boss also said it was likely we would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/#:~:text=Fine.%20Will%20we,But%20we%20haven%E2%80%99t&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/#:~:text=Fine.%20Will%20we,But%20we%20haven%E2%80%99t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eventually get another <em>Alien Vs Predator </em>movie</a></span>, but “it wouldn’t be in the way you think.” </p><p>“That’s the thing. Not in the way that it will just be called <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> or anything like the original movies,” explained Asbell. “If we do this, they’ll be organically created out of these two franchises that we’ve continued with characters that we fall in love with and those characters will combine…perhaps. But we haven’t gotten to that point. And we’re not just going to bang it out.”<br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The small patch fixed and tweaked various bugs and mistakes, as you would expect, but buried in the patch notes is one fix that caught the attention of <em>Team Fortress 2'</em>s most dedicated fans. </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed BLU Scout using the incorrect team color pants</li></ul><p>Without any context that might just seem like yet one more tiny bug fixed by Valve, but this has actually been a problem in <em>TF2</em> since its release. And although fans have pointed it out in the past, it was never addressed. Blu Scout’s pants, for the last 17 years, have been brown, which is incorrect. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1gbfv95/so_apparently_for_the_last_17_years_blu_scouts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1gbfv95/so_apparently_for_the_last_17_years_blu_scouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His pants should be grey, just like all the other classes on the Blu Team</a></span>. Brown pants are intended for Red Team members. Yet, this mistake has persisted for nearly two decades, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2289&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite the evidence</a></span>.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/heavyfortres/status/1849564536795242979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/heavyfortres/status/1849564536795242979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And then, out of nowhere, Valve fixed it</a></span>. Now Blu Scout’s pants are grey, which is nice, although it also means <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fo63oo3kk0swd1.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D291d62f437c6c67d5d13b10f3f73cd15dbbe6abf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fo63oo3kk0swd1.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D291d62f437c6c67d5d13b10f3f73cd15dbbe6abf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bunch of community-created cosmetics</a></span> for that character look ugly because they were designed with brown pants. </p><p>Why now, after 17 years, did Valve fix this long-known <em>TF2 </em>bug? We don’t know, and because Valve famously doesn’t explain many of their decisions or plans, your guess is as good as mine. </p><p>However, I have a theory about this change. Last year, around this same time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667">Valve fixed a very old bug in <em>Half-Life</em></a></span> involving a monster’s animation. I think as the year wraps up, Valve might let devs tinker as the holidays approach, and perhaps that’s why this patch has suddenly appeared. Maybe someone got a bit of free time and used it to hop into <em>TF2 </em>and correct this mistake? </p><p>Or perhaps Valve just likes trolling fans? Maybe both! Anyway, Scout’s pants are finally the correct color and we can all sleep easy knowing that the world is a better place. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
