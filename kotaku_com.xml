              <p>LEGO sets that use specific instructions look great on shelves but they don’t teach kids how to build from imagination. A classic brick box gives them raw materials and lets them figure out what to make instead of just following steps to recreate someone else’s design. This medium brick box includes 484 pieces in 35 different colors with wheels, windows, eyes, and a green baseplate for building whatever comes to mind. It <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/">drops to just $17 on Amazon, down from the usual $34</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low for a set this size with this much variety,</strong> and it’s the kind of price that makes stocking up for birthdays or holidays affordable.</p>

<h2>Great for Creativity</h2>
<p>The 484-piece count gives kids enough bricks to<strong> create multiple creations at once</strong> instead of constantly tearing things apart to make something new. You get 35 different colors, which sounds excessive until you realize that having color variety lets kids create more realistic builds where different parts of a structure actually look distinct. The included 18 tires with wheel rims mean vehicles become an obvious building option and the windows plus toy eyes add character to buildings and creatures.</p>
<p>The green baseplate measures <strong>over three inches long and six inches wide</strong>, and provides a stable foundation for constructions that would otherwise topple over on a table. Baseplates matter more than most people realize, since they let kids build upward without having to worry about stability, and the green color works for grass, fields, parks, or any outdoor scene. If you grab more than one set, you can stick multiple baseplates together, creating larger building surfaces for ambitious projects.</p>



<p>Cross-compatibility with all LEGO construction sets means <strong>these bricks work with any other LEGO pieces you already own</strong>. Kids can mix this classic collection with themed sets like City, Friends, or Creator to expand their options without worrying about pieces not fitting together. This is across decades of LEGO production, so even vintage bricks from the 80s or 90s snap together perfectly with these new pieces.</p>



<p>The<strong> large plastic storage container serves as organization when play is over</strong>, keeping bricks contained instead of scattered across the floor, just waiting to ambush bare feet. There’s a handle for easy transport, which is conducive to kids taking their LEGO collection to friends’ houses or on trips without dumping loose bricks into a backpack. Of course, proper storage extends the life of the set, as pieces stay together and don’t get lost in couch cushions or vacuumed up by accident.</p>
<p>The builds, such as trains, cars, and tiger figures, will inspire kids when they don’t know what to do or need ideas. You can find simple building ideas in the included instructions or online, but the whole point is adapting those ideas into original creations. A basic train design becomes a starting point for adding cargo cars, passenger sections, or fantasy elements like wings or laser cannons. The tiger figure teaches how to use specific pieces for eyes and features, then kids apply that knowledge to building their own animals or creatures.</p>
<p><strong>The age range is from 4 to 99</strong> which reflects both young kids just learning to build and adults who still enjoy creative construction. Younger children focus on simpler builds and color sorting, whereas older kids create complex structures with moving parts or detailed scenes. Adults use them for desk decorations, stress relief, or collaborative building sessions with their kids.</p>
<p>At $17 for 484 pieces with specialty elements like wheels, windows, and a baseplate, <strong>you’re paying about 3.5 cents per brick</strong>. That’s exceptional value for real LEGO, particularly given that themed sets often ring in at 10 to 15 cents per piece.</p>

              <p>For years now, Samsung has dominated the foldable phone market with its Galaxy Z Fold line, and the Galaxy Z Fold7 brings forth the sixth generation of this revolutionary smartphone. The great news today is that<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/"> Amazon currently offers this 512GB variant for $1,680, down from $2,119</a>. Samsung can’t offer that on their website which make it a legitimate all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Screens That Redefine Mobile Productivity</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold7 boasts dual screens that seamlessly work together to redefine how you use a smartphone. The 6.3-inch cover screen smoothly handles your quick tasks and one-handed operations, while <strong>unfolding it reveals a massive 7.6-inch main display</strong>, reminiscent of tablet territory. This inner screen incorporates Samsung’s Ultra Thin Glass technology, which feels remarkably different from the plastic screens of folding phones past. <strong>A 120Hz refresh rate</strong> on both displays ensures smooth scrolling-be it flipping through emails on the cover screen or multitasking on the main display.</p>
<p>The hinge mechanism has been refined through six generations of engineering and it’s great: Samsung reduced the crease visibility significantly compared to previous models, though you’ll still feel it slightly when running your finger across the center. The <em>JetBlack</em> finish resists fingerprints better than glossy alternatives, and the Armor Aluminum frame adds durability without excessive weight. <strong>Samsung rates this phone for 200,000 folds</strong>&nbsp;which translates to roughly five years of opening and closing the device 100 times daily.</p>



<p>The brightness goes up to 2,600 nits peak, and outdoors, it’s perfectly visible even in direct sunlight. You will be very comfortable reading the screen at the beach or navigating maps while walking around town. Samsung’s adaptive color technology adjusts the display to match the ambient lighting, thus reducing eye strain during long uses.</p>
<p><strong>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite processor powers the Z Fold7</strong> and dlivers desktop-class performance in a foldable form factor. This chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, gaming, and AI processing without breaking a sweat. The 512GB storage option gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and 4K videos without constantly managing space. Samsung pairs this with 12GB of RAM, ensuring smooth app switching even when running multiple resource-intensive applications.</p>
<p>The battery – 4,600mAh – may sound modest on paper but Samsung’s optimization makes it<strong> last over a full day with moderate usage</strong>. The heavy users who push both screens hard might need a top-up by evening, but typical usage patterns easily stretch from morning to bedtime. Fast charging at 25W will get you to 50% in about 30 minutes, though Samsung doesn’t include a charger in the box.</p>



<p>The<strong> new triple camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor</strong> that captures stunning details in most lighting conditions. Samsung’s AI processing enhances the photos automatically to adjust colors and sharpness, depending on the scene. Further, the 12MP ultra-wide camera shoots group shots and landscape photography, while the 10MP telephoto lens offers 3x optical zoom for distant subjects. A secondary 10MP telephoto camera includes 2x optical zoom to give you more flexibility in framing without compromising on image quality.</p>
<p><strong>Android 15 runs underneath Samsung’s One UI 7 </strong>with the interface optimized for foldable displays. When you unfold the phone, it intelligently expands apps to take advantage of the screen real estate. A taskbar along the bottom of the main display lets you quickly switch between your most-used apps and recent tasks. You can drag and drop content between apps, copy text from one application and paste into another, and resize app windows to fit your workflow.</p>
<p>Samsung promises<strong> four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches</strong>.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that early Black Friday deal as it could run out of stock quickly.</p>
