              <p>Gaming at high frame rates with maxed-out settings doesn’t have to drain your bank account anymore. Asus just dropped a deal on two of its latest powerhouses: the TUF Gaming GeForce <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4923/">RTX 5070 is now down to $584 on Amazon (from $739)</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4922/">the RTX 5080 sits at $1,349 (originally $1,599)</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Should You Pay Attention to These Cards?</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 comes equipped with 12GB of GDDR7 memory whih is the most recent generation of graphics memory technology. GDDR7 brings much higher data transfer rates than the older cards’ GDDR6, so textures load sooner, stuttering is reduced, and you enjoy smoother action in memory-hungry titles like Cyberpunk 2077 or Microsoft Flight Simulator. 12GB capacity means you’ll have no VRAM bottlenecks at 1440p or even 4K resolutions in most titles, and provides you with headroom through the next couple of years as titles increasingly require increasing amounts of resources.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 uses a 3.125-slot design which means it’s slightly thicker than traditional two-slot cards but not quite as massive as some three-slot monsters. This extra space allows for a more robust cooling solution without turning your case into an oven. Asus equips it with axial-tech fans that spin in alternating directions to reduce turbulence and increase airflow efficiency.</p>



<p>Upgrading to the RTX 5080, you’ll be getting 16GB of GDDR7 memory and the more substantial 3.6-slot build. This card aims directly at gamers who won’t compromise, running 4K resolution with ray tracing and still demanding triple-digit frame rates. That extra 4GB of VRAM over the 5070 makes all the difference when you’re gaming at higher resolutions and ultra textures or you’re doing content creation like video editing or 3D rendering on the side. Vapor chamber cooling on the RTX 5080 is an evolution of the older heat pipe technology. Instead of using the latter’s hollow tubes to conduct the heat, the vapor chamber distributes the thermal energy on a wider surface area, keeping the hotspot under control and delivering steady results even through long gaming marathons.</p>



<p>Both boards are PCIe 5.0 capable, doubling the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0. Now, you won’t be seeing huge real-world improvements to gaming these days, but future software and applications are going to be increasingly making use of that extra bandwidth. DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI connectivity adds future-proof readiness of the next generation of monitors, including those scaling well beyond 4K resolution and higher refresh rates. If you have come to consider one of those new 240Hz 4K monitors, these cards actually have the ability to properly feed themIt manufactures these TUF Gaming cards using military-grade components and provides protective PCB coating.</p>
<p>At $584, the RTX 5070 undercuts what many people paid for last generation’s mid-range cards while delivering current-gen performance and features. The RTX 5080 at $1,349 brings flagship-tier gaming within reach of enthusiasts who don’t want to take out a loan for their hobby. Given that both cards have strong review scores on Amazon (4.7 stars for the 5070 across over 2,000 reviews, and 4.6 stars for the 5080), stock my sell out quickly.</p>
