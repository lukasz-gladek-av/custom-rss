              <p>Recreations of classic maps and modes from other games are nothing new in shooters. Lately, however, publishers have started getting prickly over users remaking maps from their game in someone else’s, and it seems this may be especially true when those games are as competitive with each other as <i>Battlefield</i> and <i>Call of Duty</i>. <i>Battlefield 6 </i>players remaking <i>CoD</i> maps via the game’s new portal mode are finding this out the hard way, with their recreations of modes and maps from Activision’s popular shooter getting taken down over intellectual property violations.</p> <p>In an email to <i>Kotaku</i>, <i>Battlefield</i> player and YouTube creator Phiality saw their “<a href="https://youtu.be/7xo_Z9mr3zE">Battlefield Zombies 2028: Osiris</a>” Portal creation struck down, which notably took place after the mode gained some traction on YouTube. On October 23, 2025, EA sent them a copyright takedown notice specifically naming Activision as having filed the complaint. The notice asks them to “permanently delete the experience and create a new one that incorporates only your original work.”</p>

 <p>The use of intellectual property in user-made maps has been a thorny topic in recent years. Though some of us vets may recall the days of <i>Halo 3</i>’s user-made Forge maps that remade popular <i>CoD</i> playspaces surging in popularity without issue, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-uefn-call-of-duty-dmca-creator-copyright-1850299456">youth of today hasn’t had it as easy</a>. <i>Fortnite</i>’s publisher, Epic, has in the past policed the recreation of maps from other intellectual properties in its popular battle royale.</p>

 <p>Still, the targeting of <i>CoD</i> maps and modes in <i>Battlefield</i> feels very specific. As Phiality notes in their statement to <i>Kotaku</i>, other games, including <i>Fortnite</i>, presently have recreations of <i>CoD</i> maps. In a reverse situation, you can even download a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3587806355&amp;searchtext=BF4"><i>Battlefield 4</i> weapon pack for <i>BLOPS 3</i></a> via the Steam Workshop.</p> <p>Phiality isn’t alone in seeing their Portal creations taken down. As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-shuts-down-call-of-duty-inspired-battlefield-6-portal-maps/"><i>Insider Gaming</i></a>, a recreation of the classic <i>CoD</i> map “Shipment,” titled “Shipment first test,” got yanked with a warning that repeat copyright offenses might result in a temporary or permanent ban from not just <i>Battlefield</i>, but potentially all “EA Games &amp; Services.”</p>

<p>You’re saving almost $1,400 on a machine that is powerful enough to handle both work and play well. Of course, deals like this don’t stick around for long, so we recommend acting fast to get your orders in before it expires or the stock runs out for good.</p>

<h2>Premium Finish, Powerful Specs</h2>
<p>This sleek laptop flaunts a matte finish for that classic, premium look. The screen is a 15.6-inch Full HD display that pushes brilliant, sharp visuals while keeping them easier on the eyes. You’re getting narrow borders for a larger screen real estate, plus a 120Hz refresh rate that keeps everything smooth, even when you’re playing fast-paced games. The keyboard is also full-sized, featuring a 10-key numeric keypad. Typing for longer hours is going to be comfortable; just note that it’s not backlit.</p>
<p>For power, you have a 13th Gen Intel 5-core processor that outperforms older chips like the i5-1145G. It’s made for resource-intensive tasks, so working with heavier apps and pushing some creative boundaries won’t be an issue. Pair that with 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and you’ve got yourself a full-fledged multitasking companion that’s ready to take on your most productive, busiest days. There’s a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD storage built in. This is enough space to house all your important data, media content, and even games. SSD is also much faster than HDD, so you can expect significantly faster boot times than traditional drives.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, plus a ton of ports to connect all your essentials. These include USB 2.0, USB 3.2 Gen 1, USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C (data only), HDMI 1.4, SD 3.0 card slot, headset jack, and a Flip-Down RJ-45 Ethernet port. The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which is one of the most user-friendly operating systems out there, whether you’re planning to use it for work, studies, or streaming.</p>
<p>Altogether, this is a great chance to grab this powerful laptop for significantly less. Just be sure to grab the deal quickly, as it might wrap up soon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/">We don’t expect to see another one this massive before Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>
