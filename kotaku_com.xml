              <p>The controversy surrounding the DLC clans in the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-vtm-chinese-room-1851787361"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> 2</a> is finally over. The studio behind the upcoming game has confirmed that it is walking back its plans to lock two clans behind a paywall after receiving lots of “feedback,” aka people yelled at them online for a while.</p> <p>Last month,<em> Bloodlines 2</em> devs The Chinese Room and publisher Paradox announced at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom ONL</a> that the long-awaited vampire RPG sequel would finally arrive on PC and consoles in October. After a lengthy and messy development cycle that involved multiple studios and delays, a lot of fans were just happy that <em>Bloodlines 2</em> was actually, for real, coming out.&nbsp; But then folks discovered that <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-day-1-dlc-clans-2000618832">two of the game’s six vampire clans, which essentially act as your class, were locked behind a $30 paywall.</a> People got mad, a lot of negative headlines were posted, and about a week later, on August 27, the devs announced they were <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dlc-clans-locked-paywall-2000620705">going to make some tweaks to the DLC plans</a>. And now we know what that means: All six clans are included in the base game.</p> <p>On September 17, in the YouTube description of a new <em>Bloodlines 2</em> gameplay overview trailer, the executive producer on the game thanked fans for the “frank feedback” about the game’s Premium Edition DLC before confirming that none of the clans would be locked behind a day-one DLC paywall. He also praised the devs for helping create two new story packs that will now be included in the Premium Edition.</p>

  <p>“Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on <em>Bloodlines 2</em> and the Premium Edition,” said<em> Bloodlines 2</em> executive producer Marco Behrmann. “That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing. We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.”</p> <p>The two new story packs are: “Loose Cannon“ (Brujah Sheriff Benny’s story) and “The Flower &amp; The Flame” (Toreador Primogen Ysabella’s path). The plan is for this DLC, which replaces the missing paid access to clans, to launch in 2026. And so ends the B<em>loodlines 2</em> DLC saga. Hopefully, after all of this and all the years of waiting, the game is worth it all. We’ll find out when <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 l</em>aunches on Xbox, PS5, and PC on October 21.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, I didn’t have this on my 2025 bingo card, which is a thing I assume we all have. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mars-attacks-video-game-mars-attracts-theme-park-burton-1851629159">There’s a <em>Mars Attacks!</em> video game out this week on PC</a>, and more surprisingly, it’s a really fun, if somewhat rough around the edges, theme park management game that plays a lot like a sci-fi spin on <em>Zoo Tycoon</em> and <em>Two Point Hospital. </em></p> <p>Cleverly titled <em>Mars Attracts,</em> this newly released theme park management sim lets you abduct humans from throughout history and build a theme park around displaying them like animals while also experimenting on them in horrible ways for science. And also to provide entertainment to your depraved Martian guests. And after spending a few hours with <em>Mars Attracts,</em> I’m both excited to play more and also disturbed by how quickly I turned on humanity in the pursuit of building the coolest theme park on Mars.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mars-attracts"><em>Mars Attracts</em></a> isn’t based on the ’90s <em>Mars Attacks</em> movie directly, but instead is based on the original trading cards that inspired Tim Burton’s cult classic film, so don’t expect Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker to pop up at any point. Instead, <em>Mars Attracts</em> uses the OG card art and lore as its foundation to build out a wild theme park management simulator. And all of the new in-game art created for<em> Mars Attracts</em> is fantastic, perfectly emulating the old look of the cards. I really want some of these loading screen and pause menu images printed out as big posters.</p>

  <p>So what do you do in <em>Mars Attracts</em>? Well, you build theme parks. But it’s not as simple as plopping down some paths, food stalls, trash cans, and rides, and calling it a day. The Martians in <em>Mars Attracts</em> are coming to your park to see different human beings from various points in history, like the Wild West and Ancient Rome. Through the use of time travel and UFOs, you send off aliens to go collect humans and items from a given time period, which you then place in exhibits. And while you have some humans collected, you might as well run experiments on them. Not only does this please many of your guests, but it also helps you earn the various research currencies needed to unlock upgrades and new things to build. It’s a lot more fun than researching new tech in other park builders. In those games, I don’t even get to torture and kill one single human, let alone dozens.</p> <p>Of course, the humans you collect aren’t going to be happy about this situation, so you’ll need to make sure you keep their enclosure clean and filled with food troughs and water dispensers, and not poke and prod them too much. If a human gets too angry and wants to break out, they just might, and you’ll need to call in security to stop them.</p>

 <p>And if you have an excess of human beings, you can also just dissect them and use their parts to build new kiosks and entertainment options for your guests. Want to provide your Martians with balloons made out of human lungs? You can do just that, once you’ve killed enough humans. If this all sounds morbid and disgusting, don’t worry. <em>Mars Attracts</em> features a cartoonish and silly aesthetic that makes it easy to have a good time while torturing your human captives.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626566">©</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Mars Attracts</em> is currently in early access on Steam, and while I didn’t experience any annoying bugs or crashes while building out my incredible parks across the game’s first few starting zones, I did notice some missing text and a lack of sound effects. There’s just a general sense that the game isn’t finished yet, which is exactly what I would expect from an early access indie game. I also felt like some parts of the in-game economy felt grindy, and it can be annoying managing supplies when it feels like your workers aren’t doing what you expect. So if you prefer your games to be more feature-complete, perfectly balanced, and…well…finished, then you might want to wait.</p> <p>For everyone else, if you love building out wacky hospitals in <em>Two Point</em> or building elaborate parks in <em>RollerCoaster Tycoon</em>, I’d definitely recommend<em> Mars Attracts</em>. It’s the weirdest theme park builder I’ve played in a long time, but also a fantastic spin on the genre that sci-fi fans and <em>Mars Attacks</em> lovers will enjoy for hours and hours.</p>
