            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good news: Sony just announced a new<a href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><em> Ratchet &amp; Clank</em></a> game. Bad news: It’s some free-to-play mobile arena shooter thing.</p> <p>On November 12, PlayStation Studios and Insomniac announced <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em>. The game is being created by OhBibi, <a href="https://www.ohbibi.com/games">a mobile game developer located in France</a> which&nbsp;has previously created cartoony, colorful action-focused third-person shooters. And what do you know, that’s exactly what<em> Ranger Rumble</em> appears to be in the game’s first trailer.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.rangerrumble.com/?utm_source=SoftLaunch&amp;utm_medium=PreReg&amp;utm_campaign=Socials&amp;utm_id=RangerRumble_SoftLaunch">According to the upcoming game’s website</a>,<em> Ranger Rumble</em> will feature “iconic characters from the <span><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> franchise” as well as big guns and explosions, which are hallmarks of the long-running series that started back on the PS2. PlayStation Studios describes <em>Ranger Rumble</em> as a “fast-paced multiplayer platformer arena shooter,” which, yeah, seems accurate.<br> </span></p>

 <p><span>“​</span>Experience the&nbsp;<span>humor, action</span>, and energy of the&nbsp;<span>iconic universe</span> in a bold new real-time multiplayer format,” says the game’s website. “Play as a Legendary Hero from the past, now with unique abilities. Go solo or team up with other Rangers online in <span>thrilling multiplayer games</span> built for every kind of player.”</p> <p>No release date was announced, but it is supposedly coming to mobile platforms “soon.” You can pre-register now.</p> <p>I think visually, <em>Ranger Rumble</em> looks great. It feels like a Saturday morning cartoon spin on the <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> universe, and I’m here for that. However, I’ve tried multiple times to enjoy multiplayer shooters on mobile phones using touch controls, and I hate it. And sure, many of them let you plug in a controller and play that way, but at that point, I’d rather just play a game on PC or console. Perhaps <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em> will eventually make the leap to PS4/PS5 and PC, but for now, I’m not sure I’ll play it. At least Sony hasn’t forgotten about<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank.</em> So that’s nice!</p> <p>This also lines up with past comments from <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-playstation-jim-ryan-xbox-game-pass-activision-1850880301">former PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-mobile-games-apps">who in 2021 explained in investor relations documents</a> that Sony was looking to invest more in mobile games based on famous franchises. I can’t wait for the <em>Sly Cooper</em> match-three game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="550">There’s no shortage of brands to choose from when looking to boost your PC’s storage, but Crucial has been a trusted name in the game for over 25 years. The company’s award-winning lineup focuses on packing in as much storage as possible while keeping things running fast and smooth. Backed by Micron—the world’s fifth-largest semiconductor company with over 54,000 patents and compatibility across 180,000+ systems—Crucial knows its stuff. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5536/">And right now, you can grab a great deal on the Crucial BX500 internal SSD over on Amazon and it’s not even Black Friday weekend or Cyber Monday yet.</a> Here’s the breakdown of the current discounts.</p>
<p data-start="552" data-end="986">The limited-time sale covers several storage sizes for the BX500 SSD. The 240GB and 480GB models are unfortunately staying put at $37 and $60 respectively. But honestly, if you’re upgrading, you might as well aim higher. The 1TB model is down 23%, taking the price from $94 to $72, and the 2TB model is seeing a 21% discount—now just $130 instead of $164. The big 4TB option doesn’t get quite as deep a cut, sitting 12% off which brings it from $301 to $265.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5536/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>


<p data-start="988" data-end="1397">This internal solid-state drive was built for IT professionals, content creators, and everyday users alike. Whether you’re a photographer organizing thousands of photos, a video editor storing massive raw files, or a writer backing up your work, Crucial’s got you covered. With read and write speeds of up to 540 MB/s, the BX500 will provide you with consistent, high-performance.</p>
<h2 data-start="1399" data-end="1435"><strong data-start="1399" data-end="1433">Big Performance Jump from HDDs</strong></h2>
<p data-start="988" data-end="1397">If you’re upgrading from a standard hard drive, you’ll notice a massive difference right away. Your laptop will boot faster, load files quicker, and feel more responsive overall. The BX500 delivers roughly 300% faster performance than a typical HDD and is up to 45 times more energy efficient, which can even extend your laptop’s battery life.</p>


<p data-start="988" data-end="1397">Installing isn’t as daunting as one might think. Even if you’ve never swapped out a drive before, just follow along with the included step-by-step SSD installation guide included. You’ll be able to transfer everything over from your old drive quickly and easily. It’s a great upgrade for both seasoned PC builders and first-time upgraders who want a big performance boost without the hassle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889">Hideo Kojima</a> has apparently been embroiled in a slow-moving online controversy for the past week and is now trying to definitively extricate himself and his studio from the ongoing backlash. “In light of certain misunderstandings that have arisen in some media reports and on social networks, we would like to take this opportunity to accurately convey the facts,” his studio announced on social media on Wednesday.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852">The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director</a> shared a photo online earlier this month in which he appeared at the <span dir="auto">Lucca Comics &amp; Games convention in Italy alongside author and cartoonist Michele “Zerocalcare” Rech. Kojima was holding a Japanese copy of <em>Kobane Calling</em>, a 2015 graphic novel which illustrates the struggles of a town along the Turkish-Syrian border under threat from ISIS. Rech also recently published another graphic novel called <i>No Sleep till Shengal</i> about the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=persecution+yazidis&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=persecution+yazidis&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yCwgCEAAYFhgeGMcDMg0IAxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBRAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBhAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoICBAAGIAEGKIEMgoICRAAGIAEGKIE0gEIMjM0MWowajSoAgGwAgHxBfmT95DIDBFz&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">persecution of the Yazidis</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>But shortly after it was published on his social media channel, Kojima, famous for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zf3k5d/my_favourite_internet_phenomenon_is_hideo_kojima/">posting photo ops</a> with the people he meets, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kurdistan/comments/1on6y3f/hideo_kojima_faces_backlash_from_turkish/">deleted the picture</a>.</p> <p>Kojima was seemingly spurred to erase evidence of the meeting due to an online backlash surrounding Rech’s political views. <em>Kobane Calling</em> reportedly expresses sympathy for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-syrian-kurdish-ypg-2023-10-05/">Syrian Kurdish YPG militia forces</a> which, yes, fought against ISIS, but YPG is also <a href="https://mei.edu/publications/child-soldiers-and-ypg">accused by some international groups</a> of recruiting child soldiers and is classified by Turkey and other nations as a terrorist organization (the U.S. does not consider it a terrorist group, although it’s affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) which the U.S. does classify as one). The plight of child soldiers was also <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Child_soldier#:~:text=In%201999%2C%20the%20military%20fortress,to%20fight%20in%20future%20wars.">a frequent theme</a> throughout the <em>Metal Gear</em> series.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disappointing backpedaling. Kobane Calling is is a firsthand account of the Kurdish resistance against ISIS during the Syrian war; Zero literally traveled to a war zone to document it. It's only controversial if you think ISIS were the good guys in that scenario. <a href="https://t.co/N6G7KFGw3p">https://t.co/N6G7KFGw3p</a> <a href="https://t.co/HwD73b8b2j">pic.twitter.com/HwD73b8b2j</a></p> <p>— bidonica ❗ (@bidonica1) <a href="https://twitter.com/bidonica1/status/1988592648895291493?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Rech noticed and released <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQoim9wjM6k/?hl=en">his own video</a> about the incident using comic illustrations. Calling Kojima the “<span dir="auto">Jesus Christ of video games,” the cartoonist said it was his publisher’s idea to share a copy of <em>Kobane Calling</em> with the famed game developer, who then voluntarily held it up for the photo op, according to <a href="https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/11/05/zerocalcare-scoppia-la-polemica-internazionale-per-la-foto-con-hideo-kojima-al-lucca-comics-il-fumettista-ora-lo-stanno-a-tartassa/8185677/">a report</a> by Italian outlet <em>Fatto Quotidiano</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>“I opened the internet and saw two hundred Turkish sites saying that Kojima had published a post in favor of terrorism,” Rech said in the video published over a week ago, according to a Google translation. “Of course, for the Turks, they’re all terrorists, and now they’re harassing poor Kojima.”</p>

 <p>A week later, Kojima Productions finally addressed the incident with a statement throwing Rech under the bus. “There is no personal or professional relationship between the two individuals,” it declared. “The photo was taken briefly at the Lucca Comics &amp; Games venue after a short introduction through an acquaintance.”</p>

 <p>The studio continued, “Neither Mr. Kojima nor KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS had any prior knowledge or understanding of Mr. Zerocalcare’s works or political positions, and there was no intention to express agreement with, or support for, any particular stance or opinion.”</p> <p>The statement exudes a surprising amount of Ubisoft “let’s not get political” energy from the team behind a recent set of very political PlayStation blockbusters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Six Takeaways From The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-breakdown-rosalina-2000643501</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/six-takeaways-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.1351378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This morning, we got the first real trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447"><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a><span>. We learned that Bowser’s still tiny, his son is coming to save him, and the fight will take Mario and his friends into space. While the movie’s title makes it sound like it’s going to be an adaptation of 2007’s excellent </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span>, the trailer includes several references to other </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>games beyond the cosmic Wii adventure. Let’s break down some of the big takeaways from the first trailer.</span></p>

  <h2><b>Bowser is an unrecognized artistic talent</b></h2> <p><span>The king of koopas has had a lot of time to kill while in his tiny confinement, and he’s used all that time to refine his artistic skills. Yes, turning the guy into a small version of himself and sticking him in what is essentially a pet playpen is cruel and unusual punishment; still, the guy seems to have a pretty cushy arrangement. Mario and Luigi have been kind enough to let him be true to himself in decorating his diminutive domicile, and he’s basically made a mini castle in which to spend his shrunken imprisonment. When you’re no longer trying to conquer other kingdoms, you really learn where your true talents lie, and Bowser could have had a lucrative business as an interior designer and painter. Mario tries to crush his spirits by calling his extremely detailed (and embellished) painting of him and Peach “trash,” however, resulting in a tirade from the little guy which reveals that, despite all his attempts at rehabilitation, he’s still an angry despot underneath all that unrecognized talent.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643512">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The team might be splitting up?</b></h2> <p><span>The first time we see any hint of the “Galaxy” side of </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span> is when a (gorgeous) meteor shower falls over the Mushroom Kingdom. Peach and Toad are then shown taking a Launch Star up into space and reaching a water-based planet full of Bloopers. Mario and Luigi, however, are shown riding motorcycles in a desert area that looks like Tostarena from </span><i><span>Super Mario Odyssey,</span></i><span> which also looks like a </span><i><span>Mad Max </span></i><span>homage. We see the inverted pyramid that was a major landmark in </span><i><span>Odyssey</span></i><span>, which means there’s no mistaking that it is definitely the Sand Kingdom from the Switch game. So it seems like Mario and his friends might be splitting up for at least part of the movie.</span></p>

 <h2><b>There’s a surprising number of </b><b><i>Super Mario Sunshine </i></b><b>references</b></h2> <p><span>Well, maybe it’s not </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> surprising considering Bowser Jr. is the main villain this time, but </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </span></i><span>has some references to divisive GameCube platformer </span><i><span>Super Mario Sunshine</span></i><span>. We see Peach and Toad fighting a horde of Ninjis in what looks like a planet based on the Casino Delfino stage from </span><i><span>Sunshine</span></i><span>. Ninjis didn’t appear in </span><i><span>Sunshine </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Galaxy</span></i><span>, so it really just seems like the movie is pulling indiscriminately from all of </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>‘s</span> <span>history, rather than being a more direct adaptation of the Wii game.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643508"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643508">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Bowser Jr. is also pulling inspiration from multiple games</b></h2> <p><span>Benny Safdie’s Bowser Jr. is seemingly taking on the main villain role in this movie, and his design and abilities seem to be a mash-up of references from different games. His base design is the classic one we see him sport in most games, complete with the bandana he wears around his neck that has a drawing of vicious, razor-sharp teeth on the front. He also wields his magic paintbrush from </span><i><span>Sunshine </span></i><span>and other appearances, but instead of using it to transform into the Shadow Mario from his debut game, he changes into the corrupted form seen in </span><i><span>Super Mario Wonder, </span></i><span>complete with a new black and purple color scheme and glowing red eyes.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643448">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Rosalina is a boss</b></h2> <p><span>It wouldn’t be a </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy </span></i><span>movie without Rosalina. </span><i><span>Captain Marvel </span></i><span>star Brie Larson is voicing the cosmic princess for the film, and in the trailer, we see that her magical powers are a force to be reckoned with. She takes out Megaleg, one of the bosses from the Wii game, like it was nothing, and she serves the whole time. Everyone is kicking ass in this trailer, but Rosalina’s magic is on another level. Love her.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000642906" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642906"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642906">Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Yoshi is nowhere to be found</b></h2> <p><span>I guess Illumination and Nintendo don’t want to show their whole hand, but I don’t see even one reference to Yoshi in this trailer, despite the first movie teasing the dinosaur steed in its post-credits scene. There’s still plenty of time, though, as </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </span></i><span>is months away. The sequel is coming to theaters on April 3.</span></p>
