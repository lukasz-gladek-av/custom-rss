            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo randomly announced a ton of new content coming <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118">to <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> in a couple of months</a>. That includes new Nintendo crossover items you can purchase from Nook’s Cranny. These will apparently let you play some classic games like <em>Ice Climber</em>. It’s a neat nod to one of the coolest parts of the 2002 <em>Animal Crossing</em> on GameCube, except that this time around it’ll require a paid subscription to access. Boo!</p> <p>It was a neat surprise going about your business in <em>Animal Crossing</em> and randomly discovering a game like<em> Excitebike</em> for the NES. No, it wasn’t just for decoration. You could actually activate it and play Shigeru Miyamoto’s original 1984 racer <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjIICAUQABgWGB4yCAgGEAAYFhgeMgoIBxAAGAoYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB7SAQg1OTk2ajBqNKgCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">via a fully-functioning in-game NES emulator</a>. A bunch of other classics were available to collect as well. Some, like <em>Punch-Out!!!</em>, were only available through special codes. Others, like <em>Ice Climber</em>, required special e-reader cards.</p>

 <p>Imagine winning a random raffle or shaking a tree and being blessed with a free copy of the original <em>Donkey Kong.</em>&nbsp;Back in 2002 there was both the novelty of playing one game within another game and the appetite for older games that weren’t otherwise backwards compatible on modern hardware. Maybe your mom buried the NES up in the attic or sold it to help buy the SNES. Maybe <em>Balloon Fight</em> got lost when the kid down the street never gave it back.</p>

 <p>I booted up <em>Animal Crossing</em> so many times&nbsp;<em>just</em> to go back and play <em>Punch-Out!!</em>, which even at the time felt strangely nostalgic (and also a pain on the GameCube controller).</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We can see the playable Super NES and Super Famicom games will be F-Zero and Panel de Pon, respectively <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AnimalCrossing</a> <a href="https://t.co/mpmH0wQjsL">https://t.co/mpmH0wQjsL</a> <a href="https://t.co/vGBmTDbKcR">pic.twitter.com/vGBmTDbKcR</a></p> <p>— André (@AndreSegers) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreSegers/status/1983926022752874971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So it’s a rad idea to bring that feature back for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, but a huge bummer that these games will only work with Switch Online where…you’ve already been able to go and play them for years. It doesn’t even sound like the full suite of NES classics will be injected into <em>Animal Crossing</em> when its free update arrives on January 15.</p>

 <p>Nintendo stresses you’ll only be able to play a “select classic game on each system,” and for the purposes of the trailer at least, it only confirms Famicom, NES, and Game Boy furniture pieces. So you’ll have access to the handheld version of <em>Dr. Mario</em>, but no word on if something like <em>Super Metroid</em> will be available with a possible SNES your Villager can buy from the Nook kids (some eagle-eyed fans <a href="https://x.com/AndreSegers/status/1983926022752874971">have spotted <em>F-Zero</em></a> in one brief moment from the trailer).</p> <p>Why not just make these games free for people who own <em>New Horizons</em>? I have no idea. Got to protect the value proposition of titles that came out over three decades ago and which Nintendo has sold multiple times before across half a dozen different platforms, I guess. Here’s to whichever poor kid accidentally buys <em>Ice Climber</em> in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> next year and gets instructed to input their parents’ credit card information when they try to play it without a subscription.</p>

              <p>Activision has officially announced its plans to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. It will be written and directed by<em> Friday Night Lights</em> creator Peter Berg with some writing help from <em>Yellowstone’s</em> creator Taylor Sheridan. No release date was shared.</p> <p>On October 30, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/">following an initial report from <em>Deadline</em></a>, Paramount and Activision confirmed that after signing a deal in <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-2000622362">September to work together</a> on a future <em>Call of Duty</em> movie, the companies have settled on a director for the live-action war movie based on the popular first-person shooter franchise. Peter Berg is directing, writing, and producing the <em>Call of Duty</em> movie through his studio Film 47. Berg’s past work includes films like <i>Lone Survivor</i>,&nbsp;<i>Deepwater Horizon</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Patriots Day.&nbsp;</i>Taylor Sheridan is co-writing the movie and will help produce it. In recent years, Sheridan has become one of the biggest names in TV, creating shows like <em>Yellowstone</em>, <em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>, and <em>Tulsa King</em> for Paramount’s streaming platform.</p>

 <p>No plot details were shared in a press release announcing the<em> Call of Duty</em> movie’s director and writers, but Paramount did claim that the live-action film will be “designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences.” In other words, Paramount claims its new <em>Call of Duty</em> movie will be good and everyone will love it.</p> <p>Paramount likely sees Berg as a perfect fit for this project, as he has a history of making gritty action and war movies. And teaming him up with Sheridan makes sense as the two are friends in real life and have worked together before on movies like <em>Hell or High Water.&nbsp;</em>No casting announcements were made by Paramount, but considering Berg has used Mark Wahlberg in five different movies, it seems at least quite possible that the actor (who previously portrayed Max Payne) will be involved in the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. Well, assuming it gets made. Activision has been trying and failing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Films">a decade now to make a <em>CoD</em> movie</a>. But maybe this time…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last month, I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyperkin-x91-retro-controller-review-past-imperfect-1793539025">Hyperkin</a>‘s new Competitor controller. This wired gamepad is an officially licensed Xbox controller that is designed to look and feel like a PlayStation 5 controller. And it’s a great controller, but holy crap does it break my brain when I use it.</p> <p>Out now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-controller-ps5-hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-price-1851733419">Hyperkin’s new Competitor controller costs $50</a> and is a damn fine gamepad. It features super-smooth and responsive Hall Effect joysticks, so stick drift shouldn’t be a problem anytime soon, and it has Xbox-like Impulse Triggers that rumble as you’d expect. This wired controller is incredibly well built and feels great to use. Heck, it feels really good just to hold. It’s the kind of gamepad that makes you want to play something when you pick it up. Buttons are responsive, too, though I’m not a huge fan of the menu and view buttons. They’re too slim in profile and can be easy to miss when first using the controller and blindly sliding your thumbs around.</p>

 <p>The Competitor sports some extras that a standard Xbox gamepad lacks, like two back buttons located on the rear of the gamepad’s long, textured grips. These can be programmed in supporting games, letting you assign reload or jump or other actions to these extra inputs. The back buttons can also be locked so you don’t accidentally use them, a feature I appreciate as I don’t normally engage with back paddles.</p>

 <p>The big difference between this and most other Xbox controllers is that it’s built to feel like a PS5 DualSense. The sticks are symmetrical, the d-pad feels ripped right off a Dualsense, and even the shape is a close-to-perfect match for Sony’s controller. If you’re someone who is more comfortable using a PlayStation controller, but you also own an Xbox Series X/S, the Competitor is designed specifically for you.</p>

 <h2>Plays great, feels weird</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640206"><em>The Hyperkin Competitor (black and white) next to my PS5 gamepad (black) and my trippy-looking Xbox controller.</em> ©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Overall, this is a fantastic controller that worked perfectly on my PC as well as my Xbox Series X. But actually using this controller to play games broke my brain. I didn’t realize until I started playing around with the Competitor how hardwired my brain is when it comes to controllers.</p>

 <p>Holding this thing, my brain wants to treat it like a PlayStation controller, yet the Xbox button prompts don’t match up with what my brain <em>thinks</em> I’m holding. I’d go to press the DualSense’s touchpad to open a menu and find nothing but barren plastic. It was like rubbing my stomach while tapping my head with a different hand. I could use the Competitor, but only if I thought about it, and even then, I’d make mistakes.</p> <p>I imagine for folks who prefer PlayStation controllers, this won’t be a problem. They’ll plug this into their Xbox and never look back. But as someone who hops between Xbox and PlayStation a lot, this controller really screwed with me. That’s not the controller’s fault. That’s my brain being weird. For most people, this won’t be a problem. And for $50, the Competitor is a solid, well-made Xbox or PC controller that will likely last you years if you take care of it.</p>
