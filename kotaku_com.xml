It began with a giant orb (The Traveler) hovering over the last city on earth in a post-apocalyptic near future. The main thing you do in the sci-fi MMO is shoot enemies to get loot, which they leave behind in various colored orbs. Most raids involved at least one orb-based mechanic. And now <em>Destiny 2 </em>has taken the orb to its natural conclusion: transforming players into one. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196790" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="196790,195326,196805" data-current="196790"><div><p>Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22347.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-menu-music-d1-bungie-1851786347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-menu-music-d1-bungie-1851786347">The newest expansion, <em>The Edge of Fate</em></a></span>, has a new mechanic called Matterspark that makes players become balls of light that roll around like little glowing Samus Arans to navigate secret tube passageways. It is without a doubt the worst thing Destiny has ever forced me to do. </p><p>That’s not hyperbole, nor is intended as a slight against the very thoughtful developers at Bungie. I simply do not like taking a break from what <em>Destiny 2</em> does very well—shooting—to do something it does very poorly—platforming as a third-person orb. It feels floaty, sluggish, and a bit chaotic, like trying to navigate a marble through a wooden labyrinth using a magnetic tether. The effect is mildly dizzying. It’s especially bad on PC. </p><p>It doesn’t help that Matterspark is one of the very first things <em>The Edge of Fate</em> campaign introduces you to. In addition to transforming into slithering sphere to reach new areas, there are also generators you can only power when you’re an electric ball, forcing you to constantly shift between forms to bring down barriers and progress the mission. </p><p>My friend came over last night for dinner. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927?_gl=1*v4obb9*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI2NzYwMjAkbzc3MiRnMSR0MTc1MjY3NjA4MCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927?_gl=1*v4obb9*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI2NzYwMjAkbzc3MiRnMSR0MTc1MjY3NjA4MCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">He’s one of the people I keep trying to convince to play <em>Destiny 2</em> with me</a></span>. He saw me puttering around combat like a golf ball stuck in a sand trap and howled with laughter. There is absolutely no way I’m convincing him to buy <em>The Edge of Fate</em> now. </p><p>I was skeptical of Matterspark, since Bungie originally revealed it in a livestream in May. Turning into a ball and reaching secret places in the <em>Metroid </em>franchise is cool because those games are specifically designed around exploration, backtracking, and experimentation.<em> Destiny 2</em> is not. It’s a game about loading into a sci-fi obstacle course and ruthlessly murdering everything in sight as quickly as possible. </p><p>It’s certainly played with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-taken-king-kicks-ass-so-far-1731000770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-taken-king-kicks-ass-so-far-1731000770">more open-ended exploration over the years</a></span>, both in terms of platforming and in terms of shooting puzzles that unlock hidden secrets. Turning into an orb, unfortunately, doesn’t play to either of those strengths. It makes platforming feel worse and disables my guns. In that way, Matterspark is part of a worrying trend in modern <em>Destiny</em>, one that pursues novelty at the risk of sidelining the reason I actually want to play the game: the best-feeling shooting of any FPS ever. </p><p><em>The Edge of Fate</em> makes a pretty poor first-impression in general. My <em>Destiny 2</em> hype train currently has a full head of steam, but it’s already threatening to be derailed. I don’t like Kepler yet, the new zone which is sparrow-less and feels overly constricted while at the same time lacking a clear vibe to spark the imagination. It’s a lot of rocks with alien pustules growing on them. I don’t like the new streamlined Ops menu that feels like a <em>Call of Duty </em>HQ funnel, or that the more creative planet map it replaces has been desaturated to signal its forced obsolescence. </p><p>It’s nice—a relief even!—seeing gear scores reset to 10 as we begin the power climb anew, but I would prefer to skip over the blues (rare loot) and get right to the good stuff again (purple legendries/exotics). The new gear chase and upcoming raid might be <em>The Edge of Fate</em>’s saving grace. A completely new system means chasing new weapons and armor in order to take advantage of the most powerful builds. The grind could be fun. It could also be incredible tedious. But I’ll take that over being subjected to another Matterspark objective. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em>’s opening scene is perhaps its strongest. In a flashback sequence set in an experimental dinosaur breeding facility, a carelessly discarded Snickers wrapper gets sucked into a pressure-sealed door, allowing the film’s mutated Distortus Rex to escape its containment, which is technically the genesis of much of the direct horror that follows during the film’s runtime. As I sat in the theater, I could hear the original film’s Dr. Ian Malcom explaining it, while also probably hitting on me, how this is a perfect example of “unpredictability in complex systems, [...] the butterfly effect.”</p><p>That it was a Snickers wrapper in particular is also notable: An artificial waste product from an artificial food item artificially designed through science to satiate our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/WnM-S-apI3E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/WnM-S-apI3E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural need: “hunger</a></span>,” as the advertisements always tell us. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196046,196452" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757"><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> Is Half A Good Movie, And Half A Bad Video Game Quest</a></span></p><p><em>Rebirth</em>, for much of its runtime, remains in metaphor.

I agree with <em>Kotaku</em>’s Zack Zwiezen in his review that the film is rather clumsy in weaving these two narrative threads together. But interestingly, I’ve found the mercenary side of the story to be more meaningful than my colleague did, and I think it’s key to understanding what’s going on in its ending, which many have found a little hollow by the time the credits hit the screen. Does <em>Rebirth</em> nail what I think it’s trying to do with the mercs? Maybe! But what it’s exploring is rather opposed to the kind of visual, action-heavy spectacle we would expect of an action movie.</p><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This all started to click for me when recalling one particular scene. Early on, when the mercs first encounter the family and find themselves under threat from friggin’ water dinosaurs,  Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali) snaps into action to do whatever he can to save the lives of the children they just rescued. There’s an element of panic here—chaos—which Duncan’s comrade Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson) swiftly addresses by reminding Duncan that he’s not actually emotionally responding to the situation in front of him. Rather, he’s responding to the death of his own child, which we learn about earlier on without much detail. We don’t know much of anything about this event aside from it being a clearly painful life chapter, which Duncan and his off-screen estranged lover have chosen to try and bury in silence, to just abandon like the scientists fleeing the escaped D-Rex in the film’s opening. </p><p>Zora herself is burdened by the horrors of the past: We learn she lost someone in a brutal act of violence, leading to a slow, painful death—a traumatic event she’s scarred from having witnessed, it seems, though she never confirms this, and the audience is never shown the act. There’s also her mother, who is said to have died of heart disease, the very thing the characters are trying to cure by securing valuable biological material from dinosaurs. But she rarely, if ever, dwells on them. Neither she nor Duncan get flashbacks to their trauma flashpoint. We hear about it on the margins, lines of dialogue quickly said and discarded to focus on the mission, silent moments of quiet crying when the horrors of the past, mutated into PTSD, have returned to ensnare unclaimed victims.</p><figure id="" data-id="e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-recommend-id="image://e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-recommend-id="image://e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s something admirable about Zora’s demand for Duncan to leave the past alone. It’s clear she’s telling the truth: Panicking over past failures is not helpful when you’re in a boat surrounded by carnivorous dinosaurs. I doubt I’ll ever be in a similar situation. (At least I hope not.) But also, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t tuck that line of hers about emotionally responding to a past event inappropriately in my back pocket for the next time I find myself in some bitter argument that’s really about something wildly different than either party is willing to admit.</p><p>But <em>Rebirth</em> isn’t here to tell you a story about the wisdom of bottling up your emotions. Quite the opposite. Duncan gets his opportunity to face that fear and guilt of losing a child vicariously through saving Isabella (Audrina Miranda) by staring down the D-Rex and leading it away from everyone else, to what, for a moment, appears to be his own death. </p><p>What <em>Rebirth</em> promises, however, is that directly facing one’s fears isn’t a death sentence. It also makes clear, for the mercs, that the monsters living in our memories are as capable of ensnaring us as the most clever of raptor girls. But <em>Rebirth</em> offers a promise to the emotionally beleaguered mercs: You aren’t guaranteed to be devoured by the mutated horrors of the past if you face them. Bucking the trope of the lone man who faces his fears to his own death, much like <em>Star Wars</em>’ <em>The Last Jedi</em>, Duncan doesn’t become the man who must sacrifice himself to save everyone else. At the same time, his surprise survival also doesn’t indicate that everything’s good now that he stared down a monster; in the final scene of the film, he’s clearly shaken from the events. Three people he and Zora knew were viciously slaughtered in front of them. But the two protagonists are still alive. Survival, as the film reminds us, isn’t guaranteed, but it was still attained by these characters.</p><p>This, in my opinion, is what’s leaving some viewers with a sense of hollowness by the film’s ending. A subtle, metaphorically delivered shift in the psyche of the characters isn’t always told through an action film. And to be honest, <em>Rebirth</em> often appears to be actively trying <em>not</em> to be an action film, at least not for the mercenaries (I’d argue the family portrayed in the film’s other plot thread contains more direct action). The mercs’ battle is internal. We see only two scenes where they fire lethal weapons at dinosaurs. There’s no epic dinosaur fight at the end. D-Rex is left on the island to its own devices, with the characters having gone through more of an internal shift in their emotions and personal values as they return to civilization. </p><p>The mercenary plotline in <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> is a subtle one of internal, emotive transformation and growth. It’s a stark pivot from CGI dinosaurs slamming each other into buildings. It doesn’t always land, but I think if you’re willing to let Zora and Duncan’s arc sit with you a bit more, you might find <em>Rebirth</em> to be a compelling story of human vulnerability, even when the focus isn’t monstrous teeth shredding soft flesh.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-scarlett-johansson-mahershala-al-1851786416]]></content:encoded>

Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. </p><p>Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. </p><p>The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.</p></blockquote><p>It’s been a long wait for season five, with the show’s fourth season airing nearly three years ago, back in 2022. Wild. Modern TV, while it looks amazing and is arguably better than any previous era of television, is very annoying. TV shows shouldn’t have three-year gaps between seasons! </p><p>Anyway, I’m excited for this new season. I’ve loved each season of <em>Stranger Things</em> more than the last, and this new trailer has me pumped for one last big adventure with the gang. I hope Steve makes it out alive. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-stranger-things-se-1819987356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-stranger-things-se-1819987356"><em>Stranger Things</em></a></span> season 5 will be split up into three releases.

They both offer abundant space and the ideal climates for crop growth.</p><p>In Autumn Village, the sprawling development zone just down the hill from the shrine is large enough for a few shops, houses, and rows upon rows of crops. In Spring Village, there are multiple development zones, two of which are quite large, with enough room for tilled fields in all three.</p><p><strong>When planting crops, prioritize those with the highest return in the least amount of time.</strong> Anything over 30 gold per crop is a sound strategy, so long as they don’t take too long to mature.
