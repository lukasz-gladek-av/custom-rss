              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-movie-remake-theater-release-january-2026-1851784778"><em>Return to Silent Hill,</em></a> a live-action film adaptation of Konami’s beloved <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, hits theaters later this week. Early reviews for the horror flick are as scary as any monster from the games.</p> <p>First announced in 2022, <a href="https://kotaku.com/return-to-silent-hill-pyramid-head-first-look-1851482793"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> releases on January 23. It isn’t connected to the past two <em>Silent Hill</em> movies, even though it was directed by the first film’s Christophe Gans, and is instead a loose adaptation of the PS2-era survival horror classic<em> Silent Hill 2.</em> Marketing for this film has been minimal to say the least, partially because it seems the executives involved realized it wasn’t great back when it wrapped filming in 2023, and the movie is only seeing the light of day after that recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake did so well. But after the delay and the lack of marketing, perhaps this is a very good horror film? Nope. Doesn’t seem like it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661969" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661969"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661969">©Rotten Tomatoes / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">As of January 21, there are 15 reviews for <em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> on critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. And the new movie has an abysmal seven percent Tomatometer score. For those not familiar with Rotten Tomatoes, that ain’t a great score. In fact, if this seven percent score holds, <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/worst-movies-of-all-time/"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will go down as one of the worst-reviewed movies ever</a>. Yikes.</p>

 <p>The general consensus from critics is that while parts of <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> look great, the film is a boring, sloppy, confusing, and (perhaps worst of all for the genre) not-very-scary movie about a main character that is hard to relate to and who seems more confused than terrified.</p>  <p>“This powerful survival horror story has been turned into an ugly, laughable adaptation that proves that maybe we should’ve never gone back to Silent Hill,” said Ross Bonaime over at <em>Collider</em>.</p>

 <p>“Christophe Gans’s film does away with all the psychosexual nuance of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>,” claims Justin Clark at <em>Slant Magazine.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I found the experience difficult to sit through and nonsensical from moment to moment, with its confounding story and shoddy CGI matched only by its lack of entertainment value,” said critic Brian Eggert.</p>

 <p>At the moment, there is only one non-rotten score, from Dominic Baez at the <em>Seattle Times</em>, and it doesn’t read like a loving endorsement of the movie. Instead, it seems like Baez found most of the movie bad, but enjoyed the ending. The end credits are apparently very “stylish.” When critics are praising your credits and not much else, that’s a bad sign.</p>

              <p>Christopher Judge comments <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584">on his fellow Kratos</a>. A new Kickstarter will transform your Switch 2 dock into an old-school GameCube. And two people who worked on <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> argue about what’s to blame for modern VFX looking dull and lifeless. It’s a very late edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>Who’s ready for more bad news for PC gaming? Samsung and SK Hynix are <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109799/ssd-prices-may-follow-ram-pricing-after-samsung-and-sk-hynix-reportedly-cut-nand-production/index.html">reportedly</a> dropping NAND production to focus on DRAM. That could mean even more expensive SSDs. Bad timing for me to replace the PC I built back in 2015 with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960.</p>

So kudos, you’ve got a great live-action Kratos.” The TV series <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/max-parker-cast-god-of-war-heimdall-1236691740/">also revealed</a> that Max Parker will play the Watchman of Asgard, Heimdall.</p> <h2>Chris Pratt promises the <em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie still has more characters to reveal</h2> <p>“I’m not allowed to say what they are, but yes, there are some really incredible…Well, I think some of them have been released in the trailer–Rosalina, Bowser Jr.–and then there’s even a couple more that are not in the trailer that people should be excited to see,” the star of <em>Mercy</em> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-rosalina-and-bowser-jr-s-appearances-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-chris-pratt-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-people-should-be-excited/">told</a> <em>Gamesradar</em>.

 <h2>The maker of <em>Payday 3</em> is laying off developers</h2> <p>Multiple staffers at Starbreeze Studios have been let go, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/layoffs-hit-payday-3-developer-starbreeze/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>. “Today, many of us at Starbreeze, Stockholm, got sad news and I’m now seeking a new role and would appreciate your support,” wrote one of them on LinkedIn. “After over 7 years, the longest I’ve ever been at any company in any industry, my time has (more than likely) come.”</p>

 <h2>No online multiplayer for <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h2> <p>Following in the footsteps of all the previous Lego games, the new<em> Lego Batman</em> won’t have online co-op. “Fans of all generations will be able to enjoy the game solo or team up with a friend or family member through two-player local couch cooperative gameplay only,” <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/faq/">reads the FAQ</a> (via <a href="https://primagames.com/featured/lego-batmans-new-game-once-again-skips-online-co-op">Prima Games</a>).</p> <h2>Turn your Switch 2 into a GameCube</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battle Dock coming soon! <a href="https://t.co/hRdu7zI6IV">pic.twitter.com/hRdu7zI6IV</a></p> <p>— Retro Fighters (@retrofightersco) <a href="https://twitter.com/retrofightersco/status/2013382477923111083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A new dock <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247448559/battledock-for-switch-2">on Kickstarter</a> promises to do exactly that. It’s going for $40 with a January ship date and attaches directly to your existing Switch 2 dock. It comes in various old-school GameCube colors like silver, indigo, and orange, and has connectors for up to four of the retro console’s controllers. Perfect for when Switch Online adds <em>Mario Kart Double Dash</em> and <em>Smash Bros. Melee, </em>if ever.</p>

 <h2><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</em> gets a free demo</h2> <p>It’s out today on PC and console, including Switch 2, and lets players experience a bit of the Ryukyu district in Okinawa as Kiryu and the series’ familiar Kamurocho setting in Tokyo as Mine. The full remaster and all-new side story releases on all platforms on February 12.</p> <h2>Dueling <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> VFX takes</h2> <p>Director Gore Verbinksi talked to <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/11/gore-verbinski-good-luck-have-fun-dont-die/"><em>But Why Tho</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/greatest-slip-backwards-pirates-of-the-caribbean-director-says-unreal-engine-makes-films-look-too-much-like-games/"><em>VGC</em></a>) about the state of VFX. “So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects,” he said. “So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema.” He added, “I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards.”</p> <p>Epic Games VFX supervisor Pat Tubach, who said he also worked on the <em>Pirates</em> movies, fired back. “It’s inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI,” Tubach said in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/epic-games-vfx-head-says-pirates-of-the-caribbean-artists-would-have-loved-using-ue-and-i-should-know-i-was-one-of-them/">statement to <em>VGC</em></a>. “Unreal Engine is primarily used for pre-visualization, virtual production, and in some cases final pixels. I can guarantee that the artists working on big blockbuster VFX films like <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> 10-15 years ago could only dream about having a tool as powerful as Unreal Engine on their desks to help them get the job done. And I should know–I was one of them.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-backlog-pulse-music-ps5-xbox-2000661365">Stop doomscrolling and go play <em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">One analysis firm predicts the Switch 2 is about to go up in price</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-reunion-chloe-announcement-release-date-2000661323">The new <em>Life Is Strange</em> is coming sooner than expected with some unexpected story choices</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">Despite the performance issues, annoying jokes, and bugs</a>, I’m still playing and enjoying <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>. I’m currently working on my second full playthrough with my wife, who is also a big <em>Borderlands</em> fan, and we’re having a great time. Mostly. Everything is going fine right up until we encounter another damn loot capsule. These things are the worst part of the game and are so bad that they truly baffle me.</p> <p>As you explore the open world of<a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-steam-reviews-gearbox-randy-pitchford-2000634014"><em> Borderlands 4,</em></a> you’ll find side activities and quests to complete. Some of these are elaborate, but other stuff is as simple as killing a specific target or activating a safehouse. One of these supposedly simple and fun little side activities involves Loot Capsules. These are small pods that you can stumble upon and then have to carry back to the nearest safehouse to unlock. Doing so opens the capsule, and you get some loot. Sounds fine, right? Wrong!</p>

 <p>In <em>Borderlands 4,</em> Gearbox created a new mechanic that lets you pick up objects while fighting. This is used in various ways in the looter shooter, and most of the time, it is a nice way to spice up a combat encounter or make solving a puzzle just a bit more interesting. But when you hold something in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, you can’t mantle or climb up a ladder, drive your hover bike, aim down your sights, throw grenades, or fast travel with that object. It greatly limits your toolbox, and that’s fine when it’s used sparingly as a momentary wrinkle you have to contend with.</p> <p>Yet that isn’t the case with Loot Capsules, which sometimes require you to walk a very long distance back to the “closest” HQ to get your reward. And you have to walk it. You can’t use your cool bike. You just run back on foot, unable to take most shortcuts because you can’t even use your sick grapple hook when holding an item. It is so fucking tedious. If you get attacked by enemies and have to fight your way out, you’d better hope that nothing happens that dislodges that capsule from your hand, or you could be searching around desperately for it in a moment. Has this happened to me? Yes, why do you think I’m writing this blog? And when you finally get to your HQ, you might have to solve some platforming puzzle that even involves tossing the damn loot pod across gaps. If it lands in an area you can’t enter, like a bottomless gorge that kills you, then it respawns back where you found it. Congratulations, you get to do it all over again.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Gearbox | <em>Go to hell, Claptrap</em></figcaption></figure> <p>Oh, and every time you pick it up, Claptrap starts talking. Every. Single. Time. Sometimes, he’ll talk over himself. And there are only so many lines. And they go on and on. I don’t even hate <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/borderlands-claptraps-new-robot-revolution">Claptrap</a> like a lot of people do, but I quickly reached my breaking point after just a few capsules.</p>

 <p>These damn capsules annoy me so much, and I deal with them so often that I’ve started to overthink how they even work. In a sci-fi universe that lets me digitize dozens of guns and store them on my person easily, why the fuck can’t I just store the capsule, too? Why must I lug it back? Why can’t I collect it like all the various shields, guns, and other loot I stuff into my digital trousers with no issue? Who thought this was fun? I’d love to chat with them because I’m genuinely curious how this was left in the game. Truly, it baffles me.</p> <p>Here’s the funniest part about all of this: I’d be fine with the bullshit and the capsules if the reward was worth it. In my experience, this is never the case. I’ve opened close to two dozen of these things or more while playing alone and with friends. I’ve never gotten a single legendary weapon. Never. It’s usually the same crappy loot you often find in random chests, which don’t require a tenth of the effort to open. I’ve talked to friends about it and they’ve reported the same thing: Worthless loot that you trash the second you see it.</p>

 <p>At this point, I’ve started to ignore them when playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> alone. And when I do pick one up, I just gnash my teeth the whole time as I hear the same damn Claptrap line again. At least I enjoy the rest of the game. Mostly.</p>
