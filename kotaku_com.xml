Bleh. </p><p>The latest entry in the long-running golfing series was announced a few weeks back at Sony’s most recent PlayStation State of Play and is coming to PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 4 with a mix of single-player and multiplayer modes.

She also finds a quirky yet brilliant sidekick to sheepishly help her optimize her Ironheart suit, with an interesting twist. After meeting McGillicuddy (Alden Ehrenreich) and visiting his shady bunker full of black market weapons, Riri gets him to confess that his name is actually Ezekiel Stane.

In the show, Ezekiel says he is 36 years old, which would make him roughly 17 when his father was killed by Iron Man. That’s still young enough for him to have developed the sort of trauma that’ll turn someone into the type to hoard weapons of mass destruction as a “hobby.”</p><p>Interestingly enough, Ezekiel tells Riri that he and his father weren’t close (hence the Ziploc bag urn) and references his father’s nefarious Iron Monger alter ego. However, in <em>Iron Man</em>, it’s never publicly revealed that Obadiah was the Iron Monger, which could suggest Ezekiel either had intimate knowledge of his father’s crimes from being involved, or that he was told about them later in life. Either way, <em>Ironheart </em>adds a cool expansion to the MCU history books—without making that the central appeal of an already great show. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ironheart-iron-man-obidiah-stane-ezekiel-stane-disney-1851785091]]></content:encoded>

This game can feel a bit obtuse at times, but there are certain items you’ll definitely want to sell, while other materials just don’t necessitate hoarding. </p><h2 id="h20982"><a id="1"></a>What items are safe to sell?</h2><figure id="" data-id="7b5fd2ce08a7b68f8201c41c1a14f7bd" data-recommend-id="image://7b5fd2ce08a7b68f8201c41c1a14f7bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The View/Sell Items menu, highlighting the Sell All Trade-in Materials option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The View/Sell Items menu, highlighting the Sell All Trade-in Materials option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b5fd2ce08a7b68f8201c41c1a14f7bd" data-recommend-id="image://7b5fd2ce08a7b68f8201c41c1a14f7bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The View/Sell Items menu, highlighting the Sell All Trade-in Materials option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not unlike other RPGs or other genres with an ungodly amount of materials and ingredients, <em>Wilds</em> isn’t short on things you can trade for money. <strong>Items marked as Trade-in Materials are specifically meant to be sold and nothing else.</strong> Here is a list of every Trade-in Material, how to get them, and how much Zenny they can net you:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Krano Copper:</strong> Found by hunting low-rank Kranodath. Worth 500z</li><li><strong>Krano Pyrite:</strong> Found by hunting high-rank Kranodath. Worth 1500z</li><li><strong>Gilded Scale:</strong> Reward for fishing a Goldenfry. Worth 500z</li><li><strong>Golden Scale:</strong> Reward for fishing a Goldenfish. Worth 1000z</li><li><strong>Platinum Scale:</strong> Reward for fishing a Platinumfish. Worth 2000z</li><li><strong>Steel Egg:</strong> Purchase from the Support Ship or acquire through Nest Trinkets. Worth 1000z</li><li><strong>Silver Egg:</strong> Purchase from the Support Ship or acquire through Nest Trinkets. Worth 10000z</li><li><strong>Golden Egg:</strong> Purchase from the Support Ship or acquire through Nest Trinkets. Worth 20000z</li></ul><p>Since their only purpose is to be sold, you’ll only see these items in the Sell Items menu that’s accessible through merchants or your camp. Trade-in Materials are categorized under the Special Items/Other tab. <strong>If you want to sell all your junk fast, press Triangle/Y to bring up the sub-menu, and then select <em>Sell All Trade-in Materials</em></strong>.</p><h2 id="h20983"><a id="2"></a>What else can be sold?</h2><p>It’s unlikely that you’ll run out of Zenny. Just completing hunts can provide more than you need. If they don’t, selling Trade-In Materials will yield a hell of a boost in funds. All that being said, you do have the choice to sell other things. Everything from ores and ingredients to weapons and armor can be traded for Zenny.</p><p>While there are certainly a lot of options, <strong>I would prioritize selling any low-rank armor you made and ingredients that you have a ridiculous amount of</strong>. Weapons can always be upgraded to higher rarities. Special items and materials you forage can be given to Item Traders for other rare assets. Even monster parts can be used to smelt ores if you don’t have any applicable weapons or armors to forge. Remember not to sell everything just because you can–plenty of stuff has other uses with the many mechanics of this game!</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zenny-trade-in-material-1851785064]]></content:encoded>
