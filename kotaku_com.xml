              <p>As we come barreling toward the end of the year, you can still find all sorts of great tech deals. Lots of good stuff has been marked down for holiday shopping, but there is no rule against using these hefty discounts to secure a nice new gift for yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6540/">If you’re been in the marker for a new computer, you can upgrade to the Apple iMac right now while saving yourself 12%.</a> That may not sound like a ton, but it actually cuts the price down by $150.

<p>This 2024 Apple iMac all-in-one desktop computer is powered by the M4 chip. This chip is one of Apple’s most powerful yet. The M5 just came out, but this one is still remarkably reliable. It’s built for Apple Intelligence and will keep your system running smoothly whether you are editing photos, building out decks, gaming, or bouncing between a million and one browser tabs.</p>

              <p>If there’s one thing that can transform how your home feels without dropping hundreds on new furniture, it’s the lighting you choose. These <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/">Govee smart bulbs now cost just $17 for a two-pack on Amazon, down from the usual $25, and you can stack an extra 10% off with the promo code IZVCRPT14KV7</a> to hit a record low price that makes upgrading your entire house ridiculously affordable.</p>
<p>You get <strong>1000 lumens of brightness per bulb</strong> (equivalent to old 75W incandescents), <strong>access to 16 million colors</strong>, <strong>tunable white light</strong> from warm 2700K to cool 6500K, <strong>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity</strong>, and full <strong>voice control through Alexa or Google Assistant</strong>. These bulbs create different atmospheres for different moods without you touching a dimmer switch. Order today and Amazon delivers them before Christmas.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1000 Lumens Really Lights Up Big Rooms</h2>
<p>That 1000-lumen output is a lot more important than it sounds like it would be: Cheap smart bulbs usually only go up to 600–800 lumens which means that even at full brightness, they don’t light up big rooms very well. You can make them brighter when you need task lighting or dim them down across the full 1–100% range for ambiance. The CRI90+ color rendering index makes colors look real and true instead of washed out like they do under cheap LEDs.</p>



<p>You can <strong>choose from 16 million colors</strong> so you can get the exact shade you want instead of going through a few presets that never quite match what you had in mind. You can make your living room glow purple while your kitchen stays warm white, or you can set all the bulbs to the same energizing blue-white for morning routines. The <strong>tunable white range goes from 2700K to 6500K</strong> which is the range of colors that goes from the warmth of candlelight to the brightness of office daylight.</p>



<p>The <strong>Govee Home app gives you access to 54 scene modes</strong> that handle the color programming for you if you don’t want to manually adjust settings. <strong>Music sync mode makes the bulbs change colors </strong>when your phone’s microphone picks up sound, turning any playlist into a light show that pulses with the beat. Sunrise and sunset timers gradually brighten or dim the lights to wake you naturally or ease you into evening, and you can schedule these automations to match your actual daily routine instead of fumbling for switches half-asleep.</p>
<p>You can control these bulbs from anywhere using the app, even when you’re not home, which lets you turn the lights on before you get there or check to see if you left something on after you left. You can change the brightness, colors, or turn lights on and off with your voice using Alexa or Google Assistant. This feels like the future at first, but then it quickly becomes the only way you want to interact with lights. The dual connectivity also acts as a backup;<strong> if your Wi-Fi goes down, you can still use Bluetooth to control things locally</strong>.</p>
<p>The bulbs fit in <strong>standard A19 sockets</strong> and work with any lamp or fixture that takes regular screw-in bulbs and makes installation as easy as changing old bulbs. Most routers send out 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signals, which these devices can connect to. These 9-watt bulbs use a lot less electricity than old 75-watt incandescent bulbs, but they still give off the same amount of light.</p>
<p>The $17 price for two bulbs becomes even better when you apply that 10% promo code, and brings your <strong>effective cost down to around $7.65 per bulb.</strong> That’s cheaper than many dumb LED bulbs that just turn on and off, except these give you millions of colors, remote control, voice commands, scheduling, and music sync capabilities.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro M5 With Max Config Drops Record Low, Amazon Drops Margin While Official Site Stays Full Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-pro-m5-with-max-config-drops-record-low-amazon-drops-margin-while-official-site-stays-full-price-2000655017</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with these M5 MacBook Pro models a few weeks ago and they’re still full price on Apple’s website, but <strong>Amazon decided to spread some holiday cheer by lowering the prices on all models to all-time lows</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">24GB/1TB model now costs $1,799 instead of $1,999</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">the 16GB/512GB model now costs $1,349 instead of $1,599</a>. This means that these M5 machines are actually cheaper than the M4 generation was when it first came out. You get here Apple’s new M5 chip, a stunning 14.2-inch Liquid display that can reach 1600 nits of brightness and a battery lasts all day. The<strong> 24GB model will be shipped before Christmas</strong>, and the 16GB model will be sent by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful M5 Chip</h2>
<p>The M5 processor doesn’t just make the M4 better but it also changes the way a laptop handles heavy workloads. Each GPU core now has a Neural Accelerator that speeds up AI tasks by a lot which means you can handle machine learning workloads and Apple Intelligence features at speeds that would have needed a desktop workstation just a few years ago. The 10-core CPU can easily handle everything from video editing to compiling software and the unified memory architecture means that your RAM talks directly to the processor, so there are no bottlenecks like those that happen with regular laptop designs.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence runs completely on your device so your private information never leaves your MacBook to be processed on a cloud server. The system helps you write better, make your ideas clearer, and do repetitive tasks automatically without sending your data to Apple or anyone else. This <strong>privacy-first approach is much more important than most people think </strong>and it lets you use AI features without worrying that your emails, documents, or creative work will end up in a training dataset.</p>



<p>The <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display has a peak brightness of 1600 nits</strong> for HDR content and a steady brightness of 1000 nits for regular use. The 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio makes blacks look really black instead of that grayish tone you see on cheaper laptop screens. The colors are also very accurate, making this a good choice for professional photo and video work.</p>
<p>The promise of a battery life that lasts all day isn’t just a marketing gimmick: This laptop works the same whether it’s plugged in or running on battery power. Most Windows laptops slow down when you unplug them to save power, but the M5’s efficiency lets you render video, compile code, or run resource-intensive creative apps at full speed for hours without needing to find an outlet. You can really take this to a coffee shop and work all day without bringing the charger.</p>



<p>The ability to <strong>work with other Apple devices makes the whole ecosystem better</strong> than any one product could do on its own: You can control your iPhone from your Mac’s screen with iPhone Mirroring which means you can reply to texts or use apps that only work on iPhones without having to pick up your phone. You can copy something on your iPhone and paste it straight into a document on your Mac. You can also start a FaceTime call on your laptop and then switch to your phone when you need to move around.</p>
<p>The 24GB/1TB model costs $1,799, and the 16GB/512GB model costs $1,349 and that’s<strong> less than what the M4 generation cost when it first came out</strong>.</p>
