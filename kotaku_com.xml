What’s so peculiar here, other than the paltry damages sought, is that all three patents cited by Nintendo’s lawyers in the lawsuit, as revealed by Pocketpair, were registered between May and August of <em>this year</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tag/palworld&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tag/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a></span> came out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580">to rather enormous attention</a></span>, in January. So what’s going on?</p><p>“The Plaintiffs,” says Pocketpair, “claim that ‘<em>Palworld</em>,’ released by us on January 19, 2024, infringes upon the following three patents held by the Plaintiffs, and are seeking an injunction against the game and compensation for a portion of the damages incurred between the date of registration of the patents and the date of filing of this lawsuit.”</p><p>They then list them as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Patent No. 7545191</strong></p><p>[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]</p><p>[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]</p><p><strong>Patent No. 7493117</strong></p><p>[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]</p><p>[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]</p><p><strong>Patent No. 7528390</strong></p><p>[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]</p><p>[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</p></blockquote><p>Looking up those patents, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first</a></span> alludes to a system where a player aims and fires an “item” toward a character in a field, and in doing so triggers combat, and then dives into extraordinary intricacies about switching between modes within this. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The second</a></span> is very similar, but seems more directly focused on tweaking previous patents to including being able to capture Pokémon in the wild, rather than only during battle. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en?oq=7528390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en?oq=7528390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The third</a></span>, rather wildly, seems to be trying to claim a modification to the invention of riding creatures in an open world and being able to transition between them easily.</p><p>All three patents are successful requests to modify previously established patents, each noticeably designed to match the newer features in more recent <em>Pokémon </em>games.
