              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-1-reloaded-remaster-ps5-xbox-pc-summer-1851779167"><em>Gears of War</em> is making the leap to PlayStation 5 later this month</a> in what is one of the biggest signs that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars are over</a>. And while I find the idea of playing <em>Gears</em> on a PlayStation controller strange, franchise creator Cliff “CliffyB” Bleszinski is “thrilled” that something he worked so hard on will soon be available to more players.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-creator-cliff-bleszinski-thrilled-about-seeing-his-once-xbox-exclusive-on-playstation">In a new interview with <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Bleszinski was asked about the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-save-progression-ps5-xbox-2000618072"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>, which is a remaster of the original game’s <em>last</em> remaster. This new version with enhanced visuals and improved performance is launching on both Xbox and, for the first time in franchise history, PlayStation via a PS5 port. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-ps5-remake-remaster-halo-forza-port-1851779186">But while some fans find it all a bit bizarre</a> to chainsaw monsters with the DualSense’s circle button instead of the Xbox gamepad’s B, the original <em>Gears</em> trilogy’s director doesn’t feel the same.</p> <p>“It doesn’t feel strange,” Bleszinski explained to <em>Eurogamer</em> when asked if he finds the PS5 port weird. “I’m thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on.”</p>

And since then, even after Microsoft bought the franchise in 2014 and started making its own third-person cover shooters, fans have continued to ask Bleszinski if he’d ever return to help make another<em> Gears of War</em> game. According to him, he’s asked “nearly every day on social media” about returning.</p> <p>“And I’m like ‘uh, I’ve said it a thousand times, I’m open to consult on any of it’,” said Bleszinski. But it seems Xbox isn’t interested in bringing him back to consult on a future game in the series, with the <em>Gears</em> creator adding, “Crickets. On to the next!” There is some irony in Xbox ignoring Cliff Bleszinski in 2025, despite <a href="https://youtu.be/AXO1mpgc-is">making “CliffyB” the rockstar face of the Xbox 360 </a>at the height of the console war between Microsoft’s device and the PS3 back in 2005, and positioning Epic’s then-upcoming game, <em>Gears of War,</em> as the 360’s killer app. Now they won’t even call him to get his input on the franchise.</p> <p><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on August 26. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gears-of-war-reloaded-game-pass-2000618432">It will be available on day one with Game Pass</a> and will be free to anyone who already owns <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, aka Xbox’s previous remaster of the game.</p>

              <p><em>Game of Thrones</em> author George R.R. Martin recently appeared on a panel at Seattle WorldCon 2025 entitled The Shifting Landscape of Epic Fantasy, alongside Brandon Sanderson, Robin Hobb, Rebecca Roanhorse and Ryan Cahill. However, during the question-and-answer portion at the end of the session, one member of the audience got up in front of the all-star panel to complain that George R.R. Martin was taking far too long to write the penultimate book in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series, <em>The Winds of Winter</em>, and given that he likely doesn’t have that long left to live, shouldn’t he let someone else write it?</p> <p>The outstandingly rude question was met with an astonished murmur in the hall, while the guests on stage looked incredibly uncomfortable and attempted to move the topic on. However, the audience member seemed not to be able to pick up on the mood they’d created, and just continued digging their hole with a series of staccato additional words. You can see the squirm-inducing moment here (thanks&nbsp;<em>ScreenRant</em>):</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GEORGE RR MARTIN WORLDCON PANEL 2025 FULL " width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCiQWbjPtYI?start=7762&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Which somehow means someone choosing to film a two-hour panel in portrait wasn’t close to the most offensive thing that happened.</p>

 <p>The bizarre, rambling question, which begins with the audience member talking somewhat incoherently about Martin Scorsese directing her in a movie, then takes a dramatic left-turn as she declares, “George, you’re not going to be around for much longer.”</p> <p>Martin, who is 76 and clearly still reasonably healthy, didn’t appear to react to the premonition of his death (although the person filming infuriatingly avoided filming him at any point). “This is a tough question,” the person at the mic continues while the audience begins audibly booing and vocally disagreeing, attempting to rescue herself by adding, “this is more directed at Brandon…” The reason being that Brandon Sanderson, a spritely 49, took over writing Robert Jordan’s unfinished <em>The Wheel of Time</em> epic fantasy series after the author died, aged only 58. The questioner wondered if the same could be arranged for <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. “How would you feel about someone else taking over and finishing the books?” she said, seemingly now addressing Martin again, despite various members of the panel loudly saying, “No, no,” and getting up from their seats.</p> <p>“Not me,” you can hear Sanderson say, while Martin gets up from his seat. Even then, the person at the mic keeps going, responding to inaudible comments from the panel, in a room that surely could no longer contain any air at all.</p>

 <p>Obviously a lot of&nbsp;<em>GoT</em> fans are frustrated by <em>The Winds of Winter</em>‘s prolonged absence, given the book was due out 14 years ago. Given the series is <em>two</em> books away from being finished, and given Martin’s current output, it’s reasonable to wonder if any human would live long enough to get it finished at the current rate. Assuming another 14 years, Martin would be 90. However, there are obviously more human and decent ways to approach the subject.</p> <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/george-r-r-martin-howard-waldrop-ugly-chickens-game-of-thrones-1236078329/">Martin said of the delay last year</a>, “How could I be 13 years late? I don’t know, it happens a day at a time.” He then added, “A lot of people are already writing obituaries for me. ‘Oh, he’ll never be finished.’ Maybe they’re right. I don’t know. I’m alive right now! I seem pretty vital!”</p> <p>And who knows! Maybe he’ll surprise everyone and release his version of the story’s conclusion all of a sudden (the <em>Game of Thrones </em>TV series had to write its own ending, given it unexpectedly ran out of source material). In the meantime, maybe don’t yell at the old dude on stage that you reckon he’ll die soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>With a reputation for being a closer, Rod Fergusson helped get the last troubled BioShock game out the door. Can he do it again? The outgoing head of the <em>Diablo</em> franchise at Blizzard revealed on Tuesday that he’s joined <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680">2K Games’ struggling Cloud Chamber studio,</a> as <em>BioShock 4</em> development stalls and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z">layoffs</a>&nbsp;hit the Montreal-based team.</p> <p>In an memo to staff shared with<em> Kotaku</em>, 2K Games president David Ismailer confirmed that Fergusson would be head of the BioShock franchise, including helping to oversea its movie spin-off that’s currently in production at Netflix. But he also said the team at Cloud Chamber would be downsized as <em>BioShock 4</em> is reworked.&nbsp;“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” he wrote.</p> <p>Fergusson announced earlier this month he was <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680">leaving Blizzard after five years</a>, having joined just prior to the launch of <em>Diablo 4</em> and before Microsoft, his old employer, purchased Activision Blizzard. He was similarly brought in to help ship <em>BioShock Infinite,</em> which suffered multiple delays under a chaotic development process led by series creator Ken Levine at Irrational Games over a decade ago.&nbsp;“I’m returning to 2K as Head of the BioShock Franchise, leading Cloud Chamber!” Fergusson wrote on Bluesky. “I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.”</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/app.bsky.feed.post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiae25sd7bmtqrb6sjljl5iqrc6oobscldxw6nr6af2hcjlcqmsi6m"> <p lang="en">Would you kindly allow me to share some news?</p> <p>I’m returning to 2K as Head of the BioShock Franchise, leading Cloud Chamber!</p> <p>I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta?ref_src=embed">Rod Fergusson (@rodfergusson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e?ref_src=embed">2025-08-19T15:20:29.637Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Not long after it launched, Levine left Irrational, and parent publisher 2K Games announced it was shutting the entire studio down. Years later, it was revealed that a new studio in Canada called Cloud Chamber would be making <em>BioShock 4</em> while Levine worked on Judas, a very BioShock-looking sci-fi immersive sim, at his Ghost Story Games startup. Despite both being revealed a while ago, each project is still MIA.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">reported earlier</a> this month that <em>BioShock 4</em> had suffered a setback and leadership change after a recent negative internal review. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-not-canceled-movie-judas-ken-levine-2000616424">claims the game won’t be canceled, however</a>. “It’s going to come out,” he said in a recent interview. “That I can say hand on heart, without question.”</p> <p>Fergusson, a long-time producer, is a known hater of the phrase “it’s ready when it’s ready.” “It takes the agency away from the team,” he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo/492060/diablo-4-rod-fergusson-ready-when-its-ready/">told <em>Polygon</em></a> last year. “Saying ‘it’s ready when it’s ready’ means the team doesn’t have control over what they’re building. Mind, I’m giving you one person’s philosophy. But you control the scope. You control the schedule. You control a bunch of things. The idea that the game has to reveal itself somehow, with some unknown amount of content…I just find ‘it’s ready when it’s ready’ to be so passive.”</p> <p>Here’s the full email Ismailer sent staff today about the changes:</p> <blockquote> <p>BioShock is woven deeply into the fabric of 2K. It’s one of our most beloved franchises and respecting its legacy and meeting our fans’ expectations is critical to its future success.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p> <p>Work on the next BioShock game has been underway for several years. While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I know this is tough news for everyone. If your role is being affected, you’ll hear from your manager or studio leadership today with details on severance, career services and support resources.&nbsp; There is no easy way to do this, but we hope to do whatever we can to support you through this.&nbsp; I want to thank each of you for your dedication and hard work.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I also want to share an important studio leadership update. After an extensive search, I’m excited to announce Rod Fergusson will be leading Cloud Chamber as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. Rod is an industry veteran with a proven history of critical and commercial success, including BioShock Infinite, Gears of War, and Diablo.&nbsp; Rod rejoins us from Blizzard, where he was GM of the Diablo franchise and launched Diablo IV – Blizzard’s fastest-selling game ever.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>As Head of the BioShock Franchise, Rod will lead Cloud Chamber and oversee the development of the next BioShock game, as well as franchise extensions including our film partnership with Netflix. We will share more about Rod’s onboarding and how these changes will take shape in the coming days and weeks.&nbsp; Rod and I worked together 10+ years ago and I am grateful he has chosen to return to lead our BioShock efforts.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I recognize that today is a day of mixed emotions. We’re excited to have Rod joining us, and are equally grateful to everyone at Cloud Chamber who has helped us get this far. These changes are rooted in 2K’s firm confidence in BioShock as one of the most beloved franchises, and our commitment to deliver the best game in franchise history.</p> </blockquote>

              <p>Xbox has just announced the new games arriving on Game Pass in the second half of August, and it contains a couple of enormous names. We already knew that&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> was going to be a day-one release on Microsoft’s subscription service, but we’ve now learned that <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will be joining it two days later. Along with a bunch of others.</p> <p>Added today for PC is <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack’s <em>Void/Breaker</em>, developed by Stubby Games. Another game launching directly onto Game Pass, this is from the same team that created 2022’s extremely good FPS puzzler <em>The Entropy Center</em>.&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker</em> is a roguelite FPS in which you’re trapped in endless loops by an evil AI, and is all about lightning-fast action.</p> <p>Also arriving on PC is an early access build of <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, a game that’s proven to be well-liked on Steam in which you…well, you already guessed from the title. It’s a blacksmith management sim.</p>

 <p>Arriving tomorrow, August 20, on consoles and PC is <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em>, the recent remake of the original&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-like spoof, and <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, the 2012 update to one of the most beloved entries in the murderous coming-of-age series. Then on August 21 there’s <em>Herdling</em>, the big-beast herding adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031/36#content">first announced at Gamescom last year</a>.</p> <p>Come August 26, the big hitter arrives. Stretch your crouching muscles because it’s <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, the anticipated remastering of the original <em>Gears of War</em> from 2006. Being published by Xbox Games Studios, it’s coming straight to Game Pass Ultimate, but in our new, strange future, it’s also being released for sale on PlayStation as well.</p> <p>Then there’s the big surprise for this month, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. While the game has developed some manner of infamy for allegedly being poorly treated by both <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">BioWare</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169">EA</a>, and was then caught in the tiresome culture wars, it remains a solid RPG and a great piece of storytelling in a well-loved universe. It already faced the ignominy of being <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-playstation-plus-march-sonic-tmnt-1851766608">free on PS Plus just a month after it was released</a>, but perhaps makes more sense to arrive on Game Pass now that it’s six months old.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of releases for August, and the various tiers of Game Pass on which they appear:</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Blacksmith Master </strong></em>– PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Void/Breaker</strong></em><em> –&nbsp;</em>PC&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<em><strong>Goat Simulator Remastered</strong>&nbsp;</em>– Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Standard)</p>

 <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<strong><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></strong> – Cloud, Console, PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</p> <p>Aug 21:&nbsp;<strong><em>Herdling</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 26:&nbsp;<strong><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 28:&nbsp;<strong><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p>

 <p>Then, because the universe must be balanced, a bunch of games are leaving. On August 31 you’ll no longer have:</p> <ul> <li><em>Ben 10 Power Trip&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 3&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>This War of Mine: Final Cut&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> </ul> <p>Presumably&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em> is being removed to entice you to pay for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> when it comes out in September.</p>
