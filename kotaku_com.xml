It’s a great gadget to bring along for extended trips outdoors, whether its a day trip excursion or full weekend of camping. Likewise, it’s an excellent tool to have on had in an emergency situation like during a blackout or if your car has broken down on the side of the road. It’s good to be able to keep a charge phone in such events.</p>
<p>Built durably to last, the Anker portable power station has a lifespan 10 times as long as comparative models. Even after a full year of not being used, it will still have retained at least 85% of it’s charge. This way, if you are keeping it on hand in your car or in your closet in the event of an emergency, it will work for you as expected when it comes time that it’s needed.</p>



<p>The power bank includes a smart display on the front which can communicate helpful information while powering or charging your devices. It can be set to show the power station’s battery life, input and output power, remaining charge time, charge modes, among other data.</p>

              <p>Between 4K videos, raw photo files, game libraries, and endless work documents, running out of storage space feels like a monthly crisis. The Seagate expansion 20TB external hard drive solves this problem in one massive swoop, and right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">has slashed the price from $499 down to just $229 for both Prime and non-Prime members</a>. This early Black Friday deal <strong>beats even Seagate’s own website pricing</strong>, and here’s the kicker: you’re paying the same price you’d normally fork over for a 10TB drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Meets Desktop Convenience</h2>
<p>This is not a portable drive you will slip into your pocket: The <strong>Seagate 20TB device is a desktop unit that requires its own power supply</strong>&nbsp;which gives it the muscle to deliver consistent performance for your bulkiest files. Inside the black enclosure lives a 7200 RPM Seagate <em>BarraCuda</em> drive with a 512MB cache, pushing <strong>read speeds around 246-257 MB/s and write speeds of 239-256 MB/s</strong> according to real-world testing. These numbers mean you can transfer a 50GB game in about three to four minutes, or back up your entire photo library from the past decade without aging five years in the process.</p>
<p>The <strong>drive connects via USB 3.0 using a micro-USB port</strong> and it comes pre-formatted in exFAT so both Windows and Mac machines recognize it immediately. Just plug in the included 18-inch USB cable and 18W power adapter, and you’re ready to drag and drop files without installing a single piece of software. Mac users who want to use Time Machine will need to reformat the drive, but that’s a quick one-time setup.</p>



<p>It also includes Seagate’s <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em>&nbsp;which means if the worst happens, <strong>you’ll have access to pro data recovery</strong>. The service covers everything from accidental deletion to physical damage; you’d need to check the fine print for limitations. You also get international power adapter plugs, which are a nice touch if you travel or switch countries. There’s a <strong>one-year limited warranty on the hardware</strong> while most external drives tend to run hot during operation, this one reportedly stays at around 55°C, which is warm but not concerning.</p>
<p>The real story here is value: While the prices of external drives have dropped, this deal presses the cost per terabyte down into territory usually reserved for smaller capacity drives. It’s large-capacity drives make sense for media professionals, gamers with massive libraries, or anyone needing to archive years of files without having cloud subscription fees eat into their budget month after month</p>
<p>This drive won’t supplant a speedy NVMe SSD for active work, but for long-term storage, or consolidating scattered files across multiple older drives, it delivers exactly what most people need.&nbsp; You’re getting a 20TB drives in one unit for $229, which means you’re paying $0.01 per GB. And this is a record low.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-the-stinky-gas-generator-jackery%E2%80%99s-1500w-power-station-is-going-for-pennies-on-amazon.1340863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter has arrived, and portable power stations have become the hottest commodity on Amazon as people scramble to protect themselves from unexpected power outages. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> (1500W) ranks among the most popular options for backup power and this early Black Friday deal seems almost too good to be true: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/">has slashed the price from $839 down to $419, marking a historic 50% discount</a> that puts professional-grade emergency power within reach of anyone worried about keeping their home running during the next storm or grid failure. You’ll also get a<strong> free extension cable</strong> in the bundle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Silent Power That Puts Gas Generators to Shame</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 provides <strong>1500 watts of continuous AC power and has a surge capacity of 3000 watts</strong>. This gives you sufficient power to run refrigerators, space heaters, medical equipment and multiple devices at once. The increased output can handle power-hungry appliances that once needed larger and pricier units. The pure sine wave AC outlets deliver clean power, and protect sensitive electronics like computers and gaming consoles from damage. This is in contrast to cheaper generators which can produce “dirty” power that damages circuit boards.</p>



<p>The LiFePO4 battery technology distinguishes this power station from competitors that still rely on older lithium-ion chemistry: This battery keeps over 70% of its original capacity after 4000 full charge cycles, and <strong>provides a lifespan of more than 10 years with regular use</strong>. In comparison, traditional lithium-ion batteries lose significant capacity after just 500 to 800 cycles.</p>
<p>ChargeShield 2.0 technology offers smart charging that adjusts to your needs through the Jackery smartphone app: When you need backup power quickly during an outage, the emergency charging mode<strong> takes the unit from completely dead to 100% in just one hour</strong>. For daily use, it defaults to a more conservative 1.7-hour charging time, which helps extend battery life by reducing stress on the cells. The quiet charging mode <strong>lowers operational noise to below 30 decibels</strong>, which makes it practically silent for overnight use in bedrooms or RVs, where generator noise can be a problem.</p>



<p>The included <strong>16-foot extension cord</strong> addresses one of the main issues with solar charging by allowing flexible panel placement: You can set solar panels in direct sunlight while keeping the power station shaded or inside your vehicle, maximizing charging efficiency without exposing the unit to heat. This feature is especially helpful during camping trips when the best sun angle might be far from your setup.</p>
<p>With a <strong>response time of under 20 milliseconds</strong>, the UPS functionality makes this unit a seamless backup system for home offices and essential equipment. It sits between your wall outlet and devices, switching to battery power as soon as it detects a power failure. This quick transition keeps desktop computers running without rebooting, protects fish tank pumps during outages, and ensures security cameras continue working during power interruptions.</p>



<p>The port selection accommodates all charging needs, featuring t<strong>hree AC outlets, two USB-C ports each delivering 100 watts, one USB-A port, and one 12-volt DC car port</strong>. The dual 100-watt USB-C ports charge laptops and tablets quickly without needing bulky power adapters, reducing cable clutter in your emergency kit or camping gear. The front-facing port layout simplifies connections with clear labels and LED indicators showing active outputs.</p>
<p>Despite having a capacity of 1070 watt-hours, <strong>the compact design weighs just 23.8 pounds</strong>. This makes it 18% smaller and 10% lighter than competing units with similar specs. A foldable handle on top ensures easy one-handed carrying, distributing weight evenly while moving it between rooms or loading it into vehicles. It measures 12.9 by 8.8 by 9.7 inches, making it easy to slide under seats or fit in closets without taking up too much space.</p>
<p>At $419 instead of the usual $839, this deal cuts the price in half for a power station that often comes with a high price tag. The package includes the power station, AC charging cable, extension cord, and travel case, and provides everything needed to start using it right away.</p>
