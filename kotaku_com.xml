            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s that time of year when millions of young girls learn what it takes to be an entrepreneur—Girl Scout cookie season! Selling cookies can be challenging, but for one 6-year-old, reaching record-breaking sales is a piece of cookie cake. All it took was some clever social media buildcrafting and algorithm exploits.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Pim Neill is a Daisy Scout in Pittsburgh. On Sunday, she finally made it to a whopping 100,000 cookie box sales in just a single season, blowing past the national record. </span><span>A modern girl in a modern world, Pim and her family made social media posts to promote her cookies to wild success.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Hi, my name is Pim. Do you wanna buy some Girl Scout cookies?” Pim asks in a TikTok, holding a box of Thin Mints. Her blue glasses match her Girl Scout vest, and she ends the video with a gracious, “Thank you.” The TikTok has over five million views.</span></p>   <p><span>While her astronomical success may be attributed to the internet, that isn’t stopping Pim from also putting in the work the traditional way: going door-to-door in her neighborhood.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Pim wanted to join the Girl Scouts because when she was 3, she saw the girls selling cookies,” Luke Anorak-Neill, Pim’s dad, </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pim-neill-girl-scout-cookies-record/"><span>told</span></a><span> CBS Pittsburgh. “This whole thing started by her observing girls performing what most people think is the only thing Girl Scouts do, and that’s sell Girl Scout cookies.”</span></p>

 <p><span>At first, Anorak-Neill had trouble finding a troop for Pim to join. “Our first troop, unfortunately, when we tried to join and ask questions about joining, the lady said that Pim’s disabilities would hold back the troop, and they didn’t want her to join,” he said. “And that was really disappointing, but I decided she must not speak for all Girl Scouts as a whole.”</span></p> <p><span>Pim was turned away from another troop for being too young. But finally, her family eventually found a match: a kindergarten-only troop where she is now a Daisy Scout with 10 other girls. </span><span>She began her history-making cookie campaign at the start of January. “We’ve had so much support from Girl Scouts navigating it,” said Anorak-Neill. “We’ve had a lot of support, and we’re just excited that we’re inspiring so many more girls.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Pim’s favorite cookies are Thin Mints, but she has also grown a liking for Samoas. You can buy Thin Mints, Samoas, and more from </span><a href="https://digitalcookie.girlscouts.org/scout/pim391562"><span>Pim’s digital storefront</span></a><span> until March 22.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-developer-delete-post-toxic-reviews-2000669452</link>
            <guid>1437502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, recently laid off <em>Highguard</em> developer Josh Sobel opened up about what it felt like revealing the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">at the Game Awards 2025</a>&nbsp;and then watching some of the loudest parts of the internet dunk on the game up through its January launch. One of the things he called out was people <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-dev-who-just-lost-his-job-calls-out-toxic-online-reaction-2000668306">“gleefully” trying to manifest</a> the online hero shooter’s immediate downfall. The response to his earnest inside look at having worked on the game was immediately greeted by such a harsh and toxic backlash he’s now deleted the post as well as the rest of his account.</p> <p>“I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering&nbsp;<em>Highguard</em>. And it worked,” Sobel wrote on X on February 12, just days after Wildlight Entertainment <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">announced sweeping staff cuts</a>.</p>

 <p>The post kicked off a fresh firestorm from a diffuse mob of angry online gamers and social media clout chasers who used the message to attack <em>Highguard</em>‘s developers as out of touch. They were accused of trying to deflect blame for making a game that just didn’t connect with many players. As happened with<em> Concord</em> before it, some people started looking for any post by anybody who worked on <em>Highguard</em> that they could find to start dunking on the person and the game.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update:</p> <p>Josh Sobel has now deleted his X account entirely, just days after publishing an article blaming gamers for Highguard’s failure.</p> <p>Looks like the deflection didn’t land the way he expected. <a href="https://t.co/IQCneqclUm">https://t.co/IQCneqclUm</a> <a href="https://t.co/faxHwewyK4">pic.twitter.com/faxHwewyK4</a></p> <p>— MasteroftheTDS (@MasteroftheTDS) <a href="https://twitter.com/MasteroftheTDS/status/2023075675348074690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Look, a few different things can be true here at same time. According to the <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2022730613141442903">data firm Ampere Analysis</a>, an estimated 1.54 million people played <em>Highguard</em> last month. That’s around what Palworld hit when it launched. In other words, tons of people tried <em>Highguard</em> and then didn’t come back. That already makes it completely different from the apathy bomb Concord launched into. It also suggests that despite despite all the people trying to “manifest” failure on social media, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em> had its shot</a> to find a big audience and just couldn’t capitalize.</p>

 <p>But it’s also true that regardless of whether it had any impact on initial downloads and playtime, anyone who paid attention to <em>Highguard</em> at all during it’s launch would have though the developers had advertised the game by dropping kittens off rooftops. Thousands of negative reviews by people who barely played a single match did get posted to Steam and plenty of people online were jonesing for a “Concord 2.0” flameout.</p>

 <p>Even if you think Sobel’s argument that an artificial gravity well of bad-faith negativity hurt the game is wrong, it still sucks that it happened. It’s also, frankly, bizarre. Another overlooked point made by the developer who, remember, had just lost his job working on his dream game, was that Wildlight Entertainment was not some mega publisher chasing market fits on a spreadsheet. <em>Highguard</em> was not a live service game designed in a lab by Excel.</p> <p>Not every game can succeed. Even great ones fail. But you can’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">champion risk-taking in game development</a> while also engaging in witch hunts against people just for placing bets you don’t like.</p>

              <p>Roger Clark, who plays&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>‘s lead character Arthur Morgan, has a sideline in Cameo messages. The actor recently posted to his X account (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">thanks&nbsp;<em>IGN</em></a>) to talk about an all-time favorite request he’d received, from a man who had just deleted his fiance’s&nbsp;<em>RDR2</em> save game and was looking for any hope of getting out of trouble.</p> <p>“I just deleted by fiance’s saved game in Red Dead Redemption II by accident,” began the anonymous buffoon’s message to Roger Clark. And as if that weren’t bad enough, he underlined the severity of the situation. “She was having so much fun and made every ethical decision, had about 2/3 completed.” Oh dude. There’s surely no coming back from this.</p>

 <p>Although reaching out to Arthur Morgan himself is likely an excellent first step. Posting <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022059161887137920%7Ctwgr%5E9637e6ec535fb2abda3e575092f1fa3e90fd65de%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Flet-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">to his X account</a>, Clark told his followers how much he values their support on his Cameo, thanking them for “liking my shout outs.” He notes that he enjoys them all, but adds “it’s ones like these that I live for.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really am blown away by the support you guys show me on cameo. Thank you for liking my shout outs. I enjoy them all but it’s ones like these below that I live for. Let us all send this poor girl positive vibes. At least her man knows what he did. <a href="https://twitter.com/cameo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cameo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cameo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cameo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rdr2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rdr2</a> <a href="https://t.co/U0nHM2pLVT">pic.twitter.com/U0nHM2pLVT</a></p> <p>— Roger Clark (@rclark98) <a href="https://twitter.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While we can’t see the Cameo itself, for obvious reasons, we do get to see the full text of the request. After explaining the situation, the requester added, “Can you say some words of support for this devastating loss and let her know I am sorry?”</p>

 <p>What a situation to be in. This is dozens of hours of impassioned playing, lost forever, somehow not stored in the cloud. And this is a fiance, remember—it’s not too late for her to walk away without any paperwork. Will a message from the game’s main character be enough, or will that just rub salt in the wound?</p>

 <p>The agonizing thing is, unless the perpetrator reveals himself, we’ll never know how this worked out! Did the message patch things up? Is she some sort of angel who can forgive an enormity of this scale? Please, anonymous person, find your way to Reddit.</p>

Someone modded Goku into <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></a>. And I bet you can’t guess how upset God of War’s creator is at the new 2D <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-sons-sparta-prequel-2d-retro-shadowdrop-2000668367"><i>God of War Sons of Sparta</i></a><em>&nbsp;</em>game. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. All the clipped drama that’s fit to print!</p> <p>Let’s remember some games. How about <a href="https://x.com/RagnarSan22/status/2022639748796588448"><em>Radiata Stories</em></a>? Now <em>that </em>was a great game. <a href="https://shmuplations.com/radiatastories/">Here’s an interview</a> with its development team, including its director, Naoki Akiyama, who, as far as I can tell, hasn’t worked on a new game since. It’s one of the only JRPGs that’s ever been brave enough to <a href="https://kotaku.com/revisiting-radiata-stories-my-favorite-video-game-as-a-1819006170">let you kick kids</a>. “Radiata Stories is supposed to feel like these characters are really living this world, and for that, kicking seemed like the perfect interaction,” he said.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Resident Evil</em> game every year until 2030</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) RE"10" (though likely won't be called that) is a bit shorter than usual (presuming RE10 doesn't get delayed too, it's right now aiming for a 2029 release date, but could be delayed to 2030, 2031 at worst, up to the whims of game dev), &amp; DLC for RE9 has had time to cook.</p> <p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s what a new leak from <em>RE</em> insider AestheticGamer, formerly known as Dusk Golem, <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022244942085832763%7Ctwgr%5Ef221d152e261de65c9565b722ec4964e84884a3f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000669435action%3Dedit">is claiming</a>. They suggest the horror franchise’s upcoming roadmap is as follows:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></strong> – February 27</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem DLC</em></strong> – TBA 2026</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil – Code: Veronica Remake</em></strong> – 2027</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil Zero Remake</strong></em> – 2028</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil 10</strong></em> – 2029</li> </ul> <p>That is a relentless amount of zombie knifing action. Some fans might think this unverified pipeline rumor sounds too good to be true. I think it sounds like way too much. Hype levels for Resident Evil Requiem are currently off the charts and it’s not just because Leon is back and the previews have all been very solid. It’s also because it’s been five years since the last mainline game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, and three years since the last remake, <em>Resident Evil 4</em>.</p>

 <p>In an era of way too many games, four remakes and sequels in four years might look great on an investor sheet but it feels like overkill for a franchise that’s currently at the top of its game. And we all know what happened the last time<em> Resident Evil</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-6-the-kotaku-review-5948171">got overexposed</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Apex Legends</em> has a new roadmap and it doesn’t include Cardi B skins</h2> <p>After a rough couple of years, Respawn Entertainment’s battle royale is <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/2026-roadmap">promising to double-down on rapid improvements</a> and new content, including two new characters joining in 2026. What this roadmap doesn’t include is a bunch of wild crossover skins.</p> <p>“When we’re designing skins, we try to keep in mind the personality of the Legend,” lead Legend designer Brett Marting <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/apex-legends/titanfall-legacy-change">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “We haven’t always hit it perfectly, but most of the time we do try to keep that in mind when we’re picking a skin for a character, or a visual to match with them. We like to hit their personality, otherwise it’s going to feel off for the entire immersion of everybody playing the game.”</p>

 <h2>Who needs a <em>Dragon Ball</em> racing game when you’ve got Goku in <em>Sonic CrossWorlds</em>?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn">https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn</a></p> <p>— Boost ☆ 🇵🇷🐵 (@Boos2fer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Boos2fer/status/2022173524384002530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Sega go-kart game continues giving <em>Smash Bros.</em> a run for its money with all of the crossover characters getting added, but where licensing deals fail, modders will prevail. Someone recently replaced the Monkey Ball character in the game with Kid Goku riding on his Nimbus cloud and it looks really awesome (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-goku-fan-creation/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). I hope Bandai Namco is paying attention.</p> <h2>No <em>Spider-Man</em> on Xbox, probably</h2> <p>Fans have been told over and over again that the game will never be ported to Xbox. Insomniac Games responded to the latest wave of speculation as more companies explore multiplatform releases to reiterate that its Spider-Man games coming to Xbox remains “<a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766">unlikely</a>.”</p> <h2><em>God of War</em>‘s creator loses his mind over the new pixel art prequel</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">David Jaffe absolutely  rips the new GoW game apart.

Jaffe, never one to flinch when it comes to exploring the full range of the King’s English, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liEszJCMW-k">unloaded on the game in a recent video</a>.</p>

 <p>“Every time you make a new game, you don’t have to go, ‘You know what? Let’s not go back to the great character that people love that built this franchise. Let’s see him as a little kid, some generic boring little fucking kid,'” he said. “It’s just insulting to the fans. It’s insulting to people who worked on the games that they would think this character right here is what people want. It’s crap. It’s dumb. It’s stupid. I would say avoid this fucking thing.”</p> <h2><em>Rayman 30th Anniversary</em> Edition bugs</h2> <p>In addition to being accused by some Steam reviewers of just being an overpriced collection of ROMs run in an emulator, players have also discovered that the Atari Jaguar and MS-DOS versions of the classic Ubisoft platformer <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2026/02/15/rayman-30th-anniversary-has-save-data-bug-and-ubisoft-support-says-post-launch-support-has-ended/">don’t save your progress</a>.
