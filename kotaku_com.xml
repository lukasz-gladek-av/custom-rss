              <p>Dell makes some of our favorite laptops out there, and if you’re a student or a work professional looking to grab a solid option without shelling out big bucks, Amazon is making that possible today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/">The 15-inch Dell Inspiron laptop, which typically sits at a not-so-friendly price of $2,400, is sitting at just $760 at the retailer, after a massive 68% discount – the lowest we have seen it drop to in 30 days.</a> You’re even getting a whole bunch of useful accessories, plus Windows 11 Pro pre-installed with your purchase, for absolutely nothing to sweeten the deal even more. We’re expecting it to be a popular pick this holiday season, so you might want to grab it before the stock starts thinning out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Memory, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>For under $800, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen that delivers vibrant, immersive, true-to-life visuals consistently, whether you’re catching up on the latest episode of your favorite show or creating a work presentation. The anti-glare panel helps you fight reflections in brighter settings, while the Dell ComfortView software actively reduces harmful blue light to minimize eye strain during those all-nighters. Touch support makes navigation a breeze by letting you use just your fingers to pinch, scroll, swipe, zoom, and more directly on the screen. It comes in handy when you’re working through longer documents and don’t want to rely on the trackpad or the mouse to scroll, or when sharing the laptop with a friend and both of you need to access the screen or work on something together. Note that the screen does not fold all the way back as it does in 2-in-1 laptops, so this doesn’t exactly give you that tablet-like functionality.</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard that features a lift hinge design to keep your wrists comfortable while typing. Video calls are made easy with the built-in HD webcam that offers noise reduction for a clearer picture, even in low-light settings.</p>



<p>For power, Dell offers an Intel 13th Gen Core i5-1334U processor with 10 cores, 12 threads, and intelligent boost speeds up to 4.6 GHz. It’s more than capable of handling all your everyday work and play tasks, plus some resource-intensive creative projects with ease. The massive <strong>32GB of DDR4 RAM</strong> keeps the system running fast and smoothly, even when you’re trying to do multiple jobs at the same time. It’s excellent for demanding tasks like 4K video editing, running virtual machines, and even gaming with some apps running in the background.</p>
<p>Creatives and work professionals will also appreciate the<strong> 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD</strong> that not just offers sufficient space to house all your data, but also ensures better boot times, quick file access, and faster file transfers. Basically, the processor, memory, and SSD come together to ensure a lag-free, smooth experience during both regular and demanding days. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with the ultra-fast WiFi 6, Bluetooth, plus a wide range of ports like USB-C, USB 3.2, HDMI, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p><strong>The freebies include Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a mouse, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, a 128GB UFD, and a docking station</strong>. That’s everything you need to get started with work or play right away. Just note that drops this massive are only around for a short period of time before the stock runs out or the deal expires. If you’ve been after a reliable laptop that doesn’t blow your budget, this is it.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>We knew Paramount Skydance wanted to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. We knew that they company was pretty pissed when Warner CEO <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">David Zaslav turned down the offer for $20 a share for the entire company</a>. And we knew that this became a fury when <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix and Warner agreed to a deal at $27.5 per share last week</a>. Now Paramount has reacted, and reacted&nbsp;<em>big</em>. The company has launched a hostile takeover bid, swooping in with a $30 per share offer, which works out to over $108 billion, $25 billion more than Netflix is paying.</p> <p>It was rumored earlier this year, while Zaslav was making it clear how much he wanted to sell Warner Discovery, that he was looking for $30 per share—a <em>massive</em> over-valuation of the company, but one he was looking to justify <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">by splitting the company</a>, severing off the “Discovery” parts and its loss-making cable networks, and loading that doomed company with all of Warner’s debts. Paramount’s opening bid at $20, however, was for the whole shebang. Netflix, however, outbid everyone by agreeing to $27.5 per share&nbsp;<em>after</em> the split, which is due to happen in the second half of 2026.</p>

 <p>Now, Paramount is going hard in its efforts to prevent this, increasing its previous offer by an enormous 50 percent, and again for the whole company and all its debt. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj69xzpzrdyo"><em>BBC</em> reports that</a> the company, backed by the billionaire Ellison family, called this bid a “superior alternative,” and clearly one designed to make shareholders revolt if Warner sticks with Netflix’s lower offer.</p>

 <p>This was never likely to go smoothly. If the Netflix deal goes through, it would make the streamer one of the most powerful players in Hollywood, and with the absorption of HBO Max an even more dominant force in streaming. Regulators were absolutely going to be scrutinizing this, and in a time when such bodies are now fully under the control of president Donald Trump’s mercurial (and self-interested) whims, that could go in any direction. Things were looking positive for Netflix in this regard, after its CEO Ted Sarandos had recently been to the Oval Office, likely to play on the president’s infantile habit of agreeing with the last confident voice that spoke to him. However, Sunday night Trump gave hints that he was going to be a wrench in the works, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-netflix-warner-bros-merger-problem-f3e317b61899d34ce507ba38af4a2934">saying the deal “could be a problem.”</a></p>

 <p>It’s also worth noting that the recent Paramount and Skydance merger only took place after the company, er, “settled” a legal dispute with Trump <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-1236465383/">by giving him $16 million</a>.</p> <p>Paramount’s offer would work out to $108.4 billion for the whole company, including its cable networks, dwarfing Netflix’s post-debt removal offer of $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t worth close to either figure—optimistically valued at around $10 a share six months ago, and Paramount itself is only worth $11 billion in its own right. Larry Ellison, who backs the company, is said to be worth nearly $270 billion, so could certainly afford it, but it’d still be the most extraordinary outlay were there to be no external investors involved.</p> <p>So, there we are, more excitement in the world of billionaires buying up everything to feed us their homogenized sludge.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[TP-Link Deco WiFi 7 Mesh System (3-Pack) Falls to an All-Time Low, Cheaper Than Budget WiFi 6 Routers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-deco-wifi-7-mesh-system-3-pack-falls-to-an-all-time-low-cheaper-than-budget-wifi-6-routers-2000651219</link>
            <guid>1376095</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re paying for high-speed internet but dealing with dead zones and slow performance in certain areas of your house, your router could be the culprit. An easy solution to actually enjoy the performance promised by your ISP is by investing in a solid mesh system. It works by using the interconnected devices to create a strong network that delivers consistent signals across your entire place.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick one up, as<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/"> Amazon is currently offering a sweet 29% discount on the TP-Link Deco BE23 dual-band WiFi 7 mesh system (3-pack), which brings its price down to $178.</a> You can also enjoy free shipping on your purchase if you grab it quick, but the deal is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag these savings. It’s better to act sooner rather than later if you want to score the discount before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage Throughout the House</h2>
<p>Deco BE23 uses Wi-Fi 7 technology, paired with Multi-Link Operation (MLO), Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM to deliver full speeds of up to 2882 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band with 4 streams. The 3-pack bundle blankets up to 6,500 sq. ft, while the 4x high-gain antennas per node and 4x high-power FEMs push more reliable signals across your home. You can connect up to 150 devices at the same time without compromising on the speeds. Translation? The mesh system is more than capable of delivering the signals you’re paying for in every room and corner around the house – think under the stairs, in the closet, near the balcony, etc. Everyone in the house can connect all their devices, from laptops to smartphones, PC, consoles, tablets, TVs, and more, which is especially great for remote workers and creatives who rely on a bunch of different devices to get through their days. You also won’t have to sit right next to the router to catch signals; the mesh system offers the same performance all around.</p>



<p>Those who need even better performance when working on an important task or gaming with friends can make use of the two 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN ports that come built right into each Deco unit. This lets you create a multi-gig pipeline from the internet to your devices. Best of all, the system uses AI-Roaming technology to deliver optimal speeds. It continuously adapts through advanced algorithms and learns your patterns over time as you move around. The system also plays nicely with a range of providers, but you might need to purchase a modem to get started. It’s backward compatible with all WiFi generations, so can fit into any existing system nicely.</p>
<p>TP-Link takes security seriously, as the Decos are designed, built, and maintained with advanced security as a core requirement. TP-Link HomeShield offers home network protection, plus access to handy parental controls for a safer internet experience. VPN clients and servers are supported, making it easy to access remote VPN servers without installing VPN software on each device. Setting everything up is quite straightforward, even if it’s your first time putting a mesh system up. It should be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re done dealing with painfully slow speeds and terrible coverage of your router, now is a great time to upgrade the internet situation in your home. This deal lets you do it without shelling out big bucks.</p>

              <p>If you’re planning to bring family and friends together this holiday season for hearty meals and some much-needed bonding, good music can lift the mood and make your gathering even more enjoyable. Imagine having soft tunes playing in the background as you catch up with your loved ones on Christmas Eve; wholesome.</p>
<p>You just need a good speaker to make this happen, and Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/">The retailer just slashed the Bose SoundLink home speaker by 18%, dropping the price down to $179</a>. The deal applies to both silver and grey color options, so you can pick whichever would fit within the aesthetics of your place the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bold Sound In a Minimal Design</h2>
<p>Bose has paid attention to the looks with this one. The anodized aluminum paired with a high-quality fabric grille gives off a premium look, while the overall minimal design makes it easy for the speaker to blend into any setup without drawing too much attention to itself. You’ll find all the controls right at the top; no need to go on a scavenger hunt for your phone every time you need to tweak the volume.</p>
<p>The speaker punches well above its weight by delivering crisp, clear sound for all your tracks. It captures all the highs and lows within tunes, and pushes deep bass that can fill any room with good vibes. This makes it not just great for music, but also for your streaming sessions where you don’t want to rely on your laptop or TV’s audio. Dialogues sound clearer than ever, and your favorite songs can be enjoyed to their fullest. Catch up on your favorite podcast in the morning, play the latest Maroon 5 album in the evening, and end the night with an episode of Stranger Things; it takes care of all your audio needs like a pro.</p>



<p>Advanced Bluetooth 5.3 offers solid connection stability and reduced latency. For instance, when the speaker is paired with your phone, you’ll be able to roam around the house comfortably without worrying about audio dropouts, even when things get crowded. Reliability comes from its 9 hours of battery life, which keeps the good vibes going all night long. Best of all, it supports wired connection, too, so you can plug your device in using a USB-C cord when it’s running low; no need to pause the music. There’s also a microphone built right in, which makes it easy to take quick calls right from the speaker or access voice assistants like Alexa.</p>
<p>The sound this speaker delivers is solid on its own, but you can also pair two of these together for a bigger setup, which can be great for entertaining a larger crowd. Linking them together hardly takes a few seconds, and you don’t even need an app to do it.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this minimal, no-fuss, but efficient speaker. It’s now down to $179, which is still a bit of an investment, but definitely one that’s going to be worth it. To recap, this speaker offers clear sound, deep bass (even at higher volumes), an exceptional battery life, as well as plug-and-play functionality when needed. Place it anywhere you like, and get the part started. We highly recommend grabbing it quick, before the price goes back up to $219.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tekken-director-bandai-namco-katsuhiro-harada-leaves-2000651368</link>
            <guid>1376035</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Katushiro Harada, veteran poster and the director of the </span><i><span>Tekken</span></i><span> series, has announced he is leaving Bandai Namco after 31 years.</span></p> <p><span>In a lengthy post on his </span><a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747"><span>X account</span></a><span>, Harada said that the end of 2025 will see him leave the company, and that with </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>reaching its 30th anniversary last year, right now felt like the “most fitting moment” to bring this chapter of his life to a close. Harada reflected on his “roots,” which involved promoting </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>to players in Japanese arcades; he says that those days immersed in local fighting scenes both in Japan and in community centers overseas “became the core of who [he was] as a developer and game creator.” While reflecting on the past, Harada also said that recent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tomonobu-itagaki-death-dead-or-alive-team-ninja-gaiden-2000636025"><span>personal tragedies</span></a><span> and professional movement helped him come to this decision.</span></p> <p><span>“In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life, I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect,” Harada wrote. “Those accumulated events made me reflect on the ‘time I have left as a creator.’ During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</span></p>

 <p><span>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Harada signs off by saying he will still be attending the Tekken World Tour finals in January as a guest, and by dropping an hour-long </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>mix called “Tekken: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix” on </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><span>Soundcloud</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Harada served as a voice actor in the first two </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>games before stepping up to the director role with </span><i><span>Tekken 3 </span></i><span>in 1997. He’s also worked on other fighting game series, such as </span><i><span>Soulcalibur</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokken Tournament</span></i><span>, and contributed to various other Bandai Namco games as a producer and supervisor. In 2019, Harada became the lead of the company’s overall fighting game esports division, and was promoted to a general manager. </span><i><span>Tekken 8</span></i><span> launched last year </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-review-roundup-1851189539"><span>to high praise</span></a><span> and will be Harada’s final work on the series and at Bandai Namco. Though he doesn’t say what’s next for him, Harada will be remembered both in and out of the </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>community for his candid posting on social media, both </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866"><span>in joking with players</span></a><span> and in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-katsuhiro-harada-twitter-anna-new-characters-1851575150"><span>responding to criticism</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-pushes-star-wars-millennium-falcon-to-a-record-low-to-offload-the-last-remaining-stock-before-christmas-2000651151</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kids will be cleaning up on LEGO sets for the holidays, as they have for decades. But how about LEGO’s adult fans who are just kids at heart, especially the ones who’ve been devout LEGO Star Wars fans for most or all of the years those sets have been sold? Yes, there are deals for them too, perhaps none better than <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">this Amazon sale on the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectible Model, which is 20% off right now.</a></p>
<p>This intricately detailed, displayable 921-piece commemorative model of the iconic Millennium Falcon is a $68 steal for LEGO Star Wars fans 18 and up. Years after the fun of building the LEGO Falcon, it will likely still be proudly displayed in your home, with its special LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary brick identifying it as a collector’s item.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All the Details</h2>
<p>The design of the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon includes all of the intricate little details that Star Wars obsessives would insist on, including the ship’s cockpit, satellite dish, and cannons. With 921 pieces creating a model that, when fully assembled, measures 5 by 9.5 by 7.5 inches, there’s a lot of material packed into a relatively small space for all those details.</p>
<p>The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon comes with a display stand that lets you position the ship at dynamic angles for a more attractive look. It’s not a playable model, so keep it out of the hands of the littles, but when it’s standing on its base and angled to look like it’s zooming through space, it’s a true eye-catcher.</p>



<h2>Relaxing and Rewarding</h2>
<p>As much as you will enjoy seeing the Falcon displayed in your home for years to come and having it become a conversation piece with guests, the real enjoyment is, of course, the actual building. Assembling he LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon is finely detailed work, allowing you to immerse yourself in the process. Think of the old ship in a bottle models, or the very intricate models requiring glue and paint. The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon requires the same focus, but provides a relaxing experience while being far, far more forgiving of error than those old-school hobbies. And if you really enjoy the building process, they’re LEGOs — you can always take it apart and build it all over again, as many times as you like.</p>

              <p>Good music can make even the most boring tasks somewhat bearable. Listening to some Bruno Mars or Taylor Swift during long commutes or while doing the dishes is a good way to push through them with ease. The market is filled with headphones, and picking the right one can be overwhelming. If you’re after a pair that’s comfortable to wear for long hours, offers multiple listening modes, and doesn’t blow your budget, we have good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">The highly rated Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones are going for just $179 at Amazon, after the retailer slashed a whopping 49% off their retail price.</a> You’re saving a massive $170 on a premium pair, and this deal applies to the stunning Standstone color option. Not your vibe? Several other options are discounted, too, including black, gray, lilac, and pink. Those who prefer their audio gear to be on the minimal side should grab the black version. If a pop of color is what you like, consider going for the blue pair. Both of these are sitting at $199, after dropping from $349. The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, and there are no delivery charges to worry about. You also don’t need to add any long coupon codes or follow complicated processes to score the drop. Just click Add to cart, and proceed with checkout at the discounted rate.</p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>These are made for extended use. That’s thanks to a comfortable padded band paired with plush over-ear cushions that hug your ears softly for a secure, snuggly fit. The band keeps them in place, even when you’re taking a walk, jogging around, or trying to get a workout in with some energetic music to keep you going.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; Quiet and Aware. The quiet mode blocks all the external noise, offering an immersive listening experience with no distractions. It’s great for when you want to focus on a task and don’t want background chatter and noise impacting your flow (or chain of thoughts) negatively. Aware mode, on the other hand, keeps you..well, aware of your surroundings. It lets some sounds in, making it easy to stay in the loop on what’s happening around you. You’ll be able to have conversations with this on, hear when the barista calls your name, etc. This mode is great for when you’re in a public area and can’t afford zoning out completely. Adjustable EQ makes it easy to tweak audio settings based on what you like, so you’ll always enjoy a custom listening experience.</p>



<p>The headphones offer up to 24 hours of battery on a single charge, which is more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging them in. Plus, when running low, a quick 15-minute charge via USB-C gives you an additional 2.5 hours of jamming; perfect for when you’re on the go and don’t have the time to power them up completely. Even better, these support wired connectivity just as well, so you also have the option to use them with the included audio cable, too, which works even when you’re out of battery. It’s best to use the pair with the dedicated Bose app to enjoy the latest features and adjust settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">Amazon is letting you grab these for just $179 now, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You’re saving 49% on a top-rated option, plus there are several color options to choose from, which makes it easy to choose the one that fits your aesthetics the best. But again, grab it quickly, as once the deal is gone, it likely won’t come back anytime soon.</p>
