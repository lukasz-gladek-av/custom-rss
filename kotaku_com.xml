              <p>Purchasing chargers is just as overwhelming as buying the phone itself. Apple actually sells and endorses Anker products in their own retail stores, so that says a lot about how much confidence the brand has established. And ight now, Anker’s 20W fast USB-C charger (the exact power rate needed to fast charge iPhones such as Apple’s new iPhone 17 and 17 Pro) is available on Amazon basically impossible to pass up. With the coupon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">you can obtain a 2-pack with cables for just $11, down from $19</a>. That’s<strong> basically $6 per charger</strong>, when Apple charges an identical standalone version for $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Charger Deal Is Too Good To Pass Up</h2>
<p>If you’ve owned an iPhone in the past few years, you may have noticed that <strong>Apple started no longer putting wall chargers in the box</strong>. Now, you’re stuck either paying Apple’s own adapter for way too much or settling for slower, less convenient knockoffs. The Anker 20W fast charger solves that problem without cutting corners. It’s certified and just as reliable as the official Apple version – except you’re paying a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>Beyond the obvious savings, the performance is what you’d expect from a charger in 2025. The 20W output gives you the charging speeds that newer iPhones are built to handle. Insert an iPhone 15/16/17, and y<strong>ou can fuel up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes</strong>. The<strong> included USB-C to USB-C cable</strong> ensures you’re set from the start without hunting down extra accessories, and it’s Apple-certified for safety and reliability.</p>
<p>A <strong>USB-C and a USB-A port are both included</strong> in every charger block, so you can charge two devices at once (your iPhone and your AirPods, for example) without sacrificing charging speed. It’s small enough to throw into a pocket or travel case, so you don’t have to spend much time thinking about what’s going on before you head out of the house.</p>
<p>Anker also gives you peace of mind with its MultiProtect safety system. That’s a <strong>multi-layered system that guards against overheating, overcharging, and short circuits</strong>. It’s the type of feature that you don’t even consider until you need it, and it’s another reason why Apple feels comfortable to recommend this brand.</p>
<p>At this price, the deal is more than an accommodation: It’s about having a sufficient number of chargers where you need them. You leave one at home, the other in your pocket so that you never end up digging around in the office or airport lounge. And at about 6 dollars an item, you can equip both locations for under the cost of a single Apple adapter.</p>

              <p>Finding the right pair of noise-canceling headphones can feel overwhelming these days: Every brand has half a dozen variations, and the differences are often so subtle that paying top dollar for the latest release is tough to justify.</p>
<p>Sony’s newest flagship climbs well past the $500 mark which isn’t exactly pocket change. That’s why the WH-1000XM4 feels like such an easy decision right now: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">this proven model is back on Amazon at an all-time low of $228, down from its original $348</a>. That’s more than $100 off for headphones that still strike the perfect balance of sound quality and features without being too expensive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why The WH-1000XM4 Still Feels Like The Smart Choice</h2>
<p>Its <strong>active noise cancellation</strong> remains among the best you can purchase: Powered by Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor technology, it uses microphones on each earcup to pick up and eliminate unwelcome sounds in real-time. On a plane, it calms the engine rumble to a whisper. In a busy café, it creates a bubble of silence around you so that you can actually hear the lyrics in your music or podcasts.</p>



<p>Sony quotes these headphones for 30 hours of playback which will even get you through the longest international flights without needing a charge. And just in case you do leave them uncharged, a ten-minute top-up from the included USB-C cable yields about five hours of music.</p>
<p>Controls are simple too: The touch on the right earcup means you can tap to skip tracks or pause, slide your finger for volume, or summon your assistant without having to grasp your phone. It’s the sort of thing that becomes second nature and saves time compared to digging for your phone every time you need to fiddle with something. Calls on the WH-1000XM4 are better than that: With five microphones built in and sophisticated signal processing, voices are clean on both sides.</p>
<p>Among the pleasant Sony touches is the Speak-to-Chat function: The <strong>cans naturally lower the volume when they recognize you’re talking</strong>. Imagine bumping into a friend on the platform of the train. You don’t have to fight for a pause button: the audio slows down so you naturally have a few words, then picks up again when the talk ends. Pausing the sound when you remove the cans entirely is another nice but very useful addition.</p>
<p>At $228, this deal on Amazon brings them to their lowest price ever.</p>

              <p>When’s the last time you flexed on somebody about a laptop deal? We’re guessing — maybe even hoping — the answer is “never,” but if you’re so inclined, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4191/">Amazon limited-time deal on a fully tricked-out Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen is a golden opportunity, because it’s being sold at a savings of over $2,000</a>. The bottom-line $900 price is a 70% drop from the list price of $2,999.</p>
<p>When we say “fully tricked out,” we’re being quite literal. It’s stuffed with max memory (64GB), max storage (2TB), and Microsoft’s best OS (Windows 11 Pro), which includes the elite-level Copilot AI assistant. Pretty much every bell and every whistle is included here, with a $400 accessories bundle thrown in for good measure.</p>

<h2>Not a Retread</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for the “used” or “refurbished” or “dent and scratch special” tag on this Dell Inspiron 15, you’re not going to find one. It’s a brand-new 2024 model that’s fully up to date in every way possible. It’s not&nbsp;<em>the</em> lightest laptop around, but at just 3.66 pounds, it’s hardly a lumbering dinosaur. And the Intel Core i5 processor is competitive, with speeds up to 4.66GHz.</p>
<p>This Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop is an obvious productivity superstar, with that processor and memory and storage combining with Realtek Wi-Fi 6 to power through remote work and as many work tasks as you can throw at it. Copilot AI will work wonders here as well when you need a hand with an Excel spreadsheet or you’re just not finding the right words for your email to the boss. It also has a 720p HD camera with a built-in privacy shutter, and MaxxAudio Pro stereo speakers for your Zoom calls and video conferencing.</p>



<h2>Time to Play</h2>
<p>All that speed and power and those hot speakers can also make this Dell Inspiron 15 a great gaming and streaming laptop when you’re off hours. The 15.6-inch display is full HD, with 1.4 million pixels and anti-glare coating to bring your games and shows to life, and if you cap off your work day with a long gaming grind or binge-watching your favorite new streaming show, the battery is up to the task, and Dell’s ExpressCharge tech lets you power it all the way back up to 80% in just 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Nobody will question your deal-scoring bona fides when you tell them the insane deal you got on this Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop. But you’ll want to tell them anyway: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4191/">This $900 deal is a 70% drop from the original price of $2,999, and that’s not including the $400 accessory bundle that you’re getting for free.</a></p>

              <p>LEGO is easily one of the most beloved sets of collectibles. Just about from kids to adults love them. They make for great toys, gifts, or collectors items. But really what it’s all about is the build. Loading up the latest episode of your favorite podcast or the next chapter of an audiobook your working through while you sit at a table on down on the carpet, putting pieces together one by one. You watch your progress unfold in front of you as your mind wanders and you forget about the stressors in your life. You get lost in it. And then when you’re done, you have a cool replica of the likely the most famous spaceship in cinema history.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">On that note, you can get the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set for 20% off in honor of Bricktember.</a> Yes, we’re pretending that’s a real month. For a limited time, the price of this Star Wars LEGO set has come down from $85 to just $68. You’ll be saving a good $17.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Nostalgia</h2>
<p>This LEGO Millennium Falcon is built to be display (but I won’t tell any one if you pretend to fly it around your bedroom while making the noises). When displayed, it sits at a dynamic angle like it’s taking a tight turn. The model measures in at just over five inches tall, about nine and a half inches long, and then seven and a half inches deep. It’s a great fit for any moderately-sized shelf.</p>
<p>The 921-piece set of the renowned Corellian freighter starship first seen piloted by smuggler Han Solo and his loyal companion Chewbacca has every part of the ship inside and out in great detail. Well, decent detail. To keep everything to size, the characters are all depicted with just two or three small round pieced stacked on top of each other. LEGO even decided to represent that weird holographic chess game Han and Chewie play in George Lucas’ original trilogy.</p>



<p>LEGO and Star Wars collaborated on this set in honor of the 25th anniversary of LEGO Star Wars. Back in 1999, as a way to promote the new prequel trilogy’s first film&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em>, LEGO released its first Star Wars sets. Among them were an X-Wing fighter, a Landspeeder, and even minifigures of Luke Skywalker and Ben Kenobi.</p>
<p>And now here we are a little over 25 years later, LEGO and Star Wars are just has over thousand sets together — but we’re only here to talk about one set.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/"> Get this LEGO Millennium Falcon for 20% off for a limited time.</a></p>
