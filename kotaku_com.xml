            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Call of Duty</em> players are seeing SBMM ghosts in<em> Black Ops 7</em>. Capcom reassures investors about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s day-one performance on PC. And Stalker 2 is getting a big upgrades on the eve of its one-year anniversary and arrival on PlayStation 5. Welcome to the latest edition of <del>Morning</del> Afternoon Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Game Awards 2025 nominees <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">have dropped</a> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is leading the way, including in the Best Indie Game category. It deserves a ton of accolades but <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">probably not that one</a>.</p> <h2>The next Xbox will take players’ game libraries beyond the console</h2> <p>That’s what Xbox president Sarah Bond indicated in a new interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4">with <em>Fortune</em></a>. Here’s what she said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>We are working on our next-generation hardware. It’s going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that’s what’s really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud.</span> <span>And so the Xbox experience starts with the console but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</span></p></blockquote> <p>Does that mean the next Xbox will be a handheld? Will this portability come from a unified account across console and PC? Or is Microsoft relying on cloud computing and AI to make this all into a seamless experience? Whatever the solution, it will need to bring generations of backwards-compatible Xbox games along with it. Is this a big bet on Microsoft’s gaming future, or the last gasp as it pivots away from consumer tech more broadly?</p>

 <p>Bond <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822">previously promised</a> the next-gen Xbox would be the biggest technological leap for its consoles yet.</p>  <h2>Capcom promises <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> won’t be as busted as <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on PC</h2> <p>The question came up during the company’s <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1990370536753447333">latest investor briefing</a>, and the company&nbsp;explained why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ ongoing PC troubles shouldn’t be a problem for its next big blockbuster. “<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> differs from <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features,” the company <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">said</a>. “At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications.”</p>

 <h2>It took zero days for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> players to start complaining about SBMM again</h2> <p>Treyarch has tried to confirm, for what feels <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-blops-7-sbmm-muiltiplayer-matchmaking-2000633695">like the dozenth time</a>, how matchmaking works in the latest entry. “Quick Play uses the same Open Matchmaking, where skill is minimally considered,” the studio announced over the weekend. That’s led fans to focus on what exactly “minimally considered” means. Some feel the matchmaking isn’t as “open” as it felt during the beta. Others argue that’s because the beta was free and now the skill floor for launch, where people actually paid for the game, is higher. SBMM trutherism lives on.</p>

 <h2><em>City: Skylines 2</em> gets new developer with console port still MIA</h2> <p>“After more than a decade of successful collaboration across numerous titles that we’re both immensely proud of, Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order have mutually decided to pursue independent paths,” the publisher <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">announced</a> on Monday. “The decision was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams – ensuring the strongest possible future for the <em>Cities: Skylines</em> franchise.”</p>

 <p>Colossal Order will handle a few more updates before the franchise is fully moved over to internal Paradox team Iceflake Studios. The shift comes after a terrible launch period for the sequel and has left fans wondering what the city builder’s future will be, from new expansions to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/cities-skylines-2-bloodlines-2-prison-architect-2-delay-1851668058">long-delayed arrival</a> of the console port. The game still sits at a rating of mixed on Steam.</p>

 <h2>A jumbo anniversary update should make <em>Stalker 2</em> better</h2> <p>The immersive shooter’s free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993">patch 1.7</a> adds a new difficulty mode and tons of fixes and improvements to its “A-Life system” for how creature and human NPC AI functions in the environment. The result should be fewer dumb moments and more clever, emergent storytelling. Factions should also feel more lifelike. They can now “expand control over new territories” all by themselves. <em>Stalker 2</em> hits PS5 on November 20.</p> <h2>Steam founder Gabe Newell’s $500 million superyacht <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/">has been delivered</a></h2> <p>It’s called the Leviathan. It has a gym, sauna, movie theater, and more. The 15 gaming PCs onboard are by far the least of its extravagances. That’s one way to celebrate the announcement of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">a new PC gaming console</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400">Fans think the new <em>Stardew Valley-style Pokémon</em> spin-off might take place after an apocalypse</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> won’t let you pause during the campaign&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368">Everyone’s concerned about<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech Is Basically Giving Away This USB Gaming Microphone for Nearly Free]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-blue-yeti-microphone-just-hit-its-lowest-price-ever-just-ahead-of-black-friday-2000644657</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-is-basically-giving-away-this-usb-gaming-microphone-for-nearly-free.1356046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to start a podcast, improve your livestreams, or just want to sound decent on Zoom calls, you need a high-quality microphone in your setup. Most high-end options on the market often sit above $100, but thanks to early Black Friday deals, that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">You can currently grab the Logitech for Creators Blue Yeti USB microphone for just $85 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice $55 discount on its retail price of $140. This offer applies to the silver model, but the pink and blue versions are also discounted, going for $100 and $105, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Custom Patterns for Different Recording Needs</h2>
<p>This mic delivers Blue’s signature broadcast-quality sound with a custom three-capsule array. It delivers clear, powerful, yet balanced sound for gaming, streaming podcasts, and even your calls. You can choose between four preset patterns (cardioid, omni, bidirectional, and stereo) to record exactly the way you need for any setup. Filming a heart-to-heart for your YouTube family? Go with cardioid for focused audio. Hosting an interview? The bidirectional pattern should do the job well!</p>
<p>The mic also comes with onboard controls that let you quickly adjust the volume, pick a pattern, mute, and more right there from the microphone itself. This is especially great for when you need to take a quick break between recordings and don’t want to bother with complicated software settings. Just hit a button and you’re all set. To further fine-tune your recordings, you can use the Blue VO!CE program for editing them. This platform lets you add vocal effects, modulation, and sound samples, but you will need to install the Logitech G Hub to access it.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started is simple. The plug-and-play setup means you can just hook it up to your PC or laptop via USB and start recording right away. Best of all, the desktop stand itself is adjustable, so you can always find the right angle to record without needing any extra accessories.</p>
<p>All-in-all, if you’ve been looking for a way to improve the sound quality of your recordings, this microphone can be a great addition to your setup. It’s not just easy to use, but also offers impressive sound and plenty of customization options without making things unnecessarily complicated. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">Thanks to early Black Friday deals, you can grab it without paying the full $140 price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Clears Out the New Ring Floodlight Security Camera, Now Cheaper Than Last Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/secure-your-home-with-these-nearly-50-off-ring-floodlight-cams-ahead-of-black-friday-2000644420</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-the-new-ring-floodlight-security-camera-now-cheaper-than-last-black-friday.1355983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday that follows historically have proven to be a good time of the year to make some tech upgrades to you home, whether that is a larger TV for the living room, a laptop to replace you’re old one that’s gotten slow, or perhaps something new for your kitchen countertop to take your meal prep up a notch. We’re still a couple weeks away from the biggest savings event of the year, but that hasn’t stopped some retailers and brands from cutting their prices early. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/">Amazon happens to have the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus on sale for a good 44% off.</a> It normally goes for $180, but this steep discount ends up taking off $80, bringing the price you pay to an even $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>That for the single camera. Amazon also has bundles of the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus in packs of two, three, and four. The two-pack has come down by 38%, which saves it’s standard price down to $200 — so still ends up being $100 per camera. The three-pack and four-pack discounts, however, aren’t seeing a proportionally large enough discount to be worth it. Amazon has the three-pack for 11% off, which only brings it to $480 (or $160 per camera), and the four-pack going for 12% off, which brings it down to $630 (a little under $160 per camera).</p>
<p>So right now, if you intend to grab more than one the Ring Floodlight Cams, your best bet is adding a combination of multiple single or two-packs to your cart. Ignore the three-pack and four-pack entirely.</p>



<h2>Motion-activated LED Floodlights</h2>
<p>The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus is a 1080p HD security camera designed for homes and businesses alike. They utilized motion-activated LED floodlights which can illuminate dark areas at night. This has multiple benefits. It allows the camera to capture better footage when it detects something present (working in unison with built-in Color Night Vision) and the lights just going on might be enough of a deterrent for any trespassers to turnaround. And if it’s just you coming home, it allows you to see your walkway up to your front door more easily in the dark without needing to pull out your phone’s flashlight.</p>
<p>You can check out a live view of what your camera sees right on your phone, tablet, or PC all from within the Ring app. It even can connect to Alexa so you can control security features using your voice, receive instant alerts, or pull up the video on your Echo Show.</p>

              <p>Surprise! Xbox has announced a new digital event that will broadcast later this week and will provide a new look at <em>007 First Light</em> as well as some “brand-new reveals” and Game Pass announcements, too.</p> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/17/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-announce/">On November 17,</a> Microsoft announced the next Xbox Partner Preview, a digital broadcast that the company says “shines a light on upcoming games” from various third-party studios. Beyond a new trailer for IOI’s upcoming<em> 007</em> game, Xbox promises new footage of horror adventure game <em>Reanimal</em> and an extended look at gameplay from<em> Tides of Annihilation.</em> Xbox also promises more info about the games revealed in the showcase on the company’s blog, Xbox Wire.</p> <p>The event will begin on Thursday, November 20, at 10 am PST / 1 pm EST. And you can watch it on <a href="https://youtube.com/Xbox">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a>, and <a href="https://tiktok.com/@Xbox">TikTok</a>. The YouTube stream will be broadcast in 4K/60, which is always nice.</p> <p>“Xbox Partner Preview is all about bringing you news from our partners across the globe,” said Xbox in a press release. “Be it release date announcements, fresh new gameplay from upcoming titles, and world premieres of unannounced new games. We’re also excited to reveal that Jennifer English, who portrays <em>Tides of Annihilation</em> protagonist Gwendolyn, is our voiceover artist for the show.”</p> <p>All of the games confirmed to show up in the Thursday event, as well as the new reveals teased in the announcement post, will all be Xbox Play Anywhere, so you can buy the game once and play it on Xbox, PC, and devices that support cloud streaming, with your save games and progress seamlessly hopping from machine to machine. This is a very nifty feature that I use a lot, and I’m happy to see more third-party devs and publishers embracing it. I hope &lt;INSERT GAME YOU ARE EXCITED ABOUT HERE&gt; is finally revealed or announced after the long wait. Good luck!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-rumors-leak-fake-news-false-capcom-2000644833</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-producer-calls-leon-rumors-%E2%80%98fake-news-%E2%80%99-but-fans-still-believe.1355905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will Leon S. Kennedy and his glorious hair appear in the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>? He totally will, according to many fans. But officially, Capcom hasn’t confirmed it, and <em>Requiem’s</em> producer has even called the rumors “fake news,” but spoke just vaguely enough that fans will likely continue to believe in this popular online theory.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941">Almost immediately after <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> was revealed in June</a>, fans began theorizing that the survival horror sequel is secretly hiding another playable character: Leon. Officially,<em> Requiem</em> features only one playable character, Grace Ashcroft, and is a return to the slower, creepier horror found in past entries.</p>

 <p>Playable in either third or first person, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is set to launch in February for consoles and PC, and many fans believe that when it does, Leon will at the very least show up or might even be a playable character. As evidence, they point to the fact that, since being announced, we’ve seen very little of the game beyond a few sections. Some suggest this confirms that you’ll play as Leon in other parts of the game. A leaked image of a grizzled Leon wearing an eyepatch adds more fuel to the fire. And <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">Capcom has been oddly coy</a> about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon when asked in past interviews</a>. But according to the game’s producer, there’s no concrete basis for fans to believe that Leon will be in the game.</p>

 <p>“Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more detective work [on the part of players],” said <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in"><em>Reqeuim</em> producer Masato Kumazawa in a new interview</a> with <em>Stevivor.&nbsp;</em> “So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value.”</p>

 <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">“Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation.”</p>

 <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Kumazawa also directly addressed the “leaked” eyepatch image, and it’s not good news for fans who liked the redesign.</p> <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">“There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news.”</p> <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">However, Kumazawa never says directly that Leon <em>isn’t</em> in the game. Instead, his answer essentially boils down to him saying that it all just amounts to speculation and telling people to only trust information from Capcom. So if you’re still holding out hope that Leon is in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, this interview doesn’t negate the possibility that the famous character could pop up. It just seems that if he does, he’ll have both eyes intact. <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> launches on February 27, 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>
