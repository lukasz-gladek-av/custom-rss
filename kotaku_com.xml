And they revealed that at one point they almost called it the Super Nintendo Switch.</p><p>“There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one,” said Kawamoto. </p><p>“We even considered ideas like ‘Super Nintendo Switch.’ However, Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn’t play NES games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list-start-up-issues-1851774297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list-start-up-issues-1851774297">Since Switch 2 can play Switch games</a></span>, it didn’t feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES.”</p><p>Kawamoto further explained that Nintendo doesn’t want people to focus on the console’s specs but rather to simply “think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo” and added that the company hopes it becomes the “new standard.” </p><p>“From the beginning of development,” said Dohta, “We wanted Switch 2 to be a system that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. This hasn’t changed from Switch to Switch 2. I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware.”</p><p>Dohta says Nintendo’s plan is that the Switch 2 name will “communicate simply” to customers that if you want a Switch, well, the Switch 2 is the newest and best version.</p><p>“We really struggled because there were so many different ideas,” admitted Dohta. But in the end, after lots of back and forth, we all agreed that it should be Nintendo Switch 2 after all.”</p><hr><p><em>You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku’s <em>ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA.." target="_blank"><em>Check our roundup</em></a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank"><em>including launch games</em></a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank"><em>pricing information, release date, pre-order information</em></a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank"><em>what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p><em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.

As a result it will also be Nintendo’s most expensive digital release at $80. Maybe that’s to push more people toward the $500 Switch 2 bundle that includes a digital version of the game, a price tag within spitting distance of the company’s most expensive inflation-adjusted console release ever: the original NES.</p><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is $70 digital, suggesting the baseline price for all Switch 2 premium games has gone up at least $10 this generation. Plus there’s the apparent $10 price hike for all physical versions of Switch 2 games, even though some might only be game-key cards, meaning they just let you download the full version of the game rather than containing it themselves. It’s effectively a digital experience at a potentially 15 percent higher cost to the consumer.</p><p>And then there are the accessories. Joy-Con controllers are $10 more this console cycle. So are the Switch 2 Pro controllers. The camera, a big part of today’s pitch for the new hardware, is sold separately for $50. Switch owners’ current memory cards aren’t compatible with the new hardware and will need to be upgraded too. While some Switch 2 upgrades for existing games are free, others for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>will be locked behind paid Switch Online subscriptions, which you also need to have to pre-order the Switch 2 to begin with. Sold separately, they might be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1907451279401427076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1907451279401427076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anywhere from $10 to $20</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="f14a3f43c8cd3db0327a4f75b17274ec" data-recommend-id="image://f14a3f43c8cd3db0327a4f75b17274ec" data-format="png" data-width="947" data-height="403" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A post talks about Mario Kart World prices.

At the high end are PC rigs with GPUs that alone cost over $1,000 and cutting-edge consoles like the PS5 Pro that cost $700. At the low end are free-to-play hits like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite </em>that can run on smartphones. And now that everything is an Xbox you can play some of the biggest games around, like upcoming shooter <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, in a web browser for just $12 a month. </p><p>One of the virtues of the original Switch wasn’t just the portability and being able to take open-world blockbusters like<em> Breath of the Wild</em> on the go. It was also being able to do so without breaking the bank. Nintendo abandoning the graphics arms race led to better games but also a more economical gaming experience overall that more people could be a part of. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> on the $200 Switch Lite lowered the barrier to much needed self-care during the pandemic for everyone. </p><p> “Not worrying about the price of games is how we end up closing the doors of the hobby and later the profession to an entire class, and one that further harms diversity efforts,” wrote <em>But Why Tho?</em> EIC Kate Sánchez‬ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3lltn6mbyz22z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3lltn6mbyz22z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Bluesky</a></span>. “I have worked with game dev students at wealthy and poorer schools and the path for all of them starts with when they knew games was a career path which often translates to when they began having access. Affordability is important and if you can’t see that I don’t know what to say.” </p><p>In addition to concerns about limiting diversity and economic gatekeeping, others have pointed out that Nintendo’s premium pricing strategy is being deployed at the exact same time that many in the video game industry are worried about stalled growth and losing ground to forever-game time sinks like <em>Minecraft </em>and<em> Grand Theft Auto Online </em>as well as endless scrolling time pits like TikTok and YouTube. Nintendo might be able to make the math work in its favor, but that doesn’t mean everyone else on the platform will benefit.</p><p>In addition to the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, April 2 is also when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-tariffs-nato-allies.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-tariffs-nato-allies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump plans to announce a slew of new tariffs</a></span> on foreign goods.

Bloomberg correspondent Takashi Mochizuki suggested Nintendo’s philosophy around its gaming business is shifting as well, in part due to increased ambitions and more shareholder scrutiny. </p><p>“The company now has the largest pool of investors ever, with its shares <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soaring to new heights</a></span> on anticipation about the new console,” he wrote. “Its recent crop of hires also comes from top-tier institutions and might expect a somewhat more cautious approach than the buccaneering spirit of the early era of video game development.” These new prices might not just reflect a pricier gaming landscape overall, but also a different Nintendo. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
