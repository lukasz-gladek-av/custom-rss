              <p>2018’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> </a>is a very big game. Rockstar’s open-world cowboy simulator is also chockablock with secrets and mysteries. And somehow, nearly a decade after launch, players have stumbled upon a whole new one to solve involving mysterious spider webs, feathers, and…guitars?</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0T4J8LYqUi0">As expertly documented by <em>Red Dead</em> YouTuber StrangeMan,</a> in late December, <em>RDR2</em> players discovered <a href="https://youtu.be/OSQPMaU7yz8">a strange spider glyph</a> on a telegraph pole. Above the pole, players spotted a spider web that only appears between the in-game hours of 3 am and 4 am. On the web are some feathers, which can be shot off.</p>

  <p>Things got more interesting when players took the glyph below this secret web and overlaid it onto <em>RDR2</em>‘s map. This led them to more hidden spider webs on telegraph poles. And at the center of all this is a large spider-web hidden inside a tree, which seems to contain a message pointing players to a utility pole that hides a new clue pointing to more poles that seem to be connected to acoustic guitars found at a military fort.</p>

 <p>People have <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-players-are-still-unraveling-all-1832303583">spent years and years digging through <em>RDR2</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-players-keep-finding-creepy-easte-1830502069">all of its mysteries and secrets</a>. Yet despite all those mystery hunters leaving no stone unturned, it seems there’s at least one more secret left unsolved in Rockstar’s massive open-world Western, with all of this apparently hiding in the game, undocumented by players, for the better part of a decade. Might all this also be connected to an obscure mystery in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/4l3n4o/a_guide_of_all_known_spider_webs/"><em> Grand Theft Auto V</em> involving spider webs?</a></p>

 <p>For now, investigators trying to piece it all together are stuck at <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Fort_Wallace">Fort Wallace</a>, where two guitars can be found that many believe are part of the next step in the mystery, but which (at least for now) nobody has cracked yet. There are some theories, some of which are very wild and seem hard to believe. But then again, it sure seems like players have found a seven-year-old secret in <em>RDR2</em> involving disappearing spider webs and glyphs hidden behind the breakable wood of random telegraph poles, so at this point, I’m open to basically any theory, because the reality is plenty weird. If you want to possibly help solve this new mystery before <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>GTA 6</em> arrives later this year</a>, head over to Fort Wallace and see what you can find.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Millions of votes later, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has officially taken home Steam’s Game of the Year award for 2025. It’s the highest-profile prize yet for the excellent Metroidvania Soulslike after it repeatedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">lost out to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> at recent events like the Game Awards. The game is finally getting its much-deserved flowers just as Valve’s storefront cracked an all-time concurrent player peak to kick off 2026.</p> <p>In addition to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, <em>Silksong</em> was also up against <em>Arc Raiders</em>, <em>Dispatch</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>for Steam’s GOTY, so winning is no small feat. It’s also been the platform’s best-selling game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">throughout the holiday season</a> and continues to set new concurrent player records on PC. Over the weekend <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1808500">it cracked 450,000</a>.</p>

 <p>Here are the rest of the 2025 Steam Awards winners:</p> <ul> <li>VR Game of the Year: <em><strong>The Midnight Walk </strong></em></li> <li>Labor of Love: <em><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game on Steam Deck: <em><strong>Hades 2 </strong></em></li> <li>Better with Friends: <em><strong>Peak </strong></em></li> <li>Outstanding Visual Style: <em><strong>Silent Hill f </strong></em></li> <li>Most Innovative Gameplay: <em><strong>Arc Raiders </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game You Suck At: <strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></strong></li> <li>Best Soundtrack: <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></strong></li> <li>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: <strong><em>Dispatch </em></strong></li> <li>Sit Back and Relax: <strong><em>RV There Yet</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>Are the Steam Awards, where the winners are determined entirely based on user votes, basically a popularity contest? Yes. Could you have predicted most of these winners ahead of time? Probably! But it’s also neat to see so many great games given their flowers across unique categories in which they are unquestionably very deserving of praise.</p>

 <p>The results are certainly more interesting than those at this year’s Game Awards, where <em>Clair Obscur</em> swept and<em> Silksong</em> didn’t even nab the Player’s Voice award. That went to free-to-play gacha action-RPG <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. The Steam Awards are also by far the biggest community-voted prize in gaming. Anyone with an eligible Steam account can participate and the platform recently boasted a new record player peak of 41,746,984. Is it <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-smashes-concurrent-user-record-thanks-to-war-between-two-games-3242035/">catching up to<em> Roblox</em></a> any time soon? Doubtful. But it’s good news for everyone trying to actually make and sell games on Valve’s storefront.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663</link>
            <guid>1397329</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know, to some degree, I gotta feel for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>creators</span></a><span>. Matt and Ross Duffer just wrapped up a decade-long streaming phenomenon that has certainly received a fair bit of praise from critics and fans over the years but, with its finale, has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>absolutely flopped in the eyes of some very loud viewers</span></a><span> who weren’t pleased with how the show wrapped up. And now those creators have to do a press tour in which everything they say is picked apart by people ready to tear them to shreds for a final season they feel didn’t land. So I guess it’s not too surprising that Matt Duffer maybe regrets doing postmortem interviews at all, though I’m surprised he said that out loud and on the record.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoyIdbhGg-E"><span>Josh Horowitz</span></a><span>, both Duffers talked for about an hour about the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>finale, and at roughly the 25-minute mark, while the two are talking about soliciting input from actors about how they saw their characters ending up, , Matt asks, “Did Maya (Hawke) want to die, Ross, or am I making that up?” to which Ross responds that he might be making that up. Horowitz asks why he would have fabricated such a thing, and then Matt admits that he’s not been happy with how these interviews have been going, saying his brain is “fried.”</span></p>

  <p><span>“I really shouldn’t have done any of these postmortem interviews,” he said. “I’m not in a good place. Like, why the hell we did any of them yesterday is beyond me. I’m like, fried. I’m getting over the flu, you know. So anyone mad at any answers we gave yesterday, just give me a break. cut me some slack.”</span></p>

 <p><span>I get it. As someone who has interviewed many creatives who are dealing with an onslaught of questions from several journalists in rapid succession, I know it can be exhausting work. At a certain point it’s entirely possible that the mental spend becomes enough of a burden, you start being less practiced with your responses. And given the nature of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>and the fandom around it, the interviews the Duffers have been doing have spent a lot of time on fan theories and unanswered questions, with the Duffer brothers readily handing out answers.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unsatisfied fans are hanging onto these interviews as if they’re going to possibly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>redeem </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> or at least give them closure on some threads the show seemed incapable or unwilling to make good on. Several of the interviews the two have given since the show ended have only stirred the pot further, and some fans are hopping on Matt Duffer’s comments and interpreting them as just the latest evidence that they are justified in feeling that the bros didn’t approach the finale with the proper care and forethought.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New year, fresh start. You’ve tired of breathing potentially unclean air at home? You don’t have to resign yourself to a life of allergens and pollen and dust, not on our watch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/">Amazon has reduced the price of the BLUEAIR Air Purifiers to $159.99, from its original price of $229.99.</a> This is a $70 discount, or approximately a 30% savings.</p>
<p>BLUEAIR Air Purifiers can help you remove pollen, pet dander, smoke and many other airborne particles through its HEPA filtration system. It’s the perfect home option for getting rid of all those pesky allergens in your house that make you wake up sniffling, affect your asthma, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An air purifier that takes cleaning your air seriously</h2>
<p>This particular unit goes way beyond the ones you’d find at stores like Target or Walmart, with a markedly improved filtration system that can get down to the nitty gritty and rid small to large areas of those little nasties you’re breathing in every day.</p>
<p>Plus, replacing the filter is super simple. When it is time to replace the filter, the unit alerts you so you can easily replace it. Replacing the filter regularly keeps the unit performing optimally by allowing the air purifier to continue to draw in particles efficiently.</p>



<p>If you’re running one of these air purifiers, you can feel a bit better about doing your part to breathe easily and not worry about doing much harm to the environment. There are several ways having unclean air in your home can adversely affect your health, from dredging up asthma issues you might not be aware you have to aggravating sicknesses that could be floating around.</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but there are so many particulates floating around at any time in your home that it can be difficult to cleanse everything. It’s a good idea to do so, however, as breathing in pathogens, allergens, and even pet dander is hard on the respiratory system. You also never know what kind of potential germs are floating around your home, possibly getting you sick.</p>
<p>Let’s recap. With their efficient filtration, quiet operation, and easy maintenance, the BLUEAIR Air Purifiers help to give you a cleaner home environment for you and your family. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/">For this lowest price (30% off), you definitely don’t want to miss out, either.</a> You’re likely dealing with a dusty room or home as it is, so get something that’s actually affordable to give your home surroundings a fighting chance at improving the air inside. When you’re relaxing on the couch at home instead of struggling with allergies, you’ll see how good of an idea this buy is.</p>
