Instead of improving weapon handling or defense for all players in the surrounding area, as some have requested, the flag remains mostly useless meme-bait, now with the added downside of being busted.

Among the new toys for players to mess around with are an A/LAS-98 Laser Sentry that will blowup if it stays on for too long and a Dark Fluid jetpack that lets players warp short distances. It could all lead to a completely new meta just in time for Xbox players to join when the game gets ported in August. We’re now 18-months in, but Arrowhead has promised it has years of updates still planned.<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-notes-control-group-warbond-1851786318]]></content:encoded>

The movie follows the long journey home of King Odysseus, played by Matt Damon, following the Trojan War while his son, played by Holland, looks for him and tries to figure out what happened to his old man. The movie reportedly has a budget of $250 million and is likely to be Nolan’s biggest film yet. Warner Bros. must be confident in <em>The Odyssey</em> or desperate to start making money off of it, because it’s reported that later this week, you’ll be able to buy tickets for the epic and unfinished film. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/7/14/the-odyssey-70mm-imax-tickets-are-going-on-sale-a-year-in-advance-this-thursday-july-17&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/7/14/the-odyssey-70mm-imax-tickets-are-going-on-sale-a-year-in-advance-this-thursday-july-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 15, <em>World of Reel </em>reported</a></span> that some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://harkins.com/movies/the-odyssey-imax-70mm/2026-07-16&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://harkins.com/movies/the-odyssey-imax-70mm/2026-07-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMC, Harkins, and Cinemark theater locations</a></span> in select cities have started listing IMAX 70MM showtimes for <em>The Odyssey</em>, a little over a year before the film’s release. More showtimes will reportedly pop up over the next few days before WB officially starts selling tickets on Thursday, July 17, exactly a year before <em>The Odyssey</em>’s launch. </p><p>This is an unprecedented move by WB. Previously in 2012, the studio sold IMAX tickets for <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> about six months before that Nolan-directed sequel hit theaters. But with <em>The Odyssey</em>, WB seemingly isn’t even waiting for filming to wrap up before offering die-hard Nolan fans the option to buy IMAX tickets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/charlize-theron-old-guard-trilogy-odyssey-1236304226/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/charlize-theron-old-guard-trilogy-odyssey-1236304226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At the end of this month, Charlize Theron</a></span> will film her scenes for the big-screen epic.</p><p> Knowing how rabid and loyal Nolan fans are, when tickets go on sale later this week most, if not all, of the film’s IMAX 70MM screenings will likely sell out, despite basic production on the movie not being finished.
