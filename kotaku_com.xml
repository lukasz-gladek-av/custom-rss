              <p>Developer Mark Ffrench has carved out something of a unique niche on Steam, regularly releasing fill-a-pix logic puzzle games of enormous scale and surprising depth. Among others in 2024 there was <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/11/proverbs/"><em>Proverbs</em></a>, a wall-sized puzzle based on Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting Netherlandish Proverbs, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3380760/2024_Mosaic_Retrospective/"><em>2024: Mosaic Retrospective</em></a>, which contained dozens of interlocking images recalling major events from the whole year. Following&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Pharaohs</em></a> earlier this year, we now have the most elaborate entry yet:&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>—a game that combines the same logic puzzle conceit with a pixelated point-n-click adventure.</p> <p>Right, describing a logic puzzle is always the most stultifying and joy-destroying process, so please bear with me for a moment before we get back to the fun stuff:</p> <p>To get everyone on the same page, fill-a-pix is one of the many logic puzzle types to come from puzzle maestros <a href="https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx">Conceptis</a>, where you fill in a grid based on&nbsp;<em>Minesweeper</em> rules. Each number in the grid indicates the number of cells that should be shaded in the three-by-three grid of which it sits in the center. So, a “6” on the side of a puzzle means all six cells are shaded, while a “0” in the middle means you can eliminate its nine cells from any overlapping clues. The more you play, the more familiar you become with certain patterns, such as the consequences of having a “6” and a “3” in two adjacent cells (you have to shade the three cells to the left of the 6, and eliminate the three to the right of the 3), and so many more besides. RIGHT, OK, WE’RE DONE.</p>

  <p>The way Ffrench implements this is by creating enormous mosaics that are segmented into individual puzzles, and rewarding completion of most with little pop-up information. In&nbsp;<em>Proverbs</em> it was details on each of the proverbs depicted in the vast painting. In&nbsp;<em>2024</em> it was details of the events of that year. But in&nbsp;<em>Mosaic of the Strange</em>, it’s all rather different. The details that pop up are documents, mostly about conspiratorial mysteries, because in this game you’re playing as FBI agents investigating a murder.</p>

 <p>Agents Cullen and Brady are called in after a body is found in gruesome condition, with the circumstances of the man’s death a crazed muddle of mysteries. And rather than solving multiple puzzles on a single wall, here the process of completing the grids is how you’re exploring the items in the rooms. OK, yes, it’s spurious. You’re not actually playing a point-n-click in the sense that you’re actually deducing anything, but with each item solved you gain a document pertaining to a peculiar subject, perhaps cryptids or UFOs or mysterious disappearances from lonely lighthouses, which all add up to evidence to stick up on the pinboard in your office. You also visit the coroner, the murder victim’s apartment, and elsewhere, with a total of 144 puzzles and documents to find.</p>

 <p>Various items prompt conversations between the characters, which makes what would otherwise be a more sterile puzzle game feel much more alive and in-depth, and the result is something absorbing both in narrative and in puzzling. Ffrench has nailed the way in which he delivers the challenges, with smart, context-sensitive hints if you want them, and a prompt that will pop up if you’ve gone too horribly wrong without noticing. Also, in this game, you can hugely change the difficulty of the puzzles in a way that I adore.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654620"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654620">© Mark Ffrench / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You can make things so simple that you’re basically painting by numbers, or in increments make it so challenging that every puzzle is a head-scratching ordeal on the scale of <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/02/tametsi/"><em>Tametsi</em></a>. I’ve mostly settled on one notch down from the latter, but it’s fun to scale it up to the hardest point and really have to scour for every super-complex pattern of numbers. Even better, you can change that difficulty at any point, midway through solving any grid.</p> <p>OK, I completely nerded out there, but trust me, you’ve never played anything like&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>, and you’ll get&nbsp;<em>hours</em> of entertainment for your $12. I can’t wait to see what Ffrench does next, especially if these games continue to evolve in their current direction.</p>

              <p>Bethesda Game Studios may have a reputation for putting out bug-ridden games with barely functioning UIs and then leaving it all for modders to fix, but it generally does this with stunningly wonderful games in which tolerating the jank is more than worthwhile. <em>Starfield</em>, however, is the studio’s first big first-party miss since, wow, 2006’s <i>IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition</i>. What’s more striking is that the space-faring epic has, since its September 6, 2023 release, put out a single desultory expansion pack, and that was well over a year ago now. New rumors of a rejuvenated version to accompany the game’s arrival on PS5 next year do little to squash the sense that the disappointing game has become a low priority for its creators.</p> <p><em>Starfield</em> released to widespread disappointment <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-exploration-astronauts-moon-boring-1851786351">just over two years ago</a>, followed by the most peculiarly barren post-launch period of any Bethesda game in recent memory. After a year of doldrums, the reveal of that first expansion—<em>Shattered Space—</em>looked so promising. <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323">At an early showing during Gamescom</a>, the horror vibes of the new content appeared compelling, and it felt like this could be the game’s new beginning. But instead <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-shattered-space-metacritic-steam-reviews-long-1851664605">the DLC was absolutely slated by reviewers</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-shattered-space-steam-reviews-negative-1851672655">players</a>, only further cementing the game’s reputation as a dud.</p>

 <p>Of course, because this is Bethesda, people still held out hope. While&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em> was developed by a different internal team (Zenimax Online Studios), that game had the most abysmal beta and launched in 2014 in a pretty crappy state, but vast amounts of work were put in to turn it around, and it’s now a beloved MMO that still thrives a decade later. Surely, some might have reasonably thought, the same kind of effort would be put into <em>Starfield</em>, bringing about the same reversal of fortune? Surely we could expect to see a trickle of new quests, plots, and incremental improvements until it was panel-beaten into a game to place alongside <em>Skyrim</em> and&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3</em>? Yet since <em>Shattered Space</em>‘s arrival last year, we’ve had diddly-squat.</p>

  <p>The whole of 2025 has passed without not just any new content for the game, but not even the announcement of anything to come. Instead (apart from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zknfAghd-s">a video promise</a> that an unspecified new expansion was in the works), all we’ve heard are <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">rumors that the game is being prepared for a 2026 PlayStation 5 release</a> following Microsoft’s decision to abandon console exclusivity, but without any reason provided as to why PS5 players should want it any more than anyone else. Now, word is out that the PlayStation release will coincide with a “2.0” version of <em>Starfield</em> that will also come to Xbox and PC. But even this might need to be met with muted hope.</p>

 <p>Via <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/starfield-improvements-were-showcased-in-a-closed-door-event-for-version-2-0-rumour"><em>Gaming Bolt</em></a>, leaks have appeared of the revamped version of the game, shown to various influencers and the like in a closed-door showcase. Fan-run X account Starfield News <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldNews/status/2001248212104175785">posted</a> to say the event recently took place, with the claim that it was “making those who attended very excited for the future of the game.” However, YouTuber Luke Stephens posted to X to say he’d spoken to a number of people who attended, and that people should “temper expectations.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've had a few people reach out who claim to have either been present at the event or helped put it on. They are consistent in the following ways:</p> <p>Temper expectations. Things are being improved but from what I'm hearing this probably isn't a Cyberpunk 2.0 scale update. <a href="https://t.co/fjHpMCSadC">https://t.co/fjHpMCSadC</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/2001427067540509080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Things are being improved,” Stephens says, “but from what I’m hearing this probably isn’t a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>2.0 scale update.” That’s a reference to the way CD Projekt entirely overhauled the disastrously poor launch version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to make it one of the best-loved RPGs of all time, and Bethesda can’t really fall short of that if they want to save things.</p>

 <p>Bethesda’s complete silent about all of this, with even the PS5 version’s existence never officially announced, speaks volumes about how little interest there must be in giving players a reason to get excited. That’s on top of the failure to put out any new content in a year. In fact, <em>Starfield</em> is barely getting patched these days, with only two updates in the whole of 2025, both just adding stability fixes, one in May and then the slightest update imaginable in July. The latter was accompanied with the missive, “Looking ahead, we’re continuing work on future updates and will share more about the exciting things we have planned for <em>Starfield</em> in the coming months.”</p>

 <p>Spoiler: they didn’t.</p> <p>We have no official confirmation of this closed-door presentation of a&nbsp;<em>Starfield 2.0</em>, and have asked Bethesda if it can say whether this took place—we’ll update should we get a reply. We’ve also asked about why there’s been so little information and no new content throughout 2025.</p> <p>But even if a dramatically improved revamp appears at some point in 2026 (and <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens/status/2001427071151804565">Luke Stephens suggests</a> it could come significantly later in the year than people have hoped), might it already be too late?&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s dismal launch was not because the game itself was inherently bad, but because it ran so atrociously, with console versions so poor that it was withdrawn from sale by Sony itself. People still wanted to get at the game that was being obscured by the huge technical issues. A year and a half later, the game was finally in a state where it could run properly on console, at which point it was embraced and adored.</p> <p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>‘s shortcomings</a> aren’t a result of technical issues (although those are present, with rumors that the loading screens are to be improved in the supposed 2.0 version), but rather the way its breadth came at the cost of depth, a vastness that doesn’t hold together as a coherent whole, meaning the trademark Bethesda wonkiness becomes far more of an issue. It’s hard to see how this can be rescued without a wealth of cohesive new content, and new content appears to be the very last thing this game is getting. That the whole of 2025 could have gone by without a single significant addition speaks incredibly poorly of Bethesda’s interest in those who bought the game and maintained hope.</p>

 <p>I get that. I can only imagine how awful it is to have spent so many years putting in so much love and effort building something so vast and intricate, only for it not to pull together in a satisfactory way. I wouldn’t want to keep having to plug away at it either, and would be far more interested to move on to <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120"><em>Fallout V</em></a>. It’s OK to release a game and then move on. But if that’s what’s happening, you can’t be telling your dedicated fanbase about “the exciting things” that are coming up, before just disappearing into a hole.</p> <p>Perhaps 2026 will reveal a&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em> that’s worth reinstalling, and finally I’ll be able to click with a game I’ve failed to connect with after three attempts. I really hope so. But it remains astonishing that 2025 saw nothing at all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Days after his comments on AI ignited a firestorm, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">Larian Studios cofounder Swen Vincke</a> has elaborated on the RPG maker’s current philosophy on the controversial technology, with plans for an AMA next year to address fan concerns in more detail.</p> <p>“Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make,” he posted <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">on X on Thursday</a>. “In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.</p> <p>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering…</p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The new statement comes days after Larian began facing a heated backlash over the studio’s experimentation with generative AI. Vincke <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> the company was using it for some placeholder text, meeting presentations, and concept art references. He was adamant that it was not being used to undercut human creativity and would not appear in finished games like Larian’s recently revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">RPG sequel <em>Divinity</em></a>.</p>

 <p>But many fans <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934">were disappointed, and some even outraged</a>, citing ethical concerns around how AI relies on copying existing artists’ work and worries about Larian’s critically acclaimed output becoming marred by the introduction, even if only a little bit, of AI slop into the development pipeline.</p>   <p>“Holy fuck guys we’re not ‘pushing hard’ for or replacing concept artists with AI,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">r</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">esponded Vincke</a> at the time on X. “We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.”</p> <p>The controversy surrounding the studio’s stance on AI didn’t subside, however. Vincke later updated his social media profile signaling that he was listening to the feedback and planning a new response. While the CEO’s latest statement doesn’t walk back any of his prior commitments to explore how AI could potentially benefit Larian’s design process, he’s promised further context about his thoughts on AI and exactly how the studio is using it in a January AMA on Reddit.</p> <p>Here’s Vincke’s full statement:</p> <blockquote><p>It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.</p> <p>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</p> <p>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.</p> <p>To give you more insight, we’ll do an AMA featuring our different departments after the holiday break, in which you’ll get the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly.</p> <p>We’ll announce the date in the new year. In the meantime, I wish you all happy holidays!</p></blockquote> <p><em>Update 12/18/2025, 2:10 p.m. ET: Added more context.</em></p>

              <p><em>The Outfoxies</em> arrives on consoles 30 years later. Tencent invests in its own version of <em>Ready or Not</em>. And could we finally get a <em>Kingdom Three Crowns</em>? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. All I can think about right now is how there’s a perfect <em>Simpsons</em> screenshot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/backpagepod.bsky.social/post/3ma6eg5h26c2a">for every major game</a> released in 2025. And no one had to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danarndtwrites.bsky.social/post/3mabjnlygj22d">use AI to make them</a>.</p>    <p>Activision <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2001351763375325384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001351763375325384%7Ctwgr%5E50868c1df8a9b754e43f660097df3e98a413ed04%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcall-of-duty-is-crossing-over-with-fallout-tv-show-in-season-1-reloaded%2F1100-6537059%2F">teased</a> the latest post-apocalyptic<em> Call of Duty</em> crossover with silhouettes of the Amazon show’s main characters, including Walton Goggins’ Ghoul and Aaron Moten’s Maximus in his Brotherhood Power Armor. The skins come just in time for the release of <em>Fallout</em> season 2 and an underwhelming launch for <em>Black Ops 7</em>. It’s not yet clear if players who want to run around Nuketown in Power Armor will be able to unlock it as part of the event pass or need to buy it separately.</p> <h2>Two years later, viral police-cam-footage game gets a big backer</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bodycam-fps-police-shooting-unrecord-unreal-engine-1850358473"><em>Unrecord</em> blew up</a> thanks to a 2023 trailer that made the FPS look almost indistinguishable from a found-footage movie. The game that some were skeptical even really existed is now being funded by Tencent. Will it be the next <em>Ready or Not</em>?</p> <p>“In Tencent, we’ve found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision,” Theo Hiribarne wrote (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/unrecord/bodycam-fps-game-tencent-backing"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in <em>Unrecord</em> early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>

 <h2>A cult arcade classic comes to home consoles 30 years later</h2>  <p><em>The Outfoxies</em>, a Namco arena fighter for arcades that was directed by <em>Soul Calibur</em> producer Masuya Ohishi<em>,&nbsp;</em>is finally playable on modern machines. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-cult-namco-arcade-game-which-may-have-inspired-smash-bros-has-been-given-its-first-ever-home-release/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that the game was potentially one of the inspirations behind Nintendo’s own platform fighter <em>Smash Bros</em>. The new Arcade Classics version from Hamster Corporation is single-player on Switch 1 and PS4 but has split-screen and additional modes on Switch 2 and PS5.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo wins a 15-year-old lawsuit over the Wii Remote</h2> <p>It sued BigBen Interactive, now owned by Nacon, for infringing on its Wii Remote technology with unlicensed third-party controllers. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/"><em>The Games Fray</em> reports</a> that Nintendo secured $8.2 million in damages in a recent ruling after years of BigBen successfully delaying proceedings. Nacon will still appeal the ruling, however, so this cold case will drag on a bit more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[These 12 Movies Have A Higher RT Score Than Avatar 3]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look out, Neytiri, you’ve got some competition in the form of a yellow talking sponge that lives under the sea and wears pants that are quite square in shape. At least that’s what Rotten Tomatoes indicates, with the site showing <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> performing worse with critics than a bunch of films that might surprise you.</p> <p>Releasing December 19 nationwide, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> continues the story of those blue cat alien people on that planet that looks like the coolest Unreal Engine 5 demo you’ve ever seen. This time, however, there are other alien cat people who aren’t all chill and into nature. These wild ones are into fire and destruction, and are causing chaos in the third entry in the blockbuster series. But perhaps more chaotic than that is the fact that <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_fire_and_ash"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> is sitting at 68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes</a> with 187 reviews, a drop compared to past installments. The first <em>Avatar</em> in 2009 sits at 81 percent and its 2022 sequel, <em>Way of Water</em>, has a solid 76 percent. I wonder if the lack of a big gap between releases and the tech not seeming as wild in this latest film has hurt perceptions of it.</p>

 <p>Here are some recent films that have higher Rotten Tomatoes scores. And yeah, RT is just an aggregation site and shouldn’t be treated as the gospel, but a lower score might throw a wrench in the works for the third <em>Avatar</em> movie, hurting its chances of making the billions the past films have, though I fully expect it to still do gangbusters over the weekend.</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair – 100%</em></li> <li><em>The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants – 91%</em></li> <li><em>Zootopia 2 – 91%</em></li> <li><em>Thunderbolts – 88%</em></li> <li><em>Bad Guys 2 -87%</em></li> <li><em>Predator Badlands – 86%</em></li> <li><em>Superman – 83%</em></li> <li><em>Dog Man – 82%</em></li> <li><em>Ballerina: From the World of John Wick – 75%</em></li> <li><em>Black Phone 2 – 72%</em></li> <li><em>Lilo + Stitch – 72%</em></li> </ul> <p>So yeah, the latest <em>Avatar</em> movie is losing critically to the newest <em>SpongeBob</em> movie. Perhaps movie critics just love that new tie-in song from Ice Spice, “Big Guy.”</p>  <p>Or perhaps SpongeBob truly is the big guy, and indeed, when compared to Cameron and his blue cat people, his pants are okay. But hey, at least Cameron can take solace in the fact that<em> Avatar 3</em> is better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><em>Wicked: For Good.</em> </a>Oh, and the fact that this new <em>Avatar</em> installment is likely to be the biggest movie of the year, like the past films were in 2009 and 2022.</p>
