              <p><span>After over 20 years at Xbox, Phil Spencer, the face of the brand for more than a decade, has announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059"><span>he’s retiring from the company</span></a><span>. Sarah Bond, the president at Xbox, is also out and Asha Sharma, the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, is taking over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</span></p> <p><span>It sounds bleak for Microsoft’s long-struggling gaming brand, though Sharma said in her initial email to employees that her goal was not to flood the Xbox ecosystem with “soulless AI slop.” Is that the truth or just something you say to placate your workers? Only time will tell, but Microsoft has been notoriously pushing for AI integration in its workflow, so do with that information what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now that Spencer is out, however, the internet is looking back on his tenure at the company, speculating about whether or not he and Bond were forced out of their leadership positions, and wondering what all this means for the future of Xbox. The forecast is not great.</span></p>     <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5rqrieckrxohygpkhnsar5nf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfcycdzan22d" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiggsxageu3ctmjfpdyumw76h7klcvwfw7lyloqtnf2zlxyykeetbi"> <p lang="en">The fact that the only ms/Xbox letter mentioning Sarah Bond is Phil’s, along with the fact that she didn’t release a statement, suggests that this was all actually messy as hell, and the story is going to get out faster than leadership could plan for.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The longest-serving head of Xbox <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">is retiring ahead of the brand’s 25th anniversary</a>. Phil Spencer joined Microsoft as an intern and rose to be the CEO of one of its most popular divisions. Maybe its <em>only</em> popular division.</p> <p>Announcing his retirement the same year <em>Halo</em> is set to make its <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">debut on PlayStation</a> as part of Microsoft’s new multiplatform publishing strategy, Spencer briefly reflected on his time at the company, what comes next for Xbox, and his gratitude for those who helped it get to where it currently is. Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2024944789872050298">memo he sent to staff today</a> amid an executive shuffle that will have huge repercussions for the biggest gaming publisher in the country:</p> <blockquote><p>When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.</p> <p>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p> <p>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</p> <p>I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.</p> <p>As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.</p> <p>Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.</p> <p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.</p> <p>Phil</p> <p>XBL: P3</p> </blockquote> <p>Spencer worked tirelessly to salvage Xbox’s reputation after a disastrous launch rollout for the Xbox One. The strategy included trying to nab big exclusives and eventually going on the biggest studio acquisition spree the industry has ever seen. The result was an Xbox Series X/S platform that had great features and, eventually, great games, but which struggled to keep pace with rival console platforms. The end of Spencer’s tenure saw the Xbox division acquire Activision Blizzard and continue to grow Game Pass into a defining service for the ecosystem and beyond it on PC.</p>

 <p>What happens to Xbox next is anyone’s guess. Spencer’s legacy as the longest steward of the brand will take time to settle into place. Many considered him the last bulwark against Microsoft’s AI-fueled upending of the brand. Things were never going to stay the same, but they might start changing even faster than anyone dared expect.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">Xbox boss Phil Spencer is retiring after 12 years</a> leading Microsoft’s gaming division. His replacement is Asha Sharma, the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI Product division. And in the new Xbox head’s first memo, she promises to avoid AI slop, but makes it clear that AI will be a part of the brand’s future.</p> <p>On February 20, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">as reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, Spencer is stepping down from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after over a decade leading Xbox. While many assumed his replacement would be Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, that wasn’t the case. Bond is also leaving Xbox alongside Spencer. Instead, <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/speakers/5e943e22-f2b6-4443-b8b0-55749176a169">Sharma</a> has been chosen to lead the Xbox division, and in her first memo to the company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">obtained by </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">The Verge</a> </em>and <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">later shared by Xbox</a><em>,</em> the former head of AI at Microsoft promised “the return of Xbox” and claimed she would avoid flooding Xbox with AI slop, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">but that it would “evolve” and be a part of Xbox’s “future.</a>”</p>

 <p>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,” said Sharma. “Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</p> <p>The new Xbox boss also promised that more great games were coming.</p> <p>“We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything,” said Sharma. “Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative gameplay, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.”</p>

 <h2>New Xbox boss committed to the console side of the business, but…</h2> <p>As for future consoles, something Xbox has previously confirmed and teased, Sharma says the company will “celebrate” its fans and history with a “renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console.” The new boss made it clear, however, that Xbox isn’t going back to being simply a console and the brand will continue to expand to more platforms, like mobile and streaming.</p>

 <p>“Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware,” said Sharma. “As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.”</p> <p>Sharma’s memo walks a tightrope. She is trying to convince the hardcore Xbox gamers out there that she can be trusted to avoid AI slop, despite her history of working with AI, and that she’s committed to bringing the brand back to its Xbox 360 glory days while <em>also</em> signaling to executives and investors that AI will be part of Xbox’s growing future across non-Xbox devices. Tricky rope to walk, and while I think her memo is solid, the key will be what actually happens over the next few months and years.</p>

 <p>Is this a new era for Xbox, or are we seeing the first signs that Xbox is truly dead and about to be consumed by Microsoft?</p>

              <p><span>After more than a decade in charge of Xbox, Phil Spencer is retiring from his position at the top of Microsoft’s Gaming Division, as laid out in a story from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter"><em>IGN</em></a>. Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, is also leaving the company. </span></p> <p>Asha Sharma previously president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, has been promoted to CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty is being promoted to chief content officer. Spencer will remain at Xbox through the summer in an advisory role.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Last fall, I shared with Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life,” Spencer said in an email to employees. “From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it.

 <blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it. That starts with three commitments. First, great games. Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most. I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Second, the return of Xbox. We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world. We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Third, future of play. We are witnessing the reinvention of play. To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Booty said in his own email to staff that he was “excited” to work with Sharma and was encouraged by his early conversations with the incoming CEO.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success,” Booty wrote. “She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.”</p> <p><span>Spencer has been with Microsoft since 1988 and has been with the Xbox brand since 2001, helping to launch the original console against the PS2 and GameCube 25 years ago. He was promoted to the head of Xbox in 2014 shortly after the launch of the Xbox One, and has remained a face of the brand for 12 years, operating as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming since 2022.</span></p>

 <p><span>The departure comes after a long struggle to put Xbox back on top of the console gaming ecosystem. Alongside milestones like Game Pass and acquiring Activision Blizzard there have also been plenty of game delays, cancelations, layoffs, and studio closures. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911"><span>Soft sales of the Xbox Series X/S</span></a><span> compared to the PlayStation 5 and Switch in the most recent generation pushed Microsoft to take many once-exclusive games multiplatform, doing what was once unthinkable and bringing <em>Halo</em> to Sony’s rival gaming platform.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Xbox division has reportedly been under significant pressure from Microsoft to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>reach abnormally high profit margins</span></a><span>, which some speculate has played a part in the rise of prices for Xbox consoles and subscription services in recent years.</span></p> <p><strong>Update: 2/20/26, 4:00 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</strong>Spencer posted a public statement <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/2024951211129254314?s=20">on his X account</a></p> <div> <blockquote> <p><span>It’s rare in life to know when a chapter is closing, but after 38&nbsp;years at Microsoft, that moment has arrived for me. I’ve made the decision to retire and begin the next chapter of my life. It’s a milestone that’s given me a chance to reflect on the incredible journey I’ve been fortunate enough to share with so many of you.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <blockquote><p>I’m excited for @asha_shar as she steps into the CEO role. She’s joining an incredible group of people; teams full of talent, heart, and a deep commitment to the players they serve. Watching her lean in with curiosity and a real desire to strengthen the foundation we’ve built gives me confidence that our Xbox communities will be well supported in the years ahead.</p> <p>Thinking back to my start as an intern in 1988, I never could have imagined the path ahead. I’ve been lucky to work with so many passionate creators, partners, colleagues, and players across the industry; people who challenged me, taught me, and made this work full of joy and wonder.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who’s been part of this chapter. This community has meant more to me than I can say.</p> <p>From here, I’ll keep doing what’s always mattered so much to me: cheering on the teams pushing this industry forward and playing alongside this incredible community. I’ll see you online.</p></blockquote>
