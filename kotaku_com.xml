But a recent discovery makes it technically possible to clear a hunt in just two seconds. Fans are having fun with the exploit despite it not actually saving them any time. Let me explain. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Players couldn’t understand how he pulled it off. It was later revealed, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-second-quest-cheese-capture&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-second-quest-cheese-capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as spotted by <em>VG247</em></a></span>, that the trick is less about actually capturing monsters quickly and more of an accounting sleight of hand that has to do with the way hunts are triggered in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p><p>While you can start fighting anything at any time, it’s not technically a hunt until the quest message flashes across the screen. That’s when the clock starts ticking for how long players have to finish the quest. And fans recently realized that you can poison monsters to your hearts’ content without ever actually triggering the clock.</p><p>So what players can do is keep pelting a Quematrice or Lala Barina with poison ammo until the beast gets weak. The monster will fight back, but no quest will have technically begun. Then, once it’s weak enough to catch (a little skull appears on the mini-map), players can capture it with the standard combo of shock traps and tranquilizer bombs. At that point the quest <em>will</em> begin, but less than two seconds later the monster will be captured, giving players lightning-quick clear times. </p><p>It’s important to emphasize that there’s no real use-case for this trick other than bragging rights and creating a fun meta-speedrunning challenge. Give players an in-game stopwatch and they will try to find ways to break it. I’m still waiting to see if players find some broken builds that truly let them demolish hunt times. For good players with full squads and maxed-out gear they’re already pretty short, and there are some decently deadly combos going around at the moment, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/596268332586387320/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/596268332586387320/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lala Barina longswords with paralysis</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgLk4I5CMeA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgLk4I5CMeA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">switch axe burst</a></span>. </p><p>But I’m still waiting for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> to have one of those infinite damage glitch moments that crop up from time to time in <em>Diablo 4</em>. In the meantime, you can pretend to capture a Gore Magala in the blink of an eye and drop the cropped screencap in the group chat to make all your friends jealous. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On the Dew Drinkers Discord and Mountain Dew subreddit, you can often spot people sharing photos of their collections. Because there are so many variants of Mountain Dew and some of them are rarer than others, collecting all of them, just the super-rare versions, or simply one’s personal favorites has become a big part of the community. </p><p>Some of these collectors empty the cans and bottles out, displaying them like figurines or pieces of art. But others keep the liquid in the containers, sometimes drinking them years later with mixed results. And one of these collectors, West_Yogurtcloset497 on Reddit, had the worst thing happen to him recently when a single, unnoticed leaky can caused a devasting chain reaction. </p><h2 id="h2759628"><a id=""></a>A Mountain Dew disaster</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On March 9</a></span>, West_Yogurtcloset497—who has been collecting Dew for about three years—checked on his collection of Mountain Dew cans still sitting comfortably in their boxes. What he discovered was horrible. The boxes were soaked and dozens and dozens of cans were leaking. </p><p>“There was a pool of [Mountain Dew] Maui Burst on the floor,” West_Yogurtcloset497 told <em>Kotaku</em> via DMs. “I thought my cat had peed there. I cleaned it up and went about my day. The next day, the [puddle] was there and I investigated.”</p><p>However, it wasn’t cat urine that he had found. Instead, his collection of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-true-crime-story-of-a-gamefaqs-user-who-just-wanted-1847161600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-true-crime-story-of-a-gamefaqs-user-who-just-wanted-1847161600">Mountain Dew</a></span> cans were leaking soda all over each other and the wall. According to the collector, he’d had most of those cans for about a year and had been storing them in his room while he went to college about two hours away, which made it hard for him to check on the collection. And despite keeping the cans upright, a tactic used by many collectors to avoid blowouts caused by weight crushing the weaker sides of the cans, a leak ruined everything. </p><figure id="" data-id="dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-recommend-id="image://dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->West_Yogurtcloset497 / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-recommend-id="image://dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Presumably, one can from the very top was faulty out of the factory, and leaked,” explained the collector. “The acid decayed the other cans causing them to leak, which exponentially killed more and more cans over the months.”</p><p>After discovering the soda destruction—the collector says he lost about 100 to 125 cans—and cleaning up the sugary mess, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West_Yogurtcloset497 posted images</a></span> of what happened on the Mountain Dew subreddit, adding: “PSA Check up on your cans frequently and make sure they are stored correctly.”</p><h2 id="h2759629"><a id=""></a>Community reactions and the future</h2><p>In the comments below, people commiserated with the collector about his loss and shared similar stories of times they were screwed over by a leaky can or bottle.

No telling how long some of them were open.” He did try some of the cans that survived the Dew-pocalypse and says they were still carbonated and tasted “fine.” </p><div><p>Thankfully, due to cold weather, his room wasn’t filled with ants or other bugs and there wasn’t a nasty smell. However, he did confirm that his wall is ruined and will need to be cleaned and fixed up. As for the future, the collector tells me that he will continue to store cans, but has learned a valuable lesson in how to do so properly. </p><p>“[I won’t] keep the cans in the boxes anymore,” said West_Yogurtcloset497. “And make sure to check on them frequently. I knew cans eventually leak, but I had no idea that a single leaking can could kill most of my can collection.” </p></div><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
