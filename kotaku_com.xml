              <p>Amazon shows a <em>“hidden price”</em> on the PS VR2 bundle, rather than the standard retail price because Sony’s contracts with retailers limit how certain deals can be advertised. But the real <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">list price is $299, down from the usual $399, which makes this Black Friday deal an all-time low</a> for the <strong>headset bundled with Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>. This pricing has propelled the bundle to <strong>#1 best-seller</strong> status in its category, and if you already own a PS5, this is the perfect entry point into serious VR gaming.</p>

<h2>Eye Tracking and Sense Technology Redefine VR Immersion</h2>
<p>Because the eye-tracking system monitors where you look in real time, it allows games to <strong>render details precisely where your gaze focuses</strong>. That advantage brought about foveated rendering, a technique whereby PS VR2 delivers sharper visuals in the direct line of sight while doing less processing on peripheral areas. Characters in games can respond to eye contact. This enables <strong>a lot more natural interaction</strong> that simply wasn’t possible with previous systems.</p>
<p><strong>Headset feedback</strong> adds another sensory layer through subtle vibrations that sync with in-game actions. You feel the rush of air as something flies by your head or the impact when objects collide near you. The 3D audio creates a complete sound environment where you can pinpoint exactly where sounds originate, whether that’s footsteps behind you or wind coming from a specific direction.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K HDR visuals boast 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye</strong>, and drastically reduces the screen door effect that plagued earlier VR headsets. Text comes out crisp and readable, distant objects retain detail, and overall image quality approaches what you would get from a high-end monitor. The HDR capability means brighter highlights and deeper blacks give scenes more depth and realism.</p>
<p>The <strong>110-degree FOV offers wide peripheral vision</strong> that aids in keeping the feeling of immersion intact since more of your visual space is filled. You don’t feel like you’re looking through binoculars, which was one of the complaints of headsets with narrower FOV. These lenses also reduce distortion at the edges to keep the image clear across the full field of view.</p>



<p>The Sense controllers introduce haptic feedback similar to the DualSense gamepad, allowing you to feel textures and impacts through your hands. Adaptive triggers create resistance that changes based on what you’re doing, whether that’s drawing a bow or squeezing a trigger. Finger touch detection tracks where your fingers rest on the controller without requiring you to press buttons, enabling more natural hand gestures and interactions. These controllers are a significant upgrade from previous VR input methods that have relied on simple button presses.</p>
<p>It comes with <strong>Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>, a game that shows what PS VR2 can do: it was built for this hardware, taking advantage of eye tracking, haptic feedback, and visuals. You climb mountains with natural hand movements, manipulate the environment with gesture controls, and experience the Horizon universe in a completely new way. The bundle gives you immediate access to premium VR content without needing to buy games separately.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting Sony’s latest VR technology bundled with a full game for $100 less than the standard price. Eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K HDR visuals put this headset above most competitors that cost significantly more. This is the most accessible pricing the PS VR2 has received, and including Horizon Call of the Mountain adds immediate value.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-pixel-10-pro-goes-cheaper-than-last-years-9-pro-amazon-crushes-google-on-black-friday-deals-2000646123</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-pixel-10-pro-goes-cheaper-than-last-year%E2%80%99s-9-pro-amazon-crushes-google-on-black-friday-deals.1360600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google announced the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro only weeks ago, but Amazon has already chopped prices significantly for Black Friday. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Pixel 10 Pro 128GB slides to $749 from its debut price of $999</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/">more affordable Pixel 10 (128BG) reaches $599 from $799</a>. Those are record-low prices and puts some serious pressure on competitors, particularly Apple’s suddenly less competitive iPhone 17 lineup. The Pixel 10 Pro brings true flagship specs with Google’s <strong>computational photography advantages and Gemini AI integration</strong> at a price that beats its premium competitors by hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gemini AI Assistant Changes Daily Smartphone Use</h2>
<p>The<strong> integrated Gemini AI assistant</strong> can do a lot more than simple voice-based requests to perform complex tasks across apps and contexts. You can ask it to summarize long email threads, write messages in your personal style, or provide information in depth by looking at pictures through the camera. For sensitive tasks, the AI processes requests locally on the <strong>Tensor G5 chip</strong> to maintain your data private while delivering fast responses. It feels far more organic than bolt-on AI features since it’s integrated into the core Android experience.</p>
<p>It learns your patterns and proactively provides information relevant to you without explicit commands. It suggests responses to messages based on context, reminds you about tasks mentioned in emails, and provides traffic updates for your regular routes at the right times. The AI automatically handles photo organization, creating event- and people-centric albums while making search phenomenally accurate with natural language queries.</p>



<p>The <strong>triple rear camera array features a combination of a 50MP main sensor, 48MP ultra-wide, and 48MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom</strong>. In typical Google style, computational photography processes several frames for each single shot, combining them to suppress noise, increase dynamic range, and capture finer detail than is visible in a single exposure. <strong>Night Sight mode delivers great photos</strong> in near darkness without flash, while retaining natural colors and revealing detail that’s completely invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>The <em>Super Res Zoom</em> extends beyond the 5x optical range through computational techniques that <strong>maintain image quality up to 30x digital zoom</strong>. Real-world results show surprisingly sharp details at 10-15x zoom levels that typically look pixelated on competing phones. Video recording reaches 4K at 60fps with advanced stabilization that smooths out walking motion and sudden movements. The <strong>Magic Eraser feature removes unwanted objects from photos</strong> convincingly and uses AI to fill in backgrounds naturally.</p>



<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Super Actua display leverages excellent brightness of as high as 2000 nits</strong>&nbsp;and it’s even readable in direct sunlight where other phones wash out. An adaptive 120Hz refresh rate dynamically changes based on the content: high refresh for scrolling and gaming, lower for static content, to save battery. Color accuracy and contrast are as good as standalone monitors, deep blacks thanks to the <strong>OLED panel</strong>&nbsp;and vibrant colors that do not look oversaturated.</p>
<p>The Tensor G5 chip handles everyday tasks smoothly while excelling at AI workloads that other processors struggle with. Apps launch quickly, multitasking stays responsive, and gaming performance matches what you’d expect from a flagship device. Efficiency from this chip combines with the <strong>5,060mAh battery to deliver genuine all-day usage</strong>&nbsp;with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. <strong>Fast charging reaches 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> and wireless charging offers convenient overnight top-ups.</p>
<p>For $749, you’re getting a flagship for $250 less than its launch price, hundreds below what Apple and Samsung charge for comparable specs. The Pixel 10 Pro matches or slightly outperforms the camera capabilities of an iPhone 17 Pro for thousands of dollars less, and the Gemini AI integration offers capabilities the competition can’t.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-dualsense-now-selling-it-cheaper-than-no-name-controllers-2000646090</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-dualsense-now-selling-it-cheaper-than-no-name-controllers.1360597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it launched, the Playstation <em>DualSense</em> changed the way controllers felt in your hand and it remains the <strong>best way to experience PS5 games with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong>. Generic controllers will get the job done but they miss out on the immersive details that make modern games feel alive. The great news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5777/">Amazon just dropped the DualSense to $54 for Black Friday down from its usual $74 price</a>, with every color option seeing the same discount. That’s an all-time low, since these controllers never see any discount throughout the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5777/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Haptic Feedback Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The haptic feedback system replaces traditional rumble with <strong>precise vibrations that simulate different textures and actions</strong>. You feel the difference between walking on metal, grass, or sand through subtle vibrations that match the surface. When you pull a bowstring in a game, the adaptive triggers create actual resistance that increases as you draw back. This L2 and R2 trigger tension changes dynamically based on what you’re doing, whether that’s pressing a gas pedal, pulling a trigger, or drawing a weapon.</p>
<p>These <strong>features work across hundreds of PS5 titles now</strong>, and developers continue to find innovative ways to utilize them. Racing games can make you feel the road surface and brake pressure. Shooters give each weapon a distinct trigger feel. Even menu navigation gets enhanced with subtle haptic clicks that confirm your selections. The technology doesn’t just add novelty; it provides actual feedback that improves your control and connection to the game.</p>



<p>The <strong>onboard microphone lets you chat without needing a headset</strong>&nbsp;which is great for quick online sessions. The mic quality handles voice chat clearly enough for team coordination, though serious streamers will want a dedicated microphone. You can plug any headset directly into the 3.5mm jack when you need better audio or more privacy. The <em>Create</em> button replaces the old <em>Share</em> button and gives you quick access to screenshots, video clips, and broadcast features without interrupting gameplay.</p>
<p>The speaker built into the controller adds another audio layer in supported games: You hear environmental sounds, character voices, and sound effects emanating from the controller itself, which creates a much more three-dimensional audio experience. Some games use it for subtle details like radio chatter or reloading sounds. Others make it central to the experience, with sounds moving between your TV and controller based on where they originate in the game world.</p>



<p>The design retains the classic Playstation layout while <strong>refining the ergonomics and improving the analog sticks</strong>. The grips fit comfortably into medium to large hands, and the textured surface prevents slipping during intense gaming sessions. The analog sticks offer better precision compared to the previous generation, with improved resistance and dead zones that make aiming feel way more responsive. <strong>Battery life runs about 12 hours on a full charge</strong>&nbsp;which gets you through multiple gaming sessions before needing to plug in.</p>
<p>The <strong>addition of USB Type-C charging</strong> means faster power delivery along with a reversible cable that plugs in either way. Placing the port at the top of the controller gives easy access while playing. <strong>Bluetooth</strong> connectivity extends functionality to play with PS5 consoles, Windows PCs, and Mac computers, all from one controller. PC gaming support has significantly expanded, as more titles now have haptic feedback and adaptive triggers support on Windows. This cross-platform compatibility makes the DualSense useful beyond just your Playstation console.</p>
<p>The midnight black color option provides you with a stealthy alternative to the standard white and shows less wear over time. <strong>Other colors like cosmic red, starlight blue, and galactic purple all hit the same $54 price point</strong> during this sale – you can pick up multiple controllers in different colors and still manage to spend less than buying two at their regular price.</p>
<p>You’re getting here Sony’s flagship controller, complete with its advanced features, for less than the price of many third-party options at $54. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers alone are worth this price, but you also get multi-device support, built-in audio options, and refined ergonomics. That’s genuine value since these controllers almost never drop below $60, and the Black Friday pricing makes it the right time to buy a backup or upgrade from older controllers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-4-pack-of-govee-smart-light-bulbs-is-nearly-free-amazon-prices-them-like-regular-budget-bulbs-2000646086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-4-pack-of-govee-smart-light-bulbs-is-nearly-free-amazon-prices-them-like-regular-budget-bulbs.1360567/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart lighting changes a room, and these bulbs yield that change in minutes. You screw them into any standard socket, open an app and you’ll suddenly be in full control of your home’s atmosphere. The Govee smart light bulbs are one of those extremely rare smart home products that actually lives up to the <em>“easy”</em> promise while genuinely changing your daily experience. And the good news is that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5776/">just dropped the 4-pack to an all-time low of $23 for Black Friday, down from the usual $39 price tag</a> (40% off).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5776/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors Makes a Difference</h2>
<p>That color range here isn’t just some marketing number: these bulbs <strong>pack 16 million color options along with 54 preset scenes</strong> that cover everything from movie night to dinner party vibes. You can dial in the exact shade you want for any situation, whether that’s a warm amber for evening reading or a cool blue for focus work. The RGBWW setup means you get proper white light too, not some washed-out white that cheaper RGB bulbs produce. <strong>Each bulb pumps out 800 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which gives you plenty of brightness for standard rooms without needing multiple bulbs per fixture.</p>
<p>The music sync feature converts any space into a reactive environment. Your phone’s microphone picks up the audio, and the bulbs shift colors and brightness to match the beats. This works great for parties or just making your regular music listening more immersive. You do need to make sure no other app is using your microphone, but once that’s clear, the sync happens in real time with minimal lag.</p>



<p>Voice control via <strong>Alexa or Google Assistant</strong> means you can change lighting without having to touch your phone. Simple commands, such as <em>“dim the living room”</em> or <em>“set bedroom to warm white,”</em> work exactly as you’d expect. The Govee Home app gives you more granular control when you want it, letting you fine-tune brightness percentages, save custom scenes, and switch between modes. The app connects via both WiFi and Bluetooth, though you’ll want that WiFi connection for remote control when you’re away from home.</p>



<p>Group control makes it easier to operate several bulbs over different rooms: You create a scheme in the app, add whatever bulbs you want in that group, then control them all at the same time. This saves time when you’re setting up lighting for the whole house or just want to turn everything off at once. The bulbs require a stable 2.4GHz WiFi connection for this to function well, so bear in mind this if you have a dual-band router set to auto-switch frequencies.</p>
<p>Lighting seamlessly fits into your routines through the timer and scheduling functions. You can also make bulbs gradually brighten at the time your alarm goes off, simulating a natural sunrise that makes waking up less jarring. At night, sunset mode slowly dims your lights as bedtime approaches. These scheduled changes happen automatically once you set them up, and you can adjust the timing whenever your schedule shifts.</p>
<p>Installation takes roughly two minutes per bulb, as <strong>they fit standard A19 sockets</strong> and don’t require any special fixtures or complicated wiring. The bulbs draw their power from standard AC 120V outlets and connect to your network during an initial setup process. One limitation to know upfront is that these won’t work with smart switches, since the bulbs need constant power to maintain their connection and respond to commands.</p>
<p>This 4-pack at $23 gets you four rooms worth of smart lighting for less than some brands charge for a single premium bulb. Easy setup combines with generally reliable app control and genuine functionality to make this one of the better entry points into smart home lighting. You’re getting music sync, voice control, and millions of color <strong>options for about $6 per bulb</strong>, which is what basic LED bulbs cost just a few years ago.</p>

              <p>The premium active noise canceling headphone market is filled to the brim with offerings from Sony, Bose, Sonos, and many more all vying for your attention. Apple is still Apple, however, and the AirPods Max is one of the best-selling products in the category despite the crowded competition and higher price tag.</p>
<p>This r<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">ecord low of $429 at Amazon, down from the usual $549</a>, puts extreme pressure on every competitor in the space. A great sound, professional-level noise cancellation, and that Apple integration make for value that justifies the investment, especially at this Black Friday pricing which undercuts rivals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Noise Cancellation Silences the World</h2>
<p>Computational audio combined with advanced algorithms allows the <strong>active noise-cancellation system to block outside sound</strong> with phenomenal effectiveness. Each ear cup has three outward-facing microphones that detect ambient noise, while one inward-facing microphone monitors sound that reaches your ear. This audio is <strong>processed 200 times per second</strong> by the system to create anti-noise that cancels out unwanted sounds before they reach your ears.</p>
<p>The effectiveness goes beyond what most of the competition achieves and creates a level of isolation that allows for focused work or pure enjoyment of music anywhere. You immediately notice the difference it makes on flights, in busy offices, or while you’re walking down crowded streets where background noise simply disappears. The <strong>system continuously adjusts to your environment and head movements</strong>, and keeps consistent cancellation even as conditions change around you.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode opens external microphones</strong> to allow outside sound to pass through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Because of the audio processing, it makes external sounds feel natural, not artificial or amplified, allowing you to hear conversations, traffic, or announcements while still wearing the headphones.</p>
<p>Personalized spatial audio provides a kind of theatre-like experience, and <strong>allows audio sources to appear in three-dimensional space around you</strong>. The system uses head tracking to keep sound anchored to your device even as you turn your head, maintaining the illusion that audio comes from fixed positions in space. It works best with movies and spatial audio music, where instruments and voices occupy distinct positions in the sound stage. The personalization uses the <em>TrueDepth</em> camera found in compatible iPhones to map your ear geometry and then adjusts the audio profile to fit your specific anatomy.</p>



<p>Computational audio and the <strong>Apple-designed H1 chip make for sound quality that is on par with a set of dedicated audiophile headphones</strong> that cost significantly more. Bass response stays tight and controlled, not bleeding into midrange frequencies. Vocals sound clear and forward with very good detail, showcasing subtle textures in recordings. High-frequency response extends smoothly without harshness, making these comfortable during extended listening sessions.</p>
<p><strong>This aluminum and stainless steel construction</strong> imbues these headphones with significant heft and a truly premium feel that few competitors can match. The mesh canopy and memory foam ear cushions spread weight out for comfortable wear, but the overall heft still makes its presence felt during long listening sessions. USB-C charging brings the AirPods Max in line with modern standards, making it more convenient to charge them using the same cables as you do your phones and laptops. <strong>Battery life reaches about 20 hours</strong> with active noise cancellation turned on, which should easily get you through several days of typical use.</p>
<p>With the H1 chip, seamless integration with Apple devices happens automatically: instant pairing, switching between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac is a breeze. It also allows for hands-free Siri activation through voice commands. Automatic switching detects which device you’re actively using and routes audio to it appropriately. These integrations work exclusively within the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>At $429, they’re $120 below standard pricing while offering audio quality and features comparable or better than competitors at similar or higher prices. Sony’s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra sell around $500 so the AirPods Max are competitive on price while offering superior build quality and the advantages of being part of the Apple ecosystem.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/blueair-drops-black-friday-deal-on-air-purifier-now-selling-for-pocket-change-for-healthier-sleep-2000646110</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blueair-drops-black-friday-deal-on-air-purifier-now-selling-for-pocket-change-for-healthier-sleep.1360537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You spend roughly a third of your life sleeping so the air quality in your bedroom is crucial in terms of health and quality of rest. The same can be said for living rooms, home offices, and other places where you will be spending plenty of time. Good-quality air purifiers aren’t cheap with premium models from reputable brands coming in well above the $200 threshold. However, Blueair breaks that pattern this Black Friday by offering an all-time low on Amazon – <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5781/">dropping the Blue Pure 211i Max down to $199 from its usual $349 price (42% off)</a>. This is the <strong>best pricing ever seen</strong> on one of the most effective air purification systems on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5781/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>HEPASilent Technology Cleans Faster and Quieter</h2>
<p>The HEPASilent dual-filtration system combines mechanical and electrostatic filtration to achieve better performance than standard HEPA filters alone. This technology cleans the air up to 83% faster while generating 50% less noise than traditional HEPA systems. The <strong>purifier can process enough air to clean a 3,048 square foot</strong> space in one hour, a 1,524 square foot room in 30 minutes, or the typical 635 square foot bedroom in about 12 minutes on high speed.</p>
<p>The filtration captures <strong>99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1 microns, going smaller than what standard HEPA filters catch</strong>. This means the system removes viruses, smoke particles, pet dander, pollen, mold spores, and dust with exceptional efficiency. Light household odors from cooking, pets, and smoke are handled by the layer in the carbon filter, but it does much better with fresher odors than deeply embedded ones.</p>



<p><em>Quiet Mark</em> certification confirms this is a <strong>purifier that runs at 23 to 53 decibels</strong> depending on the fan speed. The lowest setting is quieter than a whisper and thus can be applied in bedrooms during sleep with no disturbance. Even the highest speed remains below regular conversation levels, so you can easily run this device during the day without its interfering with your work calls or TV watching. Impressively, it keeps the noise level low, considering how much air this unit is actually capable of moving.</p>
<p>Smart app integration allows remote control of the purifier, programming operation times, and air quality monitoring from your phone. The Welcome Home geofencing feature automatically turns the purifier on when you approach home so the air is clean by the time you arrive. Clean Air ETA lets you know how much time until a room reaches your target level of air quality.</p>



<p>The onboard pollution sensor measures particles PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 in real time and displays results through a 5-color air quality index. If air quality changes-whether from cooking, opening windows, or other activities that introduce particles-you see immediate feedback. In auto mode, the fan speeds ramp up as pollution builds and ramp down as the air cleans up. This automation means you do not need to constantly adjust settings yourself.</p>
<p>The advanced functionalities are <strong>kept simple with the two-button design and LED display</strong>. You control fan speeds from 1 to 4, engage night mode for minimal noise and lighting, adjust the brightness of the display, and utilize child lock to avoid accidental changes. Alexa voice control provides another layer of convenience in the form of hands-free adjustments.</p>
<p>You’re getting the top-performing Blueair purifier for 43% off at $199 and brings premium air cleaning into budget territory. Meanwhile, combining fast cleaning speeds with quiet operation and smart features usually means paying $300 or more from competing brands.</p>
