              <p>And just like that, it’s already time to start shopping around for the holiday season. Finding the right gifts for all your friends, family, and loved ones can be quite stress inducing. Sure, we like to get unique gifts catered to the recipient, but also a good gift that works across the board for everyone can be equally appreciated and save you a lot of time and effort. Just about everyone under the sun could find a good use for a portable power station. Amazon happens to hat this one from Anker on sale for a solid $70 off. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">Anker power bank is typically sold for $150, but for a limited time, Amazon has it down by nearly 50%</a>: The price has dropped to just $79.</p>

<h2>Emergency or Entertainment</h2>
<p>The Anker power bank is able to hold a massive capacity of 60,000mAh (or 192Wh). This much power will allow you to charge multiple devices from zero to 10%, multiple times over. It’s a great gadget to bring along for extended trips outdoors, whether its a day trip excursion or full weekend of camping. Likewise, it’s an excellent tool to have on had in an emergency situation like during a blackout or if your car has broken down on the side of the road. It’s good to be able to keep a charge phone in such events.</p>
<p>Built durably to last, the Anker portable power station has a lifespan 10 times as long as comparative models. Even after a full year of not being used, it will still have retained at least 85% of it’s charge. This way, if you are keeping it on hand in your car or in your closet in the event of an emergency, it will work for you as expected when it comes time that it’s needed.</p>



<p>The power bank includes a smart display on the front which can communicate helpful information while powering or charging your devices. It can be set to show the power station’s battery life, input and output power, remaining charge time, charge modes, among other data.</p>
<p>Atop the power station is an LED light which can be set to two different brightness modes. The convenient strap allows it to be easy to pick up and transport.</p>
<p>Choose between either green or gray for the Anker power bank. Both color options are on sale right now for 47% off. That brings them down from $150 to just $80, saving you $70 for a limited time.</p>
