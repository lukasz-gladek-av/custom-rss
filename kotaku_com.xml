              <p>Last week, digital PC gaming storefront <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-anti-drm-cd-projekt-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2000659280">Good Old Games</a> (GOG) found itself at the center of online controversy after users claimed a banner ad for a big sales event was created using AI tools. The firestorm only grew larger when a GOG employee seemingly confirmed the ad was created using AI. However, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-caught-using-ai-generated-artwork-2000663836">GOG wouldn’t confirm with <em>Kotaku</em></a> how the banner ad was made. But it has since explained the situation to paying supporters in a private Discord server.</p> <p>On February 2, <em>Kotaku</em> received a screenshot of a message addressing the New Year Sale AI-generated banner situation that was posted in the official GOG Patron Discord server earlier in the day. This is a special Discord server created by GOG for fans who pay <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/patrons">$5 a month to be a part of the store’s Patron program</a>, which lets them talk to other like-minded users while helping to guide the future of the store and being credited when old games are saved.</p>

 <p>In the message, a GOG employee with the username Arthur Slay confirmed that the banner was made “with the help of AI tools” but claimed it was still a “work-in-progress” and wasn’t meant to be displayed on the store publicly. <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/author/artur/"><em>Kotaku</em> believes this user is a GOG marketing employee, Arthur Dejardin.</a></p> <p>“This shouldn’t have happened,” posted Arthur Slay. “We failed on at least two levels: Quality-control of the asset that landed on the front page, and then reacting quickly enough when we noticed the error.”</p>

 <p>Arthur further said that GOG hears all the “disappointment” and acknowledged that it’s “a sensitive topic for many of you.” As for why they used AI tools? Arthur says GOG has been testing different “technologies” ever since the store was founded. “Some experiments are successful, and some (like this banner) are not.” Arthur added: “Exploring various tech gives us the reach of a much larger team, so we never have to settle for doing less.”</p>

 <p>“I also want to be honest about how we chose to explore technology,” posted Arthur. “We don’t have the infinite resources of the industry giants. We’re a dedicated, but small team, working our asses off every day for game preservation. To keep that mission alive, bring more games back to life, and make more games DRM-free, we experiment with tools that can allow us to do more with the limited hands we have.”</p> <p>On January 30, after the ad was called out online in numerous places, GOG told <em>Kotaku</em> via email that it was unable to “comment publicly on our internal processes or tools.” <em>Kotaku</em> has contacted GOG about this Discord message and why the store didn’t share these details with us last week.</p> <hr> <p>Here is the full message from the private Discord as shared with <em>Kotaku</em>:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Hi everyone, I’d like to address the case of our recent New Year Sale banner.</em></p> <p><em>First of all, regarding the quality of the asset: This banner was a work-in-progress asset that we mistakenly allowed to be displayed on the storefront. This shouldn’t have happened. We failed on at least two levels: Quality-control of the asset that landed on the front page, and then reacting quickly enough when we noticed the error.</em><br> <em>Second, I want to confirm that this WIP asset was indeed made with the help of Al tools. We hear your disappointment with the use of this technology, and see that it’s a sensitive topic for many of you.</em></p> <p><em>I also want to be honest about how we chose to explore technology: We don’t have the infinite resources of the industry giants. We’re a dedicated, but small team, working our asses off every day for game preservation. To keep that mission alive, bring more games back to life, and make more games DRM-free, we experiment with tools that can allow us to do more with the limited hands we have.</em></p> <p><em>We’ve been testing different technologies since our beginnings. Some experiments are successful, and some (like this banner) are not. Exploring various tech gives us the reach of a much larger team, so we never have to settle for doing less.</em></p> <p><em>Lastly, I’m aware that some of you have concerns about a GOG team member leaving the Patrons Discord server. Please understand that in heated moments, people sometimes need to step back for their own well-being. That was a personal decision, and we respect it.</em></p> <p><em>Thank you, everyone,</em><br> <em>Arthur</em></p></blockquote>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> punishing dodge and parry windows are one of the RPG’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-parry-sakapetate-chromatic-troubadour-1851781507"><span>defining characteristics</span></a><span>. Enemies basically do a little dance before they bring their weapon down on your party, and you’re expected to memorize and dodge every pattern lest you end up dead before your Gommage. Naturally, fans took this as a challenge, and one person has finally beaten Sandfall Interactive’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161"><span>GOTY sweeper</span></a><span> without taking any damage.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber Hayete Bahadori has uploaded a four-hour </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>walkthrough showcasing a damageless run using only one party member in every fight the game allows. Three encounters require you to have a party of three, which doesn’t count against the rules Bahadori set because they’re hardcoded into the game. Pulling off a run like this requires intimate knowledge of just about every required enemy encounter in the game, and Bahadori’s commentary running through each fight sheds plenty of light on patterns that players typically only pick up after repeat plays. If you want to watch the full thing, you can do so below, but it also has time stamps for the big boss fights if you want to jump to a specific encounter.</span></p>

  <p><span>Bahadori says in a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1qs6wtk/i_completed_expedition_33_on_expert_using_a_solo/"><span>Reddit AMA</span></a><span> that the hardest fight to pull off was actually the final battle against Renoir, which has some of the trickiest attack patterns. Despite the video evidence, some </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>fans were skeptical that the game could be beaten without taking any damage, as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>emotional damage of its tragic story</span></a><span> is not so easily parried. To which Bahadori responded, “you caught me.”</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the inevitable </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> sequel</span></a><span> will give speedrunners a chance to dodge and parry their way through some crazy attack patterns once again. Or hey, maybe whatever Sandfall Interactive cooks up next will be something completely different. It sounds like the studio is trying </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall-interactive-sequel-2000656692"><span>not to feel beholden to any specific expectations</span></a><span>, so who knows?</span></p>

              <p><span>Just as the noise from the fan outcry about the disappointing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> finale</span></a><span> was starting to die down, another project from the Netflix sci-fi series is putting the Hawkins kids back in the limelight. </span><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85</span></i><span> is an animated series that takes place between the main series’ second and third seasons, and all things considered, it looks pretty good in its first trailer.</span></p> <p><span>Netflix has pegged the show as a more kid-friendly “Saturday morning cartoon” take on </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, and it definitely comes off that way based on the clips we’ve seen thus far. It’s colorful, packed with jokes, and even the evil creatures from the Upside Down are kinda cute in its </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span>-esque art style. The main cast of characters are returning in the series, but they are notably not voiced by any of their live-action actors. All of them are grown now, so they probably couldn’t voice their younger selves anyway, and they definitely sound like kids in this first trailer, which you can view below:</span></p>

  <p><span>While the fifth and final season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> created a whirlwind of controversy after some fans were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>disappointed in its conclusion</span></a><span>, even prompting some to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>spin a conspiracy theory</span></a><span> that a secret finale was coming that would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>address all their grievances</span></a><span>, maybe </span><i><span>Tales from ‘85 </span></i><span>could serve as a low-stakes palate cleanser? I also wouldn’t be surprised, though, if the people who were that dissatisfied with season 5 just wash their hands of the series altogether and don’t watch the show. Which is valid. Live your truth, Byler shippers. Just, you know, be normal about it instead of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307"><span>harassing the creators of the show</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85 </span></i><span>will premiere on Netflix on April 23.</span></p>
