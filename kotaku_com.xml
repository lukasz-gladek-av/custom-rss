            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The thing that surprises me most about these personal GOTY lists, which I’ve been doing most years since I started working at <em>Kotaku</em> (including in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2023-zelda-cyberpunk-baldur-s-gate-3-a-1851130971">delivery room for my third child</a>), is just how little I remember them after they go up. I could guess what was on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gach-s-top-10-games-of-2020-1845962135">2020 list</a>, or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gachs-top-10-games-of-2018-1831323132">2018 one</a>, or my very first one from 2016, but I would probably get half of them wrong.</p> <p>The dirty little secret about these lists, at least for me, is how fluid and ephemeral they are. What was in my top 10 shifted throughout the year and that variance didn’t stop once the list was published. I lock in my choice but always harbor doubts, not just about the games themselves but most of all about my own ambivalent feelings toward them. Those change, evolve, and usually just get more complicated over time.</p>

 <p>Each of those lists would probably be different if I compiled them today. But that’s sort of the point. They are snapshots of what I thought I felt at the time. Maybe they help, even if only slightly, to clarify someone else’s feelings about one of their favorite games of the year. Or, even better, turn them onto something they hadn’t already tried. I know, though, that mostly we all just skim the lists to see how much they overlap with our own, and what we think that says about our own tastes and the other person’s. So if you haven’t already skipped ahead, here are my top games of 2025 in alphabetical order:</p>

 <h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656028"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656028">Sad Socket</figcaption></figure> <p>A beautifully elegant mash-up of minimalist tower defense strategy and roguelike deckbuilding, <em>9 Kings</em> is still in Early Access and already pretty much everything I want it to be. The introduction of a quest mode late in the year basically added an entire second game. Nothing brought me more joy this year than snuggling up on the couch and watching my brain-dead synergies scale in unexpectedly deadly ways.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655381"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655381">Embark Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is the first modern game to get me to break my “no mic with randos” rule. But <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ real trick is just how rewarding it makes playing the multiplayer extraction format as a solo outsider. It does a wonderful job of blending immersive PVE encounters with unpredictable PVP run-ins in a way that adds to the richness of the sci-fi world rather than making it feel like a series of incentive-driven hamster wheels. Solid gunplay, great atmosphere, rewarding progression.</p>

 <h2><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000017750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000017750"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000017750">Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, a tight-knit sci-fi TTRPG, feels practically sprawling compared to the first game. That scope can occasionally get unwieldy or see the game run into pacing issues, but the fusion of dice-roll skill checks and light resource management with branching dialogue and player choice yields an unforgettably grim but evocative voyage through cosmic backwaters on the decline. Never have the stakes been so high for even the most trivial tasks. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> reminded me that letting go is often hard but necessary, and that knowing it isn’t the same thing as actually doing it.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002350"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002350">Image: Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p>Everyone’s favorite French-infused, Unreal Engine 5 reskin of <em>Final Fantasy X</em> is as good as they say. I’m not on board with all of the game’s narrative choices, and I’m less impressed by the apparent novelty of a good JRPG in the year 2025 than some, but<em> Clair Obscur</em> is rock solid in so many departments and sets a new gold-standard for (non-tactical) turn-based combat. The writing and performances are especially superb, and none of it would amount to a hill of beans without the (mostly) excellent soundtrack.</p>

 <h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000896">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If we judged games by merely by the sum of the joy or boredom they produced moment-to-moment, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> would not rank very highly. But games are more than just graphs of the emotions they produce across dozens of hours of playtime.<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is an ambitiously chaotic action platforming collectathon that feels incredibly novel for the first five to eight hours, loses all steam and inventiveness in the second and third acts, and then comes roaring back with one of the best closers of any modern Nintendo game. Could <em>Bananza</em> have been more? Probably. Was it enough? Definitely.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001602">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Nightreign</em> is an excellent action-RPG but a top-notch multiplayer game. It uses the superficial trappings of a <em>Fortnite</em>-like battle royale to completely reinvent open-world exploration, problem solving, and the classic FromSoftware boss fight. It’s less like being thrust into an i-frame boot camp than embarking on a road trip where you know the car will lose a tire, run out of gas, and stall out in the worst possible place, but persevere and the place where you break down in the middle of the night will soon begin to feel like the home you never knew you missed.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The best RPG job system to ever do it, combined with an A-tier story and S-tier music, yields an all-time classic that never fails to prove why so many people are still obsessed with it, whether you give it one hour or 20. The remaster is overly cautious with improvements and stingy with new content, but it avoids the cardinal sin of trying and failing to improve on what was already a masterpiece.</p>

 <h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628704"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628704">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>Last month I went to an Italian restaurant and ordered their Spicy Crab Vodka. The first bite was surprisingly delicious. Every bite after that was equally delicious. The fact that every bite from beginning to end effectively tasted the same did not diminish the dish’s overall effect, or how much I still think about it. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> feels a bit like that. What it lacks in variety or novelty, it more than makes up for with quality, craftmanship, and the confidence to know exactly what it is and be the best version of that. It’s impressively huge and uncompromisingly slick, backed up by great writing and some incredible performances.</p> <h2><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of great 2D action games this year. None of them, in scope, precision, and ambition, ultimately held a candle to <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. It incorporates some of the tried-and-true elements of Metroidvanias and Soulslikes but transforms them into a unique, intimate, at times frustratingly galling journey that asks a lot of you but is generous with its rewards. It’s not perfect, but the flaws it does have only come into focus because of everything else it nails. On my deathbed a snow globe will slip from my hands and crash onto the floor as I mutter the name “Bell Beast.”</p>

 <h2><em>Split Fiction</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000005179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005179">Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s never a good sign when I want to start off an entry with some sort of acknowledgement of a game’s biggest weakness, but maybe it’s a testament to just how insanely smartly designed <em>Split Fiction</em> is that its trite premise and often grating banter did not substantially detract from the whole experience. <em>Split Fiction</em> is so effortlessly good at what it does, it makes it easy to overlook just how infrequent it is to get such a tightly paced, well-balanced action-adventure, particularly one that keeps finding ingenious ways to one-up itself all the way through to the very end.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/these-are-the-guys-who-brought-gta-v-s-thug-trio-to-lif-1333412658">Actor Ned Luke,</a> who portrays Michael De Santa in <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and <em>GTA Online,</em> has been swatted a lot. In fact, he gets swatted so often that in a recent clip going viral online, it appears that he and one of the officers checking on the call know each other by name after so many run-ins.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2651379727?tt_content=full_vod_button&amp;tt_medium=clips_watch_page&amp;t=0h37m32s">during a <em>GTA Online</em> livestream with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> voice actor Rob Wiethoff</a>, Ned Luke was swatted by someone. While Luke played the game live on Twitch, two police officers were invited into his house by someone. One of the officers then yelled out to Luke, “You’re being swatted again!” as he entered the room. Here’s the clip from the December 23 stream as shared by YouTube channel IceBladeNinja.</p>  <div> <p>Swatting is the act of calling the police on someone who is streaming in the hopes that law enforcement will arrest or disrupt the content creator. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting#Injuries_or_deaths_due_to_swatting">It’s a dangerous thing to do</a> in a country like the United States, which has armed officers ready to open fire.</p> <p>This most recent swatting incident for Luke happened about <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nedluke/clip/BloodyEnergeticVanillaHoneyBadger-tg-qEFmBN165JTKk">30 minutes into the stream</a>. After a short and friendly chat with law enforcement, Luke continued broadcasting on Twitch for another hour and a half. Based on publicly posted information from the actor, this appears to be at least the eighth time since late 2023 that the 67-year-old has been swatted while streaming online. That might explain why the police officers in the clip above seem so chill, and one of them appears to be on a first-name basis with the actor.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-michael-actor-ned-luke-swatted-while-playing-on-thanksgiving-stream">In November 2023, on Thanksgiving,</a> Luke was swatted. He posted about the incident online, <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1728128625734742489">claiming it was the sixth time</a> it had happened to him due to his private details, like his address, being leaked online in the past. <a href="https://gamevro.com/ned-luke-gta-5-voice-actor-swatted-again-livestream/">On December 29, 2023</a>, Luke was once again swatted, this time with police officers calling him and asking the actor to step outside. ‘</p> <p>Hopefully Luke won’t have to put up with frequent swatting in the future. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSv1RJVkezG/">On December 27, the actor posted on Instagram</a> that at least one person involved with swatting him was now facing federal charges and would be in court in January of 2026 over their alleged swatting activity. “Fuck around and find out,” said Luke on Instagram. “Many more names discovered and provided.”</p> </div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-top-selling-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-digital-foundry-2000655990</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve has revealed the official list of best-selling games on Steam for 2025. They include everything you’d expect, plus a few surprises. <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> ended up beating out <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and others for a spot in the top dozen, despite being recently labeled as one of the worst PC ports of the year by <em>Digital Foundry</em>.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025">full list of the top 24 best-selling new Steam games,</a> broken up into two sections. The games within the sections are in no particular order. First, the top 12:</p> <ul> <li><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></li> <li><em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em></li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 26 </em></li> <li><em>Borderlands 4 </em></li> <li><em>Schedule I </em></li> <li><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></li> <li><em>Civilization VII </em></li> <li><em>Battlefield 6 </em></li> <li><em>Dune Awakening </em></li> <li><em>Arc Raiders </em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em></li> </ul> <p>And numbers 13-24:</p> <ul> <li><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em></li> <li><em>Dispatch </em></li> <li><em>Dying Light: The Beast </em></li> <li><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana </em></li> <li><em>Europa Universalis V </em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em></li> <li><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></li> <li><em>Split Fiction </em></li> <li><em>Inzoi </em></li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em></li> <li><em>Stellar Blade </em></li> <li><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></li> </ul> <p>The list includes the big blockbusters, but also more hardcore historical strategy games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em></a> and <em>Europa Universalis V</em>. I was surprised to see <em>Civilization 7</em> in the top 12 despite its launch woes and fan discontent around some of the new features and the content-light end game. But then again, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> secured a top spot as well despite miserable user ratings as fans await still much-needed optimization patches.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s action-RPG also made <em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s list of the worst PC ports of 2025. The technical analysts there still seem flummoxed by how badly the game runs, even after its latest Title 4 Update, and even as the publisher’s upcoming work like <em>Pragmata</em> and <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> appears to be doing just fine on the platform. “Definitely one of the poorest games I’ve reviewed in a long time from a technical performance perspective,” Alex Battaglia said during the outlet’s <a href="https://youtu.be/s3_0yhXDKTs">annual look back video</a>.</p>

 <p>Capcom has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579">bigger performance improvements in 2026</a>, but even those will be spread out across a couple of months. It’ll be the one-year anniversary of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ launch and PC players will still be waiting to see if the game will finally be passable on that platform or if it’ll continue to run with framerate hitching and texture pop-in, among other issues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Z-A Leak Is A Fascinating Look At The Game We Didn’t Get]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-leak-video-old-build-teraleak-window-2000655988</link>
            <guid>1394005</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kenneth-shepards-top-10-games-of-2025-pokemon-hundred-2000655496"><span>I loved </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, but looking at a game in every stage of its development is inevitably going to make you wish a studio had been able to implement every idea it had into the final product. The infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>Game Freak Teraleak</span></a><span> from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>last year</span></a><span> has given us a pretty thorough look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> journey from design doc to finished game, and while it’s interesting to see these screenshots and pieces of test footage, it also has fans weighing in on Game Freak’s processes and sharing how they feel about the final product now that they’ve seen how the sausage was made.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sdVmay2ky0"><span>TurtleBro</span></a><span> compiled all his findings in the Teraleak into a feature-length video that goes chronologically through </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s development files dating back to 2022, shortly after work on </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> had wrapped up. Some files are from so early in the process that Game Freak was using </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>’ Irida as a placeholder for the player. These screenshots and videos show some cut content and features, like additional building interiors to explore, being able to use overworld abilities around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, and even some additional multiplayer modes that had players throwing Poké Balls at one another, dodgeball style.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps most surprising in these early builds is a much </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>higher level of environmental detail</span></a><span> than we see in the final game. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> was memed to hell and back for its flat-textured buildings, and some of the first pieces of footage TurtleBro shows off include windows and building structures that are much more detailed. In January of 2023, many of these assets were swapped for something similar to the flat ones we have in the game now, and internal notes suggest this downgrade was a “burden” on the team. It’s here you can see a lot of the game’s initial ambitions get pulled back, though some things, like the real-time, action-based combat system, started to take shape here, albeit in a more third-person shooter style than the command-based one we have now. By March of that year, the team was on track to deliver the game we got, and morale started to improve.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s one aspect of the development timeline that is kind of fascinating considering 2024 was the first time in quite a few years since there wasn’t a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><span>or expansion</span></a><span>: it sounds like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was feature complete by June 2024, and Game Freak spent around 16 months on polish before it launched the game on October 16, 2025. </span></p>

 <p><span>TurtleBro speculates that the reason the game’s visuals were deliberately downgraded was to give the team the year to spend refining the game in order to avoid a massive performance fiasco like the one that surrounded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> in 2022</span></a><span>, though others who viewed the game less charitably </span><a href="https://x.com/soulsilverart/status/2005368278689222901"><span>suspect Game Freak may have just shelved </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> for over a year and moved onto a new project, rather than using that time for meaningful iteration. It’s unclear, however, as the development details stop at this point; the Teraleak occurred in August, and thus, we don’t have any more of these design docs that might confirm the team’s thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span>Overall, it’s a fascinating look at how </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> went from concept to finished game, and TurtleBro does a great job of comparing images of aspects of the game from early in development to what those aspects look and play like in the actual, released game you can play on your Switch or Switch 2. Check out the full video below:</span></p>

  <p><span>I do mourn some of the stuff we lost in the development process, but that’s the risk you take when you look at unfinished work. The video puts the leaks we’ve seen from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> into perspective, serving as a reminder that several of the mechanics and concepts those leaks have revealed may not make it into the final product, either. We’ll know for sure when those games are revealed, which will likely happen for the series’ 30th anniversary next year.</span></p>

              <p>Like everything else that was once popular, the early 2000s Fox TV comedy <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> is returning in Spring 2026 with stars <a href="https://kotaku.com/shop-contest-frankie-muniz-winners-1838809743">Frankie Muniz</a>, Bryan Cranston, and Jane Kaczmarek all back to reprise their roles as Malcom, Hal, and Lois, respectively.</p> <p>On December 29, Disney and Hulu released the first trailer for <a href="https://people.com/frankie-muniz-malcolm-in-the-middle-reboot-trailer-exclusive-11875191"><em>Life’s Still Unfair</em></a>, an upcoming 4-episode<em> Malcom in the Middle</em> miniseries event set around 20 years after the original show, which ran from 2000 to 2006 on Fox. Here’s the trailer:</p>

  <p>And here’s the official synopsis for the miniseries, which will be exclusively available on Hulu and Disney+:</p> <blockquote><p>“After shielding himself and his daughter from his family for over a decade, Malcolm is dragged back into their orbit when Hal and Lois demand his presence at their 40th anniversary party.”</p></blockquote> <p>As a young pre-teen in the early 2000s, I watched a lot of <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> during the show’s original run on TV. But like a lot of people, according to ratings data, I remember my family vaguely checking out around season four. Two years later, the show was canceled due to low ratings. Of course, nostalgia for content from this era is reaching its highest point as people who grew up in that era are now entering their 30s. So Malcolm and his family will soon return to TV (or internet streaming TV) as Hollywood execs and number crunchers hope to squeeze out as much profit and viewership from this reheated revival as they can before they move on to the next somewhat popular TV show or movie from about 20 years ago.</p>

 <p>I love leftovers as much as the next guy, but I’m not sure I need every TV show and movie I grew up with to return for what often ends up being forgettable and tired reunions. Anyway, <em>Malcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair</em> will premiere on Hulu and Disney+ on April 10, 2026. Regardless of how I feel about the revival, the show’s opening song still kicks ass.</p>

              <p>If you’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> vibes from the new trailer for <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em>, you’re not alone. Some are pointing to the upcoming RPG as evidence that we’re about to get lot of copycats trying to ape the 2025 Game of the Year’s aura, similar to the wave of open-world games that borrowed elements from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>after that game’s incredible success. But <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> didn’t spring up out of nowhere, and the series it’s a part of has a long history of its own.</p> <p>“This single-player&nbsp;turn-based RPG is reborn in Unreal Engine 5 with the latest technology,” publisher CubeGame <a href="https://twitter.com/CubeGameCN/status/2005594647792656573">announced on Monday</a>. “Set off on a journey to find the immortals with Tianhe Yun’s team. In the meantime, a hidden truth that has been sealed for a long time is revealing itself.” The update was accompanied by a fresh trailer that’s been turning heads for both its high production values and its flashy turn-based combat.</p>

  <p>That last part is the biggest reason why the game’s been drawing comparisons to <em>Clair Obscur</em>. Like this year’s hit RPG, <em>Sword and Fairy 4:</em> <em>Remake</em> seems to feature cinematic battle animations with lots of motion blur and slowdown, as well as a command wheel integrated into the scene rather than situated off to the side with the rest of the HUD. The fact that the whole thing is in Unreal Engine 5 adds another level of hyper-realistic sheen reminiscent of <em>Clair Obscur</em>.</p>

 <p>But while the internet has a penchant for condensing new stuff down into familiar buzz phrases and using the most popular things as lenses for understanding everything else, <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. Quoting one site’s post about the game that called it a “<em>Clair Obscur</em>-like,” <em>The CRPG Book </em>editor <a href="https://crpgbook.wordpress.com/">Felipe Pepe</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felipepepe.bsky.social/post/3mb4tg7zfjk2v">wrote</a>, “I really hate how games media handles anything out of China. We’re getting a gorgeous remake of one of their best RPGs ever, but the clown does zero research about it and just goes ‘I’m getting a lot of Boss Baby vibes from this…'”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The original Sword and Fairy 4 looked like this, the second screenshot is the remake, and the third is Expedition 33.  </p> <p>The only bar you have to clear is to recognize shape and colors at this point, and you are failing miserably. My 3-year old cousin can see the similarities <a href="https://t.co/HCNNmqtPFV">https://t.co/HCNNmqtPFV</a> <a href="https://t.co/0X9sXdrz9o">pic.twitter.com/0X9sXdrz9o</a></p> <p>— Dream's Longest Day (@Dreamboum) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/2005678913092231639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The first <em>The Legend of Sword and Fairy</em> launched for MS-DOS in 1995 and served as an analogue to <em>Final Fantasy</em> rooted in Chinese mythology, but it was never localized outside of East Asia. The most recent entry was 2021’s <em>Sword and Fairy 7</em> which abandoned turn-based combat for real-time action and is available on both PC and console. <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em>, meanwhile, is an update to the 2007 entry which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621680/Sword_and_Fairy_4/">also happens to be available on Steam</a>. It only looks like<em> Clair Obscur</em> to the degree that all turn-based battle RPGs have you similarly watching a static row of fighters enact the commands you select from a menu.</p>

 <p>It’s definitely possible that <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> developer UP software has leaned into some of the stylistic RPG design choices we now associate with <em>Clair Obscur</em> in the year since that game blew up (trailers for it were getting fans hyped well before its 2025 release, too). But <em>Clair Obscur</em> owes some of those elements, including its flashy command wheel, to series that came before it, like <em>Persona</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-director-says-jrpg-3-0-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-at-a-fundamental-level-2000647233">As RPG fans have been reminding each other a lot this year</a>, the genre extends well beyond <em>Final Fantasy</em> and a certain modern French riff on the franchise.</p>

 <p>Maybe <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em><em>&nbsp;</em>will be the latest one to help players continue to expand their turn-based horizons.</p>
