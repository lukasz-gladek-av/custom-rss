              <p>Christmas might be over, but that won’t stop retailers and digital stores from offering up deals themed around wintertime. Case in point: GOG’s big new Winter Classics Promo, which features over 1,000 heavily discounted old PC games.</p> <p>Kicking off on January 6, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20260106-winter-classics-promo?order=desc:trending">the new GOG Winter Classics Promo</a> sees the storefront dedicated to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">selling and preserving games</a>, offering up some of its older titles for up to 95 percent off. The sale runs from now until January 20, and given the weather, it is a good time to curl up with some classic PC games under a warm blanket and have a cozy night. As always, games bought on GOG don’t feature any DRM or the need to download a launcher or digital app. You just buy it, download it, install it, and play it.</p> <p>So here are some of the highlights from this massive GOG sale.</p> <ul> <li><em>Theme Hospital – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 3 GOTY Edition – $7 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout New Vegas – $10 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 4: GOTY Edition – $16 ($40)</em></li> <li><em>Dungeon Keeper GOLD – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Dungeon Keeper 2 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Roller Coaster Tycoon – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 – $5 (10)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 2000 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 3000 – $5 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 4 – $5 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Thief Gold – $1.80 ($7)</em></li> <li><em>Thief 2 – $1.80 ($7)</em></li> <li><em>Thief 3 – $1.80 ($9)</em></li> <li><em>Medal of Honor War Chest – $5 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Ultima Underworld 1-2 – $3 ($6)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Jade Empire – $4 ($15)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Syberia – $1.30 ($13)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Ultima 1-3 – $3 ($6)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Ultima 4-6 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Far Cry – $3 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Far Cry 2 – $3 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Spore Collection – $30 ($15)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Torchlight 2 – $4 ($20)</em></li> </ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752</link>
            <guid>1399618</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax, the Nova Scotia-based mobile team in Ubisoft’s stable of studios, announced that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"><span>it was unionizing back in December</span></a><span>. Ubisoft swears up and down that what came next was decided before 61 of its 71 employees joined the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada, and if that’s actually the case, Ubisoft sure stepped on a massive rake by shutting down the studio just weeks after organizing members made the union official.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/"><i><span>Gamesindustry.biz</span></i></a><span>, Ubisoft said the call came not from a cruel union-busting effort, but as part of years-long cost-cutting initiative on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> company’s part.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” the statement reads. “As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if this is the case, the optics are bad. Ubisoft has been undergoing a lot of reorganization in the past few years, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>layoffs at subsidiaries like </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws </span></i><span>developer Massive</span></a><span> and top level personnel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542"><span>leaving the company</span></a><span> as it continues to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161"><span>drastically reduce its workforce</span></a><span> after Tencent bailed it out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796"><span>to the tune of $1.25 billion</span></a><span>. So yeah, it might not be union busting, but the whole thing still deserves your “boos” and tomatoes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax had developed two free-to-play games based on some of Ubisoft’s biggest properties:</span><i><span> Rainbow Six Mobile </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</span></i><span>. It’s unclear how this will affect </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Mobile</span></i><span>, which was set for a global release on February 23. </span></p>

              <p>Oh great gaming gods, hear our prayer: Please may 2026 prove to be the year in which the AI bubble bursts. Amen. A rather splendid sign of at least one big-name tech company backing away from the bullshit claims comes from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/dells-ces-2026-chat-was-the-most-pleasingly-un-ai-briefing-ive-had-in-maybe-5-years/">a <em>PC Gamer</em> interview</a> with Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, who outright stated that consumers just don’t care about AI, and aren’t drawn in by its addition to products.</p> <p>“What we’ve learned over the course of this year,” says Terwilliger to&nbsp;<em>PCG</em>‘s Dave James, “especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI. In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”</p>

 <p>This is not to say that Dell is backing away from AI as a feature within its tech (baby steps), but rather is just avoiding mentioning the topic during its latest raft of announcements during CES 2026. James reports that the Dell presentation from vice chairman Jeff Clarke only mentioned the near-meaningless two letters once, and in a pejorative fashion, saying “we have this un-met promise of AI.” Instead, the speech focused on new laptops and desktop computers, the challenges of tariffs, and some shiny new monitors. You know, like hardware manufacturers used to do.</p>

 <p>So when Dave James spoke to Dell’s Kevin Terwilliger, he brought up how conspicuous the topic was in its absence, given the tedious ubiquity of the subject for the last few years. “One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Terwilliger told <em>PCG</em>. “So a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”</p>

 <p>What strikes me most about this is not the lack of being AI-forward, but the willingness to call out that it was dumb to have been so in 2025. While he adds that “we’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device,” the change in emphasis feels very significant.</p>

 <p>The reality is, “AI” as a term means so many different things in so many different circumstances that it’s useless. For decades, in gaming, it was the term used to describe the programmed behavior of NPCs, until it was clumsily repurposed by companies like OpenAI, Google, and X to instead be shorthand for “generative-AI” like LLMs, the plagiarism machines that are fed all the content of the internet and then regurgitate it in slightly different, significantly less accurate forms. But when computer manufacturers use it, it’s something else all over again, software that “learns” based on experience, allowing for high-speed adjustments to ideally improve performance. In that sense, it’s somewhat more like the algorithms being used in scientific research to dramatically speed up fields like medical research, also usually just called “AI.”</p>

 <p>So hurrah to Dell for being bold enough to back away from the bullshit. May it be the first of very many, as we start to see “AI” exposed as the grift it truly has become, and hopefully a new emphasis on celebrating creativity and originality, whether it’s aided by AI-driven GPUs or not.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marshall Slashes Its On-Ear Wireless Headphones to Nearly 50% Off, Rivaling Sony Deals]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marshall-slashes-its-on-ear-wireless-headphones-to-nearly-50-off-rivaling-sony-deals-2000657681</link>
            <guid>1399504</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Marshall makes some of the best audio gear on the market. If you want to hear bold, rich sound with deeper bass on the go, we recommend checking the Marshall Major V on-ear headphones out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">These typically sit at $170, but you can grab a pair for just $90 at Amazon today, after the retailer took 47% off the usual price</a>. This offer applies to the black color option. Other models are discounted, too. For instance, the brown and cream versions are sitting at $87. The blue option, on the other hand, is going for $100.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Durable Design, Bold Sound</h2>
<p>Major V headphones feature a rugged design that’s durable and made to handle everyday wear and tear quite well. The pair folds down for compact storage, making it easy to carry these around with you. When not in use, fold the headphones down, toss them into a bag, and get going!</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy the classic Marshall sound for all your favorite tracks. Expect thunderous bass, smooth mids, and crisp treble that bring music to life. Whether you’re listening to a podcast, streaming a show, or just vibing to an energy-filled song, audio comes through with exceptional clarity, with tunes felt deep into your bones. Even better, the audio doesn’t distort when you pump the volume all the way up, which is great for when you really want to immerse yourself in a track.</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is push and hold the control knob on the headphone until the LED turns to a slow blue pulse. Enable Bluetooth on your phone and select Major V from the list of available Bluetooth devices. Once the devices have been paired, download the Marshall Bluetooth app and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. There’s a customizable M-button on one of the earcups, which can be used to access custom actions. By default, the button action is Spotify Tap, but you can tweak it to something else using the Marshall app. For instance, you can use it to launch EQ settings on the app or enable a voice assistant for hands-free management.</p>
<p>Battery life is exceptional and better than most other options in the same range. A single charge gets you up to 100 hours of playback, which is more than enough to go an entire week without running low! When it comes to recharging, the headphones support wired and wireless options. For wireless charging, you can place the right ear cup flat down on a compatible charging pad. When the LED light turns on, it indicates that the headphones are successfully being charged. It takes around 3 hours to fully recharge the pair.</p>
<p>Just note that Major V headphones aren’t water resistant, so we won’t recommend taking them to the pool or in the shower. If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, now is a great time to pick the pair up without paying the full price. These deliver superior sound that helps you enjoy your favorite music to the fullest. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">Act fast, though, as we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon. Multiple color options are discounted, so you can pick the version that fits your aesthetics the best.</a></p>
