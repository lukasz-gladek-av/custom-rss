            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Itâ€™s cooling down where I live, which makes me so damn happy. Anyway, welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>â€˜s daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we got a big update for a classic indie game, a way to get <em>Borderlands 4</em> for free, a hidden mode in <em>Silksong</em>, and Treyarch making more changes to what will and wonâ€™t transfer into next yearâ€™s <em>Call of Duty.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Treyarch Changes Its Plans With (Some) <em>Black Ops 6</em> Skins Again</h2> <p>The <em>Call of Duty</em> wacky cosmetics saga continues. Last month, following a large online<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-call-of-duty-wacky-weird-skins-dev-explains-1851719188"> backlash against ugly crossover skins</a> and serious competition from<em> Battlefield 6</em>â€˜s popular and grounded beta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Activision and Treyarch announced that <em>BLOPS6â€²</em>s skins wonâ€™t carry over into </a><em>Black Ops 7.</em> The idea was to give the upcoming sequel a fresh start and not have people running around as Stan Smith from <em>American Dad</em> on day one. A lot of people liked this change, but not everyone was happy that the skins theyâ€™d worked hard for would not be moving forward. So uh, Treyarch is making some more changes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">That's not all! The Guild Override camo is joining the Zombies Main Quest Reward &amp; "New Orders" Operator skins, and will be available at the launch of Black Ops 7 for those who digitally Pre-Order ðŸ”¥ <a href="https://t.co/Jz3GoZZyTq">pic.twitter.com/Jz3GoZZyTq</a></p> <p>â€” Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1965567701574975757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1965567701574975757">On September 10, Treyarch announced on social media</a> that some zombie-related skins would now carry over into<em> Black Ops 7</em>. Specifically, the Operator Skin rewards earned by completing main quests and the New Orders Prestige Level 1000 cosmetic items. So no, it doesnâ€™t seem like all the wacky crossover skins from last year will be showing up in <em>Black Ops 7</em>, but who knows? Treyarch and Activision are changing things up so fast right now that in a few weeks, this might all be out the window. Itâ€™s almost like Activision is a bit nervous about how much of a bite <em>Battlefield 6</em> might take out of it this holiday season.</p>

 <h2>Drink Enough Beers, And You Might Get A Free Copy Of <em>Borderlands 4</em></h2> <p>Do you like drinking beer? Do you like <em>Borderlands 4</em>? Do you like free video games? Are you tired of answering my questions? Well, Iâ€™ll stop and explain that Gearbox, 2K, and beer maker Voodoo Ranger have teamed up for a new promotion. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-beer-includes-a-copy-of-the-game-if-youre-lucky/1100-6534578/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">As spotted by <em>GameSpot</em></a>, a bunch of specifically branded Voodoo Ranger beers will contain various <em>Borderlands 4</em> rewards, including 1,000 free copies of <em>Borderlands 4.</em> So to have a decent shot, all you need to do is buy like 200 beers, and that probably isnâ€™t very expensive, right? I donâ€™t drink booze, so let me do a quick search online andâ€¦oh my god!</p> <h2>Thereâ€™s A Hidden, Much Harder Mode In <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p>Since the moment it was released earlier this month, popular 2D action platformer <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has been at the center of quite the discourse around video game difficulty. Some people say itâ€™s too hard, others say itâ€™s not too bad, and still others are just skipping all of this and modding the game to make it easier. Well, donâ€™t worry, thereâ€™s a secret difficulty option hidden in the game behind the Konami cheat code. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n8d1xc/cheat_code_discovery_not_joke/">But this newly discovered secret mode</a> actually makes <em>Silksong</em> much, much harder as you can only die once. Good luck with that!</p> <h2>The 14-Year-Old <em>Binding Of Issac</em> Just Got A Massive Update</h2> <p>Yeah, sure, the creator behind 2011â€™s roguelike classic<em> The Binding of Issac</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-years-after-it-was-announced-binding-of-isaac-creator-finally-shares-a-release-date-for-his-next-game-2000623148">recently announced </a>the release date for his long-awaited next game, but that doesnâ€™t mean he canâ€™t keep working on his OG hit. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/521976260528701584">On September 9, Edmund McMillen announced a big new update for </a><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/521976260528701584"><em>Isaac</em></a> that includes many, many changes and tweaks to the beloved indie game. I expect Iâ€™ll be in my 60s and still reading about new updates for this game.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> looks even better on Switch 2 now</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-car-cloud-gaming-lg-kia-2000624462">Apparently, your car might be an Xbox.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/9-things-you-need-to-know-before-starting-elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-new-hard-mode.1293780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>â€˜s new hard mode, Deep of Night, is about to go live, and publisher Bandai Namco has released a new explainer on YouTube helping to onboard fans to the multiplayer rogueliteâ€™s most challenging content yet. Combined with reams of datamined clues over the past month, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect heading into it. FromSoftware will no doubt have a few surprise curveballs hiding up its sleeve, but the announced changes alone should be enough to make even veteran Nightfarers feel like naÃ¯ve grist for the Soulslike mill all over again.</p> <h2>When does Deep of Night go live?</h2>  <p>In keeping with all past updates, <em>Nightreign</em>â€˜s new mode is set to be available in the game starting around 9:00 p.m. ET on September 10 across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</p> <h2>Nightlords and shifting Earth events will be completely random</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624683">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>In Deep of Night, players wont get to pick which bosses they face ahead of time, or choose which Shifting Earth events are active. Relic choices and builds will all have to be adapted to on the fly. Youâ€™ll want to have multiple relic presets ready so you can choose after seeing what Nightlord youâ€™re facing before the match loads.</p>

 <h2>Enemies hit way harder</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624682"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624682">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>A clip from the Deep of Night trailer shows trash mobs taking several more hits to fall at the start of a run. According to datamines, most enemies in the first depth will have around double their normal health and power, with stats only ramping up from there.</p> <h2>Items come with more buffs and debuffs</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624680" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624680"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624680">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Players will have to be a lot more careful about what they pick up when theyâ€™re running around Limveld. While gear comes with extra buff slots, it also comes with a debuff that will make it easier to die. Examples shown include status ailment buildup upon getting hit and taking more damage from the Nightâ€™s Tide.</p>

 <h2>New red mutated enemies are extra tough but drop new rare gear</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624681"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624681">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>These variants will be even stronger, potentially stopping a run dead in its tracks. Hoping to swoop through a mine for a quick crafting stone? Thought you could demolish that Cathedral golem all by yourself? Not this time! But with the greater risk comes greater rewards. It seems like these red enemies will also drop red gear with new powers that will probably end up making or breaking runs.</p> <h2>Additional Deep Relic slots expand buildcrafting</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624678" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624678"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624678">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Players will have access to three additional relic slots that can only be filled with relics earned from Deep of Night. Thatâ€™s because these will each come with negative stats as well as positive ones. According to datamines, examples include ones that completely invert characterâ€™s usual stat progressions. Fighters can become spell casters, squishy glass cannons can become tanks. It looks like Deep of Night will completely turn the established build metas on their heads.</p>

 <h2>Sometimes the map will be completely empty</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624677"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624677">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>There are at least two randomly occurring events we currently know about in Deep of Night. The first will hide the Nightlord icon for the entire run so you have no idea who youâ€™re facing at the end. The other will erase every icon from the map so you have no idea what camps are where. Players will just have to wing it or rely on their memorization of the probabilities from the hundreds of randomized seeds a run can pull from.</p> <h2>Completing runs earns rank points to unlock challenging depths</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624684"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624684">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>This scoring system will double as a skill-based matchmaking system for grouping you with other Deep of Night players. Once you progress out of Depth 1 you can never go back, but every Depth after that can see you pushed back to an earlier one if you keep failing.</p>

 <h2>Everdark Sovereign bosses can appear</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624675"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624675">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Thatâ€™s right, ED Libra and the gang could be what greets you at the end of an already harrowing run. Good thing youâ€™ve spent months practicing each of those variants, right? Right??</p> <h2>The Bell Bearing Hunter just got scarier</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624679" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624679"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624679">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>The gameâ€™s hardest field boss can also be one of its red variants. Have fun! Iâ€™m sure wasting five minutes trying to kill him will be totally worth it. If you want to find out more about what to expect out of Deep of Night before embarking on your own run, YouTuber Scavinjx <a href="https://youtu.be/Lj6hgSh2AxM">has a great breakdown</a> of many of the new relic effects, passives, and exact damage and health multipliers based on recent datamined info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsungâ€™s M5 Series FHD smart monitor is on sale over at Amazon. There are two different size models. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/">The 27-inch is normally $280, but after a 46% discount it comes to just $150.</a> The 32-inch has come down from $300 by 27% to just $220. Those prices are for the black option. You can also choose a sleek all-white version. The price and discount for that one are the same as the black for the 32-inch. However, the 27-inch white model is onl;y down to $230 which is notably $10 more than the 32-inch is going for. So unless space is that much of a concern, thereâ€™s really no good reason to choose the 27-inch white over the 32-inch white.</p>
<p>As a smart monitor, this display is equipped with a full Samsung TV interface which you can stream movies and shows to. You can even get live TV channels at no extra cost. Essentially itâ€™s a small HD TV that you can also control with a mouse and keyboard. It does also come with a remote.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Samsung M5 smart monitor has embedded productivity apps including the full Microsoft 365 suite. You can bypass needing a PC by just accessing Word, PowerPoint, or Excel on the monitor directly.</p>
<p>The display is fully adjustable on a swivel and tilt stand so you can always have it position optimally depending on where youâ€™re sitting and where you have it set up.</p>



<h2>Samsung Gaming Hub</h2>
<p>A real selling point is Gaming Hub. This is Samsungâ€™s built-in interface to stream popular video game titles right to your TV, or rather in this case, right to your monitor. It doesnâ€™t even require an Xbox consoles â€” just get yourself a controller and subscription to Xbox Game Pass and youâ€™ll be ready to play. Nothing to download either. All the titles can be streamed from the cloud.</p>
<p>As a subscriber to Xbox Game Pass, youâ€™ll gain access to hundreds of awesome games ranging from indie darlings like <em>Celeste</em>&nbsp;to giant AAA hits like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. Or pop on over into a new <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server with some friends. The long-awaited <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>is finally here and yes, it too is on Game Pass. New titles arrive to the service every month and you will gain access to even more games as it includes an EA Play membership.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/">Grab you Samsung M5 smart monitor for as low as $150 for a limited time over at Amazon.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-quest-3-512gb-with-batman-game-drops-to-a-new-record-low-the-ultimate-vr-headset-for-gaming.1293669/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is kicking off back-to-school season with an offer on a Meta Quest 3 VR bundle thatâ€™s hard to pass up:<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4029/"> It is $499, but included is the headset, Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and three months of Meta Horizon+ trial</a>. Normally, youâ€™d pay almost as much for the headset alone so getting all this extra content included in a bundle is a valuable bargain.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Resolution</h2>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 offers nearly a 30% resolution increase over old models with much sharper images and a <strong>stunning 4K Infinite display</strong> that makes all the details pop. That is to say that everything that you view in the virtual world looks sharp and real and your gaming and exploratory experience looks incredibly real. The graphics enhancement helps you perceive every last detail and adds depth to your experience.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages is that the Meta Quest 3 is cable-free: There is <strong>no fumbling with cables</strong> or clamping it to a separate screen, and that gives you the freedom to move, play games, exercise and travel within virtual environments without restriction. This untethered method makes VR more natural and enjoyable to experience, and keeps you engaged without being restricted by cords.</p>



<p>Powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, this headset has<strong> double the graphical processing power of its predecessors</strong>. This means scorching load times and smooth next-generation graphics that render gaming smooth and life-like. The 8GB RAM (33% more than before) helps to manage sharper visuals and quick response so you get the best out of it without any lag.</p>
<p>The headset also includes mixed reality features that overlay virtual objects over your real world: Dual RGB color cameras capture full-color, high-definition passthrough photos and enable you to co-interact with digital objects as well as your own physical world. This feature offers new ways of experiencing and exploring both worlds simultaneously.</p>
<p>Battery life has also been extended with the capacity to<strong> supply more than two hours of uninterrupted gameplay</strong>. This enables you to dive into prolonged sessions, recharge less frequently, and pick up where you left off.</p>
<p><strong>With 512GB storage</strong>, this Meta Quest 3 bundle gives you plenty of space to download games, applications and content without worrying about running out of space. And, with the Batman experience and Meta Horizon+ subscription thrown in, you gain access to even more content, so you have a full VR experience right from the start.</p>
