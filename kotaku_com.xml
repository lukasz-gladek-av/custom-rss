              <p>In a splendidly combative interview with Razer’s billionaire CEO Min-Liang Tan,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview"><em>The Verge</em>‘s Nilay Patel took him to task</a> over the peripheral company’s approach to AI, not least including the Grok-powered <a href="https://kotaku.com/grok-hologram-anime-waifu-ces-2026-2000657749">waifu-AI-in-a-jar stunt</a> it pulled at this year’s CES. The hour-long interview gets more and more uncomfortable as it becomes clear Tan has no answers for any of the crucial questions Patel is putting to him. And just wait until he’s asked what games he’s played recently.</p> <p>The interview, which took place live on stage at 2026’s CES, has such a peculiar tone. <em>The Verge</em>‘s Nilay Patel makes pretty obviously cynical remarks about Razer’s approach in terms of the attention-seeking silliness it pretends to be developing, and Min-Liang Tan replies as if the questions are entirely sincere. Of the Ava AI tube, “Did you say to your team, ‘I want a holographic anime waifu on my desk’? You say the metric is ‘what we want.’ Who was like, ‘I want this’?” asks Patel. Tan then launches into a deeply sincere response about how the holo-lady was there to represent technology Razer can create for game companies, meeting an imagined desire for “a holographic representation of some of your latest characters,” and that the product demonstrates “we’re now able to get personality there and have conversational AI coming through,” and further that it isn’t just “great software” but now features “great intelligence.”</p>

 <p>As impossible as it is to think of a single use-case for a game character appearing in a physical tube and being able to spurt Grok responses back at people, Tan enthuses, “It’s that premise of being able to chat, as opposed to clicking a button or typing on something, and having a little thing over there.” It’s “a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like that, and so we said, ‘Hey, it’s a great concept,’ and I think the community loves it.”</p>  <p>Ava, <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava">which has a website</a> that’s taking $20 preorder deposits and states that the product “is expected to be available in the second half of 2026,” is certainly not going to be released then, if at all, as becomes awkwardly obvious as the interview continues. When pressed on the reality of Ava actually being developed as a consumer product, rather than something “hack[ed] together” for CES, Tan starts to prevaricate. “We plan to put it out, but we do want to get as much feedback, to hear what the concerns are, right? Are there things we can do better? What’s cool? What are the characters that we would like to get on?” Which are all <em>really</em> strange questions to be asking of a product that’s supposedly going on sale later this year. Not least one that’s planning to run on Grok, Elon Musk’s wildly unstable and poorly managed AI.</p>

 <p>“Can you care about trust and safety, and also partner with Grok?” asked Patel, with the interview taking place as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">the stories of Grok’s gleeful creation of revenge porn and CSAM</a> were breaking. Tan does not answer the question at all, but rather speaks of Grok’s “really great conversational AI model.” When Patel puts to him the other obvious issues of a Grok-powered conversational device, Tan gives some of the most astonishingly dreadful responses, such as declaring, “Well, the doors have been open since Tamagotchi,” and “we’ve interacted with NPCs.” Patel desperately persists, laboring over the point that intentions are meaningless when we all know what gen-AI is already doing, but Tan refuses to engage, instead just repeating the usual lines about “software guardrails” and how the tech is [deep sigh] “evolving.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661262"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661262">© Razer</figcaption></figure> <p>Patel continues heroically on. When asking Tan about glowy-keyboard company Razer’s intentions to invest $600 million into “AI” alongside employing 150 AI engineers, the host points out “that gamers hate it. The gamers, I think, are in open revolt against AI coming into their games, into their platforms.” This obviously hits rather close to home for the Razer CEO, who arrived at CES under the banner of “AI is the future of gaming.”</p> <p>Tan attempts to draw a line between the “AI slop” that most game players are currently revolting against, and the nebulous “AI tools” that will help developers with QA and cause them to “develop better games.” He talks of a “QA companion” that Razer is developing to “work with the human QA tester” by, um, filling in forms. Genuinely, that’s the example.</p>

 <p>But as much as Patel pushes, Tan never provides an actual example of a compelling use case. Instead it’s all about how “helpful” it will be, how it’ll “work with” current products, but never with a single concrete example of what he’s actually talking about. But it is, of course, “revolutionary.” Thank goodness for Patel, who jumps in at this point to demand that Tan explain what exactly is “revolutionary” about putting a camera with “AI” in it in some headphones in Razer’s Motoko. The answer: “Well, I would say, first off, we are really looking at being able to have an unobtrusive universal form factor to enable AI smarts.” Ho boy. It’s ChatGPT talking at you in your ears. And, more specifically, an imaginary future version of ChatGPT that can interpret live camera footage and ambient audio and provide related answers based on these feeds.</p> <p>And for all of Tan’s protestations that Razer isn’t interested in “slop,” he then goes on to deliver that hoary old line, “We’ll see new forms of artists, artists of whom may not necessarily have been so adept in terms of using a paint brush or using Photoshop, now being able to kind of wordsmith and craft great pieces of art with prompts throughout.” So yeah, just plagiarized slop then.</p> <p>And just in case it couldn’t get any worse, Patel finishes up by asking Tan—who repeatedly declared his love for gaming throughout—what games he’s playing right now. “Oh, it depends.” Nope. On a second try he says, “<em>Civilization</em> and stuff like that…I do play some MMOs of sorts, shooters, and I still play a lot of the battle royale genre.” Patel points out those are genres and desperately presses for the name of a game. “Oh, well, I play random stuff.” Fucking hell.</p>

            <guid>1410817</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping multiple devices charged has become a daily challenge. Smartphones are just the starting point—add in wireless earbuds, smartwatches, tablets, laptops, and handheld gaming consoles, and it’s easy to see how quickly outlets and charging bricks multiply. A single, powerful charger that can handle everything is no longer a luxury. It is an absolute necessity. That’s why you need an Anker laptop charger. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Amazon happens to have it on sale at the moment for 35% off. It normally runs for $100, so that discounts easily calculates out to a savings of $35.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Charging</h2>
<p>Designed as an all-in-one charging hub, this compact power brick is built to replace several individual chargers at once. It supports USB-C charging across a wide range of devices, from phones and accessories to full-sized laptops and gaming systems like the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or similar handhelds. With a maximum output of up to 140W, it delivers a ton of power fast helping to minimize the time it takes to bring your devices back to life.</p>
<p>At the front of the charger, you’ll find three USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port, allowing you to charge up to four devices simultaneously. The first two USB-C ports support the highest power output, so either can be used for fast-charging a laptop without sacrificing performance. The USB-A port ensures compatibility with older cables and accessories you may still rely on, keeping the charge valuable for even your legacy devices.</p>
<p>Fast charging performance is a highlight. The Anker Laptop Charger is capable of powering larger devices and laptops like the 15-inch MacBook Air rapidly. Under optimal conditions, it can bring a drained laptop battery up to 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>



<h2>Smart Display</h2>
<p>A built-in smart display located on the top of the unit provides real-time charging information, breaking down how much power each port is delivering as well as the total output across all connected devices. The high-definition, full-color display makes the information easy to read at a glance.</p>
<p>The display also doubles as a temperature monitor. Keeping charging temperatures in check is critical for both safety and long-term device health, and the charger gives you visibility into how warm it’s running. Behind the scenes, Anker’s ActiveShield safety system continuously monitors temperature—checking millions of times per day—to protect against overheating and ensure stable performance.</p>
<p>In the box, Anker includes the 140W charger itself and a five-foot USB-C to USB-C cable rated for up to 240W, so you can take full advantage of its capabilities right away. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Available in dark gray or silver, the Anker laptop charger is now on sale for just $65 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-director-budget-development-2000661252</link>
            <guid>1410769</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The buzz around <em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">was strong coming out of its initial 2023 PlayStation Showcase reveal</a>. It was a familiar multiplayer formula inside a wrapper that looked unlike anything else out there. But things started going downhill after fans went hands-on with an alpha test build in May 2025. Coupled with an <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685">art plagiarism scandal</a> and annual mass layoffs at Bungie, the vibes had turned rancid. Fans were skeptical and haters were gleefully calling <em>Marathon</em> the next <em>Concord</em>. What does that do to the headspace of someone working on the game internally?</p> <p>“That kind of stuff hits everyone differently,” <em>Marathon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">former franchise art director, Joseph Cross</a>, said in a new interview with <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">Mikhail Klimentov’s <em>ReaderGrev</em> newsletter</a>. “We had both spells, where there was a lot of positivity and then there was a lot of negativity. Personally, I’m able to compartmentalize a lot of that. And a big part of the reason I’m able to do that is just because, getting back to my own identity as an artist, the art is really the most important thing to me here.”</p>

 <p>Cross, who’s worked outside games on film projects like 2021’s <em>Dune</em>, said he ultimately can’t control how players feel about the game design or how <em>Marathon</em> plays. “It’s difficult for me to take any of that stuff personally because I believe in the art, because I believe in what we’ve done,” he said. “I think we did something really cool, and I think it will pan out. I can’t control the way the game plays. I’m not a designer. I’m not the game director. I can only control what I can control, and what I could control, I feel really good about.”</p> <p>He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>And you can’t take that away from me, as much as the haters try online or wherever, and whether someone doesn’t happen to like the art direction personally, whether they don’t agree with some political thing Bungie did, or whatever the animosity du jour is, you can’t take the thing I care about the most away. There’s a part of me definitely that feels bummed, but sort of in the same way you feel bummed like you got unlucky. It’s like when you drop the toast and it goes face down. It’s like: Damn, I wish it would have gone face up when I dropped the toast. It feels like losing a lottery ticket or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that stuff never feels personal, you know?</p></blockquote> <p>As a manager, Cross added that it can be hard to know how everyone else on the team is processing the noise, especially when people are working remote through Zoom and Slack. “In my position, it’s not enough to just process it internally,” he said. “You have to advocate for and be there for the team and for the project and that’s a whole other can of soup.”</p>

 <p>Something that did weigh on the veteran Bungie artist is what a big risk and investment <em>Marathon</em> is, and what all that effort means if it ends up not paying off. The people comparing it to <em>Concord</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">which took many years to develop and cost over $200 million</a> to make, are not entirely wrong in that regard. Cross pointed to that risk taking as one of the project’s virtues, but worries it could be part of a dying breed of AAA project that studios like Bungie have made their bread and butter.</p>

 <p><i>“Marathon</i> is such a massive project,” he said. “The studio took such a risk on this. You know, often times we felt like we were sort of getting away with something. And I think about that in the big picture, the idea of studios funding unproven, unknown projects for six or eight years, for hundreds of millions of dollars, sort of on spec. How much longer are things like this going to exist? I’ve been part of a couple of them now.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Mac Mini, Amazon Clears Out Ryzen 7 Mini Gaming PC at Record Low (Windows 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-mac-mini-amazon-clears-out-ryzen-7-mini-gaming-pc-at-record-low-windows-11-pro-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-2000661033</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC upgrades don’t always require shelling out big bucks, if you know where to look. Those looking for a compact, space-saving, but powerful (and cost-effective) solution should consider the Acemagic mini gaming PC at Amazon, which offers the best of both – or well, all – worlds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/">This PC retails for $599, but shoppers can grab it for less today.</a> Amazon Prime members can snag it for $408, after a nice 32% drop, while non-Prime shoppers can pick it up for $469 ($61 more than Prime members), which still knocks 22% off the list price. All shoppers will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so there are no extra costs to worry about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact, But Powerful</h2>
<p>This mini PC is truly compact. It easily fits in the palm of your hand and can squeeze into tighter, cluttered workspaces with ease. If you prefer a cleaner, more minimal setup, you can even mount it behind your monitor, or under the desk to keep it out of sight.</p>
<p>Performance is seriously impressive. The mini PC comes equipped with an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor that clocks up to 4.5GHz. When compared with its predecessors like the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U, this PC delivers around 35% faster CPU and 38% better GPU performance. It’s made to handle 1080p gaming, light editing, regular work, and even multitasking without slowing down. The PC is perfectly capable of supporting your work needs in the day, and entertainment sessions with games like APEX, CSGO, PUBG, COD, DOTA2, RUST, GTA5, and more at night.</p>



<p>There’s a massive DDR4 32GB RAM (dual channel), which keeps things snappy as you push through busy days. It keeps the system running smoothly, even when you’re working on a heavier, resource-intensive project that demands power. Storage is taken care of by the built-in 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 SSD. It’s spacious enough to house all your important files, work documents, research papers, high-resolution photos, videos, and more comfortably. What’s even better is that both the memory and the storage are expandable up to 64GB and 2TB, respectively. That means if your needs grow in the future (which is inevitable), the system can grow to support them. You won’t need to worry about major overhauls anytime soon.</p>
<p>Port selection is decent. A triple monitor setup is supported with HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), DP, and dual USB 3.2 Gen2 ports, letting you juggle a bunch of tasks at the same time. Think taking work meetings on one screen, while working on your project on the primary one, and having reference material opened on the third. Or playing a game on your main screen, while also catching up with friends on the other. You won’t have to worry about the system overheating, either. That’s thanks to the dual-vent cooling system, which maintains optimal 15-28W TDP performance without throttling.</p>
<p>The PC plays nicely with a variety of operating systems, but comes with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, meaning it’s ready to be used right out of the box. It’s also certified for AutoCAD/Adobe suites, which makes it great for work professionals, creatives, gamers, and students alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/">The PC is now down to $408 for Prime members, and $469 for non-Prime users.</a> The discounts offer a great way of upgrading your system without paying the full price.</p>

              <p><em>Marathon</em> is a <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">hero extraction shooter</a>, but it wasn’t always that way. Former franchise art director Joseph Cross detailed his time working on the game in a new interview, including a big change to a core aspect of the game midway through development. He also spoke about <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">leaving Bungie</a> after spending so much time working <em>Destiny</em> and the company’s upcoming multiplayer game.</p> <p>“The game design itself [had] a pretty profound evolution midway through, and that changed the visual psychology a fair amount,” the veteran artist <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">told Mikhail Klimentov’s newsletter <em>ReaderGrev</em> in a new interview</a>. As Cross describes it, <em>Marathon</em>‘s player characters were originally just generic throwaway mercenaries that players would customize to fit their own fantasy. It was only later on that the development team made the shift to actual characters with prescribed backstories, abilities, and unique visual identities.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marathon Art Style (a short thread). First of all thanks to everyone for all the kind words and enthusiasm for the art style/direction in our announce trailer, it's been amazing to see. This was the result of many talented artists working together, with the support of an amazing <a href="https://t.co/ePPi41KA6c">pic.twitter.com/ePPi41KA6c</a></p> <p>— Joseph Cross (@josephacross) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephacross/status/1663415929043296257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“You’re going from designing one vehicle in a fleet of a thousand to now you’re designing the Millennium Falcon,” he said. “The psychology changes. I think that gets back to your original question, which is like, art relating to gameplay and at what point do those collide? And that certainly was a big one. In the case of this production it was a fairly significant event, and had to happen incredibly quickly, too.”</p> <p>The hero aspect has become an important part of the marketing around <em>Marathon</em>‘s in-world fiction and a differentiator between it and genre rivals like<em> Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Escape from Tarkov</em>. But it also gives the game one foot in the realm of a genre that some players seem incredibly burnt out on. Elsewhere in the interview, Cross said the game is banking a lot on its striking art style, which borrows inspiration from things as wide-ranging as Nike sneaker culture and Ikea furniture assembly, to help set it apart.</p>

 <p>He said:</p> <blockquote><p>There’s also something about the design of the game, where at a certain point I really did believe that art had potentially more of a responsibility for creating interest than it would if we were working on a different kind of game. The game design, nobody’s reinventing the wheel here. We’re putting compelling spins on established mechanics. The narrative is also not reinventing the wheel. It’s an abandoned space colony where something mysterious happened. We’ve seen this a lot. It’s about how you spin it, and at some point, for better or for worse, I told myself that this is an opportunity for art to sort of step up and provide a level of newness to this world.</p></blockquote> <h2>Leaving Bungie on the eve of <em>Marathon</em>‘s release</h2> <p>So why did Cross, who spent over a decade working on art for the studio beginning with the original<em> Destiny</em>, decide to recently leave before <em>Marathon</em> ships? He said he’s an artist first and foremost, and is increasingly conscious of the limited number of new projects he’ll actually get to work on in his lifetime. “I’m not a founder of Bungie,” he told Klimentov. “This is not my company. And I’m conscious of the number of projects I get to work on in my life. I’m not getting any younger. I’ve spent what will ultimately be 15 years, essentially, on two projects for Bungie: <i>Destiny</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Marathon</i>, with film work in between.”</p>

 <p>Cross decided on his departure just a couple of weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em>‘s new March 5 release date</a> was decided. “The natural cadence of the kind of work that happens post-launch in a live service game, I also understood what that was looking like,” he added. “It’s also true that at the level of seniority that I had, there are challenges there that don’t necessarily exist as an artist, and getting to this phase of a project like this at that level had its own challenges that contributed also.”</p>

<h2>A mic that’s great for casual creators and established professionals</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 Bundle (2 Transmitters + Receiver + Charging Case) combines two wireless transmitters, a small wireless receiver and a charging case into a single lightweight portable recording package. DJI describes the system as ultra-light with adaptive gain control for maintaining a consistent volume level regardless of the type of speaker,. It also uses dual-band anti-interference technology to help prevent interference from nearby wireless devices.</p>
<p>DJi states that the combined battery life will provide up to 28 hours of continuous use when taking into account the charging case, allowing you to shoot for extended periods of time before having to charge the case again.</p>
<p>Two clip-on transmitters and a wireless receiver that mount to a camera hot shoe, can be used to create a complete 2 person wireless microphone system. All of these components fit inside the provided charging case that allows all of the components to remain organized and charged during non-use intervals.</p>



<p>The receiver can connect to as many as four wireless microphones and synchronize audio to as many as eight receivers, with four-channel output available for larger production needs. Therefore, you can begin with the two wireless microphones provided, and then purchase additional units to expand your recording capabilities.</p>
<p>Each of the two wireless microphones is capable of internally recording two separate files of 32 bit floating point data, providing a wider dynamic range than typical 24-bit systems, and therefore more opportunities for adjusting levels in post-production.</p>
<p>Additional details regarding power and connectivity include a charging case that not only powers the transmitters and the receiver but also stores all of the provided accessories. In terms of total operation time, DJI rates the system at 28 hours or more, depending on how often you are using each component before needing to recharge the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/">If you’re ready to upgrade your mic situation or just want to add another to your arsenal, you can’t go wrong with this setup. Act quickly and get yours before it disappears from stock again.</a></p>
