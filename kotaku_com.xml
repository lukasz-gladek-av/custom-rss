            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The third part of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy is <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-3-queens-blood-snowboarding-2000662578">already “playable” and currently being polished</a> by the development team at Square Enix. Part of the speed of that turnaround time from <em>Rebirth</em>‘s launch just under two years ago is the team’s continued use of an older version of Unreal Engine. The upcoming sequel’s director recently confirmed why the developers have opted to stick with the older tech for the final game.</p> <p>“We’ve been using Unreal Engine 4, but we’ve made a lot of modifications to fit our needs,” Naoki Hamaguchi explained in a new interview <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">with <em>GameSpot</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-explains-why-the-third-game-will-still-use-unreal-engine-4/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs.” The director said <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-remake-part-3-could-switch-to-unreal-engine-5-if-square-decides-it-would-speed-up-development/">back in 2024</a> that the team was exploring shifting to the newer Unreal Engine 5 for the third game. Clearly, they wound up opting against it.</p>

 <p>Sticking with the more familiar version of the tools could help Square Enix get the third <em>FF7 Remake</em> game out faster. Plenty of other game studios have lost precious development time when shifting to the newest version of an Unreal Engine toolset, though not everyone has faced the same level of trouble with switching over. Sticking with UE 4 could leave fewer unknowns and help as the publisher ports the trilogy to Switch 2, but it also comes with <a href="http://I hope they can figure out some kind of solution to improve diffuse indirect lighting quality, though I’m not optimistic.">some potential graphical drawbacks</a>.</p> <h2>What role will gen AI play in <em>FF7 Remake</em> Part Three?</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Hamaguchi was asked about his evolving views on gen AI. Last fall, he said there <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/its-really-fateful-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-on-charting-a-new-course-for-the-jrpg-series-with-a-return-to-nintendo-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-outdoing-ai/">weren’t any set rules</a> within the company about its use even as Square Enix was pushing to automate entire areas of quality assurance testing work <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688">over the next couple of years</a>.&nbsp;“ My stance hasn’t changed on depending on AI to produce something or to create something,” Hamaguchi told&nbsp;<em>GameSpot</em>. “ I don’t rely on AI to come up with ideas and things like that.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “That said, AI is a tool that I and other colleagues would utilize so that our tasks would become much smoother or some of the menial tasks are taken care of by AI. I think it’s becoming more and more necessary. I think the purpose of utilizing these tools is so that creators will have a better environment so that they can work more efficiently and they can explore more creative options.”</p>

 <p>He said QA was one of those areas, citing the example of testing collision detection, which is a repetitive series of “tedious tasks.” “By automating that using AI, we reduce the stress on the human that is required to check on it,” Hamaguchi said, before adding, “And so we’re hoping that that would lower the bandwidth that is required of our people.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-samsung-odyssey-lg-27-oled-gaming-monitor-is-41-off-with-an-ultra-fast-0-03ms-response-time-2000662707</link>
            <guid>1416076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Raw PC power only goes so far if your display can’t keep up. You won’t reap the reward of all that’s going on under the hood. A high-end graphics card and fast processor deserve a screen that can actually show what they’re capable of, especially for gaming. That’s where this current deal on LG’s UltraGear OLED 27-inch gaming monitor comes in, offering a significant upgrade for a much lower price than usual.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/">Right now, the LG UltraGear OLED gaming monitor is discounted by 41%, bringing the price down from $800 to $474.</a> That kind of drop makes it far more accessible for players who have been holding off on upgrading their setup. If you’ve been gaming on a basic office monitor, the difference a proper gaming display can make is immediately noticeable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This UltraGear model features a 27-inch panel with a QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440. That resolution strikes a sweet spot for PC gaming, delivering sharper visuals than 1080p without the heavy performance demands of 4K. It also supports a 240Hz refresh rate, allowing games to run at extremely high frame rates when paired with capable hardware.</p>
<p>As an OLED monitor, visuals look incredible with accurate, vivid color, and deep blacks that actually looks black, but don’t hide details in the dark thanks to the Black Stabilizer.</p>
<h2>Ultra-fast Input</h2>
<p>Fast response times matter more than many people expect. Games with tight platforming, precise timing, or competitive multiplayer elements benefit enormously from reduced input lag. A rapid 0.03ms response time, movement feels fluid and inputs register almost instantaneously, which can make a real impact in fast-paced games. Controls feel lighter and more responsive.</p>



<p>Connectivity is well covered here. The monitor includes dual HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 connection, all capable of supporting refresh rates up to 240Hz. That makes it easy to hook up a gaming PC, console, or secondary system, easily switching between sources.</p>
<p>Audio immersion gets a boost as well. The built-in headphone jack supports accurate spatial audio for games that offer 3D sound, helping you pinpoint movement and direction more clearly during gameplay.</p>
<p>The adjustable stand allows you to raise or lower the screen, tilt it forward or back, and even rotate it vertically. This makes it easier to maintain good posture during long sessions or use the monitor as a secondary vertical display for Discord, game guides, or a number of other uses.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/">At $474, this LG UltraGear monitor delivers a substantial upgrade in speed, clarity, and control without paying full price.</a> It’s a strong option for gamers ready to let their PC finally stretch its legs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[XREAL 1S AR Virtual Smart Glasses Get a Surprise Price Drop Right After Launch, With Switch 2 Support]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xreal-1s-ar-virtual-smart-glasses-get-a-surprise-price-drop-right-after-launch-with-switch-2-support-2000662866</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just when you think that the next big thing is finally going to be flying cars now, the tech world rolls out something new that puts that idea on hold yet again. Virtual and Augmented reality glasses are “that” big thing these days, and if you’ve been curious to try a pair yourself, Amazon is making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/">We just spotted the Xreal 1S AR glasses going for $449 at the retailer, down from $549</a>. That’s after a nice (and rare) $100 discount. All shoppers will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too. This is also the lowest we have seen these glasses drop to in a while. The offer, however, won’t be around forever. It’s best to get your orders in before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Viewing Experience</h2>
<p>This smart pair is capable of presenting a breathtaking virtual screen up to 500 inches, anywhere you want. You’ll experience ultra‑smooth viewing with a 120Hz refresh rate in 3DoF mode, plus a 90Hz global refresh that eliminates flicker to keep things sharp. Each unit is carefully colored‑tuned for precise, natural hues, while the optical engine boosts clarity by 9% for incredible detail. Trying to stream a nature documentary in your living room, or playing your favorite game, expect lifelike picture quality with image points that lock perfectly in your eye for a more realistic, immersive experience.</p>
<p>There are multiple viewing modes that support a bunch of needs. The 3 DoF Anchor lets you anchor your screen anywhere with a single press of a button. You can adjust the size and distance using the on-screen display settings. Spatial Anchor makes the screen stay fixed in a single place, even as you walk around or change your position. It offers that TV-like experience where the screen doesn’t flicker or move as you do. The Follow mode, on the other hand, offers real-time spatial anchoring. It keeps the screen fixed directly in front of your field of view by moving it according to your head movements. Basically, content won’t ever be out of sight, as long as you don’t want it to. Getting a stable, centered image also reduces motion sickness, which makes this mode perfect for travel.</p>



<p>Then there’s UltraWide, which expands the viewing area to give you plenty of space to multitask, create, and unwind. Similarly, Side View delivers a mini screen, allowing you to keep an eye on what’s going on around in your surroundings while still being connected to the digital world. What’s more, the sound system has been co-developed with Bose to match the immersive visuals. You’ll enjoy a spacious, balanced soundstage with deeper lows and clear highs, regardless of what you’re viewing.</p>
<p>Getting started with using the thing couldn’t be easier. The pair runs on a self‑developed X1 chip, which is the world’s first spatial computing processor built specifically for AR glasses. It doesn’t require complicated setup processes to get going. You can simply connect it to any USB‑C DP‑enabled device and step straight into expansive spatial content. Once paired, you can adjust brightness, color temperature, tint, distance, and 2D/3D modes with precision using on‑device controls.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the AR glasses, a carrying case, a USB-C cable, and a user manual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/">You can now grab this smart pair for just $449, after Amazon took a nice $100 off its usual price</a>. The offer won’t be around for long, so we highly suggest grabbing it without wasting much time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-choice-windows-11-pro-mini-pc-at-nearly-40-off-is-surging-as-a-mac-mini-alternative-2000662863</link>
            <guid>1416010</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="107" data-end="536">“Brains like a full-sized PC, body of a Mac Mini, and easier on your checkbook than either” would make a really strong dating site bio for a mini PC, and the Acemagic K1 is well worth swiping right for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">It’s an Amazon’s Choice mini PC preloaded with Windows 11 Pro that’s on sale for a limited time for just $220, a big 37% break from its usual $349.</a></p>
<p data-start="538" data-end="997">This deal isn’t about some janky plug-and-pray rig that you’ll be trying to return or replace within weeks or months — the Acemagic K1 is a bona fide, space-saving desktop replacement that fits in the palm of your hand. It has an AMD Ryzen 4300 processor that can max out at 3.7GHz and enough onboard memory (16GB) and storage (256GB) to juggle web tabs, creative apps, Discord, and whatever random emulator you’ve got open without the dreaded slowdown that turns productivity into an endless loading screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="538" data-end="997">Mini Build, Mini Price</h2>
<p data-start="999" data-end="1440">If you’re eyeing a Mac Mini purely because you want a tiny powerhouse combined with the flex that comes with all things Mac, this Acemagic K1 deal at Amazon is your wallet pleading with you to be reasonable. Yes, Apple’s M4-powered Mini is sleek and whisper-quiet, but it’ll set you back significantly more with similar memory — over twice as much, actually. We’ve seen gaming headsets that cost more than the Acemagic K1.</p>
<p data-start="1442" data-end="1860">But this discounted mini PC squeezes an AMD Ryzen-class processor and that generous RAM into a chassis the size of a thick paperback. You can hide it behind a monitor with a VESA mount, plop it next to your console, or shove it into your streaming cabinet without asking your partner for extra desk real estate. Add a monitor — or as many as three monitors — and keyboard you already own — <em>voila</em>, instant command center.</p>


<h2 data-start="1442" data-end="1860">Palm-Sized Powerhouse</h2>
<p data-start="1862" data-end="2277">To answer the inevitable question of <em data-start="1886" data-end="1911">“why not a laptop?”</em> — this isn’t about portability. The Acemagic K1 is a dedicated little beast with outstanding expansion potential and a whispery high-efficiency cooling system that quietly hum along while your laptop’s fan blasts like it’s trying to take off. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to offload background tasks, run servers, handle video encoding, or just give their main rig a break without dropping a pile of cash.</p>
<p data-start="2279" data-end="2649"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">Like all Amazon deals, this $220 price won’t linger forever.</a> Yesterday it was here, tomorrow it might be back at the full price of $349. If you’ve been mentally earmarking that desk corner for a proper PC that doesn’t look like a suitcase and sound like a jet turbine, your patience has just paid off. Whether it ends up as your primary machine, a home server, or the hub of all your nerdy projects, the Acemagic K1 one of the more legitimately great mini PC deals we’ve seen in a while.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-drops-to-its-black-friday-low-after-multiple-price-cuts-now-priced-like-a-budget-android-smartphone-2000662878</link>
            <guid>1415986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google’s Pixel range offers some of the best Android phones on the market. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re after basic features for everyday use or want to enjoy all the latest advancements in the AI world.</p>
<p>The tech giant unveiled its Pixel 10 Series last year, featuring stunning models with a solid build, an impressive camera, a bright display, new AI tools, and a lot more. That said, its previous generation Pixel 9 phones are still an excellent option to consider, and pack many of the features found on the latest models. If you’ve been thinking of treating yourself to one, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">Amazon is offering the 128GB, unlocked Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Hazel at a 36% discount today, which drops its $1,099 price to just $699</a>. Basically, it’s cheaper than the basic Pixel 9 right now. Those willing to trade their older phone can save up to $600 on their purchase, too, but you might not be able to combine both offers. Trade-in credit is offered in the form of Amazon gift cards that you can use towards other purchases. We highly suggest grabbing the offer as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting it to stick around for longer than a day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With AI Features</h2>
<p>Pixel 9 Pro XL features a stunning 6.8-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL Super Actua display, which is both bright and vivid. It offers excellent picture quality in all lighting conditions, whether you’re using it while soaking up some sun or in a dimmer setting at night. At the back, you’ll find a triple rear camera system that not just lets you take professional-level photos, but also high-quality video up to 20x with Super Res Zoom Video. You will also be able to film clearly in low light with Night Sight Video, as well as enhance your videos up to 8K with Video Boost.</p>
<p>AI integration takes the overall experience even further. For instance, there’s Gemini to make everyday tasks easier. It’s an efficient AI assistant that’s ready to help you with research, summarizing documents, creating content, getting reply suggestions, translations, and more – 24/7. Your purchase also includes a year of Google One AI Premium access, which includes Gemini Advanced and more tools, so you can unlock the full potential of your device. It typically costs $239, but here, it’s included for free.</p>



<p>Other cool smart features include “Add Me”, which makes it easy to add the photographer to group photos so no one is left out. It works by taking two shots (one of the group, and the other when the photographer has swapped places with someone) and merging them together into a single photo. Then there’s “Click to Search”, which lets you circle an image or text to perform a quick Google search.</p>
<p>The 128GB space in this version is roomy enough to house all your photos, videos, applications, and documents comfortably. Battery is another strong selling point, as a single charge offers over 24 hours of usage. What’s more, the Extreme Battery Saver extends that to up to 100 hours, making it perfect for off-road trips and power outages.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">You can now upgrade for just $699, after a massive $400 discount. It’s a rare drop, so it’s best to snap it quickly before it expires.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-is-back-at-a-record-low-in-another-clearance-move-on-amazon-not-the-official-store-2000662800</link>

              <p>There are deals, and then there are deals that make you say “This is the way.” (It’s OK to mix metaphors in a galaxy far, far away.) Right now, LEGO’s Star Wars Millennium Falcon has been restocked at Amazon after a heavy-duty holiday selling burst and it’s arrived in 2026 in one of those rare price windows where it’s genuinely worth firing up the hyperdrive and snagging it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">The Amazon limited-time deal for the 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is going for $68, 20% off its usual price.</a> That might sound like pocket change compared to what some of us drop on boxed trilogy marathons or obscure action figures, but when a set that’s this beloved dips below its typical tag, it’s actually worth paying attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Grown-Up LEGO Fun</h2>
<p data-start="855" data-end="1359">Now before you go imagining the 7,500-plus-piece Ultimate Collector Series starship that’s the size of a studio apartment and costs about a much — let’s be super clear: This is the smaller 25th Anniversary edition 921-piece Millennium Falcon that’s been popping up in deals lately. That said, 921 pieces is still plenty of bricks to keep your fingers busy and your inner kid grinning ear to ear, and this version comes with a display stand so you aren’t sacrificing precious shelf real estate to chaos.</p>
<p data-start="1361" data-end="1855">This isn’t one of those microfighters you flick at your coffee table. It’s the kind of model that earns a place of prominent display as a collector’s item and conversation piece, and not in a heap of other half-wrecked LEGO sets after a pretend battle. Kids probably <em data-start="1649" data-end="1654">can</em> build it, but this adult-oriented set feels more like a collectible for anyone who’s ever whispered “She’s faster than she looks” at a spaceship dangling from a peg at a toy store.</p>


<h2 data-start="1361" data-end="1855">Use the Force</h2>
<p data-start="1857" data-end="2195">LEGO Star Wars sets — even ones that aren’t giant — don’t linger on sale for long. They’re the kind of things that disappear off retailer sites faster than the Falcon makes the Kessel Run. When the price drops to a fresh low and stock comes back, it’s usually fleeting.</p>
<p data-start="2197" data-end="2503">So if you’ve been on the fence about adding this to your collection, now’s the time to decide. Whether it’s for a gift, a weekend build sesh, or a new centerpiece atop your entertainment center, a 20% drop on a fan-favorite set isn’t something that happens every week. See it while you can, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">while it’s still on sale at Amazon for just $68 — because once it sells out again, there’s no guaranteeing when it’ll be back.</a></p>
