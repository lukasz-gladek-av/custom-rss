If you haven’t heard of him before now, it’s probably because his social media accounts were small, and his reach was very, very limited.

So far, there are <em>twelve</em>, and it’s absolutely bewildering.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,195752" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Free-to-play games having multiple currencies is, again, nothing new, and it’s all by design, all a part of the psychological systems to have you desperate to top things up, keep things ticking, and if you can <em>just</em> get three more of these, then a whole other thing unlocks! And, again, the big issue here is that this is <em>Pokémon</em> doing it to an audience with a huge proportion of children, and indeed delivering it in the most byzantine way imaginable.</p><p>To discover just how bonkers this all is, on the game’s main page, there’s a button on the bottom-right with three lines. Tap that, and there’s an option below “Shop” called “Items.” Click on this innocuous little word, and the lunacy is revealed.</p><p>Let’s lay it all out:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Poké gold (non-paid)</li><li>Poké gold (paid)</li><li>Shinedust</li><li>Shop ticket</li><li>Special shop ticket</li><li>Premium ticket</li><li>Pack Hourglass</li><li>Wonder Hourglass</li><li>Event Hourglass</li><li>Advance Ticket</li><li>Event Shop Ticket (Meowth)</li><li>Emblem Ticket (Genetic Apex)</li><li>Rewind Watch</li></ul><p>Now, we’re being generous here, including the two types of gold as one to get to that total of 12. And if your list doesn’t have that many, that’s because you currently don’t own any of them. It’s a list that just keeps expanding, and given the specificity of the Event Shop Ticket and Emblem Ticket, we must assume that there are other types of these to come.</p><p>You might expect me here to go through explaining what each type does, but you know what? Not even The Pokémon Company seems willing to share that. That Advance Ticket’s entry reads, “This ticket cannot be used yet. Wait and see what it’s for!”</p><p>Um, no? Just tell me? It’s already annoying enough as it is.</p><figure id="" data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of these currencies are used to buy items from specific pages of the game’s shop, which itself is laid out as if it got caught in one of those Doctor Strange spells where all the buildings and train tracks start spinning and weaving inside one another. To spend the Event Shop Ticket (Meowth), you need to go to the “Limited Time / Events” section of the shop, and then to the Event page within that, as distinct from the Premium page, Poké gold page, and the mysterious and always-empty “Other.” There’s another Other in the “Main” section of the shop, which is also empty! Is it empty of the same things? No one knows!</p><p>Special Shop Tickets are gained when you sacrifice multiple versions of full-art or better cards, which the game never explains at any point, and require you to have somehow gathered three or more of the same incredibly rare art. We’re talking about cards with a 0.3 percent (or worse, getting as low as 0.013 percent) chance of coming out of a pack here. You get <em>one</em> of those per card (I know, because infuriatingly I’ve somehow pulled three of the gorgeous Snorlax full-art card), and the cheapest item in this shop costs <em>seven</em> Special Shop Tickets. That’s for the presentation backgrounds, rather than the fancy black-and-silver sleeves, playmat or coin you might want—they cost 12 tickets each!</p><p>Oh wait! Hang on! It <em>is</em> thirteen currencies, because I completely forgot to include Pack Points! Yeah, there’s yet another system that it doesn’t even bother to remember when listing what you own. These are the points you can use to exchange for cards you might want in your deck, gained by opening packs, and only appearing—not when you’re building packs or on any of the card screens—but when you’re on the page to select a new sealed pack to open...</p><p>WHO LET ANY OF THIS HAPPEN?!</p><p>I have to stop writing now, in case I discover a fourteenth currency I’d not seen before now and have an aneurysm.</p><p>And why is it like this? To deliberately confuse you. To make sure you’re never certain which currency is one you should be holding onto and which is one that has no other purpose than to be spent there and then. And to constantly dangle numbers in front of you that could get higher if only you bought just a teensy bit of gold. Some directly, like hourglasses, where shortages can be made up by subbing in gold you own; others indirectly by only arriving if you buy the (abysmal) Premium Pass, or won by continuing playing that Event where you just ran out of hourglasses...</p><p>Next time, the <em>eight</em> different pages of Missions!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re just a week out from launch, so a lot of people haven’t beaten the game yet so there aren’t a ton of hard numbers for the story decisions, but developer BioWare <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dragonage/status/1854967733907333551&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1854967733907333551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has released some early stats</a></span> about the kinds of characters people are making. This includes pie charts, so let’s break down the data.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b476134b88461f085263d8e18a8229d7" data-recommend-id="image://b476134b88461f085263d8e18a8229d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between classes in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between classes in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b476134b88461f085263d8e18a8229d7" data-recommend-id="image://b476134b88461f085263d8e18a8229d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between classes in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First up is classes. There are only three base combat roles in <em>The Veilguard</em>, so the divide between them was never going to be huge, but I was surprised to see that players are pretty evenly split between Warrior, Rogue, and Mage. The first two are tied with 30 percent of players picking up a sword or dagger. Mage came out on top, however, with a 40 percent cut of the pie chart. I played a mage, too, and had a blast with it in a way that I haven’t in previous games. Mages in the last three <em>Dragon Age</em> games were mostly stationary, fighting from a distance and running away if anyone got too close. <em>The Veilguard </em>retools the class to have both the traditional long-range spellcasting and a close-range tool kit with an orb-and-dagger build. It’s the most versatile mages have felt in these games, so I’m not surprised that folks are gravitating toward it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="73357430fa056c06274589cd2c7d9344" data-recommend-id="image://73357430fa056c06274589cd2c7d9344" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between lineages in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between lineages in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73357430fa056c06274589cd2c7d9344" data-recommend-id="image://73357430fa056c06274589cd2c7d9344" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between lineages in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Class was a pretty even distribution, but protagonist Rook’s race has some clear favorites. Humans win out with 43 percent of players choosing to be what they already are in the real world. I’m not judging even a little bit because I picked a human and tried to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575">make my Rook look like me</a></span>. Elf Rook was in second place and was just on human’s heels with a 40 percent cut. That leaves Qunari and Dwarves to take up a minuscule percentage of Rooks, with the former claiming 11 percent, and the latter squeaking in with six percent. Dwarves have always felt like one of the more underserved races in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and I’m left to wonder if that’s because of stats like this.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="beb08fc0c5b8347476161571ea221c3a" data-recommend-id="image://beb08fc0c5b8347476161571ea221c3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing Lucanis above text that reads &quot;SEA OF BLOOD.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A graphic showing Lucanis above text that reads &quot;SEA OF BLOOD.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="beb08fc0c5b8347476161571ea221c3a" data-recommend-id="image://beb08fc0c5b8347476161571ea221c3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing Lucanis above text that reads &quot;SEA OF BLOOD.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This was an interesting statistic. Apparently Lucanis’ recruitment mission “Sea of Blood” is giving <em>Veilguard </em>players trouble, as it’s the one most players have died on in the first week. I had a little bit of trouble with the final boss, but I would be interested to see if this statistic changes as more players progress and reach the Weisshaupt mission. The boss in that quest knocked me on my ass multiple times.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e3e5b00f7759c1e804ff31303ebd6f66" data-recommend-id="image://e3e5b00f7759c1e804ff31303ebd6f66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between factions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between factions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e3e5b00f7759c1e804ff31303ebd6f66" data-recommend-id="image://e3e5b00f7759c1e804ff31303ebd6f66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pie chart showing the divide between factions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of my favorite parts of customizing Rook in <em>The Veilguard </em>is picking your faction, as this determines parts of your character’s backstory and informs relationships with your party. It seems like some Dragon Age fans like familiarity, as the Grey Wardens faction is tied for number one. You play as a Warden in Dragon Age: Origins, so I personally decided against retreading that this time around. I instead went with the Shadow Dragons, freedom fighters from Tevinter, which were tied with the Wardens at 24 percent each. That’s nearly half the split, so the other four factions include the Antivan Crows at 16 percent, Veil Jumpers at 15, Lords of Fortune with 11, and the Mournwatch coming in last place with 10 percent. Honestly, no hate to the Mournwatch, I expected that to be lower considering how detached they feel from the bulk fo the game. But if y’all wanna raise the dead, that’s your business.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f11080024f87e827d9340eb3ec074458" data-recommend-id="image://f11080024f87e827d9340eb3ec074458" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing a dragon attacking a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A graphic showing a dragon attacking a city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f11080024f87e827d9340eb3ec074458" data-recommend-id="image://f11080024f87e827d9340eb3ec074458" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing a dragon attacking a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While folks may have died the most during Lucanis’ recruitment mission in the early hours, the enemy that has been giving <em>Veilguard </em>players the most trouble has been one of the dragon fights. High Dragon Corius The Icetalon is one of the possible dragon fights you’ll face in the early game if you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168">choose to save Treviso over Minrathous</a></span>. Dragon fights can be tough in The Veilguard, especially if you’re not targeting its weak points and just swinging away at the giant lizard. But once again, I’ll be interested to see this stat updated in the coming weeks after more people play because something that gave me a lot more trouble is right around the corner.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
