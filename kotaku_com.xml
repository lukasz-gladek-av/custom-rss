              <p><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale might not have paid off all the various story threads this season set up, but it did tease a location rarely seen in the games and featured the reveal of something big returning from <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>. Spoilers below for the season in general and the finale episode in particular. If you haven’t watched it yet and don’t want to be spoiled, don’t keep scrolling!</p>  <p>After two seasons of following the Ghoul as he searched for his family, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finale-margot-enclave-cooper-janey-2000665411"><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale</a> finally brings him face to face with…their empty cryopods hidden deep in a secret Vault below Mr. House’s Lucky 38 Casino. Dang. But inside his wife’s tube is a postcard for Colorado, giving him hope that his family is still alive in the midwestern state.</p>

 <p>So off he goes on a new quest to hopefully find his wife and daughter after a heck of a 200 years. During the credits, a billboard reinforces the idea that next season will, at least partially, be set in Colorado. What do we know about Colorado in the <em>Fallout</em> universe, and what can we expect?</p> <h2>Colorado In The <em>Fallout</em> Universe</h2> <p>Colorado is a state that has been mentioned a few times in past games and <em>Fallout</em> media, but has rarely played a big role. It, like most of the rest of the United States in <em>Fallout</em>, was mostly wiped out by the nuclear bombs dropped during the Great War. Colorado’s biggest appearance in the games thus far happened in<em> Fallout Tactics</em>, a game that isn’t wholly canon, but parts of it might be (it’s weird). In that 2001 tactical turn-based RPG spin-off, we are introduced to Vault 0.</p>

 <p><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_0">Vault 0</a> is set in an expanded version of the real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain_Complex#Video_games">Cheyenne Mountain Complex</a>, a large underground U.S. military bunker designed to survive nuclear war and other massive attacks. Exactly what happens in <em>Fallout Tactics</em> isn’t really important, but Vault 0 and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex could play a part in season three. We know the Enclave is still around, and it would make sense for them to hole up in something like that to hide away from the rest of the wasteland.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, as pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/fallout-season-3-location/">PC Gamer</a>,</em> in the lead-up to <em>Fallout</em> season one, Amazon posted an hour-long video about the opening of Vault 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/o1YhcviJ7IU?t=761">And during the stream, an announcer says this</a>: “Unless you’re the President of the United States or something like that, and you have a mountain in Colorado to go under and direct the events of the world.” And who did Cooper Howard run into in this season and hand off the Cold Fusion capsule to? The president. I suspect Vault 0 or a version of it will play a role in season three.</p> <p>One other interesting thing to note about Colorado is that the original version of <em>Fallout 3</em> that was being developed by Black Isle Studios before it was canceled was going to be partially set in Colorado. Fitting that Colorado will likely play a big role in season three of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> show, given that it was previously featured in both the third <em>Fallout</em> game ever made (<em>Tactics</em>) and the original <em>Fallout 3</em> (Project Van Buren).</p>

 <h2>That Other Big (Wink) Tease</h2> <p>After all the credits, Amazon included a post-credits teaser scene featuring Elder Cleric Quintus and Dane back at the Brotherhood’s Area 51 base we saw earlier in the season. Chaos is continuing there after Maximus took off with the Cold Fusion capsule. Anyway, Dane brings Quintus a scroll. He tells the scribe that Quintus the Unifier is no more. Instead, he is now Quintus the Destroyer and unrolls the scroll to reveal a blueprint for Liberty Prime.</p> <p>We technically saw what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1qcvxny/surprised_no_one_is_mentioning_this/">appears to be Liberty Prime earlier this season</a> in a photo featuring Mr. House’s body double. But this is the giant democracy-defending robot’s first real appearance in the show. Or, well, he appears as a blueprint schematic. Close enough.</p> <p>This seems to be a new version of the big robot, named Liberty Prime Alpha, and is different from the mech that first appeared in <em>Fallout 3</em> and later in <em>Fallout 4</em>. I’m not yet convinced this ragtag chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel is going to be able to create its own Liberty Prime. Perhaps it’s buried away in Area 51? We’ll have to wait until season three to find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On January 29, <em>Ashes of Creation</em> maker Intrepid Studios was promising big updates to the recently launched, long-awaited fantasy Steam MMO. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ashes-creation-refund-kickstarter-steam-mmo-layoffs-2000665006">Less than a week later</a>, the game has been review-bombed, removed from Valve’s storefront, and seen all of its developers suddenly fired, according to a new post from the studio’s communications director.</p> <p><span>“I waited until today to share this because I wanted to be sure I was communicating from a place of clarity,” Intrepid Studios head of marketing Margaret Krohn <a href="https://x.com/MargaretKrohn/status/2018794224276377819">wrote on X</a> on Tuesday. “Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect. What I can share is what I experienced. On January 28, toward the end of the workday, I was informed that we would be laying off 100 developers. I was devastated – these are hardworking people who were going to lose their jobs. Still, I believed it was something we could face together and find a path forward from.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I waited until today to share this because I wanted to be sure I was communicating from a place of clarity.</p> <p>Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect.

But according to Krohn, the mass firings at the studio were already moving forward. She said she received confirmation of which members of her team would be laid off by the end of day on January 29, and the remaining employees began working on “ways to move forward” the following day. But by January 31, it became clear that no one at the studio was safe.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“On January 31, we were all informed via a confusing email that we would be laid off, along with a WARN notice,” she wrote. “It is still shocking. The entire studio gathered to try to understand what had happened and what it meant for our future. In the end, none of us are receiving our final paychecks, the 60 days notice and pay outlined under the WARN Act, PTO payouts, or other compensation owed.”</span></p>

 <p>That’s the same day that <em>Ashes of Creation</em> director Steven Sharif announced on Discord he was no longer in control of the company and was resigning in protest.&nbsp;“I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation,” he wrote on January 31. “Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665514" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665514"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665514">Valve / Intrepid Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That was the first public mention of the turmoil Intrepid was facing and it immediately ricocheted across Steam, where<em> Ashes of Creation</em> entered Early Access back in December, and Kickstarter, where backers raised $3.2 million to bring the MMORPG to market starting way back in 2017. The game was quickly review-bombed on Valve’s storefront with warnings to other players to stay away of what soon might become a dead game, while backers on Kickstarter demanded refunds over the game never hitting a proper 1.0 launch. It’s since been removed from sale completely on Steam.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“What matters most to me now are the people – both the players and developers,” Krohn wrote today. “To the players: the entire development team was working extremely hard, pulling long hours, and wishes with all our hearts that we could give you <em>Ashes of Creation</em>. There are no words that fully express how sorry we are that this journey ended this way. You should pursue a refund, you deserve it. To my colleagues: this team is truly a family. The culture we built together is something I have never experienced anywhere else. In the midst of heartbreak and uncertainty, we have come together to review resumes, help with portfolios, share job leads, and support one another emotionally.”</span></p>

 <p>As of now, it’s unclear who remains in control of Intrepid Studios as a company, which is based out of San Diego, or what will happen to <em>Ashes of Creation</em>, whose potential for a comeback seems increasingly unlikely. Who funded the game’s development? How did the studio’s finances suddenly get wiped out overnight? And what recourse do developers who worked on it have to be made whole? <em>Kotaku</em> tried reaching out to the studio’s email address but we haven’t heard back. Sharif declined to comment before clearing it with his legal counsel.</p> <p>When we reached out to <span> Krohn she responded with the following: “I made my statement. I can’t really talk more than that, I think I might have even said too much as is, but people need to know what happened.”<br> </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Next-Gen Xbox On Track For 2027 Launch Says AMD CEO]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-on-track-for-2027-launch-says-amd-ceo-2000665496</link>
            <guid>1424758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su shared some interesting information about two upcoming video game devices, <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Valve’s Steam Machine</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-xbox-microsoft-phil-spencer-new-console-1851700253">Xbox’s next-gen console</a>, both of which are powered by her company’s chips.</p> <p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/amd-spills-the-beans-on-next-gen-xbox-launching-in-2027/">As reported by <em>Gamesbeat</em></a> on February 3, Su shared some new info about when to expect Valve’s upcoming console-like PC gaming box, the Steam Machine, and further teased a possible launch window for Microsoft’s previously confirmed-to-be-in-development next-generation Xbox.</p> <p>“From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year,” claimed Su in prepared remarks ahead of a financial call.&nbsp; “And development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom [System on Chip] is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>

 <p>This isn’t a confirmation that the next Xbox will launch in 2027, but Su did point out that both the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will be entering their seventh year on the market at that point, and that’s a good time for a refresh.</p> <p>Valve’s Steam Machine has a confirmed release date of 2026, but nothing any more specific. Valve says the Steam hardware family will expand in early 2026, but didn’t specify if that was all three recently announced devices, just one, or some other combo like the VR headset and new controller. Su’s comments seem to indicate that Valve could start selling and shipping Steam Machines to customers within the next few months. Meanwhile, we’ve known for some time that Microsoft is trying to get the next Xbox out <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">around 2027</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-game-pass-gen-10-release-date-microsoft-1850849528">possibly 2028</a>. Microsoft execs have also teased that the next-gen Xbox will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">a “very premium, very high-end” device</a>, so it doesn’t sound cheap.</p>

 <h2>The next generation of game consoles will be expensive</h2> <p>While Su didn’t talk about prices, it’s pretty clear to anyone paying attention that any video game consoles or console-like devices arriving in the near future are going to cost quite a bit. President Trump’s tariffs have led to increased prices on many goods made overseas. Meanwhile, AI hyperscalers and tech giants are <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">scooping up more and more PC parts, like RAM and GPUs</a>, to help build out massive AI data centers. <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">This has led to memory prices skyrocketing</a>, and Nvidia is even reportedly looking to start making old GPUs again as the parts needed to make newer cards are routed toward making high-end cards for data centers.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-nintendo-ram-shortage-2000658946">Existing consoles, like the Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Xbox Series X/S,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">could also see price increases</a> in the future due to memory shortages and the rising cost of PC parts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">Even AMD’s cheaper GPUs are reportedly going to see price increases</a>. Meanwhile, when we’ve seen new gaming-adjacent tech launch in the last 12 months, the prices have been high, as in the case of Xbox and ROG’s handheld PC which <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-price-preorder-2000629161">costs $1,000.</a> And it looks like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">Steam Machine will possibly cost $800 to $1000</a> or more when it launches later this year.</p> <p>What does all of this mean for the PlayStation 6 and next Xbox? It means you probably need to start saving now if you want to afford one of these devices when they launch in the next 24 months or so. And maybe be prepared to go without one for a while, as it’s likely there will be shortages for a long time following either console’s future launch.</p>
