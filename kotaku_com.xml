Mio, the angsty introvert of the duo, writes science fiction to cope with her difficult upbringing. Zoe, a bubbly fantasy writer, escapes into stories of dungeons and dragons to process her trauma. While playing Hazelight’s latest co-op adventure, I was curious how the action-platformer would spotlight both its leads’ fictions in its final levels, assuming it would no longer be alternating between the sci-fi and fantasy worlds. Would it take place in some kind of neutral world that wouldn’t show favor to either of its heroes? Could Hazelight maybe just hone in on one of their stories for simplicity’s sake? As it turns out, the studio didn’t take any of the easy options, and the result is an incredible display of the team’s technical skill and inventive game design.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196123" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="196123,196789,197298" data-current="196123"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21655.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Split Fiction</em>, Mio and Zoe have been trapped in a virtual reality that extracts ideas from authors’ brains, to be packaged and sold by a tech corporation called Rader Publishing. An accident occurs, and Mio and Zoe are stuck in a shared simulation, being thrown back and forth between sci-fi and fantasy stories, the pair working together to battle through each other’s imagination.</p><p>Beyond the occasional side quest, the simulation keeps a divide between both worlds, but as the pair tear down the facade from the inside it becomes more unstable, and they’re almost able to break free and go back to their real world. However, in a last-ditch effort to save his brain-scraping machine, Rader of Rader Publishing forcibly enters the simulation himself, destabilizing all that’s come before to introduce the final 30 minutes of the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-recommend-id="image://23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-recommend-id="image://23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, it appears both players are, for the first time, existing in two separate worlds. Mio wakes up in her sci-fi story, while Zoe is thrown into her fantasy world. But after some brief platforming, the two find each other, yet each side of the game’s split screen depicts entirely different levels. Structurally, they are identical, but where Mio sees buildings and gaseous planets in the distance, Zoe sees a magical forest. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s co-op gameplay requires communication and coordination, but it was all while occupying the same space. Now, because the level is rendered as both sci-fi <em>and</em> fantasy, some objects are only interactive for one player, while the other has to find some way to help them from their “side.” For example, something that appears as just a pushable box to Mio might be a bouncy mushroom for Zoe, something she can use to jump high enough to reach an objective. Or perhaps some flora in the fantasy world could appear as a computer terminal in the sci-fi one. <em>Split Fiction</em> mostly delegates puzzle-solving and combat roles by giving its characters different tools. In the final level, that division of labor becomes inherent in the world design. Mio and Zoe are occupying the same space, but only one of them can see the way forward at a time. It leads to silly moments like when Zoe has to swim to reach an objective and Mio can’t see how she’s floating above what—to her—looks like a chasm. These two worlds are rendered simultaneously, with both characters moving through their respective worlds, affecting the other, all without once showing any signs of performance trouble. It’s a clever way to give sci-fi and fantasy equal weight in the final push, but it doesn’t stop at one impressive technical feat.</p><p>As the simulation continues to fall apart, <em>Split Fiction </em>starts playing with the boundaries of everything you thought you knew up to that point. Hazards appear in Mio’s sci-fi world that she has to avoid by moving to the right side of the screen where Zoe’s fantasy story takes up space, then suddenly there’s an onslaught of enemies, aircrafts, and obstacles blocking your progress that requires both players to rapidly move between both levels, as you watch both characters and the worlds around them seamlessly shift from one genre to the other.</p><figure id="" data-id="a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-recommend-id="image://a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-recommend-id="image://a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>But it doesn’t end there</em>. After a brief boss fight with a kaiju version of Rader in the simulation’s home, Mio and Zoe are sent back to their respective worlds and all the rules you’ve been taught about how these intertwined worlds work go out the window. The splitscreen that was once just a dividing line to help both players navigate the world from their perspective becomes a chaotic obstacle you have to navigate. The bar in the middle of the screen rotates, pivots, and shifts in ways that constantly change the confines of both the sci-fi and fantasy worlds, exposing both players to different dangers and paths forward.</p><p>The split down the middle of your television becomes a weapon for your enemy to wield, depriving you of literal screen space where you can safely exist, moving the divide between both worlds to push you into the dangerous sides of your own creation. There’s a section where <em>Split Fiction</em>’s camera shifts to a top-down perspective, with the splitscreen spinning around like a carousel, exposing dangers from the fantasy world like piranhas, or science-fiction industrial grinders, and all you can do is frantically jump between worlds until Rader throws something else at you. It’s challenging and requires you to pull from your knowledge of every previous level to recognize hazards from one world and maneuver your way to safety in the other. <em>Split Fiction </em>manages to pull this off without a hitch, which is another incredible technical feat on top of being stunning gameplay.</p><figure id="" data-id="e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-recommend-id="image://e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-recommend-id="image://e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s something kinda poetic about an artless corpo having to wield Mio and Zoe’s created worlds to take them down because he’s incapable of imagining something of his own. The final boss fight, against Rader’s giant god form, is literally just him reaching into both of their stories and tossing whatever beast or machine he can in hopes that it might save his creation. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s final level is relentless, dragging both players between science and magic without a moment’s respite. Words don’t do it justice. Its visual splendor is mixed with clever and challenging game design, all tied in a tight thematic bow. It’s the kind of thing you can only experience to its fullest once, and I’m already miffed I’ll never get to experience the delight of playing it for the first time with my co-op partner, slackjawed and gobsmacked at how Hazelight pulled it off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can see a rusty, cobbled-together sign that says “Welcome to the strip.” This is the nicer area of New Vegas in the video games, and getting in isn’t cheap. </p><p>Of course, it’s hard to discern much more from these shaky videos and leaks and we don’t know precisely how New Vegas will be featured in <em>Fallout’s </em>next season. But regardless, I’m excited to see such an iconic and famous piece of <em>Fallout </em>turned into real sets. <em>Fallout’s </em>dedication to real, hand-built sets and not just relying on CG backgrounds is something I really appreciated about season one, and it seems we’ll be getting more of that in season 2 when it arrives at some yet-to-be-announced date in the future. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll need to have good aim and manage your metal ring resource well, while dealing with his limited mobility (compared to Dr. Strange, the other main tank in Rivals). If you can, you’ll find a very rewarding character with lots of room to show off.</p><h2 id="h488"><a id=""></a><strong>What are Magneto’s Abilities?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0dd3786265f624473ff79af6b072d986" data-recommend-id="image://0dd3786265f624473ff79af6b072d986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto's main character profile screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto's main character profile screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0dd3786265f624473ff79af6b072d986" data-recommend-id="image://0dd3786265f624473ff79af6b072d986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto's main character profile screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Iron Volley</strong> (Primary Attack - Left Click / Right Trigger) - Your primary attack. Solid damage which is influenced by how far it flies before it hits your enemy.</p><p><strong>Meteor M</strong> (Ultimate - L3+R3) - Magneto flies up into the air, drawing in all projectiles to feed “the sphere,” hit the button again to unleash it on your enemies and make them rue the day they crossed the Master of Magnetism. It will explode if you charge it too long, but it’s not a big problem as you’ll often be trying to use the ability quickly.</p><p><strong>Metallic Curtain</strong> (LT) - Creates a large wall of magnetic force that blocks projectiles. Use it when your health is getting low to protect yourself and nearby allies. Your main damage-mitigating ability, use it often, particularly if you and your allies need breathing room.</p><p><strong>Metal Bulwark</strong> (Right Click / RB) - A shield Magneto can give to his…less sturdy allies. Use it to save a key Dualist or Strategist from being knocked out, and claim any damage they take to feed the rings on your back, empowering Mag-Cannon.</p><p><strong>Iron Bulwark</strong> (B / Circle) - Magneto creates a shield around himself, and converts any damage taken during its duration into metal for the rings on his back. A great way to prepare your Mag-Cannon and mitigate damage. Use it every time it’s available during combat to make life easier for your healers (and yourself).</p><p><strong>Mag-Cannon</strong> (LB) - After charging up the rings on his back, Mag-Cannon unleashes them in a targeted attack, dealing more damage the more rings there are. The fully-powered version knocks enemies back several yards as well. Great for picking off enemies with low health, particularly Strategist characters and Dualists.</p><p><strong>Magnetic Descent</strong> (Passive) - Hold the jump button to float down instead of falling.</p><p><strong>Metallic Fusion</strong> (Team-Up Ability: Y / Triangle) - Teaming up with his daughter, the Scarlet Witch, Magneto gains the ability to power his Iron Volley with a massive sword, dealing more damage.</p><h2 id="h489"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play Magneto?</strong></h2><p>Magneto is a solid, all-around tank who moves slowly and more deliberately, but who also has several special moves that help him protect himself and his allies, as well as prepare to deal small bursts of damage afterwards. He is a fantastic choice for a Vanguard character, rewarding those who put in the time to truly master his skills.</p><figure id="" data-id="1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-recommend-id="image://1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-recommend-id="image://1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Three chevrons near the middle of the screen represent the rings on Magneto’s back, so keep an eye on them. When they are completely filled and purple, he gains a relatively hard-hitting secondary attack in Mag-Cannon. Use it to pick off low-health healers and DPS to help your team establish dominance in the contested area.</p><p>Keep an eye on your healers and DPS teammates and use your shield to protect vulnerable healers first, particularly when enemies are attacking them in the back of your team. If they are in a good state, you can use the shield on yourself to give the healers more breathing room—particularly if they are Mantis or Loki, who benefit greatly from the extra time to set up damage buffs, deal damage, and create clones, respectively.</p><figure id="" data-id="c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-recommend-id="image://c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-recommend-id="image://c5ceb09a66e97289a5ab74307fad799c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Use your ultimate when you want to scatter the enemy group, or as a counter to powerful ultimates like Cloak and Dagger, Invisible Woman, or Punisher. Since it absorbs projectiles, it is a great way to turn the tides, particularly if it also nullifies an enemy ultimate (and potentially the enemy who used it).</p><hr><p>With all these tips in hand, you are prepared to become a true master of magnetism. Good luck!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
