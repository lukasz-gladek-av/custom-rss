              <p>Roborock is celebrating its 11th birthday and instead of just blowing out the candles, the company is going to be giving the gifts to its customers. For a limited time, the entire line of smart robot vacuums is available with massive discounts and the discounts are so good that <strong>most of the models have reached their record low prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Among these, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3842/">Roborock Q8 Max is our favorite, and it’s currently on sale at $179, down from $599</a>. It’s not the newest model in the series but in<strong> terms of value for money it’s unbeatable</strong>, which is also why it’s the company’s best-selling unit in the world.</p>

<h2>Perfect for Everyday</h2>
<p>The powerful suction, <strong>which is 5500 Pa</strong>, is one of the first things you notice and it gives it the cleaning capability that’s usually reserved for high-end devices. Dust, crumbs, tiny particles and embedded dirt in carpets all disappear just as easily as lighter material resting on hardwood. Supporting this power is <strong>Roborock’s DuoRoller brush system</strong> that’s a smart twin roller design that’s resistant to hair tangling and rolls easily across a range of surfaces. For pet owners, this is peace of mind that the vacuum won’t be choked after a single pass through a hairy patch in the living room.</p>
<p>But a robot vacuum is more than just brute force, because if it doesn’t clean intelligently, performance quickly becomes frustrating: That’s where the Q8 Max differs from bargain-class machines. With Roborock’s PreciSense LiDAR navigation system, <strong>it accurately scans and maps the home</strong>, and builds a detailed layout that allows it to map routes logically. Combined with obstacle detection technology, the Roborock Q8 Max neatly avoids cords, toys, and table legs, so it gets stuck less and has more time actually cleaning.</p>



<p>Another reason this model has been so popular is that it does not just vacuum,<strong> it also mops and it does both in a single pass</strong>. The onboard electronic water tank has thirty levels of flow control so you can adjust the mop output to clean anything from sensitive hardwood to tile. This means beyond a surface touch-up, you get a deeper clean without needing to switch devices or start multiple cycles.</p>
<p>Battery life and independence are also crucial to the experience: The <strong>5200 mAh battery offers up to four hours of runtime from a single charge</strong>, and covers areas as large as 300 square meters in one go. To further simplify upkeep, the automatic dust-emptying dock holds weeks’ worth of debris in its 2.5-liter sealed bag. For most households, that means quite literally <strong>not needing to consider bin emptying for nearly two months</strong> as your robot does the lion’s share of the floor cleaning quietly in the background. Add in Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri compatibility, and it is a home companion that responds to voice commands without demanding attention in return.</p>
<p>That’s why the Q8 Max has been the best-seller for Roborock.</p>
<p>With Roborock celebrating its 11 years of innovation, getting the opportunity to grab the Q8 Max at this all-time low&nbsp; price point makes it a no-brainer.</p>

              <p>Hideo Kojima is celebrating ten years of his Kojima Productions company with a lengthy livestream and live show later this month. Beyond the Strand will take place on September 23 at the TOHO Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Toyko, and be livestreamed out to the gorgeous masses, where the developer promises “glimpses into future projects.”</p> <p>It’s a somewhat premature celebration, given Kojima Productions wasn’t officially founded until December 16, 2015, but it seems likely the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em> creator is itching to speak about what his studio is working on now that <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is out. So far, Kojima Productions has given us two&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em> games, but we know that <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289/3">a horror game called&nbsp;<em>OD</em></a> is already in the works, starring the extraordinary Sophia Lillis (<em>I Am Not Okay With This</em>,&nbsp;<em>It</em>) and Hunter Schafer (<em>Euphoria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cuckoo</em>), as well as&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em> spiritual successor <a href="https://kotaku.com/physint-kojima-metal-gear-ps6-release-date-od-1851781247"><em>Physint</em></a>.</p>  <p>However,&nbsp;<em>Physint</em> is thought to be at least five years away, and there hasn’t been anything to see of <em>OD</em> since the above announcement video. The latter experienced an eight month delay due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, but is now back in development. So could we be getting updates on these, perhaps even something in-game? Well, given Kojima’s preference for flair and mystery, footage seems unlikely. But given this is scheduled to be two-and-a-half hours long, there’s got to be&nbsp;<em>something</em>.</p>

 <p>There’s also word that Kojima is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-a24-1851099101">making a movie based on&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em></a>, so perhaps there’s news to be revealed on that? Maybe even shots of Norman Reedus falling over on a hill? The developer has also hinted at other&nbsp;<em>DS</em> adaptations, although he’s been incredibly vague about what they could be. There’s also <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289/7">been word about other TV or film projects</a> ahead of <em>Physint</em>.</p> <p>The only details about Beyond the Strand we have right now, beyond the “glimpses,” are that there will be “special guest appearances.” Geoff? Oh god, imagine if he&nbsp;<em>didn’t</em> invite Geoff. That’d be such a move.</p> <p>If you live anywhere near Tokyo, <a href="https://l-tike.com/cinema/mevent/?mid=763198">tickets for the event went on sale today</a>, September 2, via a lottery system. The livestream details will apparently be announced closer to the event. In the meantime, my absolute favorite detail is in the small print: “<span lang="EN-GB">We cannot be held responsible for any disputes between attendees.”</span></p>
