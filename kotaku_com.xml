It’s no surprise, then, that new games featuring beloved developers tend to make such a splash. Such is the case with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2844850/FANTASIAN_Neo_Dimension/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2844850/FANTASIAN_Neo_Dimension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em></a></span>, which has been brought to life by the father of Final Fantasy, Hironobu Sakaguchi.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Now, players can finally check it out on consoles and PC with this remastered version of the mobile title under the new name <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>.</p><p>While the core game remains largely untouched, newcomers to the experience can enjoy a new difficulty option and 4K support on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC— though the Nintendo Switch version tops out at 1080p.</p><p>With much of the adventure remaining the same, you can expect to spend around the same amount of time with <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> as you would the mobile version. Here’s what you need to know about how long it takes to beat the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="79dd326bd0d4850d723e348edb2f8ee8" data-recommend-id="image://79dd326bd0d4850d723e348edb2f8ee8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character runs across a diorama-like environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character runs across a diorama-like environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker Corporation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79dd326bd0d4850d723e348edb2f8ee8" data-recommend-id="image://79dd326bd0d4850d723e348edb2f8ee8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character runs across a diorama-like environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h167950"><a id=""></a>How Long Is <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>?</h2><p><em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> is a surprisingly lengthy title for a previously mobile-only outing. <strong>The game’s main story can take around 30-40 hours </strong>for those who aren’t rushing to the finale. However, that would be overlooking much of what makes <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> such a thrilling journey.</p><p>The game also has a a wide variety of optional content beyond the main story and plenty of Trophies/Achievements to unlock if you want to experience everything that <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> has to offer. To fully complete everything, you’ll need to reach level 99, defeat thousands of enemies, collect a wide selection of weapons and armor, read every novel scene, and much more.</p><figure id="" data-id="44f5b3aab21bb01b41c2e21f470cd82e" data-recommend-id="image://44f5b3aab21bb01b41c2e21f470cd82e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters battle against a tree monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters battle against a tree monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker Corporation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="44f5b3aab21bb01b41c2e21f470cd82e" data-recommend-id="image://44f5b3aab21bb01b41c2e21f470cd82e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters battle against a tree monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Completionists looking to meet all of these demands can expect to spend up to <strong>80-90</strong> hours with <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>.
