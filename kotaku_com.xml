              <p>Virtual reality stopped being a futuristic fantasy the moment Meta cracked the code on affordable and high-quality headsets that actually work without a gaming PC tethered to your head. The <strong>Quest 3S brings premium VR experiences at a fraction of what you’d expect to pay</strong>, and Amazon just dropped both storage configurations to record-low prices for early Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">128GB model (including a Gorilla Tag bundle) now costs $249 instead of $299</a>; and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the 256GB version (including Batman: Arkham Shadow) sits at $329 down from $399</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Quest 3S Destroys the Value Competition</h2>
<p>Meta equipped the Quest 3S with the same core processor inside the flagship Quest 3 <strong>and offers you identical graphical processing capability for significantly less</strong>. That Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip boasts double the GPU performance of the Quest 2 for rendering virtual environments with sharper textures, smoother frame rates and more complex objects.</p>
<p>The Quest 3S runs <strong>entirely wireless and frees you from the cable management nightmares that plague PC VR setups</strong>. You simply charge the headset, put it on, and jump into experiences without configuring external sensors or worrying about tripping over cords mid-game. This standalone design means you can play in your living room or even outside if you want with the h<strong>eadset tracking your movements</strong> through built-in cameras and sensors. Battery life typically gives you<strong> two to three hours of active play</strong> before needing a recharge which feels about right for VR sessions before eye strain sets in anyway.</p>



<p>Both bundles include<strong> immediate access to more than 40 games</strong>&nbsp;and avoids the sticker shock of buying a headset only to find out you’ll have to spend another hundred bucks on software. The 128GB version includes an exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle, while the 256GB model throws in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>, along with a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+, which unlocks even more premium titles.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing that’s become a cultural phenomenon in VR, it’s Gorilla Tag, which lets you swing through environments using only arm movements in a shockingly physical workout disguised as a game. Batman: Arkham Shadow is a full-fledged superhero adventure built specifically for VR with hand-to-hand combat and detective work that feels genuinely immersive.</p>
<p>Storage considerations matter more than you might think with VR headsets, too. Games with detailed environments and high-resolution textures can easily consume 10GB to 20GB each, and the Quest 3S does not support expandable storage. The 128GB model gives you enough room for roughly eight to ten major games plus several smaller experiences, which works fine if you’re comfortable deleting and redownloading titles as you rotate through your library. The 256GB version doubles that capacity and lets you maintain a larger installed library without constant storage management.</p>



<p>The visual experience inside the Quest 3S uses <strong>Fresnel lenses with a resolution of 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye</strong>, and matches the Quest 2’s clarity while benefiting from that doubled processing power. Colors pop with better saturation, black levels deepen in dark scenes, and the overall image feels crisper during gameplay. The Quest 3 does offer slightly better optics with pancake lenses that reduce the headset’s overall bulk, but the visual improvement doesn’t justify the $250 price premium for most users.</p>
<p><strong>Meta’s mixed reality capabilities</strong> transform your real room into a game zone by mapping your furniture and walls, then seamlessly integrating virtual elements. You could place a virtual chess board on your real coffee table, have a movie screen floating above your couch, or defend your living room from virtual invaders crawling across your real furniture.</p>
<p><strong>The Quest 3S weighs about 515 grams</strong> and distributes that mass across your face with adjustable straps that take into account head size and shapes. Comfort will, of course, vary from person to person, but most people can handle hour-plus sessions before taking a break. The included elastic strap works well enough, though more serious VR enthusiasts often upgrade to Meta’s Elite Strap for better weight distribution during longer play.</p>
<p>At these early Black Friday prices, the Quest 3S completely rewrites the entry cost for quality VR. When you’re paying almost double for marginal improvements, the regular Quest 3 simply can’t compete on value. And for PC-based headsets, an expensive computer is needed in addition to the investment into the headset itself. Meta nailed the sweet spot between performance and affordability with this model.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovos-15-inch-512gb-laptop-is-nearly-free-amazon-cuts-prices-by-78-and-wants-it-all-gone-2000644589</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo%E2%80%99s-15-inch-512gb-laptop-is-nearly-free-amazon-cuts-prices-by-78-and-wants-it-all-gone.1354666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Picking a new laptop isn’t easy these days. With endless options flooding the market, most of us tend to stick to reliable brands and Lenovo remains one of the few that never disappoints. Right now, one of its most complete models, the Lenovo <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5601/">IdeaPad Slim 3 with a 15.3‑inch FHD+ display, Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM and 512GB PCIe SSD, is down to an all‑time low of $549 from $2,499</a>, now 78% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power, Speed, and Everyday Practicality</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is built for the kind of multitasking modern life demands. The <strong>13th‑gen Intel Core i5‑13420H chip delivers eight cores</strong> (four Performance + four Efficiency cores) and twelve threads which means you can run multiple professional apps, stream media, and browse with dozens of tabs open – all without slowdown. Its turbo frequency reaches 4.6 GHz, giving the extra power burst needed for quick data crunchingor content creation sessions.</p>
<p>Storage also gets a serious boost thanks to the 512 GB PCIe SSD: That’s enough space for a full library of files, photos and software, while keeping boot and loading times near‑instant. It’s the kind of performance jump that makes going back to a traditional hard drive nearly impossible. You only need to lift the lid and the system wakes instantly, ready for work or play.</p>



<p>Then there’s the display: a <strong>15.3‑inch WUXGA panel (1920 × 1200) with a 16:10 aspect ratio for extra vertical room</strong>. It’s crisp, bright at 300 nits, and features an anti‑glare coating that keeps reflections minimal even under strong lighting. The narrow bezels make the entire setup look modern, while the 45 percent NTSC color coverage produces consistent tones for everyday use. Whether you’re streaming shows or reviewing presentations, the wide‑angle IPS screen ensures what you see is both vibrant and fatigue‑free.</p>
<p>The IdeaPad Slim 3 features Wi‑Fi 6 for faster and more reliable wireless performance and Bluetooth 5.2 for low‑latency peripheral pairing. Its generous port selection makes life easier: two USB‑A ports, one USB‑C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, an HDMI output, a 3.5 mm audio jack, an SD card reader, and of course the power connector. That means no annoying dongle juggling when you want to plug in a mouse, transfer photos or connect to an external monitor.</p>



<p>This 15‑inch Lenovo is slimmer than the previous generation by around 10%. At roughly 4 pounds, it strikes the right balance between portability and sturdiness. The hinge feels solid but light enough to open with one hand, and the full‑size keyboard with number pad makes typing comfortable even during long sessions of data entry or writing. Lenovo always manages to hit that sweet spot between form and function and this one’s a perfect example.</p>
<p>Daily usability shines through small, thoughtful touches like efficient cooling that keeps fan noise low and the Copilot key on the keyboard, giving instant access to Microsoft’s AI assistant. That’s a rare feature for a laptop in this price category, and it aligns perfectly with the growing shift toward AI‑enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>Whether you’re browsing the web, managing spreadsheets or taking Zoom calls, the IdeaPad Slim 3 stays responsive and cool through it all. Its battery performance comfortably lasts through a full workday with light productivity mixed with streaming. Pair that with <strong>fast charging and you’re back to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong> using any modern USB‑C charger.</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for a reliable daily driver, the IdeaPad Slim 3 is about as balanced as it gets. Amazon discounts come and go but this one feels special.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-pair-of-magnetic-wireless-chargers-costs-peanuts-now-cheaper-than-an-apple-charging-cable-2000644584</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Owning a MagSafe compatible charger is one of those small luxuries that makes daily life feel smooth: no cables, no fumbling, just drop your phone and watch it charge. The only catch? Normally, buying a single official one costs almost as much as a wired charger and cable combined. But this early Black Friday deal flips that logic upside down. Right now on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5600/">the Anker Zolo magnetic wireless charger 2-pack is selling for just $25, down from $39</a>. That’s <strong>cheaper than what Apple charges for a single USB-C cable</strong>, and you’re getting two fast wireless pads that work brilliantly with the latest iPhones and AirPods.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5600/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Cool Convenient Charging for Daily Use</h2>
<p>Magnetic chargers have become a staple among iPhone owners due to the ease they deliver. Instead of searching behind the nightstand for your cable, you just snap your phone onto the charging pad, and it locks in place every time. The Anker Zolo pads use <strong>Qi2 certified technology to deliver up to 15 watts of fast charging</strong> which is sufficient to bring an iPhone 17 Pro Max up to 20 percent in just 19 minutes when combined with a 20W or higher wall adapter.</p>



<p>What makes this a great everyday charger is the smart protection system inside. Anker’s ActiveShield 2.0 monitors<strong> temperature levels more than 8 million times a day</strong>, and automatically adjusts power flow to prevent overheating. That means your phone or earbuds stay cool even during overnight charging, while the battery’s long‑term health remains protected. It’s the kind of detail most people never think about, but it’s crucial if you charge your phone daily and want it to still perform like new next year.</p>



<p>Each pad comes with a <strong>5‑foot cable</strong>&nbsp;which is much longer than most standard chargers-giving you more freedom to move your phone while it’s powering up. You can easily FaceTime, scroll, or stream with the cable stretched comfortably across your couch or desktop, sans that tight, awkward pull that short cords create. If you’ve ever tried texting while your phone’s plugged into a short 3‑foot charger, you know the difference those extra inches make.</p>
<p>The compact form factor makes these chargers great for travel, too. They fit easily into a laptop sleeve or small pouch and come with a handy cable tie that keeps everything neat. Toss one in your backpack for the office and leave the other on your nightstand-no need to keep reconnecting cables or worrying about frayed connectors. The simplicity of dropping your phone on the pad and walking away quickly becomes addictive.</p>



<p>While each Anker Zolo pad works well enough on its own as a charger, and gets two in one set makes it feel like an instant home upgrade. Keep one beside your bed and one on your desk, or place them side by side for family use so that there’s always one handy. Even if you never give much thought to chargers, this deal is of the sort you’ll be appreciative of daily: a little convenience that makes life with technology smoother in subtle ways.</p>
<p>What’s also impressive at this price is how Anker didn’t strip away support or design to make it cheaper. The build feels premium, the surface has enough grip to keep devices in place, and the magnets snap precisely where they should. <strong>Coming in at under $13 per pad</strong>, the value here borders on absurd when compared to single‑charger prices from other brands.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-tiny-gadget-lets-you-connect-your-bluetooth-headphones-to-the-planes-screen-and-it-costs-pennies-2000644579</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-tiny-gadget-lets-you-connect-your-bluetooth-headphones-to-the-plane%E2%80%99s-screen-and-it-costs-pennies.1354642/</guid>

              <p>If you’ve ever been stuck<strong> on a long flight watching a movie with those cheap wired earbuds the airline hands out</strong>, you’ll understand why small Bluetooth transmitters exist. The <em>Ugreen</em> airplane Bluetooth 6.0 transmitter solves one of the most annoying travel problems: letting you use your own wireless headphones with the in‑flight entertainment system. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/">it’s down to an all‑time low price of $18, down from its usual $27 on Amazon</a>. It’s the kind of tiny gadget that instantly makes travel more comfortable and feels like a small luxury upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Game‑Changer for Travel</h2>
<p>What’s so clever about this little adapter is that it turns <strong>almost any traditional audio source into a wireless one</strong>. Plug it into the headphone jack on the plane seat, the TV in your hotel room or even an old car stereo, and you can connect your Bluetooth earbuds or headset in seconds. No tangled wires, no adapters dangling from your seat — just your own choice of headphones and clear sound.</p>



<p>The connection quality is surprisingly solid for something this small. <strong>Due to Bluetooth 6.0, pairing happens almost instantly</strong> and the range extends up to 10 meters — that’s enough to move freely in a living room or even stroll across a hotel suite without losing the signal. The newer Bluetooth spec also cuts down the annoying audio delay that used to make videos and games slightly out of sync.</p>



<p>What’s more, the Ugreen unit <strong>holds up to 18 hours of use in receiver mode and 16 hours in transmission mode</strong>&nbsp;which will easily cover a full day of travel, including layovers and entertainment before landing. You can charge it during use if needed, but in practice, most users say it goes days between charges. For frequent flyers, that’s the difference between a gadget you need to babysit and one you can forget about until the next trip.</p>



<p>But what really makes this adapter flexible is its two‑in‑one design: In TX or transmit mode, it streams audio from non-Bluetooth devices such as airline seats, TVs, or older gaming consoles, directly to wireless headphones. In RX or receive mode, meanwhile, the device does the opposite, turning wired speakers or car stereos into Bluetooth receivers. You can stream music from your phone to your old home speakers or plug it into a car AUX port for instant wireless audio playback.</p>
<p>Even better, the Ugreen transmitter is able to <strong>pair with two pairs of headphones simultaneously</strong>. So if you’re traveling with a friend or partner, both of you can watch the same movie from the plane’s screen without bothering to split a pair of wired earbuds. It’s a simple feature, but one that genuinely makes those long flights more enjoyable. The built‑in microphone is another nice touch – if you’re using it in receiver mode with your phone, you can answer calls hands‑free without disconnecting.</p>
<p>At this price, it’s hard to think of another gadget that adds this much comfort to travel and everyday listening. The build quality is solid, the functionality is well thought out, and it covers so many small annoyances that accumulate over time. It’s the kind of item that costs very little yet quietly changes how you travel and listen. And considering this $18 deal is the lowest it’s ever gone on Amazon, it might be one of those rare impulse buys that pays off immediately.</p>
