The Ice King will begin attacking it from underneath, taking out chunks of the landing. Occasionally he will also swipe above the platform; this attack is indicated by a line of reddish paw prints. Keep moving around to dodge these attacks and once the platform gets small enough, Mio and Zoe will fall to the ground below and the real fight will start. </p><h2 id="h313181"><a id=""></a> The first phase </h2><figure id="" data-id="b0aade99497c3a6058ba5c8675f79a56" data-recommend-id="image://b0aade99497c3a6058ba5c8675f79a56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split view shows the protagonists of Split-Fiction abttling the Ice King." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split view shows the protagonists of Split-Fiction abttling the Ice King." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0aade99497c3a6058ba5c8675f79a56" data-recommend-id="image://b0aade99497c3a6058ba5c8675f79a56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split view shows the protagonists of Split-Fiction abttling the Ice King." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Raised slightly above the battlefield, the Ice King will create columns of ice. Run between them to avoid getting hit. After he sends out several of these, he will start to slam on the ground, raising chunks of ice that need to be jumped over. He will then raise on his hind legs for a second, giving whoever is controlling Zoe enough time to turn into her tree spirit and pull him to the ground. Once this is done, Mio should run over to his face and begin pummeling it. Note that sometimes, after sending out the shockwaves of ice, the Ice King will pause for a moment before resuming his attack. This is a trick to get Zoe to turn into the tree spirit which is unable to jump. Don’t fall for it. Make sure he is fully upright before trying to pull him down.</p><p>After dealing enough damage to him, the Ice King will cause icicles to litter the arena, culminating in a gigantic one in the center. Stand in the small spaces between or where the icicles have already fallen to avoid getting hit. He will then resume the pillars of ice, but this time, icicles will be falling as well. Continue moving to avoid taking damage. Eventually he will repeat the shockwave attack letting you use the tree spirit and gorilla to deal more damage.</p><h2 id="h313182"><a id=""></a> A cool intermission </h2><figure id="" data-id="07f6121aeaf6d98113074dad081c1502" data-recommend-id="image://07f6121aeaf6d98113074dad081c1502" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction slide down an iced spiral." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction slide down an iced spiral." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="07f6121aeaf6d98113074dad081c1502" data-recommend-id="image://07f6121aeaf6d98113074dad081c1502" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction slide down an iced spiral." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After hitting him twice, the Ice King will once again break the arena you are fighting on.

The Ice King will start the fight by creating a vortex in the pool which sends out small tornadoes. Run around the perimeter of the pool by dodging the tornadoes. The vortex will then disappear allowing Mio to turn into her axolotl form and jump in. There is a giant ball in the center that she can throw above the surface. Zoe must then use the tree spirit to catch it in midair and throw it at the Ice King to stun him. Have Mio race back to land and turn into her gorilla to throw a few more punches his way.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Ice King will freeze the pool and repeat the vortex attack. Dodge as you did previously and he will use a new attack once the tornadoes clear which has him sending out bombs that follow you around. The trick is to dodge these attacks on top of the frozen pool to cause damage to the ice. Do this enough times, and the ice will break, allowing access to the plant ball again. Repeat the process to damage him once more and the Ice King will go down for good.</p><figure id="" data-id="6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-recommend-id="image://6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-recommend-id="image://6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ice King can be a little tricky given his high number of AoE (Area of Effect) attacks; but a good way to avoid this is by keeping some distance from you and your partner so you aren’t both taken out by the same attack. Other than that, follow this guide, and you will take out the first of Zoe’s bosses in no time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While that doesn’t mean a strike is currently in effect, it does mean the 300 members who are part of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA could initiate a strike if progress isn’t made at the bargaining table on their first contract.</p><p> “Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” said senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong in a press release. “None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.” </p><p> ZeniMax Workers United-CWA formed back in 2023 after the CWA cut a deal with Microsoft to support its bid to acquire Activision Blizzard in exchange for the tech giant remaining “neutral” on unionization within the company. Instead of fighting the process, Microsoft would voluntarily recognize any union with majority support among its members. Things sound less congenial at the bargaining table. The Bethesda union held a one-day work stoppage last fall and filed an unfair labor practice charge against Microsoft for outsourcing work. The Xbox maker disputes that it’s being unreasonable. </p><p> “Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>Kotaku </em>in an email. “We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair—if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.” </p><p>Quality assurance testers have long been one of the most exploited groups of developers in the game industry, forced to work long hours for low pay as studios crunch to ship massive games with as few delays as possible. But the work is also one of the most valued by players. There’s nothing worse than running into a game-breaking bug or watching your character randomly die while falling through the floor after an hour-long boss fight. Bethesda championed 2022's <em>Starfield </em>as one of its most bug-free releases in years, and it was. </p><p>Microsoft is currently bringing<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to PlayStation 5 this month, followed by the release of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> in May. Bethesda’s next big release is expected to be <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, though the open-world RPG is likely still years away from coming out. A strike could potentially slow things down even further if a deal isn’t hashed out at the bargaining table.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
