Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto told fans in the Nintendo Today app that the shift was for “production reasons.” </p><p> “It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be,” he said. “Thank you for your patience.” </p><p>What’s notable about this new May launch window? That’s actually when <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em> was originally supposed to come out. However, that new chapter in the MCU was recently delayed until December 2027, with <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>similarly pushed from spring 2026 to around the holidays. </p><p>Ultimately, that’s good news for Nintendo and Sony, who it’s producing the movie with. <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>’s live-action debut can now have some room to breath while still joining the pre-summer blockbuster bandwagon. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em> is also rumored to be coming in 2027. Maybe we’ll get another Barbenheimer. Sonelda? Zonic? Is this anything?</p><p>Despite Nintendo being so transparent with the release schedule nearly two years away, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-movie-kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1851448204&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-movie-kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1851448204">we still don’t know anything else</a></span> about casting or what the movie will be like, including which stories from the games it might incorporate. Director Wes Ball, who helmed 2024's <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>, said he wants it to feel somewhat “grounded.” I hope Link is wearing his iron boots the whole time. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So I’ll start by saying no excuse of course like I should have been on this, we should have been on top of this.</p><p>He contionued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The second I got off that stage I called Derek our lead game designer and I said ‘Derek did you know we had an $80 bundle, this is news to me, like what the heck, that makes no sense,’ and he didn’t. Essentially what happened out former head of monetization who happened to come from call of duty was with us for less than a year and was very aggressive on price.</p><p> Actually prior to his departure we actually originally had founders packs for $100 and battle passes for $10 and the first thing Derek and I did when we revaluated everything a month ago was slash those things so founders went from $100 to $60 and we actually added in game currently that the game originally wasn’t going to have we decreased the battle pass from $10 to $5 but unfortunately things slipped through the cracks.</p></blockquote><p>In addition to shifting the blame to a past employee and once again trying to beef with <em>Call of Duty</em>, Proulx’s explanation doesn’t entirely square with the studio’s defending of the pricey cosmetics just days prior. “This pack features our most unique skins with complex animations &amp; artwork,” the official <em>Splitgate 2</em> account posted back on Friday. “We have a variety of cheaper options.  The game is free to play, &amp; you don’t need to buy anything to enjoy it to its fullest. Nothing is pay to win &amp; never will be.”<br></p><p>So did the bundle “slip through the cracks,” or is 1047 just backtracking now in the face of players revolting against a hostile monetization strategy that violates the “old school” ethos <em>Splitgate 2 </em>wants to cultivate? People have pointed out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l576z1/splitgate_2s_ingame_store_is_a_masterclass_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l576z1/splitgate_2s_ingame_store_is_a_masterclass_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the subreddit</a></span> that the problem isn’t just that the prices started out to high. The shooter’s in-game shop is also full of slimy practices like fake inflated discounts and currency mismatches so players always have to overspend to get what they want.</p><p>“Honestly, the store and its prices really feel like something out of a gacha game, except for the fact I don’t think I know of any gachas that have you <em>preorder</em> [battle] passes,” wrote one player. “Great gameplay, terrible business model,” wrote another.</p><p><em>Splitgate 2</em> is currently sitting at mixed reviews on Steam, though Proulx said the free-to-play shooter reached over 2 million players over the weekend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/neverwinter-nights-2-remastered-obsidian-rpg-aspyr-1851784064<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one thing we’re all guilty of, including you, it’s forgetting to mention <em>Neverwinter Nights 2</em> in the same breath as <em>Baldur’s Gate II</em>, <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>, and <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>. The Obsidian RPG is one of my favorite games <em>ever</em>, and yet, I’ll still forget to bring it up when totting the best RPGs. It’s like it has a curse upon its name, fated to go unmentioned. But perhaps that’s finally to be lifted, with the fantastic news that it’s due to receive an Enhanced Edition from Aspyr.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,196299,196903" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> BioWare’s original <em>Neverwinter Nights </em>launched with its own solid 60-hour solo campaign, but the game was primarily about equipping players with the tools to create their own online D&amp;D campaigns. That’s where its legacy lies, certainly, and Aspyr subsidiary Beamdog gave that game the remastering treatment back in 2018. But Obsidian’s sequel, released four years later in 2006, flipped the script. Yes, this was also a game designed to make creating player campaigns as accessible as possible, but first and foremost, it was its single-player story, and <em>wow</em>. Featuring some of the best companion characters in any of the BioWare-likes that made up the glory years of the RPG genre, this was the tale of an orphan, raised by a master elven ranger, setting out to defeat the King of Shadows.</p><p>BioWare aided the development, much as it had for Obsidian’s other borrowed sequel, <em>Knights of the Old Republic II</em>, while the game had former Black Isle employees responsible for the extraordinary <em>Planescape: Torment</em> in prominent positions. It was a game created by a development supergroup, and it shone for it.</p><p>Of course, like so many 20-year-old games, it does feel awfully clunky now, so it’s excellent news to hear Aspyr is giving it a remaster. Here’s the trailer, but don’t get over-excited at the opening moments—that’s just a new rendered cutscene:</p><p>Rather crucially, this is going to ship with all the expansion packs, and given we’re talking about a game from 2006, that doesn’t mean a bunch of new outfits and a bonus gun skin—<em>Mask of the Betrayer</em>, a DLC expansion released in 2007, is a whole new three-act story featuring the same characters, but with new spells and abilities, and it was wonderful. Then, 2008 saw <em>Storm of Zehir</em>, which wasn’t quite as solid, but was a great last hurrah for D&amp;D’s 3.5 ruleset. Lastly, there was 2009's <em>Mysteries of Westgate</em>, which wasn’t created by Obsidian, isn’t connected to the previous stories, and didn’t really hit at all. But for the sake of preservation, it’s great that all three expansions are receiving the same overhaul.</p><p>There’s not long to wait—the game is out July 15 across Xbox, PS5 and PC, although no signs of a mobile edition just yet. I mention that simply because the Android version of <em>KotOR</em> from Aspyr is quite so good.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
