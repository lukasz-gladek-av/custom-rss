              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-preservation-program-private-detectives-drm-2000635611">Digital video game storefront Good Old Games</a>, aka GOG, is hosting a massive sales event dedicated to open-world games. Or, well, <em>mostly</em> open-world games. It really depends on how you define what is and isn’t an open-world game.</p> <p>This week, GOG launched a big ol’ sales event featuring some remarkably steep discounts on a variety of games that it classifies as open world. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20251015_open_world_promo?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true#Catalog">The sales event runs until October 25 and features nearly 400 PC games</a>, including some big hits lik<em>e <a href="https://kotaku.com/saint-s-row-the-third-remastered-looks-nice-but-feels-1843608576">The Outer Worlds, Saints Row: The Third,</a> Shadow of Mordor, Sleeping Dogs, </em>and <em>Far Cry 2.&nbsp;</em>All of these games are only available on PC and, like all other games on GOG, don’t feature any DRM. Which is great! This is a good sale. And if all you care about is seeing a list of some of the best and biggest deals I spotted from the sale, scroll past the next paragraph and check that list out. Enjoy it! Happy shopping.</p> <p>Okay, the real sickos are still here. Good. Scrolling through GOG’s list of open-world games made me ponder what is an open-world game. How do you define it? Is <em>Slime Rancher</em> an open-world game, or just a game that features a large map you can freely explore? Do open-world games need side quests? Activities to complete? I think so, but perhaps my definition is too strict? Or maybe trying to categorize every piece of media into various genres and subgenres is silly, and I should stop thinking about this so much? Probably that one.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><strong><em>Deadly Premontion: Director’s Cut</em> </strong>– $1.25 ($25)</li> <li><strong><em>Dropsy</em> </strong>– $1 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds</em> </strong>– $8 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Greedfall</em> </strong>– $3 ($35)</li> <li><strong><em>Slime Rancher</em></strong> – $5 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Hard West</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em></strong> – $4 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of War Definitive Edition</em> </strong>– $6 ($60)</li> <li><strong><em>Rebel Galaxy</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw</em></strong> – $5 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row 2</em> </strong>– $1.5 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row: The Third Remastered</em> </strong>– $3 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em></strong> – 3 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row: Gat out of Hell</em> </strong>– $4 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>Dungeon Siege Collection </em></strong>(1,2,3) – $5 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>LEGO DC Super-Villains Deluxe Edition</em></strong> – $9 ($55)</li> <li><strong><em>Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition</em></strong> – $3 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>American Fugitive</em></strong> – $4 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Rustler (Grand Theft Horse)</em></strong> – $5 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Brutal Legend</em></strong> – $3 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>No Man’s Sky</em> </strong>– $24 ($60)</li> <li><strong><em>Far Cry</em></strong> – $3 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Far Cry 2</em> </strong>– $3 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Two Worlds Epic Edition</em></strong> – $5 ($15)</li> </ul>

              <p><span>If you missed it the first time, Netflix is bringing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, its animated musical about a group of demon-killing pop stars, back to theaters for a weekend.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The singalong showings will play in theaters from October 31 to November 2, and unlike the last run, it will be shown at AMC theaters. In a statement to </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/kpop-demon-hunters-theaters-return-amc-1236587369/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span>, an AMC representative said, “Netflix, the world’s largest streaming service, and AMC Entertainment, the world’s largest theatre chain, have jointly decided to work together.” Historically, AMC hasn’t played Netflix’s movies, though it made an exception for 2022’s </span><i><span>Glass Onion</span></i><span>. But hey, having </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>a cultural phenomenon like </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>do so well in its first run melts even the iciest of cold shoulders. I saw the movie in theaters twice during the previous theatrical run in August, and neither of my crowds </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>passed the vibe check</span></a><span>. Those were at the Alamo Drafthouse, which is notorious for its strict etiquette rules, so maybe I’ll go to an AMC showing this time around and find my people who are willing to sing along. That’s how it’s done, done, done, baby.</span></p> <p><span>Since these showings are all happening on Halloween weekend, I fully expect to see moviegoers dressed up as their favorites from Huntr/x and the Saja Boys. Maybe it’s time for me to buy Rumi’s jacket and a purple beanie to do a genderbent cosplay of my bias. It’s only two weeks away, though, so I gotta act fast.</span></p> <p><span>Since its release in June, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has gone on to become Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>most-popular film of all time</span></a><span>, so it’s not terribly surprising that everyone wants in on this theatrical run. Enjoy it while it lasts, folks. It’s probably gonna be a long time before we see a sequel, but it sounds like a short film might be just around the corner.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ballxpit-devolver-kenny-sun-brickbreaker-indie-2000635720</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ballxpit-is-so-much-fun-it%E2%80%99s-eating-up-all-my-free-time-send-help.1325938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Time travel is real, ya’ll. I’ve experienced it in a few different ways, but the most recent of my trips forward through time, where magically a few hours have just vanished before my eyes, were experienced with a healthy dose of brickbreaker roguelike <i>BallxPit</i> from Kenny Sun &amp; Friends. Its smart reliance on clever angles, interesting build options, and great art design all coalesces to generate the kind of singular, focused attention you feel when staring into a campfire for a long period of time–just imagine you’re in control of that fire, letting it grow in ferocity by chucking balls into it.</p> <p><i>BallxPit</i>’s premise is rather simple: In the fantasy realm of Ballbylon, a massive meteor has dug a hole, or pit, if you will, in the ground where a once-great civilization stood. Now it’s up to you and your cast of funny little heroes to venture into the depths to beat back the encroaching monsters by spitting balls at them.</p>

 <p>That is what it seems is happening. It’s a little gross if you really think about it…so try not to.</p> <p><i>BallxPit</i> fuses together elements of a number of genres, but at its core it’s a brickbreaker (think classics like <i>Breakout </i>and <i>Arkanoid</i>) in which you march toward advancing enemies, firing a variety of projectiles to wipe them out. Each map I’ve played thus far also includes two mini-bosses and one main boss, who introduce some bullet hell scenarios for you to survive.</p>

 <p>As I mentioned earlier, you fight back by spitting balls at the enemy hordes. For the most part these balls come in two basic types: baby balls and more powerful balls on which different status effects can be stacked, combined for greater effect, and evolved into more powerful versions of themselves. Once a ball is in play, it will bounce around the level, hitting walls or monsters. Once it comes back to your character, you can spit it back out to start the process all over again.</p>

 <p>You can use up to four different main balls at any given time. You’ll have the chance to earn one each time you level up by collecting enough gems from fallen enemies, and you can level up these balls up to three times. Fusion pickups, meanwhile, let you sometimes combine balls to merge their effects, thereby opening up a new slot so you can acquire a new ball. I’m still unlocking new balls, but one of my favorites so far is Laser, which comes in a horizontal or vertical variety and nails multiple enemies with a satisfying beam of death. It’s perfect for crowd control. Freeze is another handy ball which, as you might expect, will freeze enemies for a specific amount of time relative to its level. As you play, you can snag a “Fusion” pickup to combine these into a “Freeze Ray” which includes both freezing and the lane- or column-spanning laser. Another great combo is one that fuses the earthquake ball and poison ball, allowing you to poison multiple enemies in an AOE attack. There are a ton of different combinations like these and given the randomness of the roguelike genre elements, if you’re not building your way to a setup you already know and rely on, then you’re instead likely to hit upon some new and surprising ways to combine powers. It’s a satisfying buildcrafting experience.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635731"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635731">© Screenshot: Kenny Sun &amp; Friends / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Accompanying these balls are up to four passive abilities which can do everything from increasing your damage from specific angles to speeding up your movement or upping your defenses.</p> <p>It all combines for a very satisfying, though challenging, game loop that only becomes more irresistible as your destructive capacity grows. And though it may look wildly chaotic at times, blasting through the game’s hordes of satisfyingly animated enemies isn’t just a mindless march forward through pixely carnage; while my first few hours were spent just jumping into the fray to see what happened, the ways you can combine different powers and use angles to bounce balls deep into the enemies’ ranks encourage you to play smart to be sure you melt them before they reach you. But if you’re often overwhelmed when games hoist multiple coexisting systems upon you at once, relax; <i>BallxPit</i> lets you jump in without much homework, and you can pick up the basics of what each ball does in real time.</p>

 <p>Making things all the more engaging, you’re regularly increasing in power as you play. Defeated enemies will drop anything from resources for your base to fusion powerups that let you level up or combine more powerful balls, as well as healing potions (they’re very rare, though) and gems, which will steadily increase your level meter. And you’ll level up fast. If you enjoy a rapid progression in power, well, <i>BallxPit</i> is quick to give it to you. Enemies drop so many gems that you’ll quickly ascend in levels. Hit a new level and you’ll get a choice of three possible powerups, either a new ball or a passive (once you’ve leveled up all your balls and passives, you’ll just choose one of three resources for your home base). Just blindly grabbing a new ball or passive ability won’t always work if you don’t take a beat to figure out what kind of build you’re going for. Are you combining balls to up your AOE attacks? Are you investing in upping your speed output? The random, roguelike features of the game ensure that you probably won’t fall into too many predictable builds, but over time you’ll start finding patterns you prefer.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635733" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635733"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635733">© Screenshot: Kenny Sun &amp; Friends / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There’s also a whole farming management sim built into the game as well. I haven’t spent as much time building my base as it seems the game wants me to (the brick-breaking portion is very hard to put down). But every time you complete a run, you can choose to back to your base which, at first, looks similar to your home in other farming sims: You’ll put down plots of land with farmable resources, build housing units for your characters, and send your characters out to gather wood, rocks, and wheat.</p> <p>But it’s the way you lay out and farm for resources that makes all the difference. True to its form as a brickbreaker that has you firing balls of destructive energy at your enemies, <i>BallxPit </i>turns farming into a situation where angles really matter. Your characters will sprint around your base for a certain period of time, colliding with various plots of land to mine the resources in each tile. So as you determine your base’s layout, you want to create one that maximizes your harvest based on the angles at which your characters bounce.</p> <p>Your resources grow back pretty fast, too. So every time you finish a run in the pit, you can usually come back to your base to start farming with the potential for a decent harvest. Though I’ve yet to enjoy the untapped potential of setting up an efficient, well-designed base for my characters to bounce off of and farm, this complementary game mechanic helps <i>BallxPit </i>avoid a sense of redundancy that might otherwise have set in if there was nothing breaking up the ball-spitting, brickbreaking action. I always feel like there’s something new to do, whether that’s sending a new character down to polish off a previously finished map, returning to base to farm resources, unlocking a new character by building a new housing unit, or continuing to expand and grow my base.</p> <p><i>BallxPit</i> has been a wonderful time in my half-a-dozen or so hours with it, and has become an easy go-to option when picking up my Steam Deck without a clear game in mind to play. The diversity of build options helps keep runs feeling very fresh, and I’m still discovering new ways to plow through hordes of enemies, whether that be cool new builds or a fun way to exploit various angles that I hadn’t considered before. I don’t think watching balls rapidly bounce all over the place while enemies perish in various ways and damage numbers satisfyingly pop up over their heads will&nbsp; get old anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ROG Xbox Ally X: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-kotaku-review.1325923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is an Xbox? It’s a question that’s only been asked twice in human history. The first time was in 2001 when engineers at Microsoft turned PC components into a home console. The second time is now, as Microsoft moves beyond that hardware to new frontiers to fuel its now-gargantuan game publishing apparatus. One of those frontiers is PC gaming handhelds, and the ROG Xbox Ally X is the first flag planted clumsily in that soil. It’s a step in the right direction but not a convincing one. It’s a half-measure at best, and one that will give you sticker shock.</p> <p>Lets get this out of the way: The ROG Xbox Ally X costs $1,000. That gets you an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, 8GB of extra memory, and an 80wh battery compared to the $600 Xbox Ally model’s Z2 A processor, smaller memory, smaller battery, and smaller storage (512GB of SSD instead of 1TB). Microsoft only sent me the Ally X for review, so I can’t tell you how the two match up or if the upgrade is worth it. What I can tell you is that $1,000 is a lot to spend on any handheld, especially a PC gaming one that still feels this compromised.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635719" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635719"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635719">Asus / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s more than double the price of a Switch 2, and $450 more than the base Steam Deck OLED. At just 7 inches, the 1080p, 120Hz screen is still smaller than both of those cheaper alternatives. The new Asus-manufactured handheld, like the original models, still comes with an enormous bezel that makes it look like a cheap tablet. Nothing about the Ally X shell, the flexing of the screen when you press down on it, or the density of the components inside gives the feeling of a luxury gaming device.</p>

 <p>It does feel surprisingly light and comfortable in my hands, though. It’s one of the heaviest handhelds around at 1.57 pounds but the distribution of the weight makes it hardly feel noticeable. The new Xbox controller-like paddles on the ends are far and away the biggest improvement the Ally X makes. They look silly. They&nbsp;<em>are</em> silly. They are also the most comfortable built-in grips of any handheld I’ve played. The biggest letdown, on the other hand, might be the new modified Windows OS.</p>

 <h2>A pricey Xbox skin over a familiar Windows experience</h2> <p>The Xbox Ally X has a unique job and it doesn’t do it particularly well. Its central task is to organize all of your PC games from all of your different launchers in one easy-to-navigate menu that lets you swap between them like your tabbing across the Xbox console dashboard. Bonus points for the Xbox Ally X being a portable device that lets you play the biggest blockbuster releases on decent-to-good settings from the comfort of your couch, bed, or anywhere else that isn’t the desktop PC you already spend too much time ruining your posture in front of. The Ally X gets a decent grade on the latter. Unfortunately, it mostly bungles the former.</p>

 <p>Out of the box, the handheld is still very much a Windows device. Only after a couple hours of me fiddling around with downloads and updates did the Ally X have everything it needed to launch the full-screen Xbox experience. That’s the device’s main selling point, at least until the modified OS ships to other PC gaming handhelds in early 2026, and it’s not a great sign that it doesn’t turn on the first time with it ready to go for October 16 launch.</p>   <p>Once installed, you never have to think about Windows again, except for every time there’s an error screen, or you switch to one of the non-Xbox launchers like Steam or the Epic Games Store. Games that require you to log into a separate company’s portal to access them also interrupt the experience. Playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Steam required opening the Valve-owned storefront followed by the proprietary CD Projekt Red launcher followed by the actual game’s main menu. Not all of it is Microsoft’s fault, but it’s just one example of the limits of the more gamer-friendly version of Windows the company is touting.</p>

 <p>Credit where it’s due: there are some really cool features here. The Ally X comes with a dedicated Xbox home button. Pressing it pulls up a cross-bar where you can quickly access shortcuts for recently played games, the main storefronts and launchers, and a bunch of settings menus and gameplay capture tools to tinker around with. Hold the Xbox button down and you’ll pull up each window that’s currently active on the device. You can toggle between these with the touchscreen or the bumpers and then quickly close any of them out by holding down the “X” face button. The sleep mode also works nicely. Press the power button and the screen goes off. Press it again 12 hours later, enter your pass code, and your game will be right where you left it.</p>

 <h2>Near console-like game performance</h2> <p>These are the parts of the Ally X that remind me of the best parts of the Xbox Series X/S. Quick Resume was a small addition this console generation with a big impact. Microsoft’s consoles store suspended states for multiple games so that you can quickly swap between them without having to do all the laborious work of saving, shutting them down, and starting them back up again. You can see hints of that innovative thinking in the Ally X’s retrofitted gaming layer for Windows, but it feels incomplete right now. It’s less a deep tissue renovation than a fresh coat of paint that missed some spots and is already peeling in others.</p> <p>Let’s talk about games for a second. I’m not here to do benchmark analysis. I played everything from <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> to recent smaller hits like <em>Consume Me</em> and <em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>and they all ran somewhere between good enough and great. On big-budget AAA releases I could get around 40fps on medium graphics settings or higher with frame-generation. Performance and visual detail was consistent and nothing ever crashed on me. At the same time, there was never a moment of “Wow, I can’t believe [insert game here] looks this good in my hands!” Anything from <em>Hades</em> <em>2</em> or<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> on down runs perfectly, and truth be told I spent most of my time playing indie games from Game Pass and Steam.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000635737" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635737"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635737">Forgive me for all the smudges. I have three kids.</figcaption></figure> <p>That’s part of the conundrum of considering a $1,000 PC gaming handheld. Sure, you can run through bombed out buildings, land some kill shots, and take objectives in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. Despite the great ergonomics and dutiful performance, however, this isn’t where I want to spend most of my time playing that type of game. The same goes for cinematic blockbusters like <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. These Sony exclusives are technically available for the first time ever on an Xbox-branded device. Still, I’d prefer to bask in those worlds on console or desktop (also there was some weird visual hitching in<em> Spider-Man 2</em> that I couldn’t quite figure out how to fix). The Ally X might be the closest to replicating a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming experience in a handheld thus far, but it doesn’t quiet feel revelatory enough to justify the jump yet.</p>

 <p>That leaves two alternatives. The Ally X is either a $1,000 box to play $20 indie games you can run on the 8-year-old Switch, or it’s a pricey accessory that extends the traditional PC and console gaming experience beyond a single room and screen. The Ally X is surprisingly good in that role. Cloud data syncs seamlessly back and forth between it and other devices you can play your library on, and cloud gaming runs smoothly enough to be a meaningful option for accessing a vast library of Xbox console games that aren’t natively available on PC, even if it’s still far from being a satisfying solution.</p> <h2>The Steam-sized elephant in the room</h2> <p>Microsoft has updated some PC games in its store to have little badges that let you know how well they’ll work on the Xbox Ally handhelds. For whatever reason, though, there are plenty of listings, including <em>Minecraft</em>, that still don’t mention it at all.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is “handheld optimized.” <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is “mostly compatible.”<em> Silent Hill F</em> warns to “check minimum requirements.”<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, meanwhile, will “perform great on your device.”</p>

 <p>What checking for these little badges really drove home for me, however, is just how many games aren’t available in Microsoft’s PC gaming store at all. Even if you want to stay in its ecosystem as much as possible, you’ll still have to venture to other storefronts for big games like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. And these store pages offer no help or promises for how the games will run on Ally X, in addition to making you deal with the still-cumbersome process of swapping between the Xbox hub and places like Steam.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000635724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635724"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635724">Asus / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For all its neat ideas, perhaps the most damning thing about the experience of actually navigating the Ally X is how none of the new, Xbox-centric modifications make it feel nearly as good as Steam Big Picture mode, which would occasionally accidentally take over my screen when I pressed the wrong combination of buttons. When that happened, my eyes would immediately relax. The controls immediately felt snappier. Even on the Ally X, Steam still feels like it’s winning the PC gaming handheld race. It left me pining more for what the $1,000 version of a Steam Deck might look like than what a more seamless, feature-complete Windows gaming experience could be.</p> <p>I went into my time reviewing the Ally X hoping it would check all of the boxes and become the unquestionable standard bearer for gaming in this form factor. Instead, it’s hard to recommend to anyone who doesn’t already have a massive Microsoft PC gaming library, or have their heart set on being a guinea pig for a Windows gaming experiment that’s still very much a work-in-progress. What is an Xbox? I’m not sure anymore. But it’s definitely not the Ally X. At least not yet.</p>

              <p><span>Now and then, a patch adds something that makes you wonder how it got through testing. Most competitive game fans pore over patch notes, combing through every change to make sure their favorite fighting game or hero shooter is “fair” and skill-based. Well, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-fgc-fighting-game-tournament-wawa-child-1849165232"><i><span>Dragon Ball FighterZ</span></i></a> <span>got a </span><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-patch-notes-140"><span>new patch</span></a><span> last week, and even if you don’t play Arc System Works’ anime fighter, you should see this absolutely dirty new tech for one of its many Goku variants.</span></p> <p><span>Goku Ultra Instinct is one of the five playable versions of the </span><i><span>Dragon Ball </span></i><span>protagonist in </span><i><span>FighterZ</span></i><span>, and it’s the Saiyan at his most powerful. This blue-haired Goku has an ability that lets him sidestep to the other side of an opponent whenever they’re hitstunned, which allows you to extend combos by moving to where your opponent is not guarding. However, if you pair it with assist moves from your teammates, you can essentially string together an unblockable, never-ending combo.</span></p>   <p><span>On one hand, it is lore accurate. Folks on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonballfighterz/comments/1o4crsq/what_the_actual_fuck_ultra_instinct_goku_patch_140/"><i><span>FighterZ</span></i><span> subreddit</span></a><span> are calling the maneuver “aura farming,” even though it seems like an absolute balance nightmare. It’s funny to watch, but I can’t imagine trying to play against it without losing my cool.</span></p>   <p><span>The block mechanics of most fighting games require you to push your stick or d-pad in the opposite direction of an incoming attack, which means players must often rely on mixups to get past an enemy’s stonewalled defense. Moves like this one allow you to quickly get behind an enemy, bypassing their current guard input and punching through their defenses. Normally, there’s some kind of drawback to these moves so an opponent has counterplay against them, but if that exists here, it doesn’t look like </span><i><span>FighterZ</span></i><span> players have found it yet.</span></p>
