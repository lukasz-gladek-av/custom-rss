            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>Xbox Developer Direct</span></a><span>, we got the most expansive look at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>reboot</span></a><span> we’ve seen yet. Playground Games is picking up the series after original developer Lionhead Studios shut down in 2016, and it definitely feels like the studio is modernizing the action RPG series with an open world and a new morality system. With that new morality system, </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is changing what was one of the core pillars of the series: your appearance will no longer be determined by whether or not you’re making good or evil decisions. In fact, it’s abandoning the idea that any of your actions are objectively good or evil altogether.</span></p> <p><span>For those that didn’t play any of Lionhead’s </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>games, like many games of the early 2000s they have a binary “hero or villain” morality system where doing things like helping people in need would move you toward the “good” side of the spectrum while doing things like skinning people alive in front of their weeping mother would move you toward the “evil” side. </span></p>

 <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>games, the decisions you made would gradually alter your character’s look, with good characters appearing pristine and almost angelic, and evil players growing horns and turning into a monster. I tended to play evil characters in these games and wasn’t thrilled that my characters were turning into uggos, but that’s the contract you sign when you play these games. Playground Games’ </span><i><span>Fable</span></i><span>, however, is approaching morality differently, and so this mechanic is going out the window.</span></p> <p><span>As illustrated in the showcase, </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is trying to handle morality in a more “subjective” way, which essentially means the game won’t treat your actions as simply “good” or “evil,” but rather that NPCs will react to the things you do based on their own proclivities. So you can kick people out of their homes as their landlord, and some rich idiot who lives for that shit might still think you’re a standup guy. Since things aren’t so black and white this time around, Playground’s Ralph Fulton tells </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> it’s abandoning the morality-based appearance-changing system of previous games because there is no “objective” morality system to attach them to.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>That sort of character morphing feature, obviously a really central part of the original games. It’s not in ours. And I’ll tell you why. There’s probably a couple of reasons. One, I guess it’s about that high level principle I was talking about, that there is no objective good and evil. And the original games were predicated on there being an objective good and an objective evil, and you were somewhere along that scale, and that’s what determined how your appearance changed.</span></p> <p><span>But for us, that doesn’t really work. The way I’ve described our morality system working, you’re never that thing, absolutely. You’re different things to different people based on what they like or what they choose to value. So, that’s one reason that it didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span>There’s another reason, which is in our game, you build reputation based on the settlement, the town, the city that you’re in, the part of the world that you’re in. But when you go to a new place, a place you’ve never been to before, you walk in without any reputation and thus nobody knows what to think about you. And you can almost, through your behavior, through your choices, form completely different reputations, a completely different identity, if you like, in that place from the place that you were last time. And you can do that across all the locations in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Now, you couldn’t do that if you walked in with horns and a trident. Your reputation would precede you in that instance. And honestly, that ability to be completely in control of your identity and thus what people think of you felt more important to us than that legacy feature. So, it worked great in those games. It didn’t seem to fit in ours, so we don’t have it.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>From a roleplaying perspective, I get why this decision was made, and I’ll be glad that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575"><span>my future bald, bearded gay</span></a><span> won’t have to look like a demon while I’m trying to woo the men of Albion. But it is leaving behind what was a core pillar of the </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>series back in the day, and long-time fans who have been waiting over a decade for a new </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>are reacting accordingly.</span></p>

   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">they've confirmed in an IGN interview that your actions will not transform your appearance. 😠 That's a core part of why I love Fable and I'll miss that.</p> <p>Everything else looks fantastic, though.

I'm happy to be excited. <a href="https://t.co/aqiDTHLR2o">https://t.co/aqiDTHLR2o</a></p> <p>— Jake Baldino (@JakeBaldino) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeBaldino/status/2014445728001630593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait what?? that's like Fable's whole deal! <a href="https://t.co/E9mzl8OvZO">https://t.co/E9mzl8OvZO</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/2014470703605584029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“NPC’s and how your character looked reflecting your actions was pretty important for me,” Disastrous_Fig5609 wrote on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fable/comments/1qk9zj3/rip_to_the_main_feature_that_set_fable_games_apart/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>. “You watch the character grow up from childhood, then you watch them grow into a hero or a villain. You might not be able to plant an acorn and watch it grow into a tree as you play the game, but that element of shaping the world around you with your actions still somewhat persisted with shaping your character with your actions.”</span></p> <p><span>“The location based reputation is cool, but it absolutely could have just been a dual system,”&nbsp; ForestBrah01209 wrote in the same thread. “One town will see you one way, another town will see you a different way. However, if I’m absolutely evil and move to another town, I’m still absolutely evil, even if my new neighbors think I’m just another stranger or even a nice guy. Shame that I won’t be able to rock the devil horns anymore.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is the first game in the series to have a character creator, so at least it’s not like everyone’s characters are going to look the same. We’ll see if there are enough character customization options to let players at least manually emulate some of those old </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>transformations when the game launches in the fall. </span></p>

              <p>The Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime features an ultrawide-angle lens with a 180° horizontal field of view, letting you capture what’s happening at your front door. Night vision keeps you seeing a high-quality image regardless of the time of day. Motion and sound detection automatically send notifications to your mobile device, tablet, and compatible Roku devices when someone approaches your door. In addition to receiving notifications, you can communicate with visitors using two-way audio from your mobile device or tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6850/">You can now purchase the Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime for $50, down from its regular price of $70, saving you $20 or 28% off.</a></p>

<h2>A reliable security method to see everyone who darkens your doorstep</h2>
<p>This hardwired Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime uses your existing wiring for continuous power, eliminating the need to replace batteries. After installation, you can check the live feed of your front door and review past events on your mobile device or tablet using the Roku Smart Home app. You can also receive notifications on your compatible Roku TV or streaming player, so you know who is approaching your front door, whether your phone is nearby or across the house.</p>
<p>Videos captured by the camera are recorded in 1080p HD. The lens covers a wide area of your front porch with an ultrawide-angle 180° horizontal view, so you don’t need to adjust the camera angle to see both items on the mat and a visitor’s face when they are standing near the door. Night vision lets you capture clear images at night, showing details such as clothing and purses rather than obscuring them in shadows.</p>



<p>Beyond basic motion and sound detection, the built-in smart features notify you as soon as motion or sound is detected at your door. This means you’ll know right away when someone approaches, and if they press the doorbell, you’ll be notified immediately of who pressed it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-on-anc-headphone-clearance-new-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-crash-to-an-all-time-low-2000662534</link>
            <guid>1414327</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feature an Active Noise Control system and an immersive audio system, and they fit well for extended periods. They also include soft ear tips that seal against the ear to eliminate ambient noise, but do not feel too tight. These earbuds feature Bluetooth compatibility for phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices. Additionally, the earbuds have a white smoke finish, have touch controls, and a compact charging case that is small enough to carry in a pocket. They were made to be portable while keeping the audio front and center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">You can find the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for $249 at Amazon.</a> This is a $50 discount from their normal price of $299. So this represents a 17% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds with the style, comfort, and quality of Bose headphones</h2>
<p>The noise-cancellation on the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds works to cancel out engine noise, conversations, and other background noise. If you would rather hear some outside noise, then the Aware Mode provides an alternative. It allows you to hear what is happening outside and smooths out sudden spikes in decibel levels caused by loud noises, such as clanging dishes and slamming doors. In addition to providing awareness of your surroundings, if you prefer more isolation, Quiet Mode reduces ambient noise so you can enjoy your playlists, calls, podcasts, etc., at a lower volume.</p>
<p>CustomTune technology in the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds determines how sound behaves in your ears and adjusts noise cancellation and equalization accordingly. The earbuds produce a test tone when you insert them and measure the response. Then it sets the bass, midrange, and treble to match your ear shape. Bose Immersive Audio provides a spatial effect that creates the illusion that music and video are coming from in front of you rather than inside your head.</p>



<p>The fit and comfort of the earbuds are due to the combination of the soft silicone eartips and the flexible stability bands. There are multiple sizes of each component, and they can be combined in 9 ways. The umbrella-shaped tips provide additional blockage of ambient noise. Plus, they are rated IPX4, so they are suitable for use during sweating or light rain.</p>
<p>The call quality of the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds depends on the noise-rejecting microphones and processing specifically tailored to ensure your voice is heard clearly. The microphones are focused on capturing your voice while rejecting wind and background noise; therefore, the caller hears you, not the surrounding noise.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, battery life and charging capabilities are configured to provide you with enough time to listen to whatever content you desire. Battery life is approximately 6 hours in Quiet, Aware, or Immersive Modes, and about 4 hours in Immersive Mode. The case supports 3 charging cycles and can be charged via a USB-C port or a wireless charging pad. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">These are great headphones, and you’ll want to take advantage of the $249 sale price instead of the regular list price of $299 now.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-led-floor-lamp-drops-again-to-a-new-record-low-after-another-surprise-price-cut-on-amazon-2000662374</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="546">A new year often brings the urge to refresh your surroundings, and home upgrades don’t have to involve expensive furniture or major renovations. Small changes can dramatically shift how a space feels, and lighting sits at the top of that list. The right light can make a room feel warmer, calmer, and far more inviting. That’s exactly where the Govee LED floor lamp comes in, especially now that it’s available at a steep discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/">Normally priced at $100, this modern lamp is currently 35% off, dropping the price to just $65 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p data-start="548" data-end="968">The Govee floor lamp takes a sleek, minimalist approach. Its design features a single vertical light bar that tucks neatly into the corner of a room, projecting light outward across the walls. This indirect lighting instantly softens the space and eliminates harsh glare. Thanks to its RGB LED technology, the lamp can glow in virtually any color you can imagine, allowing you to adjust the mood of your room in seconds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="970" data-end="1368">Many people have grown tired of harsh overhead lighting—myself included. We have a strict, “No Big Light,” policy in my home. Ceiling fixtures and rows of recessed lights can make living spaces feel sterile and overly bright. Lighting placed closer to eye level or below creates a more relaxed environment, perfect for unwinding at the end of the day. The Govee floor lamp excels at this, delivering ambient light that feels intentional and cozy rather than clinical.</p>
<h2>Set the Mood, Any Mood</h2>
<p data-start="1370" data-end="1857">Customization with this lamp is near limitless. It supports multi-color displays and offers 85 built-in scene modes to match different moods and occasions. Warm oranges and yellows work well for quiet evenings with a book or movie, while vibrant color combinations can energize a room for social gatherings. Holiday decorating becomes effortless with themed color options, and music sync mode adds another layer of fun by matching light patterns to the beat of your favorite songs.</p>


<p data-start="1859" data-end="2260">The Govee floor lamp works with Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to control brightness, colors, and power with simple voice commands. Scheduling and automation options let you create routines that fit your lifestyle. Lights can turn on as the sun sets, dim automatically late at night, or shift scenes for special events without manual input.</p>
<p data-start="2262" data-end="2462">Setup is refreshingly easy. After assembling the vertical bar, you simply run the light strip through it, plug it in, and you’re ready to go. No complicated tools or technical experience are required.</p>
<p data-start="2464" data-end="2753" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/">This one lamp can completely change how a room feels, and at just $65, it’s a no brainer. Give your home the cozy refresh that it needs for 2026.</a></p>

            <guid>1414261</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></i><span> is known for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-minigames-remake-trilogy-3-game-2000658234"><span>minigame glut</span></a><span>, but it did have at least </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-mini-games-best-worst-ranked-1851340606"><span>a few bangers</span></a><span> in the mix. One of those was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-queens-blood-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-1851312733"><span>Queen’s Blood</span></a><span>, a card game that you could play with various citizens throughout the world, and it even had its own extensive side story to follow. This was new for </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>–apparently Queen’s Blood hadn’t yet caught on in Midgar, where </span><i><span>Remake </span></i><span>takes place–and it sounds like Square Enix wants to expand upon it in the upcoming third game.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/"><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed Queen’s Blood will make a return in the as-of-yet-untitled third game, but it will be a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span>“Queen’s Blood is a very popular and beloved minigame, and I believe a lot of people are still wanting something like that,” Hamaguchi told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. “I want to expand on Queen’s Blood so we are enhancing it, and giving you a more powered-up version of it when you see that third installment… Queen’s Blood is still going to be available in the third installment. We just want to expand on it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>What could those enhancements entail? New cards, mechanics, or maybe the board will just be twice as big, allowing for more territory-claiming plays? We probably won’t find out for a while, but Queen’s Blood isn’t the only minigame in the third entry, as it will also signal the return of the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>’s snowboarding segment, which Hamaguchi says will be more than “just a simple snowboarding minigame.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000021618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000021618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000021618">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I’m afraid I can’t delve too much into the details, but we understand that it’s not going to be just a simple snowboarding minigame. We want to make sure that it’s incorporated into the story to have that sort of connection with the theming of it,” he said.</span></p>

 <p><span>The third </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>remake is probably still a ways away, but it does seem like the game is coming along and is in a playable state.</span></p> <p><span>“In terms of the third installment, I believe we are coming along very smoothly,” he said. “We have set a schedule for ourselves, and I believe we are tracking on time for the milestones we have set. So I’m really thankful for the development team and I have so much respect for them working on this project. I believe that at this point the game is playable, technically, but we are still trying to polish it so it is at a quality where we can deliver it to our players.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851"><span>on the Switch 2</span></a><span> and Xbox Series X/S, with </span><i><span>Rebirth </span></i><span>expected to launch on both systems later this year.</span></p>

              <p>No smart TV? No problem. If your screen is working fine otherwise, you don’t have to replace it to enjoy smart features. A Fire TV stick can do the job for considerably less, and you can now pick its latest model for under than $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/">Amazon is currently offering the newest Fire TV Stick 4K Plus at a 30% discount, bringing the price down to $35</a>. Use the code FTV4K25 at checkout, and you’ll save another $10, which drops the total to just $25. You’ll also get a one-month free trial to Xbox GamePass with your purchase, which sweetens the offer even more.</p>
<p>Those with an older Fire TV stick lying around can trade it in for 20% off this model, but you might not be able to combine the current discount with that.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy Setup</h2>
<p>This small, but mighty stick plugs directly into the HDMI input of your TV. Then, connect the USB cable to the Fire TV Stick and the power adapter. Plug the adapter into a wall outlet, and turn your TV on. You can now follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, even if it’s your first time using one.</p>
<p>Once it’s all set and running, you’ll be able to stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes from popular platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Max, and more. Most of these require a monthly fee, but if you’re looking to cut back on those, no sweat. It also gets you instant access to over 400,000 free movies and TV episodes from popular ad-supported streaming apps like Fire TV Channels, Prime Video, Tubi, and Pluto TV. Basically, you’ll never be out of stuff to watch. Maybe start the night with a good horror movie, and then switch to a lighthearted comedy show to wrap things up (and keep nightmares at bay)!</p>
<p>Smart search is made possible with Alexa, which lets you simply use your voice to find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. For instance, you can say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Jake Gyllenhaal movies”, or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and your command will be answered in seconds.</p>



<p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is made to help you maximize your TV’s potential. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support means you can stream content in vibrant 4K Ultra HD, plus enjoy immersive sound with Dolby Atmos audio. There’s WiFi 6 for smoother streaming, which also ensures less interference from other connected devices.</p>
<p>Gamers will appreciate that you can also game with Xbox Game Pass via cloud gaming through the stick. We’re talking playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Outer Worlds 2, Ninja Gaiden 4, and hundreds of other titles without a console. And since you also get a month of Xbox GamePass with your purchase, you can jump in at no extra cost.</p>
<p>This version of the stick comes with early access to Alexa+ as well, which is Amazon’s smartest AI assistant yet. The access is available through the end of 2026, and after that, it will be included with Prime. Again, it’s a nice way to try the new features without committing.</p>
<p>We’re not expecting this 50% discount to last long, so it’s best to grab it without wasting time. Just make sure you use the code FTV4K25 at checkout to maximize savings.</p>

              <p>It feels like a rare treat for a Nintendo Direct to take us by surprise, now that the events are routinely being pre-empted by leakers. This latest, just revealed by Nintendo to take place on January 25 at 9 a.m. ET (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-set-for-january-25"><em>Gematsu</em></a>), snuck up on me. It’s a shame it’s just for the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, rather than meeting our desperate need for Switch 2 game news, but at least it means we’ll get to see Shigeru Miyamoto being all delightfully excited.</p> <p>Yes, January 25&nbsp;<em>is</em> a Sunday, which is a weird choice for a Direct. All right-minded games and film journalists are in bed at 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, so expect some bleary-eyed coverage of the new footage and details being revealed ahead of the movie’s April 3 release.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us on Sunday, Jan 25, at 6am PT for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> featuring an exclusive look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p> <p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/gTC114mMLz">https://t.co/gTC114mMLz</a> <a href="https://t.co/4DOoFU1fFJ">pic.twitter.com/4DOoFU1fFJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2014700056855687256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nintendo says this will feature “an exclusive look at&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>,” but gives no more information than that. So far we’ve seen a&nbsp;<em>very</em> limited amount of the movie, mostly sticking to a single scene of Mario and Luigi’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-trailer-bowser-smug-jerk-2000643462">frustrating conversation</a> with a miniature Bowser in his teeny castle. Aside from the reveal of Rosalina, weirdly little has been shown of a movie that’s due out in just over two months.</p>  <p>The original 2023&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488">may not have been particularly good</a>, but it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-bros-movie-box-office-records-sonic-reviews-1850318954">wildly successful</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-miyamoto-negative-bad-reviews-1850380112">Miyamoto even claimed</a> the negative reviews helped the movie succeed. Nintendo and Illumination are presumably feeling very confident of a similar success for the sequel, which will hopefully make better use of the splendid&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> setting than first movie did of its Mushroom Kingdom hodgepodge.</p>

 <p>Following Sunday’s Direct, we can expect promotion for the animated movie to really ramp up, although presumably continuing to try to feature Chris Pratt’s dull-ass voice as little as possible.</p>
