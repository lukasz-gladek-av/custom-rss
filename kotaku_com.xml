              <p>During today’s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book.&nbsp;</em>The cute-looking adventure is set to arrive on Switch exclusively next year.</p> <p>On September 12, during an extra-long Nintendo Direct, there was a whole section dedicated to the 40th anniversary of Mario. (Well, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, at least.) And for some reason, the big new game announced during this part of the show was a new Yoshi game. Seems rude.</p> <p><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>is set to hop over to Switch 2 in Spring 2026. Here’s the trailer.</p>  <p><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>is an adorable-looking 2D platformer that features Yoshi trying to help a magical book. That book, named Mr. E, is filled with all sorts of secrets and knowledge, but he can’t see it himself, as his eyes are on his cover. Sounds like a nightmare existence to me.</p> <p>Anyway, Yoshi has to hop into the different stories and pages to help. This apparently involves fishing and looking super duper cute in stop-motion-like gameplay. Yoshi also has to help a flower-like creature that rides on the green hero’s back and helps him solve puzzles and interact with the worlds he hops into. For example, Yoshi can touch flowers and make them bloom while the odd creature is on his back. Not quite as cool as “<em>touch fuzzy get dizzy</em>,” but I’ll take it, I guess.</p>
