              <p>Developers at two of Meta’s virtual reality game development studios are posting online that massive layoffs have happened and that the studios might be shutting down completely.</p> <p>On January 13, multiple developers from Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru Games posted online that they had been laid off from the studios. Many of the affected staff have suggested that both studios, and others owned by the company formerly known as Facebook, might be completely shutting down. Meta has not confirmed this. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to the company for more information about the future of the VR studios and the publicly confirmed layoffs.</p> <p>“Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru. It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs/">posted senior-level designer Ray West on LinkedIn on Tuesday.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p><span>“I’ve just been laid off. It appears the entire Twisted Pixel </span>games studio has been shut down.<span> Sanzaru Games, </span>too,” <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">posted another developer on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, I was part of the layoffs today at Meta, and will be seeking a new role,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kathrynyu.com">said Twisted Pixel VR gameplay designer Kathryn Yu on Bluesky</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-horizon-worlds-teams-2026-1">This follows reporting on Monday</a> that Meta was looking to pivot away from VR and the metaverse to AI and augmented reality tech after that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/29/meta-earnings-report">part of the company lost $4 billion.</a> Meta is reportedly looking to cut 10 to 15 percent of Reality Labs, its VR sector, which includes 15,000 employees as well as numerous game studios like Sanzaru. These teams were developing exclusive Meta Quest games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514">like last year’s <em>Deadpool VR</em></a>, which was developed by Twisted Pixel.</p>

 <p>Sanzaru was acquired by Meta in 2020 following the release of<em> Asgard’s Wrath</em>, a popular and critically acclaimed RPG, in 2019. It developed a sequel that launched as a free pack-in game with the launch of the Quest 3 in December 2023. Twisted Pixel previously worked on games like <em>Splosion Man</em> and <em>Lococycle</em> before being bought by Meta in 2021 to work on VR titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Staff redundancies are anticipated at Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment, Ubisoft has announced. 55 employees are expected to lose their jobs, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted"><span>according to a statement sent to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Massive, acquired back in 2008, is the studio behind </span><i><span>The Division 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement, Ubisoft explained, “This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements, and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect in line with local regulations,” Ubisoft said.</span></p> <h2>Ubisoft’s slow, painful transformation</h2> <p><span>The news comes months after the French publisher began a new cost-cutting restructuring plan. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>Back in October 2025</span></a><span>, it asked developers at Massive to lay themselves off voluntarily.</span></p>

 <p><span>The publisher’s redundancy scheme came after a new deal with Tencent, in which the conglomerate invested over $1 billion in a smaller subsidiary, Vantage Studios. The new studio will focus on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Siege</span></i><span> franchises.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> notes that despite the new layoffs, updates for </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division 2</span></i><span> will continue, as will development for </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> and the survival extraction mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>News of job cuts at Ubisoft is not new. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752"><span>Last week, Ubisoft closed its Halifax office after it unionized.</span></a><span> The shuttering of the mobile game developer resulted in the loss of 71 jobs. The publisher claimed that the closure was not due to unionization.</span></p>

              <p><span>Game Freak’s established promotional pipeline for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games has the company using 3D renders, rather than hand-drawn art, to reveal new monsters ahead of each game’s launch. Anyone who cares about getting good assets of these new critters knows that this is the purgatory The Pokémon Company puts us through as we wait for the gorgeous illustrations we’ll get post-release, which resemble the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>old Ken Sugimori art</span></a><span> that you see featured on database sites like </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Raichu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"><span>Bulbapedia</span></a><span>. Today, January 13, we finally got the art drop for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a> <span>DLC. And oh boy, there’s some beauts here.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the art is of the several dozen new Mega Evolutions added in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and its expansion, but it also includes official artwork of some of the major characters who show up later in the game and weren’t part of the initial marketing push. Notably, this includes Lysandre, Grisham, and Griselle, ex-members of the villainous Team Flare, some of the only truly “secret” characters who are crucial to some of the late game reveals. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2025-2000655443"><span>Lysandre</span></a><span> in particular was kept under wraps, given he was long presumed dead after the events of </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. I suppose The Pokémon Company is ripping that bandage off. You had three months to play the game, so the aged, immortal version of Lysandre we get in </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>might start showing up in more marketing material now that he’s being acknowledged through official channels.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But the real treat is the good art we finally have of all the Mega Evolutions, including my boy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu X</span></a><span>, the meme king </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, and some of the lesser-known transformations that debuted in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. Click through to see them all.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yesterday, The Pokémon Company announced the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713"><span>official Pokémon x Lego collaboration models</span></a><span>, including sets for Pikachu, Eevee, and a disgustingly expensive one of the Kanto starters. If you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>compare them to the Mega Bloks models</span></a><span>, though, you might decide to buy those cheaper sets instead.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate’s Xbox Storage Expansion Card Drops Below $0.12 Per GB at a New Year Record Low as Amazon Clears Out the Best-Selling SSD]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-xbox-storage-expansion-card-drops-below-0-12-per-gb-at-a-new-year-record-low-as-amazon-clears-out-the-best-selling-ssd-2000656513</link>
            <guid>1404652</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="1023">Gaming has a file size problem. In recent years, we’ve seen video games reach overwhelmingly large sizes. This is particularly true for many big-budget games developed by Western AAA studios. Take <em data-start="286" data-end="308">Oblivion: Remastered</em>, for example, which has a file size of over 120GB. It’s hard to even imagine how much space <em data-start="401" data-end="422">Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will occupy when it’s eventually released. With games consuming such vast amounts of storage, it’s a challenge for players—especially since consoles like the Xbox Series X still come with only 1TB of internal storage. If you want to play more than just a few games, you’ll find yourself constantly managing space by deleting and reinstalling titles, which isn’t exactly convenient. A far better solution is to invest in a dedicated external storage drive. Seagate offers one that’s made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Series S, and it’s currently available at a significant discount for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="1025" data-end="1395"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon is offering three versions of Seagate’s Xbox expansion card at reduced prices right now</a>. The 1TB model, typically priced at $160, is on sale for $149, giving you a $11 discount. The 2TB version has dropped from $260 to $230, saving you $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1397" data-end="1743">Since the Xbox Series X comes with just 1TB of storage, adding one of these Seagate drives will either double, triple, or even quintuple your available space for Xbox games—depending on which model you choose. This extra storage will make a huge difference if you want to keep a variety of games installed without constantly managing your space.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Installing the Seagate expansion card is incredibly simple. Unlike the PS5, which requires users to open the console casing to install an SSD, the Seagate drive for Xbox Series X and S plugs directly into a dedicated slot at the back of the console. No tools are needed. Once it’s plugged in, you can select whether you want to save new games to the internal storage or to your Seagate expansion card.</p>


<h2 data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Swap Between Games With Ease</h2>
<p data-start="2148" data-end="2610">What’s more, games saved to the Seagate drive perform just as well as those stored on your Xbox’s internal storage. A major selling point of the current generation of Xbox consoles is Quick Resume, which allows you to suspend one game and switch to another without losing your progress. You can jump from a high-speed race in <em data-start="2495" data-end="2512">Forza Horizon 5</em> to a quick match in <em data-start="2533" data-end="2548">Rocket League</em>, then return to your original&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>race right where you left off.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Seagate’s expansion cards are officially licensed to support Xbox’s Velocity Architecture, which powers Quick Resume. This means any game you store on the Seagate drive will benefit from Quick Resume, just like games stored on the internal drive. Whether you’re downloading a new title or moving an existing one, the experience will remain seamless and efficient.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With lots of massive titles set to release this year such as <em>GTA VI</em> and <em>007 First Light</em>, now is a great time to expand your Xbox storage. Grab Seagate’s Xbox expansion card for as little as $160 for a limited time.</p>
