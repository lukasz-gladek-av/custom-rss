              <p>At the time of writing, just as the United States of Games Players are beginning to wake up,&nbsp;<em>ARC Raiders</em> has 159,483 people playing.&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> has 597,408. Meanwhile, the free <em>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</em> has 556. In fairness, a few hours back, that peaked at 1,070, the best numbers it’s seen since Christmas Day. For a game that only officially (re)launched on December 4, that’s…it’s not good. It’s very, very bad. But developers 1047 Games are trying to put a positive spin on things.</p> <p>The game once known as&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em> has had a self-inflicted rough time. Originally launched June last year, the sequel to 2019’s free-to-play multiplayer shooter was <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742">then un-launched in July</a> in response to a cacophony of negative reaction, the game’s lack of basic features like leaderboards, and its <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-skin-bundle-prices-call-duty-maga-hat-1851784073">grim microtransaction prices</a>. None of this was helped by 1047’s CEO Ian Proulx <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-trump-hat-summer-game-fest-1851783949">wearing a MAGA-meme hat in a Summer Games Fest</a> set in the middle of LA’s disgraceful ICE raids, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">then trying to milk the impotent controversy for as long as possible</a>.</p>

 <p>After five months away, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-arena-shooter-beta-1047-games-2000650903">the game was re-released early last month</a>, and you’d be forgiven for not having noticed. While&nbsp;<em>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</em> saw a half-decent 27,000 people show up on Steam soon after its original June 6 launch, that number had plummeted to under 2,000 by the time the game wriggled back into beta July 22. So its relaunch last month to a peak of 2,297 players on PC is <em>catastrophically</em> bad. And that was its peak, meaning the number of people simultaneously playing the game on Steam over the last month is failing to beat the worst of the tail-off from before the game was pulled.</p>

 <p>We must remember, Steam is but one of the ways people can play <em>Splitgate</em>, and doesn’t account for console numbers at all. Of course, an online, free-to-play multiplayer shooter would traditionally tend to find a good portion of its audience on PC, but we don’t have the data to show otherwise. As 1047 puts it in a brief, extremely defensive statement <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">posted to its official X account</a>, Steam numbers “show one number, on one platform, at one given moment.” Which is partially true. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">SteamDB, the source of all these PC figures</a>, show the numbers at&nbsp;<em>all</em> given moments, and maps them to a graph. Yes, they don’t show how many copies have sold, but they do tell you how many people are playing at any given point. And it’s barely any. Right now, seven times more people are playing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4147820/charts/"><em>Your Mom</em></a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations <a href="https://t.co/ir9W0BjFHo">pic.twitter.com/ir9W0BjFHo</a></p> <p>— SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The statement begins with an unimpeachably true statement, however. “Steam Charts don’t measure fun.” There’s no denying this, and if the 1,000 people who are persisting with the game a month after its re-release are having a great time, then all power to them. We all know excellent games that unfairly failed to find an audience, and 1047 absolutely should be defending a game its proud of and boasting about its community. It also remains the case that when those games are based on a freemium model where income comes from players buying in-game items, then its long-term potential is somewhat limited.</p>

 <p>The statement is defiant, maintaining “The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of&nbsp;<em>Spligate</em> possible,” and thanking the players the game does have. It also implores people to give the game a try, arguing “the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion.” But what the post <em>doesn’t</em> do is provide any data for console sales to bolster the opening point that people only know how it’s performing on PC.</p>

 <p>It must be so awful, to have worked&nbsp;<em>so</em> hard on a game, and then to have had the enormous setback of a failed launch, only to re-emerge after months more effort and for no one to show up despite the game being free. I can’t even imagine. Yet, I really don’t know if putting out a statement responding to Redditors being rude about SteamDB numbers is the most professional look. Still, it’s working—we’re writing about the game as a consequence, and perhaps that’ll inspire a few more people to give the game a look. I kinda hope it works.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn the playercount is lower than your studio name. <a href="https://t.co/kgdyGxs4vu">pic.twitter.com/kgdyGxs4vu</a></p> <p>— DANNYonPC (@DANNYonPC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DANNYonPC/status/2008628012611158306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Oof.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-wireless-controllers-hit-all-time-lows-after-10k-sold-as-microsoft-clears-out-special-editions-2000657266</link>
            <guid>1399186</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="392">The Xbox Core controller is widely regarded as one of the best gamepads available. Whether you’re gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or Android device, the first party Microsoft controller is always a solid choice. C<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6684/">urrently, the special edition Ice Breaker blue version is on sale for $50, down from its usual $80 price, giving you a remarkable $30 discount</a>. It’s rare to see the fancy colorways like this one go on sale for so much. It’s currently down to the same price as the basic carbon black model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6684/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="392">A Design That Just Works</h2>
<p data-start="394" data-end="948">While Sony has continually evolved its DualShock controllers each generation with new features like touchpads and adaptive triggers, Microsoft has taken a more conservative approach. The company pretty much nailed it with the Xbox 360 design. When the Xbox One controller launched in 2013, its ergonomics had been updated a bit. Now, more than a decade later, the design remains nearly identical, with only minor tweaks to keep up with modern standards. These include Bluetooth support, a switch to USB-C, and improvements in material quality. But overall, it’s the same controller that debuted alongside the console generation that first saw <em data-start="927" data-end="947">Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p data-start="950" data-end="1047">The Xbox Core controller has stuck to its tried-and-true formula because, quite simply, it works. Its super comfortable to play with, especially during long gaming sessions. I recently played <em data-start="1229" data-end="1244">Hollow Knight</em> on my PlayStation 5 in the lead up to <em data-start="1283" data-end="1293">Silksong</em>‘s launch. I decided to play the sequel upon release on PC and gifted myself a my first new Xbox controller in years. I hadn’t updated my Xbox controllers since the first couple years of the Xbox One, sticking mainly to PlayStation or third-party controllers like those from 8BitDo. It was a real “welcome home” moment. The comfort and ergonomics just feel so natural compared to other gamepads on the market.</p>


<p data-start="1655" data-end="2132">A standout but often underrated feature of the controller is its super precise D-pad. You’re in complete control as you guide Hornet throughout the world of Pharloom. The textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case are a thoughtful addition, making the controller feel secure and comfortable, especially during heated moments. It’s a small touch, but when my hands start to sweat during tough boss battles, it’s something I really appreciate.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2634">Microsoft has embraced customization options over the last decade. With the Xbox Accessories app, players can remap buttons to suit their preferences, adding a layer of accessibility that’s welcome for many. This feature is a great boon for those with specific needs to allow them to play at all, but it’s also useful for players who just want to personalize their setup. For example, someone who grew up with Nintendo consoles might struggle with the A and B button positions, and remapping can make all the difference.</p>
<p data-start="2636" data-end="3049" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Overall, the Xbox Core controller is a masterclass in simple, effective design. It may not have the flashy additions that PlayStation has introduced, but its comfort, precision, and customization options make it a gamepad that just works—no gimmicks necessary. That also keep the price down. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6684/">At just $50 for a limited time, this Ice Breaker Xbox core controller is a no brainer.</a></p>
