              <p>Every game in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series is defined, in part, by its aesthetics, the visual design choices coalescing every element into one cohesive vision. Even during the Hylian hero’s original 8-bit journey, strong art direction transformed simple sprites into sprawling labyrinths, mysterious woods, and terrible foes in the player’s imagination. While the core of <em>Zelda</em>’s story and gameplay has remained (until recently) mostly the same, the series reinvents itself artistically with nearly every entry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on June 27, 2023. It’s been republished today following the 40th anniversary of </em>Zelda<em>‘s launch in Japan.</em></p> <p>Looking back on the 40 year history of the franchise, one thing is clear: Link has had a lot of looks.</p>

 <p>Cel-shaded oceans, lonely ranches, and apocalyptic moon landings all paint the diverse canvas that is <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, but which entries truly <em>look</em> the best? There’s no bad-looking <em>Zelda</em> game—<a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon-the-kotaku-review-1818811388">not from Nintendo, anyway</a>—but today we want to rank the most aesthetically inspired, from least inspired to most. We’ll be considering all the mainline <em>Zelda</em> entries, and please keep in mind that this isn’t a ranking of the best games in the series, but rather the best-looking.</p> <p>Let’s step into the art gallery that is <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and take a look around.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elon Musk Reportedly Delayed An Update To Grok Because It Kept Getting Questions About Baldur’s Gate 3 Wrong]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-baldurs-gate-3-grok-xai-2000672632</link>
            <guid>1443139</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Elon Musk, currently on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, is apparently obsessed with <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">teaching Grok about video games</a>. The xAI-powered chatbot was reportedly so bad at answering questions about <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> last year that Musk actually delayed a major update to its model so the problem could be rectified.</p> <p>That bizarre anecdote comes from a recent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">deep-dive investigation into xAI by <em>Business Insider</em></a>. Musk’s penchant for chaos and micromanagement was apparently so bad that when confronted with Grok’s inability to correctly parse details about Larian Studios’ hit 2023 RPG based on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, he pulled top engineers off other projects to get the chatbot sorted.</p>

 <p>“In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game ‘Baldur’s Gate,’ according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said,” <em>Business Insider</em> writes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can I have just one normal week <a href="https://t.co/bip2afWQLe">pic.twitter.com/bip2afWQLe</a></p> <p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2025332627645808932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Lest you think this episode was a one-off, Musk was also apparently obsessed with teaching Grok how to play <em>League of Legends</em>. Some former xAI employees reportedly compare how the company is run to a never-ending fire drill. There are multiple “war rooms” running at the Palo Alto headquarters to tackle urgent issues, including getting Grok to Challenger rank in Riot Games’ popular MOBA.</p>

 <p>“At the end of 2025, at least five war rooms were running simultaneously, according to three people,” writes <em>Business Insider</em>. “One, they said, was dedicated to teaching Grok how to play one of Musk’s favorite video games, ‘League of Legends.'”</p>

 <p>That definitely sounds like the unparalleled, no-drugs grindset of someone worth a trillion dollars. It’s worth noting that all of this was happening the year following Musk exposing himself as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">a massive cheater</a> in games like<em> Diablo 4</em> and <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>‘s own publishing head was busy calling out Musk’s promises of AI-generated video games <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-elon-musk-ai-xai-douse-2000632638">for missing the point</a>.</p>

              <p><span>Ever see those Facebook reels where </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat 1</span></i><span> modders try to dupe strangers into thinking NetherRealm Studios added Shrek and Captain Jack Sparrow to their fighting game to decapitate one another? Something along those lines capped off this year’s figure skating competition at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan as Sub-Zero, Deadpool and Kung Fu Panda squared off on the global stage.</span></p> <p><span>Kazakhstan skater Mikhail Shaidorov won the gold in men’s figure skating this year, the first from his country to land that prize. He’s also the first Olympic figure skater, ever, to best the Lin Kuei. During the Exhibition Gala, the closing, non-competitive, often silly segment, Shaidorov came out on the ice dressed like Jack Black’s famed Dreamworks cartoon martial artist. There he danced to Carl Douglas’s “Kung Fu Fighting,” doing some friendly sparring with Deadpool and Sub-Zero before farting on them, the sound effect echoing in the arena of champions.</span></p>

The two ended with the warbled, dazed stance Mortal Kombatants do ahead of having their intestines ripped out.</span></p> <p><span>Needless to say I have never been more confused about IP rights at the Olympic games.

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend Of Zelda’s Keeps Flirting With Dumping Fantasy For Sci-Fi]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-sci-fi-concept-art-40th-anniversary-2000672580</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today marks the 40th anniversary of </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>. Originally released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986, Nintendo’s ambitious adventure kicked off the most beloved high-fantasy video game series of them all. Through decades, the tunic-wearing hero has slain stalfos, obliterated octoroks, and harassed cuccos. But behind all the sword and sorcery lies another campaign in waiting, an adventure Link has never braved but come very close to undertaking: some outer space shit.</span></p> <p><span>In 2017, </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, art director Satoru Takizawa and technical director Takuhiro Dohta </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMsF31NdNc"><span>gave a keynote at GDC</span></a><span>. It offered a rare and candid glimpse at the production behind the latest (and to some, greatest) </span><i><span>Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>, released only a few days prior. Getting a peak behind the curtain at how the toybox of physics and elemental effects came to be was a treat, but one of the more bizarre parts of the talk regarded an earlier pitch.</span></p>

 <p><span>In a segment called “Trial and Error,” Takizawa reviews concepts for a version of the game called <em>The Legend of Zelda: INVASION</em>. “This is where things got a bit dodgy,” Takizawa said. “And here’s an invasion from outer space.”</span></p> <p><span>As chuckling swells in the crowd, bizarre slides of this would-be </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> cycle. It features a UFO descending on to Hyrule, a storyboard for an alien autopsy, spacesuits and Ganondorf in what appears to be a Metallica t-shirt. Most offensive of all were slides of the most fuckboy Link ever developed. Dressed like a frosh week volunteer, Link dons baggy denim pants, a striped winter hat, a Triforce guitar and a motorcycle. To think we came this close to a Link with a </span><i><span>Superbad</span></i><span> poster in his room still gives me chills.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfefbrnvn32w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreia5cy4hgcgd5aosdhkyvbjbew2mpr72ppojm5jvkofahie7z6mkgq"> <p lang="fr">The Legend of Zelda is 40 today 🤯<br> *check notes on space*</p> <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017): UFO concept, artist unknown<br> Art director Satoru Takizawa: "Some of our younger designers came up with very unique suggestions, like the idea that UFOs could invade from space and abduct cattle.”</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz?ref_src=embed">The Spaceshipper 🚀 (@thespaceshipper.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz/post/3mfefbrnvn32w?ref_src=embed">2026-02-21T10:15:00.535Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>Thankfully we got the incredible game we got instead, but it’s probably no coincidence that Takizawa brought up <em>INVASION</em> when discussing the design for </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>’s ancient ruins and Guardians. Sheikah technology has a strong, otherworldly and out-of-place appearance to it. Mechanical octopus arms. Ominous glowing spotlights. Metallurgy so distant to the masonry everywhere else. Hell, Link’s main weapon is a damn smartphone. It always felt like some of the sci-fi elements remained deep in Hyrule’s soil, built by ancient visitors.</span></p>

 <p><span>This </span><i><span>Stargate</span></i><span>-aside wasn’t </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>’s only near miss with a different genre. Fact is, since day one Shigeru Miyamoto considered giving </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> a harder sci-fi bent. In </span><a href="https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/interview-miyamoto-un-equilibre-difficile-a-trouver-165131.html"><span>an interview with the French publication </span><i><span>Gamekult</span></i></a><span>, Miyamoto confirmed that the series’ original idea revolved around time travel.</span></p>

 <p><span>Obviously time travel is a frequent occurrence, but this initial concept is less </span><i><span>Ocarina</span></i><span> and more </span><i><span>Back to the Future Part II</span></i><span>. This plot seemingly concerns a bygone era of steel and shield rubbing up against strange future devices, and the source of the Triforce’s incredible magic being microchips and computer parts. In that same conversation, Miyamoto even muses that </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> producer Eiji Aonuma might have added the Sheikah Slate as a kind of callback to this original idea. 1992’s </span><i><span>A Link to the Past</span></i><span> got so close to Link facing off against flying cars that concept art was drafted for a tubular, ‘90s, cyberpunk Princess Zelda, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216074731/https://kotaku.com/5979669/your-favorite-zelda-game-could-have-looked-like-this"><span>resurfacing in 2013’s </span><i><span>Hyrule Historia</span></i></a><span>. Come to think of it, the title </span><i><span>A Link to the Past</span></i><span> would make a lot more sense for a game about time travel than one in which you merely hop between a good dimension and a scary dimension.</span></p> <p><span>After 40 years, it feels unlikely that Nintendo will send Link, Zelda, Tingle, all our Hyrule friends spiraling into wormholes and far off nebulas now. When Hylians land on the moon, it usually means the moon came to the Hyrule. Nintendo has reigned in their style guide before. As they venture </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-yoshi-birdo-baby-2000662854"><span>into movies</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-nintendo-lead-actors-benjamin-ainsworth-1851786373"><span>Netflix shows</span></a><span> and theme parks I expect them to only become more conservative on what their IPs do and do not do. Still, as much as <em>INVASION</em>’s Link… disturbs me, I am that steadfast </span><i><span>Jackie Brown</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ed Wood</span></i><span> are their best movies kind of hack who finds that great artists often do their greatest work beyond the comfort zone. Throughout the ages, people who work on <em>Zelda</em> seem to dream of one day lobbing Link into the cold void of space. Perhaps, one day, they will get their wish.</span></p>
