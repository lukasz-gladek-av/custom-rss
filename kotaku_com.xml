              <p>The AI arms race is currently eating up hundreds of billions of dollars in investment as companies compete over a technology whose exact benefits are still far from clear. Microsoft is at the center of that fight. How is the head of Microsoft gaming thinking about <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">fitting AI into development</a>? “Our AI use today is much more operational than it is in the creative space,” Phil Spencer said during a recent panel discussion.</p> <p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space">by <em>IGN</em></a>, he was speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in Palo Alto, California on the topic of “Big Ideas, Small Games: Creativity Beyond the Blockbuster” with Double Fine studio head Tim Schafer <a href="https://kotaku.com/keeper-the-kotaku-review-xbox-game-pass-how-long-is-it-good-price-2000637702">following the release of <em>Keeper</em></a>. Microsoft has been pushing AI into all of its products and CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">bragged about</a> relying on multiple AI assistants throughout the day to run one of the biggest tech firms in the world.</p>

 <p>But it’s less clear how those tools are being used by rank-and-file employees within the company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-gen-ai-idxbox-layoffs-npc-chatgpt-1851785609">especially on the gaming side</a>.&nbsp;According to Spencer, Microsoft gaming’s biggest deployment of AI technology right now is in its platform moderation tools. The company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/13/xbox-transparency-report-new-ai-solutions/">announced last year</a> that it’s been using AI tools to help flag and intercept offensive or spam-related communications on Xbox.</p>

 <p>“So we have AI that we use to make sure that the conversation and topics that are happening, and for protected child accounts and other things and who gets to talk to those accounts to those people, is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls,” he said during yesterday’s panel. “That’s our primary use of AI inside of our organization today, which maybe isn’t the most glamorous use of AI, but it’s something that I fundamentally believe in.”</p>

 <p>When it comes to other applications on the player-facing front, Spencer suggested AI could also help with one of the biggest challenges in gaming right now: game discovery and curation. “It’s not in practice today, but is there a way for us to use discovery based on things that you’ve done in the past to surface the next thing that you might not know about that might be interesting to you?” he speculated.</p>

 <p>When it comes to game development, however, Spencer seemed to downplay any significant use of AI tools when it comes to things like creating concept art, programming code, or scripting dialogue.&nbsp;“On the creative side, I really leave it up to the teams,” the executive said. “I have found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success. I look at the teams, and we make tools available, and I kind of let it organically percolate.”</p> <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>On the production side, which I think is where a lot of people go…we don’t have any goals in our model for that to happen. I think more about the pace of creativity, maybe the number of things we can try and take risks on before we decide on our next opportunity. But our AI use today is much more operational than it is in the creative space.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s a far cry from the promises that some gaming company executives are making about how AI can help them drastically cut costs and ship games more quickly and efficiently. Last year, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said AI was at “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">the very core</a>” of the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> publisher’s business. That company is <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">now reportedly banking on an AI</a> revolution to help it service a new $20 billion loan as part of a private equity buyout led by Saudi Arabia.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-elite-series-2-core-controller-is-selling-fast-as-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-an-all-time-low-2000638568</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-elite-series-2-core-controller-is-selling-fast-as-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-an-all-time-low.1333879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller has a heftier feel, made from heavier materials to give you some real weight to hold onto in your hand when compared to the standard Xbox wireless controller. It’s also got a rubberized grip and short hair triggers. The thumbstick mobility can be adjusted to your exact preferences, plus you get a lot of swappable parts to truly cater to your playstyle. T<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4990/">hat normally retails for $180 (even though Amazon says its usually $200), but right now, the site has it one sale for just $153.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4990/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Customize Your Way of Play</h2>
<p>While you can get the white Elite Series 2 controller for the cheaper price of just $130, that only comes with the core controller plus a tool for thumbstick adjustment and a USB-C cable. The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller in black comes with the whole kit and caboodle. Along with the thumbstick tool and charging cable, you get a charging dock to place your controller in when you’re done playing. This will ensure you always are starting any gaming session at 100%.</p>
<p>You also receive a set of four back paddles which can be assigned to any button function. By default, they will be assigned to the face buttons of A, B, X, and Y. This any first person shooter play so much better. No more do you have to take your thumb off the right stick to jump or to reload or to slide or switch weapons. Just tap one of the paddles without giving up your aim.</p>



<p>On top of that, it comes with three pairs of additional thumbsticks in different styles. The default ones are similar to what you find on Xbox’s standard controller, with the concave center and grips along the edges. The first additional pair of sticks is just a backup of the standard pair. Then you also get a dome designed set of sticks as well as the standard style but taller. It felt weird at first, but I like using the short standard on the left stick but then the tall one on the right which allows for more precise movements while aiming.</p>
<p>Your last swappable piece is the additional d-pad which has the classic plus-sign design so you can switch between whichever of the two you prefer.</p>
<p>And then all those pieces not currently in use on your controller can hang back in the included carrying case. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4990/">This fits your Xbox Elite Series 2 controller plus all the little bits and bobs, making traveling with it to a friend’s house convenient.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-4tb-portable-hard-drive-hits-0-02-per-gb-the-cheapest-way-to-expand-xbox-or-playstation-storage-yet-2000638557</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you or someone you know is constantly teetering on the edge of maxing out their file storage be it on their computer or on a gaming console, in constant need to deleting the old to make room for the new, you or they may find peace by just using an external hard drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4989/">Right now, you can save 20% on this Seagate portable external HDD.</a> Amazon normally has it listed at $125, so the discount takes it down by a solid $25. You’re left only have to pay an even $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4989/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Xbox and PlayStation Compatible</h2>
<p>This Seagate external hard drive is compatible not just with PCs but also with your Xbox or PlayStation console. The Xbox Series X has an internal SSD with a capacity of only 1TB, while the Xbox Series S has even less with just 512GB. The PlayStation 5 base console is working with 1TB. And keep in mind that these numbers are the total capacity. Some of that space is already used up by necessary system software loaded onto it to make the consoles work, so you’re really only working with a fraction of that for game storage.</p>
<p>The Seagate portable drive can add on a whole 4TB more for storing all your games. That’s great news considering many AAA games as of late have ballooned in file size, with games like <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>is listed on storefronts as being over 200GB. That will take up almost half your Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>Now there is a catch. While you can download and store your games onto the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, you can’t actually play them from it. Current gen games require super fast load time with specific hardware that enables certain functionality like Xbox’s Quick Resume feature. So when it comes time to want to play you game, you have to transfer the file from the drive to the console.</p>
<p>While that’s not the most convenient thing in the world, moving files from drive to drive is still exponentially faster than needing to redownload a game from the internet. Moving from a drive is better than that. Think of it like a digital version of taking your game off the shelf and popping the disc in when you’re ready to play. The drive can be your library, and this HDD is far cheaper than an SSD would be that can support playing the games directly from. So this presents a great budget option to maximize your game storage space while minimizing what you’ll have to spend.</p>
