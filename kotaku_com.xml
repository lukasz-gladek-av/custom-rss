              <p>Folks have been modding lightsabers and <i>Star Wars</i> characters into Bethesda’s various open-world games for as long as modders have been poking around in the code of the developer’s Creation Engine. But it wasn’t until <i>Starfield</i> came along that we had a Bethesda game whose setting was naturally conducive to an ultimate <i>Star Wars</i> fantasy. <i>Starfield</i>’s 1000-plus star systems, its gorgeously rendered planets and customizable ships, have begged for modders to transform this vast digital space into a simulation of that beloved galaxy, far, far away. Since its launch in 2023, <i>Starfield</i> has received numerous mods, many of which are <i>Star Wars</i>-themed. But one project, <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/"><i>Star Wars Genesis</i></a>, aims to assemble the best that modders have put together.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="An Expanding Star Wars Galaxy — Cinematic Showcase and Release of Star Wars Genesis V8" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OC7wvzsH6Kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I recently went through the laborious install process (made even harder if you don’t own a Nexusmods Premium account) and had a chance to chat with the project lead, DeityVengy, about what inspired the project, what it’s been like putting it all together, and what the future holds for <i>Genesis.&nbsp;</i></p> <p>First, let’s back up a bit. <i>Star Wars Genesis</i> isn’t a mod itself, but rather a collection of mods all assembled with a handy installer known as wabbajack. The process of <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/install/">installing</a> will require a Jedi Master’s level of meditative patience. It’s extensive. Needing to click through so many mods, dealing with a few that failed on install the first time (wrestling with my damn storage drives that are always virtually at capacity didn’t help), and then finally running the game with this gargantuan list took me some time. So be prepared for a lengthy and fairly involved process–and know you still may run into some issues while installing or even when you try to run it.</p>

 <p>By some miracle of the Force, I, a woman who notoriously screws up mod installs, had <i>Star Wars Genesis</i> up and running on first boot and…<i>Wow</i>. Despite some framerate issues (I’m only running a 3070ti for a mod that recommends a darn 4090), it is impressive how readily <i>Starfield</i> can be transformed into a <i>Star Wars</i> sim. Some existing planets and cities are lightly transformed from their original state. Mars, for example, and its mining city from the base game serve as Geonosis now. Tatooine, which looks like it uses one of <i>Starfield</i>’s many desert worlds, is now home to a recreation of Mos Eisley–and walking around this dreaded hive of scum and villainy feels uncanny. But it’s not only textures, buildings, and new NPC models that fill the space. There’s a dedicated questline that does an impressive job of repurposing and tweaking the base game’s main quest, Constellation, with modified voicelines that swaps the UC Vanguard for the Empire and the Freestar Rangers for the Rebel Alliance.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617838" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617838"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617838">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Genesis</i> takes place in an alternate take on what happens roughly 10 years following the events of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. It’s a fitting spot in the timeline for DeityVengy as <i>Episode III</i> is their favorite <i>Star Wars</i> film. “I kinda grew up in the prequel era,” they told me, “and naturally I ended up liking <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>.” They credit “shows like <i>Clone Wars</i>, <i>Kenobi</i>, and <i>Ashoka</i>” with having helped rehabilitate the once-maligned prequel era. Bear in mind, though, that <i>Genesis</i> isn’t set on delivering the most lore-accurate <i>Star Wars</i> experience.</p> <p>It’s still working within the bounds of what <i>Starfield</i> has to offer, plus, as explained in <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/lore/">the project’s lore page</a>, setting this mod project in an alternate universe means the player doesn’t just need to “fight the Empire, Crime Faction 1, and Crime Faction 2” as players do in so many <i>Star Wars</i> games that try to stick more closely to the lore. “Just look at <i>Force Unleashed</i>,” DeityVengy says. “Is it canon? No. Is it better than <i>Star Wars Outlaws</i> or the <i>Jedi Survivor</i> series story-wise? Hell yes.”</p>

 <p>Some may take issue with that last assessment of the recent <i>Star Wars</i> games, but it speaks to DeityVengy’s vision of this mod project firmly being “fanon, including what [they] consider the best aspects of every era.”</p> <p>Given the name of the project, I was curious about how this all started. Where does one get the impulse and the fortitude to assemble such an ambitious collection of mods, each from different modders, into one, fully working <i>Star Wars</i> sim? The project, DeityVengy told me, “started as a simple one-off video for my YouTube channel about one-and-a-half years ago. After the initial video blew up and more people got interested in it, I just had more motivation to keep it going and started working on my mods. It really [kicked off] after I made my main quest which completely rewrote <i>Starfield</i>’s main quest, and then there was another spike recently when I replaced New Atlantis with Coruscant.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617843" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617843"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617843">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But even with a love of <i>Star Wars</i> and a host of fans eager to jump into a total conversion project, DeityVengy still had some big hurdles to overcome. “For the longest time,” they told me, “the biggest challenge was a modding limitation that <i>Starfield</i> had for about a year where you could only have around 100 or so mods installed until your game became unplayable.” That limitation proved to be an opportunity for DeityVengy, one “that ended up being the foundation for a few of my big overhaul mods such as Armor Compendium, which makes <i>Genesis</i> possible today. It really just forced me to be concise and organized when I was learning how to mod. Without that initial challenge, the project would be a lot less organized and a lot buggier.”</p> <p>For those of us eager to wield a laser sword (yes, I called it that), there’s a bit of disappointment awaiting you at the end of the install process. “There are a few lightsaber mods out there,” they told me, “but I really refuse to add them unless their implementation is perfect, and that’s just unfortunately not possible without Bethesda releasing their animation framework tools.” Dodging and better third-person melee animations are really what DeityVegny seems to need to make the experience of wielding a lightsaber feel as good as it presently does to touch down in Mos Eisley and chill with some Jawas.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617839"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617839">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Up next on their plate are some faction quest rewrites. The current mod list features a full rebranding of the game’s factions. House Va’ruun, for example, are now a roaming band of Sith zealots. “I’m taking a lot of inspiration from the success of <i>Andor</i> and am keeping it as a grounded story,” they said about the upcoming faction overhauls. “The Rebellion questline that I’m working on is going to be a much more <i>Andor</i>-esque story where you’re just a regular person solving a problem for the Rebel Alliance.”</p> <p><i>Star Wars Genesis </i>is currently on version 8.2.0, with the project having started in June of 2024 and receiving regular updates since then. The next version, 8.3, is just around the corner, promising over 1,000 new voicelines for the main quest. The install page recommends waiting for this new update if you’re new to the project. At the very least, it’s a good opportunity to do a fresh install of <i>Starfield</i> in anticipation as the process of getting everything up and running is made easier when you completely clear your computer of any trace of the old install.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617840" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617840"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617840">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve only spent a couple of hours poking around in DeityVegny’s take on the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, but from the opening moments on, with the iconic sights and sounds of <i>Star Wars</i> filling my eyes and ears, it’s clear I’ll be venturing to this version of one of the most beloved fictional galaxies of all time a hell of a lot more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>I’ll be honest, this last week I spent most of it sitting around and feeling down because all I wanted to do was play more <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">Battlefield 6</a>.</em> And now, it’s back for one more open beta weekend, and this time around, there’s some new content, too. That will likely help its player count numbers grow even higher as <em>BF6</em>, months before launch, already feels like a blockbuster success for EA.</p> <p>Here’s everything you need to know about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>, including when it starts and ends, what’s included in this new beta weekend, where you can play it, and more.</p> <h2>When Does The <em>Battlefield 6</em> Open Beta Start And End?</h2> <p>On August 14, as EA and Battlefield Studios previously announced, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta returned on all platforms. And this time around, there isn’t any weird “early access” period where you’ll need a code to play. This weekend, anyone can hop in right away and start capturing control points and blowing up buildings.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700"><em>BF6</em></a> open beta started on Thursday, August 14 at 4 a.m. EDT and ends on Sunday, August 17 at 4 a.m. PDT. That means you, and over <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">350,000 other fans</a>, have around 72 hours or so to play more of what might be the best online shooter of 2025. And maybe, if EA is feeling generous, the beta will get extended a bit. It’s happened before. We can only hope.</p> <h2>Is There Any New Content In The Second Weekend Of <em>BF6</em>‘s Open Beta?</h2> <p>Yes! Earlier this week, ahead of the beta’s launch, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options">EA published an in-depth blog</a> about the second and final beta weekend, confirming that a new map and game modes were being added. There are also some changes to how playlists work, with new options that combine some modes and rotate out during the beta.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 EMPIRE STATE PS5 Pro Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7cl2WRcIYc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The big news in weekend two is a new map to explore and blow up. It’s called “Empire State” and it’s set in New York City. I played this map during a preview event last month and really enjoyed it. However, some players might be sad to learn that this new NYC-themed map is not a massive one. We know there are big maps in the game, but it seems we won’t be getting any during the beta.</p>

 <p>Also being added to the beta are two new modes: Squad Deathmatch and the <em>Battlefield</em> classic Rush. At the previously mentioned preview event, I got to play Squad Deathmatch, and it was no good due to tiny maps and <em>CoD</em>-like combat. That’s not the kind of experience I want from <em>Battlefield</em>. Rush, on the other hand, is a fan-favorite mode, and I’m excited to see it return in <em>BF6</em>. There will be some new beta-only challenges, too.</p> <h2>Does the <em>BF6</em> Open Beta Include A Server Browser?</h2> <p>No! However, EA has added a new way to join matches and find specific modes and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> beta. This new option is called “Custom Search.” Here’s how EA describes it:</p>

 <p>“Custom Search allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.”</p> <p>It should be noted that EA makes it very clear that this isn’t a server browser. We know Portal, a separate mode in <em>BF6</em> that will feature user-made content, will feature a server browser. But the beta and traditional multiplayer in BF6, for now at least, won’t include the old school tool.</p> <h2>Are people already cheating in the<em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">That is indeed a thing that happened during the last beta weekend.</a> Players online shared clips of people using what appeared to be wall hacks and other cheat software during the <em>BF6</em> open beta. EA says it has banned thousands of players and blocked even more attempts at cheating in the beta, but some people are annoyed that the game forces you to use Secure Boot on PC to help deter cheaters, which can be a hassle for some users, and yet still has a problem with people hacking it.</p>

 <p>I’ll say that in my time playing <em>BF6</em> last weekend, I never encountered anyone blatantly cheating. I did, however, run into people using flick aim, a controversial addition to <em>BF6</em> that some players say is unfair and makes the game too twitchy. The idea behind flick aim is that players on all platforms can assign buttons that almost instantly “flick” their character in a specific direction. For example, you could assign flick backward to down on the d-pad and be able to instantly pull a 180 spin at the touch of a button.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a must have setting in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Flick Look allows you to achieve an instant quick 180 in combat! <a href="https://t.co/ElMW1yvrhh">pic.twitter.com/ElMW1yvrhh</a></p> <p>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While some players aren’t happy about this and have reportedly even accused others online of cheating when seeing them use the in-game flick options, others point out that it gives console and controller users a way to compete with mouse players.&nbsp;Personally, I think flick aiming options in <em>Battlefield 6</em> are fine, but perhaps my opinion will change on that if and when more players start using it and how that changes up the flow of combat in the game.</p>

 <h2>So, Is <em>Battlefield 6</em> Any Good?</h2> <p>As someone who has played every mainline <em>Battlefield</em> game, as well as an incredibly long list of other online shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, I think <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is fantastic</a>. If the full game can match or even exceed what’s in the beta and what I played during that preview event in July, I think there’s a really good chance <em>BF6</em> is a massive hit with both players and critics.</p> <p><em>BF6</em>‘s combat is snappy and feels wonderful, but also doesn’t feel too fast or twitchy like modern <em>Call of Duty</em>. Instead, soldiers have a weight to them, and firefights can go on for an extended amount of time as players lay down cover fire using extremely loud and dangerous-sounding guns. This is the gritty, grounded modern warfare <em>Battlefield</em> game that we’ve been missing since <em>Battlefield 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>I literally felt sad for most of the week, playing or doing anything else. All I’ve wanted to do these last few days is load up <em>BF6</em> and blast some fools while helping my team win. So I’m excited that the <em>BF6</em> open beta is back for one more weekend. Sadly, after this, we’ll all have to wait until October 10 to play <em>Battlefield 6</em> again when it launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. As someone once said, <a href="https://youtu.be/-KJPP7GkuPU">“The waiting is the hardest part.”</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-libra-summons-everdark-tips-2000617780</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-newest-boss-fight-is-pure-chaos-and-i-love-hate-it.1270455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">rotating summer boss fight extravaganza</a> just reached peak chaos. Libra Creature of Night, AKA Equilibrious Beast, is the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-night-reign-libra-madness-orb-sigil-phase-1851782989">latest Everdark Sovereign</a>, turning what was already arguably the hardest boss fight in the game into something even more punishing. But not in the way players expected. Instead of simply multiplying the difficulty of the original encounter, Libra returned with completely new mechanics that revolve around summoning an army of clones that swarm players in the fight. I love it. And I hate it.</p> <p>One of the things I enjoy about FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">weekly Everdark Sovereign updates</a> is that they go live around 9:00 p.m. on Wednesday nights. Everyone logs into the game, goes about their usual runs, and runs into a brand new boss fight with no idea of what to expect. While it was relatively easy to muddle through recent boss fights with the right builds and the right amount of patience, Everdark Libra has been very different. His second phase begins early in the fight and revolves around summoning mirror images of the players facing him.</p> <p>Sure, okay, a trio of invaders. Straightforward enough. But they’re surprisingly tanky and lethal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpxsrq/solo_guardian_is_unplayable_against_everdark_libra/">especially the Guardians and Wylders</a>. Plus, not long after you defeat them, Libra summons even more. Then he starts pelting the battlefield with madness glyphs and projectiles. An added layer of bullet hell ensues. Confidence borne of dozens of back-to-back wins <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpnmhk/what_the_actual_fuck_just_happened/">immediately shatters</a>. Everyone starts running for their lives. They can barely survive the adds, let alone get chip damage here or there on Libra. Meanwhile, cryptic text keeps flashing across the screen as Libra performs different rituals. What does it mean? Oops, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpznvt/whole_village_chasing_our_revenant_we_are_truly/">you’re already dead</a>!</p>

   <p>What makes this whole ordeal exhilarating instead of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpp0z5/turning_the_best_boss_in_nightreign_into_a_summon/">just a cheap summon gimmick</a> is that there’s a method to the madness. It just requires you to approach the first couple of times fighting Everdark Libra like a researcher. It trains you to watch the battlefield carefully, analyzing cause and effect, poking and prodding his attack patterns for underlying vulnerabilities that can be exploited. You can feel the chaos change in real time if you’re a consummate lurker on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit.</p> <p>So what’s actually going on in the fight? Players have been trained to mostly eschew Libra’s “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ld9fg7/libras_deals_cheatsheet/">deals</a>” that give powerful buffs with unique and, in many cases, severe drawbacks. He offers them in the field during regular playthroughs and right before the beginning of his boss fight. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpp5cb/enhanced_libra_gimmicks_explained/">In the Everdark version, however, he also starts enforcing</a> them in the middle of the fight, whether you like it or not. You might get infinite flask heals that decrease your level each time or the passive frenzied fire attacks that also build up your own madness meter.</p> <p>Success in the fight requires constant awareness of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpojrc/all_of_everdark_libras_new_effects/">which rituals are in effect</a>. “Preaches Madness” imbues all attacks with madness, which can be used to break Libra as well (madness is one of his weaknesses). NPCs can get summoned almost every minute, but “Incites a Riot” will lead them to start fighting one another or even attack Libra. The longer into the fight you get, the more all of these effects begin stacking. And that’s before Libra uses one of his attacks to partition the battlefield with lines that punish the player when crossed.</p>

   <p>How do you win? Like in most FromSoftware fights, with a combination of patience and practice, which people with over a hundred hours in <em>Nightreign</em> aren’t accustomed to doing anymore. We’ve mastered the game, after all. We should be able to brute-force through any fight on skill and instincts alone. “You’ll need to completely rewire your brain from standard, rushed play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mq4bwu/heres_how_to_beat_libra_patience_and_planning/">one player noted</a> on the subreddit. Everdark Libra isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. This also requires players to approach how they normally do their daytime runs differently. More focus on stamina and buffs that help with swarms of enemies rather than upgrades aimed at bursting down a single target as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpw4xr/peak_chaos_thoughts/">are split</a> on whether the whole thing is genius or junk. Some love all of the complex moving pieces colliding into one frantic mess. Others hate fighting NPCs. “I want to fight Libra,” wrote one fan. “Not clones. I want a crazy grand attack. Not whatever that wet fart was.” I can sympathize! My favorite <em>Nightreign</em> fights by far are the ones that focus almost exclusively on the nuts and bolts of managing enemy aggro and frame-perfect dodging. The original Libra fight and Everdark Gaping Jaw both excelled at that.</p> <p>Eventually, winning those fights felt great, even if getting up to that point was sometimes a frustrating slog against my own limits. Everdark Libra is the opposite. Defeating him won’t feel like overcoming some great obstacle. But the experience of “solving” the fight and trying to find a way through all of the chaos more than makes up for it.</p>

              <p>Stephen King adaptations have been hot TV property for much of the last decade. From <em>Castle Rock</em> to&nbsp;<em>11.22.63</em>, from <em>Mr. Mercedes</em> to this October’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-pennywise-hbo-max-1851787189"><em>It: Welcome to Derry</em></a>, where King’s novels and short stories once made for notoriously terrible television, they’re now very often essential viewing. OK, there’s still a&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-institute-stephen-king-tv-series-mgm-from-lost-1851786460"><em>The Institute</em></a> here and there, but with the incredible Mike Flanagan working on a series based on&nbsp;<em>Carrie</em>, and maintaining that he’s developing&nbsp;<em>The Dark Tower</em>, things for King fans remain pretty great. But we’re never satisfied, so we’ve pulled together all the Stephen King stories we still want to see adapted as premium TV series.</p> <p>While cinematic outings could be astonishing hits (<em>Carrie</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Shining</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stand By Me</em>,&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, <em>The Shawshank</em> <em>Redemption</em>, <em>The Green Mile</em>), unbearable misses (<em>Silver Bullet</em>, <em>Needful Things</em>, <em>Maximum Overdrive</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Mangler</em>,&nbsp;<em>Secret Window</em>, <em>Dreamcatcher</em>), or just perfect nonsense (<em>The Running Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pet Sematary</em>,&nbsp;<em>Creepshow</em>), TV adaptations often made for cringy viewing. If you’ve suffered through 1994’s <em>The Stand</em> or 1995’s&nbsp;<em>The Langoliers</em>, you’ve seen bad things, but they’re nothing compared to&nbsp;2013’s&nbsp;<em>Under the Dome</em>. I have a massive soft spot for 2004’s lunatic <em>Kingdom Hospital </em>(although this was King’s reinterpretation of a Danish show by Lars von Trier), and adored the light-hearted first four seasons of <em>Haven&nbsp;</em>(except that was barely based on&nbsp;<em>The Colorado Kid</em> in the first place), but it’s only in the last ten or so years that King’s work has made for prestige TV.</p> <p>Recently we’ve had Brendan Gleeson and Justine Lupe in <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>, (unfortunately) James Franco and Sarah Gadon in <em>11.22.63</em>, Sissy Spacek and Lizzy Caplan in <em>Castle Rock</em>, and Jason Bateman and Cynthia Erivo in <em>The Outsider</em>, and they’ve all been incredible.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile Mike Flanagan, responsible for Netflix’s extraordinary run of one-and-done horror series like <em>Midnight Mass</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Fall of the House of Usher</em>, is seemingly on a one-man mission to adapt all of Stephen King. He’s already made movies of&nbsp;<em>Gerald’s Game</em> (superb but very tough viewing), <em>Doctor Sleep</em> (a somewhat muddled&nbsp;<em>Shining</em> sequel, struggling under its own attempts to evoke Kubrick), and the critically acclaimed <em>The Life of Chuck</em>, and keeps promising he’s about to make&nbsp;<em>The Dark Tower</em>. What he’s definitely doing next is a TV version of&nbsp;<em>Carrie</em>, due in 2026, and while it will almost certainly be excellent (he’s yet to have a TV show that isn’t), it’s surely the least essential work to adapt, given Brian De Palma’s 1976 version is already one of the greatest movies ever made.</p> <p>So what should have been a bigger priority? Which are the Stephen King stories that we want to see as prestige TV? Here’s our top five.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617807" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617807"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617807">© Hodder &amp; Stoughton</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em></h2> <p>While I’m very much looking forward to&nbsp;<em>It: Welcome to Derry</em>, I confess to being a bit disappointed that the title gained that preceding “<em>It</em>” at a certain point during its development. I had really been hoping for a more general exploration of the town that was also the setting for <em>Insomnia</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pet Sematary</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Tommyknockers</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bag of Bones</em> (partly) and so many other stories. Like&nbsp;<em>Castle Rock</em>, I was expecting a more general flavor, a town with the potential for so many other supernatural events. Instead, we’re getting four planned seasons, each set 27 years earlier than the events in the most recent movies, for each of Pennywise’s previous feasting sessions. So, given that role I’d hoped for isn’t being fulfilled, I propose <em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em>.</p>

 <p>Salem’s Lot, as the locals call it, is a place best known for the book and multiple adaptations of its vampire story, most recently HBO Max’s very poor effort last year. But it’s also had a prequel and a sequel set in town in the form of short stories <em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em> (which was the basis for <em>Chapelwaite</em>) and <em>One for the Road</em>. It also gets mentioned in so many other books like&nbsp;<em>The Shining</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Dead Zone</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dolores Claiborne</em> and even multiple&nbsp;<em>Dark Tower</em> books. The point is, it’s a place ripe for an anthology show, and while it would clearly have to center on vampires, it wouldn’t need to be only that. The main book had a wealth of characters, certainly enough to support a few seasons of development, and it’d be great to see a 2020s take on the tale. Also, in my ultimate King TV Universe (KTU), it would be an excellent hub show for characters from other outings to pass through.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617806" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617806"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617806">© Hodder &amp; Stoughton</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Needful Things</em></h2> <p>Honestly, I can’t think of a more perfect Stephen King novel to turn into television. Well, apart from&nbsp;<em>The Dead Zone</em>, but someone already did that.&nbsp;<em>Needful Things</em> tells the tale of a shopkeeper, Leland Gaunt, who moves to Castle Rock to open his peculiar boutique of antiques and obscurities. He’s got something in stock that’s just perfect for every person in town. Strangely, however, Gaunt doesn’t way money as payment, but instead peculiar favors.</p>

 <p>Like so many of King’s books,&nbsp;<em>Needful Things</em> is less about the Bogey Man and his Evil Shop, and much more about a town of characters and their relationships in the face of turmoil. His Castle Rock books always excel in this way, creating characters to deeply love and viscerally loathe, and then when events unfurl, they&nbsp;<em>really</em> matter. And that’s partly why it made for such an awful movie, despite starring Ed Harris as the adored (in the novels) sheriff Alan Pangborn. (The best thing about that film is that it was directed by Fraser C. Heston, who played the baby Moses in Cecil B. DeMille’s <em>The Ten Commandments</em>.) But it’s also why it would work so well as a TV show.</p> <p>Each week we can focus on a different character, their interaction with Gaunt, the implications of their “purchase,” and how it affects their relationships with everyone else. As his evil machinations unfold, the season builds up more and more calamity, with ever more people being drawn into the mire. As it goes on, we then get to watch the band of those looking to fight back, to combat their nemesis, and should it all click into place as gloriously as I think it could, you need not have Gaunt flee the town but rather stay on with a new plan.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617805" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617805"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617805">© Hodder &amp; Stoughton</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>The Eyes of the Dragon</em></h2> <p>This would be such an interesting series to make, firstly because it’s King’s first foray into hardcore fantasy writing, and secondly because many characters appear in vaguely different guises in the other novels. There’s a King Roland of Delain (both <em>Dark Tower</em> references), an evil wizard called Flagg (<em>The Stand</em>&nbsp;and <em>Dark Tower</em>), and the witch Rhiannon (<em>Wizards and Glass</em>). This epic fantasy tale would make so much sense in a post-<em>Game of Thrones</em> world, especially when Amazon keeps trying to adapt wildly too big stories like <em>Wheel of Time</em>–this is just one novel, albeit an enormous one.</p> <p>There have been three failed attempts to adapt this novel, starting in the late ’90s with a movie that never reached production, followed by an abandoned 2012 attempt by Syfy, and an equally unsuccessful attempt by Hulu in 2019. It seems to come down to budget each time, but that’s not a concern for the likes of Amazon or Apple TV–it feels like an odd miss not to grab it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617804" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617804"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617804">© Hodder &amp; Stoughton</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Rose Madder</em></h2> <p>I feel like&nbsp;<em>Rose Madder</em> would have been such a disastrous book for any TV network to try to develop at any point in the past, but perhaps now is the right moment. This story of a physically abused woman’s escape from her cop husband is gut-wrenching and incredibly powerful, then made far more complex by its eventual twisting into magical realism. It’s fascinating that despite every short story, lengthy answerphone message and dropped Post-It Note of King’s seemingly getting made into a movie, no one’s touched <em>Rose Madder</em> in the 30 years since it published. Apparently HBO optioned it in 1996 for a TV movie, and in 2011 <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/518441/stephen-king-rose-madder-set-screen/">it was reported</a> that a script had been written and was due to be made by Grosvenor Park, but that never happened either. And good, because there’s far too much here for a film—such an adaptation could only be crass in trying to condense the establishing of Rose’s need to escape and the real danger she’s in with a story that eventually involves magical paintings and symbolic metamorphosis.</p> <p>But as a mini-series, this could be incredible. The time feels very right for a story that explores police violence, and Rose’s story contains so much hope and beauty in the face of violence and fear. With care, precision, and enough time, the peculiarities of this story would have room to play out as the spectacular metaphor they are. I say HBO should give it another go.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617803" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617803"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617803">© Hard Case Crime</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Joyland</em></h2> <p>One of my all-time favorite Stephen King novels (my favorite, since you asked, is&nbsp;<em>Insomnia</em>, but no one should ever try to make that into a TV show!) is&nbsp;<em>Joyland</em>, a 2013 book written by King for the pulp crime publisher Titan Books. As such, and I won’t say either way, you’re never sure if it’s a straight crime story or whether it will have a supernatural twist.</p>

 <p>To me this feels like perfect Mike Flanagan material. He’s proven he can do the goriest horror, and the lightest positivity, but most of all, he’s proven he has a knack for stories that really care about their characters. This is a story of a young guy getting a summer job at a fairground, then staying on during its closed winter season to investigate a series of murders. There’s no potential for a second season here, but this book is so calm and thoughtful, with a great mystery at its core, that it’d make for a compelling mini-series.</p> <p>The only attempt to adapt it was by Freeform in 2018, but nothing’s ever come of it. And good, because no, not Freeform. Netflix for this one I reckon.</p>

              <p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof">a wide-ranging discussion over the state of the games industry</a>,&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em> spoke to former Sony Worldwide Studios chairman Shawn Layden, during which his pet hate-topic of Game Pass came up. Layden, who <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017">loves nothing more</a> than to <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069">profess doom</a> for <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-duty-gta-vi-halo-1850391113">video games</a>, implied that Game Pass profits could be the result of “financial jiggery-pokery,” then said that developing a game for the subscription service makes developers a “wage slave.”</p> <p>Layden has being laying into Game Pass for&nbsp;<em>years</em>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-consolidation-is-the-enemy-of-diversity">repeatedly criticizing the subscription model</a>. Noting <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-duty-gta-vi-halo-1850391113">ballooning development costs</a> and questioning <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-shawn-layden-console-exclusive-1851325009">whether console exclusives are a good thing</a> in the first place, since leaving Sony in 2021 Layden is routinely wheeled out for a good ol’ gripe. But he’s arguably gone further than ever in his latest round of comments.</p> <p>“They’re not creating value,” said Layden to&nbsp;<em>GI</em> of developers whose games release day-one on Game Pass, continuing that they’re not “putting it in the marketplace, hoping it explodes, and profit sharing, and overages, and all that nice stuff. It’s just, ‘You pay me X dollars an hour, I built you a game, here, go put it on your servers.'” He then described this process as being a “wage slave.”</p>

 <p>“I don’t think it’s really inspiring for game developers,” he added.</p> <p>This odd outburst was all said out of his concern for the health of developers. Appearing to dismiss <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profit-revenue-5-billion-1851787391">Microsoft’s recent announcement that Game Pass has made $5 billion in the last year</a>, Layden scoffed, “You can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable if you wanted to.” He went on, “You take enough costs out and say that’s off the balance sheet and, oh look, it’s profitable now. The real issue for me on things like Game Pass is, is it healthy for the developer?”</p> <p>What blows my mind about this is just how unlikely “all that nice stuff” actually is for so many game developers, facing the terrible gamble of pouring their blood, sweat, and tears into a game that may not actually find an audience, all without any sense of stability or security. In Layden’s idyllic version of events, all the profit sharing and overages all come right after the “hoping it explodes,” the direct equivalent of <em>South Park</em>‘s Underpants Gnomes’ Phase 2 in their profit-making scheme. And for every developer who’s faced the situation where that hope isn’t fulfilled, for the dozens of teams and studios that collapse every year after a game doesn’t hit, they would have given their arm to have had a stronger wage to support them in the aftermath.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Make Profit By Stealing Underpants - SOUTH PARK" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a5ih_TQWqCA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The comments are also tone-deaf given…the vast majority of people live off wages! It’s not some abhorrent anomaly, this terrible affront faced by game developers pushed into the miserable situation of having a company pay them up front for their game’s development costs—it’s how most of the world exists. I, right now, am paid for writing <em>this&nbsp;</em>article. I get no profit from its success on the site. And while it sure sounds nice that if a post of mine went huge I’d get a nice extra bundle of cash, I’ll stick with getting paid for my time and effort for all the times they don’t. It’s entirely normal, and in fact often incredibly secure, to get paid for the hours you’re working, not gamble your time against some future pay-off that may never come.</p> <p>Many developers have reported how being hosted on Game Pass has allowed them to stay in business—<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/xbox/with-game-pass-price-hikes-sparking-debate-indie-developers-are-rising-up-to-remind-us-how-vital-the-xbox-subscription-can-be-to-the-tune-of-staggering-numbers/"><em>GamesRadar</em> reported last year</a> how important the service has been to many indie developers. That’s not to say that it’s a pure force for good, because of course it’s not, and there’s obviously huge debate to be had about whether appearing on Game Pass could sometimes cause a game to ultimately lose out on far greater sales had it stuck to the traditional model. But even this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449">a company as big as Remedy made it absolutely clear</a> that the&nbsp;<em>only</em> significant revenue it’s seen so far from <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> has come as a result of day-one Game Pass and PS Plus deals. The idiotic wage slaves.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617753" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617753"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617753">© Remedy</figcaption></figure> <p>This idea that all creativity has to begin in a platonic fervor, then perhaps be bestowed with riches upon its culture-changing success, is the poetic disguise of the worst of capitalism. It says to all creatives, “Don’t settle for a wage, work for less, and if you’re lucky we’ll pay you later.” Yes, he’s arguing that in his ideal world, these developers not only get paid by the magic sky fairies that fund all game development, but also recoup the winnings after their game becomes a massive hit. But that’s not the reality in this industry, and implying that those who opt for security today over the slight possibility of riches later are in some way not being “healthy” just seems foolish. And note that it’s (always) being said by someone who is paid a <em>vast</em> salary for their time, and then receives bonuses, dividends, stock windfalls and so much more on top.</p> <p>Look, I’d love to set humanity free of the need for wages. Obviously universal income should be brought in immediately. I also want to see creatives return to the patron model that drove the creation of art for a thousand years before copyright bullshit broke everything. But these are currently dreams for which we should fight. In the meantime, I kind of like the idea that game developers should embrace the notion that their time and talent is enormously valuable, and they should be fully and properly compensated for their efforts at the time they’re being put in. Yes, definitely give them far more money later should their work become hugely successful and generate vast profits, but that should never be the only model by which they are compensated. For so many teams, it’s vanishingly unlikely. Even if that, for fucks sake, makes them “wage slaves.”</p>
