              <p>Budget earbuds often disappoint with tinny sound and uncomfortable fits, leaving people wondering if they should have spent more on premium brands. The Soundcore P20i by Anker changes that calculus entirely, delivering features and sound quality that rival earbuds costing ten times more while earning an impressive 4.4-star rating from nearly 80,000 reviews. Amazon has slashed the price from $39 to just $19, hitting an all-time low that makes these earbuds an absolute steal for anyone who needs reliable wireless audio without breaking the bank. This deal has already attracted over 10,000 buyers in the past month alone, speaking to the value proposition these earbuds represent.</p>

<h2>Oversized Drivers Deliver Surprising Bass Performance</h2>
<p>The 10mm drivers in these compact earbuds outperform expectations and <strong>deliver bass that rivals earbuds priced at $100 or more</strong>. The size of the drivers affects bass reproduction because larger diaphragms move more air and it creates low-frequency sounds that make music feel immersive instead of flat. The larger drivers follow the 16-ohm impedance specification for efficient power use. The sound signature highlights bass without drowning out mids and highs: You get a satisfying thump in hip-hop and electronic music, while vocals remain clear and instruments distinct. <strong>Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity provides stable audio transmission</strong> with minimal delay and prevents annoying audio-video sync issues that come with cheaper wireless earbuds.</p>



<p>The Soundcore app takes these earbuds from good to exceptional: <strong>It includes 22 preset EQ profiles</strong> designed for various music genres and listening preferences. Presets for rock, classical, jazz, podcasts and bass boost adjust frequency response to enhance sound for different types of content. You can customize tap gestures to control functions, such as skipping tracks, adjusting volume or activating voice assistants based on how you like to use them.</p>
<p>Battery performance is impressive as it offers <strong>10 hours of continuous playback on a single charge</strong> which is enough for multiple workdays or long flights without needing the case. The<strong> charging case extends total playtime to 30 hours</strong>, and gives you nearly a week of typical use before you have to charge it again. Fast charging technology provides 2 hours of listening from just 10 minutes in the case which is helpful if you forgot to charge overnight.</p>



<p>The compact design, complete with an attached lanyard, makes these earbuds extremely portable: They are <strong>small enough to fit in pockets or clip onto bags and keys</strong> without taking up much space. Their lightweight design keeps you comfortable even during extended use and prevents ear fatigue that heavier earbuds can cause. Water resistance protects against sweat during workouts and light rain while commuting but they are not rated for swimming or heavy water exposure.</p>
<p>Call quality is enhanced by <strong>dual microphones that work with AI to isolate your voice from background noise</strong> in phone conversations. The system filters out distracting sounds, such as traffic, wind, or office chatter, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly. This AI processing occurs in real-time without creating the robotic voice quality typical of simpler noise reduction systems. The microphone placement captures your voice naturally while minimizing wind noise during outdoor calls.</p>
<p>At $19, this is one of the best deals you can get.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-is-dumping-its-512gb-microsd-memory-card-now-selling-for-mere-pennies-on-the-dollar.1338880/</guid>

              <p>Running out of storage space on your phone, Nintendo Switch, or camera creates that frustrating moment where you have to delete old memories to capture new ones. MicroSD cards solve this problem by expanding your device’s capacity and let you hoard thousands of photos or hours of 4K video without compromise.</p>
<p>The Samsung EVO Select with 512GB capacity provides enough room for approximately 124,000 photos or 60 hours of 4K footage, essentially future-proofing your device against storage anxiety. And Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/">just dropped the price from $46 to just $37, hitting a new all-time low</a> just before Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed Meets Capacity for Real-World Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>160 MB/s read speed makes file transfers fast and smooth</strong>: Copying a full 4K movie to your card takes less than a minute, unlike slower cards that can take five to ten minutes. Good news is, <strong>write speeds match the demands of continuous 4K video recording</strong>. This prevents dropped frames and stuttering that can ruin important footage when slower cards can’t keep up with the data. The UHS-I interface offers the bandwidth these speeds need and connects through the standard microSD slot found in nearly all modern devices.</p>



<p>The A2 application performance class means <strong>this card can run apps and games directly from its storage:</strong> This avoids the lag that older microSD standards often had. The rating shows minimum random read speeds of 4000 IOPS and write speeds of 2000 IOPS, which results in quick app launches and smooth gameplay on devices like the Nintendo Switch. Games load faster, transitions between levels are smooth, and you bypass the frustrating delays that come from using slower storage.</p>



<p>The i<strong>ncluded SD adapter increases compatibility</strong>: It works with laptops, desktop card readers, cameras and the original Nintendo Switch dock. This simple adapter <strong>changes the tiny microSD size to standard SD</strong> so you don’t need to buy separate adapters or search for specific readers. You can easily insert the card into your computer’s SD slot to transfer files without needing cables or wireless connections that use up battery.</p>
<p>Samsung’s six-proof protection guards <strong>against water, extreme temperatures, X-rays, magnets, drops, and wear from repeated insertion and removal</strong>. These durability features mean the card can survive an accidental trip through the washing machine, withstand desert heat or winter cold outdoors, and pass through airport security scanners without corrupting data. The <strong>10-year limited warranty</strong> supports these protection claims with reliable manufacturer backing that goes beyond standard consumer electronics coverage</p>
<p>At $37, the card costs about seven cents per gigabyte, which is great value for Samsung’s premium EVO Select line.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build-2000640003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build.1338877/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO Architecture sets rarely go on sale which makes this London Skyline deal something special. The 4.8-star rating (across more than 13,000 reviews) speaks to the quality and satisfaction <strong>this 468-piece set</strong> delivers to builders who want an iconic city skyline on their desk or shelf. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/">has dropped the price from $39 to just $31, which marks an all-time low</a> that won’t last long given how quickly these sets disappear during promotional windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Iconic Landmarks Come Together in Miniature Form</h2>
<p>The set captures<strong> five of London’s most recognizable structures</strong> in carefully scaled brick form. It starts with the National Gallery’s neoclassical facade which anchors Trafalgar Square, then Nelson’s Column rises with its distinctive proportions (honoring the admiral who secured British naval dominance at Trafalgar in 1805). The London Eye appears as a functional rotating observation wheel made from transparent and gray elements that showcase its modern engineering style. Big Ben’s clock tower displays the Gothic Revival architecture that makes it easily recognizable in photographs and films worldwide. Last but not least, Tower Bridge completes the collection with its twin towers and suspended walkways.</p>



<p>The Thames river flows through the scene, and uses transparent blue baseplate tiles to create a convincing water effect beneath the landmarks. This smart design choice grounds the buildings in their geographic setting while adding visual depth to the display. The transparent elements catch and reflect light in various ways throughout the day. This gives the model a dynamic quality that shifts with your viewing angle and the ambient light. The <strong>baseplate measures about 11 inches wide</strong> and provides a stable foundation that keeps all elements securely connected during transport or dusting.</p>



<p>The<strong> set includes 468 pieces</strong> and hits the sweet spot between being challenging enough to feel rewarding and manageable enough to complete in one satisfying evening or weekend session. LEGO Architecture sets differ from standard LEGO builds by focusing on architectural accuracy and the proportions between structures rather than play features: Each landmark uses specialized pieces and smart building techniques to replicate distinctive architectural elements at this smaller scale.</p>
<p>Display potential makes this set especially appealing for offices, home libraries or anywhere you want decor that sparks conversation and reflects sophisticated interests. The monochromatic color scheme, using mainly gray, black, and tan bricks, creates a cohesive look that appears professional rather than toy-like in adult spaces. Its compact size means it fits on crowded bookshelves, desks, or window sills without overpowering the area.</p>
<p>The <strong>recommended age of 12 and up</strong> reflects the patience and fine motor skills needed for smaller pieces and detailed assembly steps. However, younger builders with LEGO experience can succeed with adult guidance. This set makes an excellent gift for Anglophiles, architecture enthusiasts, travel lovers reminiscing about London visits.</p>
<p>At $31, it offers great value given the piece count, display quality, and lasting appeal of the Architecture series.</p>

              <p>Smart lighting transforms how you experience your home, <strong>turning ordinary rooms into spaces that adapt to your mood, schedule, and activities</strong> with just a tap or voice command. The<em> Philips Hue</em> starter kit delivers this transformation in minutes and requires nothing more than screwing in bulbs and plugging in the bridge to unlock millions of colors and automated lighting scenes. This bundle includes the <strong>essential Hue brige and two 60W A19 color-changing bulbs</strong> that work in standard E26 fixtures throughout your house. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/">has slashed the price from $142 to just $99 for early Black Friday</a>, which marks a new all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Bridge Makes Everything Possible</h2>
<p>The Hue bridge acts as <strong>the main hub for your smart lighting system</strong>: It connects your bulbs to your home network and offers features that standard Bluetooth bulbs can’t. This hub creates a special Zigbee network and keeps your smart lights responsive without slowing down your Wi-Fi or hurting connection quality. The bridge also allows for automations: You can set your lights to turn on before you wake up or turn off automatically when you leave home.</p>



<p>The two included A19 bulbs deliver 800 lumens each: This provides <strong>brightness similar to traditional 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong> while using much less energy. These <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs cover a range from warm candlelight tones at around 2000K to cool daylight at 6500K,<strong> plus offer access to 16 million colors for fun lighting effects</strong>. The <strong>E26 base fits standard lamp sockets</strong> and ceiling fixtures: You can install them in table lamps, floor lamps, or overhead lights without needing adapters. Dimming is smooth through the app or voice commands, and gives you fine control over brightness levels that wall switches can’t achieve.</p>



<p>Preset scenes take the hassle out of choosing colors: They provide <strong>ready-made lighting combinations tailored for different activities and moods</strong>. The 24-hour natural light scene mimics the sun’s movement throughout the day. It begins with energizing cool tones in the morning and shifts to calming warm hues as evening approaches. <em>Focus</em> modes provide bright, clear lighting to help you concentrate during work hours, while reading scenes offer comfortable light that reduces eye strain. <em>Relaxation</em> and sleep scenes gradually dim to warm amber tones, signaling to your body that it’s time to unwind.</p>
<p>Voice control with Alexa and Google Assistant lets you <strong>adjust your lights without reaching for your phone</strong> or getting off the couch. Simple commands like <em>“turn on the living room lights”</em> or <em>“set bedroom to 50 percent”</em> become routine after a few days. The Hue app guides you through setting up voice control with easy instructions that take only a few minutes. You can also create custom voice commands for specific scenes, like saying <em>“movie time”</em> to automatically dim your lights to theater mode.</p>
<p>At $99, this starter kit is an easy way to enter the Philips Hue ecosystem. It provides everything you need to experience smart lighting in two rooms right out of the box.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Those tiny 20W chargers work fine for a single phone but they crumble under the weight of modern device ecosystems where laptops, tablets, and phones all need power simultaneously. The <strong>Anker Prime Charger delivers a massive 160W across three USB-C ports</strong> while staying roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and solves the cable chaos and outlet shortage that plagues anyone who travels with multiple devices. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/">early Black Friday deal drops the price from $149 to $109, hitting an all-time low for Anker’s most advanced charging technology</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GaN Technology Packs Professional Power Into Pocket Size</h2>
<p>Gallium Nitride technology allows this charger to deliver 1.35W per cubic centimeter of power density. This <strong>figure explains how Anker fits 160W into a size that easily fits in your hand</strong>: Traditional silicon-based chargers would have to be three times larger to provide the same power.</p>
<p>The compact design lets you slip this charger into a side pocket of your laptop bag without the bulk of carrying multiple chargers. <strong>Three USB-C ports eliminate the hassle of managing adapters</strong> for those who need to charge a laptop, phone and tablet at the same time.</p>



<p>The <strong>140W single-port output provides steady power</strong> without reducing speed: This means your laptop charges quickly even when other devices are plugged into the other ports. This feature is crucial during work sessions when you need your MacBook Pro charged up fast before a meeting or flight. Anker claims <strong>you can charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from empty to 50 percent in just 25 minutes</strong>. Any of the three ports can deliver the full 140W so you won’t have to remember which port is the fastest or worry about plugging into the wrong one. The <strong>charger automatically adjusts power distribution based on the devices connected</strong>&nbsp;so that each one gets the right amount of current without manual adjustments.</p>



<p>The <em>AnkerSense View</em> display <strong>shows real-time wattage for each port</strong>, and allows you to see exactly how much power each device gets at any time. Touch controls on the charger allow you to switch modes instantly between different power distribution settings based on your needs. Bluetooth connectivity links the charger to Anker’s mobile app which offers custom charging modes you can set up for specific device combinations you use often.</p>
<p>Build quality reflects Anker’s reputation for durable charging gear: The sturdy port construction can withstand repeated plugging and unplugging for years of daily use. The 24-month warranty provides solid support coverage and protects your investment. Foldable prongs keep the charger compact during transport and shield the plug from damage in bags. The charger is <strong>compatible with any USB-C device</strong>&nbsp;including MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, Android phones, Steam Decks, Nintendo Switches, and many other gadgets that charge via USB-C.</p>
<p>At $109, this Anker charger is cheaper than buying three separate charging blocks while providing better power density and smart features.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming on the go has always meant compromising on screen quality or lugging around bulky equipment, but portable monitors have changed that equation completely. The KYY 15.6-inch portable display solves a real problem for console gamers who want to play their Switch, PlayStation, or Xbox anywhere without hunting for an available TV. This compact screen transforms your gaming setup into something truly mobile, turning hotel rooms, friends’ houses, or even your backyard into viable gaming spaces. Amazon has dropped the price from $99 to just $69, hitting an all-time low that makes this accessory almost too good to pass up for serious gamers who value flexibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Gaming Fits in Your Backpack</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel provides a 1920×1080 resolution</strong> with a 178-degree viewing angle: This keeps colors true, even when watching from the side. HDR technology adds depth to darker scenes and prevents bright areas from losing details which is important during intense gaming sessions. The screen measures 8.8 inches tall and 14.2 inches wide, and gives you plenty of space for immersive gameplay without the bulk of a traditional monitor. <strong>Blue light reduction and flicker-free operation</strong> allow for hours of gaming without the eye strain often caused by cheaper displays. This IPS technology ensures consistent color accuracy across the entire screen.</p>



<p>Connectivity meets all your needs with <strong>two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini-HDMI port</strong>. The USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 3 and 3.1, and allows you to power the monitor and send video through one cable from compatible laptops or phones. Your Switch connects directly through USB-C for a clean setup with minimal cable clutter. The HDMI port works with the PS4, Xbox and older devices that lack USB-C outputs. The one-cable solution avoids the hassle of carrying multiple adapters and dealing with complex setups when you just want to plug in and play.<strong> Two built-in stereo speakers and a 3.5mm audio jack</strong> give you sound output options based on your environment and preferences.</p>



<p>The <strong>ultra-slim 0.3-inch profile and 1.7-pound weight</strong> make this monitor very portable: It fits easily into laptop bags or backpacks without adding noticeable bulk. The included smart cover serves as both a protective shell and an adjustable stand. It has two grooves that let you choose your preferred viewing angle. The PU leather exterior resists scratches and bumps during transport, and the frameless magnetic design keeps everything secure without clunky clasps or zippers.</p>
<p>The monitor works in <strong>both landscape and portrait orientations</strong>: This opens up fun possibilities beyond gaming, like reading documents, browsing social media on your phone’s extended screen, or watching movies in different aspect ratios. The premium gray metal finish looks professional enough for work presentations while still keeping the gaming aesthetic that console players enjoy. A simple menu control wheel on the side allows you to adjust brightness, contrast and other settings without navigating complicated on-screen menus.</p>
<p>At $69, this portable monitor costs less than many wired controllers and greatly expands where and how you can enjoy your console games. The $30 discount turns this affordable accessory into an impulse purchase that pays off each time you want to game away from your main TV.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-offloads-surface-pro-512gb-ssd-x-plus-at-a-new-low-black-friday-starts-early-2000639973</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-offloads-surface-pro-512gb-ssd-x-plus-at-a-new-low-black-friday-starts-early.1338781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The laptop versus tablet debate has frustrated professionals for years, forcing compromises between portability and productivity that never quite satisfy either need. Microsoft’s Surface Pro eliminates that choice by delivering a fantastic <strong>2-in-1 device that excels as both a full-powered Windows laptop and a sleek tablet</strong> you can hold with one hand.</p>
<p>Early Black Friday deals have hit the entire Surface Pro lineup hard with discounts ranging from 20 to 30% across all configurations including LCD and OLED displays, Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors, and every storage and RAM combination. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5092/">particular model with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage has dropped from $1,199 to $949</a>, which marks an all-time low for Microsoft’s latest Copilot+ PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5092/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Snapdragon Revolution Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon X Plus processor with 10 cores</strong> marks a major change in Windows computing: It offers performance that competes with Apple’s M3 chip while using less power. This ARM-based design runs cooler and more efficiently than traditional Intel or AMD processors. It <strong>leads to a 14-hour battery life</strong>&nbsp;which makes all-day work sessions feasible without searching for outlets.</p>
<p>The integrated NPU processes AI tasks locally on your device: It <strong>handles Copilot+ features without sending your data to the cloud,</strong> and keeps your information private and providing quick responses. Native ARM apps perform well and Microsoft’s updated emulation layer ensures that most x86 Windows software runs smoothly even if it hasn’t been recompiled. With 16GB of RAM, you can multitask easily across many browser tabs, multiple Office documents, and background apps.</p>



<p>The 1<strong>3-inch touchscreen boasts sharp 2880 x 1920 resolution</strong> at a comfortable 3:2 aspect ratio which shows more vertical content than typical 16:9 laptop displays. This extra height is important for reading documents, browsing the internet or working in spreadsheets as vertical space determines how much information is visible without scrolling. The display <strong>allows for use with the Surface Pen</strong> which is great for drawing, note-taking, and precise editing tasks.</p>

              <p>Gaming has evolved into a visual spectacle where every frame matters and your graphics card is the engine that powers those immersive experiences. The Asus TUF gaming <strong>GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</strong> brings professional-grade performance to your setup, and right now, early Black Friday deals are making this powerhouse more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4923/">has slashed the price from $999 to $849 which marks an all-time low</a> for this recently launched GPU that’s built on <strong>Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell architecture</strong>. This is your chance to future-proof your gaming rig with 16GB of blazing-fast GDDR7 memory and DLSS 4 technology that transforms how games look and perform.</p>

<h2>The Blackwell Revolution Comes to Your Desktop</h2>
<p><strong>Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture</strong> marks a real advancement in graphics processing. The <strong>RTX 5070 Ti uses that power with 16GB of GDDR7 memory</strong>&nbsp;which provides the bandwidth that modern games need. <strong>DLSS 4 revolutionizes gaming</strong> by using AI to generate frames intelligently. This allows you to increase ray tracing settings without seeing a drop in frame rates. The card runs at 2588 MHz in default mode and can reach 2610 MHz in OC mode. This gives you extra performance when you need it. These <strong>specs translate to smooth 1440p gaming at ultra settings and good 4K performance</strong> in most games.</p>
<p>Asus put a lot of thought into the <strong>cooling solution</strong>: They designed a 3.125-slot card with three Axial-tech fans that move a lot of air through a large fin array. The phase-change GPU thermal pad is a smart engineering choice. It lasts longer than regular thermal paste and keeps temperatures optimal, even during long gaming sessions that push the card hard. This design keeps your GPU cool and quiet, and avoid the loud noises that cheaper cards make under load. The extra slot width may seem like a compromise, but it is really an investment in durability. Cooler components last longer and maintain their performance over the years.</p>



<p>Durability is a priority with military-grade components that provide solid power delivery and a longer lifespan compared to standard designs: The protective PCB coating offers another layer of <strong>defense against moisture, dust, and debris</strong> that can cause short circuits. These features matter a lot, especially if you’re building a system you want to keep for several years.</p>



<p>Connectivity is also strong, with <strong>PCIe 5.0 support, multiple DisplayPort 2.1 outputs, and HDMI</strong> for maximum flexibility with monitors and VR headsets. The GPU Tweak III software allows you to control performance easily. You can adjust clock speeds, voltages, and fan curves without getting into complicated BIOS settings. Thermal monitoring helps you keep an eye on temperatures in different GPU areas.</p>
<p>At $150 off, this deal is a real value in a market where graphics card prices can often feel unrealistic.</p>
