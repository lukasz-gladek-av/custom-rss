Extraordinarily, so far, no one has died nor even been seriously injured, although millions are being evacuated from coastal areas in Hawaii, California and Japan for fear of incoming tsunamis. A bizarre knock-on effect of this event is that, well, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245?_gl=1*srymw5*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3ODEwNzckbzI3JGcxJHQxNzUzODcwOTA2JGo0NiRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245?_gl=1*srymw5*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3ODEwNzckbzI3JGcxJHQxNzUzODcwOTA2JGo0NiRsMCRoMA..">Duo Expedition for <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a></span> has been delayed.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Given the (literal) magnitude of the earthquake (a massive 8.8), it does seem a little frivolous to be concerned about how it might affect the patching of a popular multiplayer game. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzmkjjj03o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzmkjjj03o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we are in the remarkably fortunate situation</a></span> where—so far at least—there has been no loss of life, nor any significant reports of harm. It’s still possible that large waves could affect a huge number of countries, as far afield as China, New Zealand and Peru, and 13 foot waves have affected parts of Russia. However, even tsunamis have, so far, been minor. Despite this, evacuations are vital, with reports that waves <em>could</em> reach 10 feet in Japan. As such, <em>Elden Ring</em> developers FromSoftware have left their offices and canceled July 31's planned release of Patch 1.02.</p><p>“Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula,” reads FromSoft’s statement, “we have decided to postpone the distribution of the ‘<em>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</em>’ Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST / 1:00 PDT.”</p><p>Duo Mode was due to add the ability to play <em>Nightreign</em> in pairs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981">a feature fans have been begging for since the game’s release</a></span>. The game was launched designed to be played in groups of three, which is an unusual group size for multiplayer gaming, and clearly far harder to pull together than just partnering up. The lack of a two-player mode felt even more strange, though, given you could also play solo. Two days after the game came out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200">a modder created an unofficial two-player option</a></span>, demonstrating it was certainly possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware said at the time</a></span> that not including duos was rather oddly “overlooked during development,” and that the game had only been balanced for three-player play. That was due to change over the next couple of days.</p><p>Patch 1.02 was also going to launch alongside the addition of a second group of the more difficult Everdark Sovereign bosses, with Maris “Augur” Fathom of Night due to be first. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245?_gl=1*2c3yjo*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3ODEwNzckbzI3JGcxJHQxNzUzODcwODY5JGoxMCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-augur-evergaol-everdark-time-1851787245?_gl=1*2c3yjo*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3ODEwNzckbzI3JGcxJHQxNzUzODcwODY5JGoxMCRsMCRoMA..">As Ethan said yesterday</a></span>, what was one of the easier fights in <em>Elden Ring</em> is due to become one of the toughest bosses you can take on in <em>Nightreign</em>, but again, we’ll now have to wait a bit longer to experience this new encounter.</p><p>Obviously there’s no word yet on when the patch will now arrive. FromSoftware are doing the smart thing and keeping themselves safe. That’s clearly the priority far above rolling out a patch, and we wish everyone the very best.</p><p>Same to anyone near a coast in the vast affected portions of Earth today. Stay safe, listen to evacuation orders, and worry about video games later.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-duo-mode-delay-earthquake-1851787291]]></content:encoded>

As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it’s ready.”</p><p>It sounds like well-loved illustrator Sie Nanahara was provided references either by Creatures Inc (the team behind <em>PTCG</em> art) or DeNA (the developers of this app) that included fan-made art, rather than previous official Pokémon artworks. This explanation lifts responsibility from the artist which—as we’d suggested previously—would have been a very surprising move by a very established creator. </p><p>“Immersive cards” are the animated collectibles that appear in every set of the digital card game. They are one of the top selling-points of the app, offering magical cards that play out beautiful animated sequences when clicked on. As a committed player, I’ve collected all of the previous immersive cards (finally got Celestial Guardian’s Solgaleo’s Lillie card yesterday after months of trying), and so know that these being missing from the new set is a pretty big deal for players.</p><p>It also means that replacing them is no easy feat. <em>PTCG Pocket</em> uses a mix of freshly commissioned art and classic cards, and in pretty much any other circumstance could have switched the affected artwork out with anything from the colossal archive. However, given the Ho-Oh and Lugia cards are animated, these will take vastly longer to create, often requiring enormous artworks for the camera to pan around, or complex 3D animations. Neither can be rustled up in an afternoon.</p><p>Unfortunately, the “temporary placeholder” in question is literally just some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lv64qgtsyc2b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lv64qgtsyc2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“coming soon” text</a></span>. When “played” it just shows a black rectangle.</p><p>So far, I’ve not seen any accusations made regarding the Lugia immersive card, although suspect that it’s been removed at the same time as a precaution. While no blame is being placed on the artist, it makes sense to be concerned that the same issues could have arisen for both cards given they came from the same creator.</p><p>The Chinese artist whose work was copied has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a statement</a></span> regarding the issue as well, albeit an ambiguous one, referring to a past commission but not who commissioned the work. “I solely delivered commissioned 2D artwork,” he says in his own translation, “with no involvement in subsequent model production, sales, or profit sharing. This revealed past gaps in copyright awareness.” He added “profound gratitude” that the artwork had been removed.</p><p>The artist responsible for the immersive cards, Sie Nanahara, has yet to make any statements, and hasn’t responded to a request for comment.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290]]></content:encoded>
