This one is called <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> and includes a bunch of new features. It also looks perfectly positioned to once again trick me into thinking I will fall in love with these games. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Revealed during today’s Nintendo Direct, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will hit Switch 1 and Switch 2 on December 4 and tell the story of a world on the brink of collapse that must be rebuilt. Players will still go around collecting party members and grinding through turn-based battles, but this time their own personalized character will be the star of the show. New base-building mechanics will also add some light life management sim aspects to the formula, it seems. </p><p>Most importantly, however, the HD-2D pixel art still looks incredible. Here’s the trailer:</p><p><em>Octopath Traveler </em>should be the prefect series for me. I grew up on 8-bit and 16-bit games. I was obsessed with SNES RPGs. I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, the most direct inspiration for the <em>Octopath games</em>, at least a dozen times. But try as I may, my appreciation, admiration, and respect for the <em>Octopath</em> games has never given way to being truly in love with them. I play a bunch, mostly out of a feeling of duty, and then eventually bounce off. They can be nice JRPG comfort food but never felt like anything more to me. </p><p>  <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is definitely going to be the one to fix that though, I can feel it. This it the one that will convert me into a true believer rather than just a sympathetic skeptic. I will definitely <em>not</em> buy <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>, play it for 10 hours, and then never put the game back in my Switch 2. This time will be different. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will fix me. I can’t wait to order it, gift wrap it, and leave it under the Christmas tree just waiting to not break my heart on Christmas Day. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-trailer-release-date-switch-2-1851787423]]></content:encoded>
