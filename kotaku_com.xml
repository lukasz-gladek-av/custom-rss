              <p>Sony’s chief financial officer has suggested that live-service gaming hasn’t been a&nbsp;<em>complete</em> unmitigated success for PlayStation. With quite some impressive understatement, following a year that saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475">the overwhelming failure of <em>Concord</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">serious delays to Bungie’s&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, CFO Lin Tao told shareholders on a Q&amp;A call following the release of <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-sold-over-80-million-ps5-in-five-years-2000616264">Sony’s latest financial results</a> that “it’s not entirely going smoothly.”</p> <p>She did, however, defend the company’s continued forays into the genre, pointing out that while there have been a few hundreds of millions of dollars <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">hiccups</a>, there have been successes too. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>, acknowledging that “somewhat negative news has been coming out,” Tao pointed out, “if we look at the past five years, five years ago live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. We [now] have <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>MLB The Sho</em>w and&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and&nbsp;Bungie’s&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;2</em>, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner.”</p> <p>Fair play on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. The game is listed in <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">the latest financial report</a> as having sold 12 million copies across PS5 and PC, although is thought to have sold more than 15 million, and is obviously a massive hit. But it’s worth noting that <em>Destiny 2</em> came out eight years ago in 2017 from Activision, for Xbox and PlayStation, and Bungie was only bought by Sony in 2022.&nbsp;<em>MLB The Show</em> comes out with a new edition annually, so makes for an odd “live-service” proposition, and it’s notable that Sony doesn’t include its sales in its report. <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>however, launched in 2022, still receives monthly updates, so that counts.</p>

 <p>Given rumors that&nbsp;<em>Concord</em> cost anywhere from $200 million to $400 million, and possibly made back around $1 million, it does seem like perhaps this doesn’t entirely balance the scales. But Tao makes the argument that this is still a new revenue stream that Sony didn’t have five years back, so it’s not to be sniffed at. “For Q1 the live-service ratio was about 40 percent,” <em>VGC</em> reports she told the call. “For the full year it’s a little less, probably between 20 to 30 percent. So in terms of the transformation, it’s not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years you see that there’s definitely been a change.”</p> <p>Thankfully, Sony isn’t pretending it’s all roses. “Of course, we recognize that there are still many issues,” Tao went on to say, “so we should learn the lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live-service content where there’s less waste and it’s more smooth.”</p> <p>This likely explains the extreme measures taken following&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">extremely badly received alpha</a> in April this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483">not risking another&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>-scale disaster so soon after. The game has since been “indefinitely” delayed, but not before it was met with <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">plagiarism accusations</a>. Sony also <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">cancelled multiple live-service projects earlier this year</a>, further casting doubt on the format as a viable medium.</p> <p>Still, the company seems upbeat about the prospects! And it’s certainly got the money to waste. If only it could figure out a way to do it without causing hundreds of people to lose their jobs.</p>

              <p>Sony’s latest financial results are in, and the PS5 is doing better than anyone expected. Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-best-selling-forza-horizon-elder-scrolls-oblivion-1851787356">a woeful lack of new games</a> exclusive to the PlayStation console, people won’t stop buying the device, with another 2.5 million units bought between April and June 2025. That’s slightly better than it sold during the same period last year, and brings the lifetime total to 80.3 million. <a href="https://in.ign.com/xbox-series-x-1/238086/news/xbox-series-x-and-s-microsoft-has-reportedly-sold-less-than-30-million-consoles-this-generation">Recent rumors</a> have suggested that the Xbox Series may have sold only 30 million in the same time. Awks.</p> <p>Sony had some other big numbers to boast about. The PlayStation Network currently has 123 million “active users,” up seven million since the same time last year. Meanwhile, 65.9 million PS4 and PS5 games were sold in April to June’s Q1 up 12 million on 2024, although it’s notable that only 6.9 million of those were first party titles. Bear in mind that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">Nintendo sold six million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a> alone in a single month, for a brand new console with no previously established user base, and you can see how Sony’s first party numbers look pretty shaky right now. Although given the success of PS Plus and the hefty cut taken for every software sale, it doesn’t seem like people will be too worried.</p> <p>This all means the PS5 is performing pretty much exactly as well as the PS4 and PS3 before it, all of which should make Sony delighted. Those machines sold during times of financial recovery, while the PlayStation 5 launched in the midst of global catastrophe. Covid was at its peak, while supply chain issues and chip shortages meant the machines couldn’t fill shelves until months after the official launch.</p>

 <p>Sony of course has multiple revenue sources, across music, movies and technology, with $17.8 billion in sales across all its divisions in Q1, again, slightly up on last year, movies alone reporting $2.3 billion. But gaming was responsible for over $6.3 billion, making the sector worth almost triple that of movies to the Japanese corporation. Imagine if the mainstream press noticed.</p> <p>These numbers clearly explain <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">Microsoft’s strategy</a> to start releasing its first-party games onto Sony’s console. A base of 80 million potential new customers is more than double its own, and taking advantage of this is <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-ps5-microsoft-xbox-1851786765">already proving extremely successful</a>. Of course Xbox games are going to launch day-one on PlayStation, when its tripling the possible audience.</p>
