              <p><em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> are finally on Switch, bringing a taste of the series’ retro roots to a modern platform for <em>Pokémon</em>‘s 30th anniversary. Millions of fans and newcomers are downloading the game to start a brand new adventure in the Kanto region. They’ll all be faced with the same timelessly perplexing choice: Which starter Pokémon is the best to pick?</p>

 <p>Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle—who should lead your team to catch ’em all and defeat the Elite Four? The answer is whichever one you personally like best. The point of playing <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> is to have fun, not to Excel-spreadsheet the hell out of decade-old Game Boy Advance games. But even so, there may be a little gnawing voice of doubt in the back of your head convincing you listen to something other than your heart. If that’s the case, here’s my advice for which starter to pick. Let’s quickly go through the three choices.</p> <h2>Bulbasaur</h2> <p>The poison grass-type is tough as nails and not easily downed. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur at level 16 and Venusaur at level 32. That’s four levels earlier than the other starters for the final transformation. Bulbasaur is also great against the first two gym leaders, Brock and Misty, both of whom field teams weak to grass-types. What Ivysaur and Venusaur lack in speed and raw attack power, they make up for with high HP and tons of status ailment attacks that can win almost any war of attrition.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is boring but effective in a wide array of match-ups, especially when combined with Leech Seed and Solar Beam. Paired with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, it’s a great choice for the master tactician.</p>

 <h2>Charmander</h2> <p>The fire-type has always been a favorite due to the fact that it’s the most badass. Charmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16 and Charizard at level 36, the last of which&nbsp; is also a flying-type. That extra versatility also brings with it some added vulnerability, but Charizard is great in the late game for quickly sweeping most opponents from the field. Charmander, on the other hand, struggles in the early game, especially against the first couple of Gyms. It does have Metal Claw, however, which can get it past Brock’s rock-types.</p>

 <p>Flame Thrower and Slash are great meat-and-potatoes attacks. Later on you can teach it Earthquake to add another devastating move to its arsenal. Fire Spin and Toxic also pair nicely for cutting off oxygen, even against opponents with a match-up edge.</p> <h2>Squirtle</h2> <p>The water-type is the cutest and has a lot of versatility early on and in the later stages of the game. Squirtle evolves into Wartortle at level 16 and Blastoise at level 36. It’s decently easy to train and has no problem against Brock. Plus Squirtle has the best defense throughout the game, though it struggles around Gyms three and four. It can learn Bubble Beam from Misty though which gives it an early go to special attack for the first half of the game.</p>

 <p>Hydro Pump and Skull Bash are powerful late-game attacks, and Blastoise also benefits from being able to learn moves like Ice Beam and Blizzard to make short work of dragon-types. It’s a nice compromise between the glass cannon offense of Charizard and the slow, situational effectiveness of Venusaur.</p> <h2 id="which-starter-should-i-pick-in-pok-eacute-mon-firered-and-leafgreen">Okay but for real: Which starter should I choose in <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em>?</h2> <p>My final answer is: Bulbasaur. It has great survivability and provides lots of options to go with any team you want to build. The early game, up through Surge, is super easy and you have plenty of time to train up the rest of your squad by the time you get to a grass-type showdown in Celadon City. Another thing Bulbasaur has going for it is that there’s really not any other great grass types. Starmie is a great water-type substitute for Blastoise, and Arcanine is a great fire-type substitute for Charizard. Plus, Sleep Powder is a big boon when it comes to capturing other Pokémon on your journey.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Polymarket Bravely Defends Betting On World War 3 As A Valuable Public Service]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/polymarket-ww3-bomb-iran-trum-prediction-market-2000674772</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In the early hours of February 28th, the U.S. and Israeli military began an unprovoked air strike against Iran after weeks of tense posturing. Sources indicate these plans had been in development for months, despite occurring in the middle of nuclear deal negotiations to replace the one Donald Trump tore up in 2017. Civilian death tolls continue to rise and the scope of this grotesquery has yet to reveal itself. But if you put your chips on the right Polymarket page, you’re in the money.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As a new, unfathomable war in the Middle East emerges, Polymarket betters are hoping to fathom enough for a jackpot. The gambling platform, which lets you bet anonymously on anything from basketball games to bombing campaigns, has been an unending source of controversy. Justifying letting the world wager on mass death, Polymarket claims they also act as a public service, an “unbiased forecast” for people to rely on.</span></p> <p><span>At the top of the betting pages regarding Iran, Polymarket has posted an editorial note:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“The promise of prediction markets is to harness the wisdom of the crowd to create accurate, unbiased forecasts for the most important events to society,” says Polymarket. “That ability is particularly invaluable in gut-wrenching times like today. After discussing with those directly affected by the attacks, who had dozens of questions, we realized that prediction markets could give them the answers they needed in ways TV news and 𝕏 could not.”</span></p>   <p><span>It goes without saying that the people who are eagerly wagering on human suffering are, in fact, very biased. The site naturally attracts a certain set of online person, whose sway or skin in the game do not reflect reality. Even if </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/canada-election-odds-mark-carney-pierre-poilievre-2064930"><i><span>Newsweek </span></i><span>believes the gambler’s instinct</span></a><span> on matters like the 2025 Canadian federal election, the Pierre Poilievre–sympathetic crowd did not prevent him from not only failing to become the prime minister, but even from failing to hold on to his own seat in parliament. To spell things out even&nbsp; more clearly, Polymarket betters were in revolt after wagers on whether </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-says-hell-yea-to-to-helping-government-with-fully-autonomous-weapons-as-trump-bombs-more-countries-2000674755"><span>Sam Altman</span></a><span> or Elon Musk would be crowned </span><i><span>TIME</span></i><span>’s Person of the Year award </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/time-person-of-the-year-ai-musk-altman-kalshi-bet-lost-millions-angry-2000652622"><span>lost on a technicality</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While know-nothings are unreliable sources, the other obvious issue with platforms like Polymarket are gamblers who know </span><span>too</span><span> much. Since the trend emerged, professional sports leagues are struggling to keep up with online betting scandals, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5517979/unpacking-the-scandal-around-baseball-player-shohei-ohtani-and-his-interpreter"><span>such as Shohei Ohtani wagering on, uh, himself</span></a><span>. Only a few days ago MrBeast video editor Artem Kaptur was fined by the gambling platform Kalshi </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-editor-insider-trading-kalshi-artem-kaptur-2000674023"><span>for a winning streak based around his own workplace</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you think there would be stricter security around matters of immense global importance, you just lost another bet. Last June, when Israel previously fired missiles towards Iran, several high-stakes bets from first-time users were placed around the bombing campaign. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2026/jan/30/polymarket-prediction-markets-betting"><span><em>The Guardian</em> believes these bets were made by people in the know</span></a><span>, capable of predicting these horrors with insider information.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The proliferation of betting is bad enough, but the potential for anonymous betting on sites like Polymarket raises insidious stakes. Bets placed on the attacks against Iran have already swelled up on the site’s front page, pushing the evergreen “Will the US confirm that aliens exist?” thread to the fifth row. The existing financial incentives to unleash war on the Middle East, from weapons manufacturing in the U.K. to resource grabbing in the region, are a revolting reality. Giving anonymous high rollers even more windfall is insane. The only thing predictable hereon is suffering.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Fischbach, better known as Markiplier, is one of the most successful, long-running YouTubers in the field. His turn behind the camera has yielded similar success, as he directed and starred in the feature film adaptation of the horror game </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>. The film has netted $50 million on a roughly $4 million budget, competing with studio offerings on a legitimately grassroots distribution campaign. Fischbach now warns Hollywood to ignore fellow YouTubers at its peril.</span></p>

 <p><span>“At least a lot of Hollywood was willfully ignoring the potential of YouTubers here,” Fischbach told the Lemonade Stand podcast (via </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/markiplier-says-hollywood-was-willfully-ignoring-the-potential-of-youtubers-before-his-film-iron-lung-made-usd50-million-at-the-box-office/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>). “There is that level of respect that I just haven’t met yet.”</span></p> <p><span>Fischbach has been posting videos since 2012. Best known for let’s plays of horror games like </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Amnesia</span></i><span>, he has not </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-mrbeast-networth-pewdiepie-net-worth-subscriber-1849784966"><span>faltered in popularity</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pewdiepie-rescinds-50-000-pledge-to-jewish-charity-aft-1838070628"><span>spiraled out</span></a><span> like many of his contemporaries. In 2023, he stated his intention to write, direct, star and distribute a film based on David Szymanski’s game </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>, in which the player pilots a claustrophobic, windowless submarine in a deep ocean of blood. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“They said it shouldn’t be done. Not that it couldn’t be done,” </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/markiplier-iron-lung-theatrical-release-date-1236599072/"><span>Fischbach told </span><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>. “People have made movies before, just that it would be ‘woefully unwise’ to tackle writing, directing, acting and editing a movie myself.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Unassuming, independent films have stunned the box office in the past. With a leaner budget and a mighty return, </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span> joins the ranks of hits like 2002’s </span><i><span>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</span></i><span>, the independent Canadian comedy that twisted a $5 million budget into a nearly $400 million box office haul. One of the films </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span> competed against was </span><i><span>Send Help</span></i><span>, the latest gross-out thriller from Sam Raimi, who stormed Hollywood with his own shoestring 1981 horror classic </span><i><span>The Evil Dead</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>But what seems to stick in the paw of YouTubers like Fischbach isn’t commercial success. In all likelihood, content creators at his level make more money than most working Hollywood directors. It’s the more elusive prestige factor that haunts them. </span></p>

 <p><span>The umbrage is reminiscent of that expressed by Kevin Perjurer (aka Defunctland), who dovetails his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_rjBWmc1iQ"><span>very good video about unaccredited TV jingle composers</span></a><span> with a grievance about online documentaries not holding the same space as conventionally produced ones. Given that the documentary space largely filters towards Netflix true-crime specials, I wonder if these creators are agonizing for a status that rarely exists for anyone, even within the current system.</span></p>

 <p><span>Additionally, it may have been the case in 2023, but Hollywood studios do not seem to be ignoring YouTubers anymore. In 2025, NEON released </span><i><span>Shelby Oaks</span></i><span>, a horror film from YouTuber Chris Stuckmann, though the film’s impression on critics and the box office was far more modest. </span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere, A24 recently unveiled the trailer for </span><i><span>The Backrooms</span></i><span>, a big-screen adaptation of the liminal YouTube phenomenon, helmed by 20-year old Kane Parsons, who’s responsible for the viral videos. I have also been told in private conversations that online hitmakers are optioned by Hollywood pretty frequently for their creations, but that they often die on the vine before reaching the public.</span></p>

 <p><span>For his film, Fischbach says he’d hesitate adapting another video game, preferring not to pigeonhole himself like </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> helm and ultimate wife guy </span><a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-resident-evil-auteur-in-his-own"><span>Paul W.S. Anderson</span></a><span>. Less surprisingly, Fischbach added that studio reception to him has changed since </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>’s success, saying he’s already met with executives, though they largely just want to know how he pulled it off. “They’re all asking me the same thing,” says Fischbach. “’How’d you do it? How’d you do it?’”</span></p>
