            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> twice in the past couple of months. The first runthrough was of the original on PlayStation. The second <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040">was the excellent <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster,</a> out today. Despite having grinded through the classic strategy RPG back in the day, I still learned a thing or two from revisiting it again all these years later. Here’s a bunch of friendly reminders, PSAs, and helpful tips, whether you’re playing <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> for the first time or coming back to it after decades away.</p> <h2>Keep every character a Squire until they learn JP Up</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630276" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630276"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630276">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Rule number one of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is “ABJPU”: always be JP-ing up. JP stands for Job Points and these are what you use to unlock skills across the game’s sprawling job system. As you rank up each job, you’ll collect more points per action you take, but the JP Up skill will double that, letting you progress your characters twice as fast. The skill is on the third page of the Squire skill list under the passive section. Hold off on swapping your fresh recruits to chemists, knights, or other starting classes until you have this one unlocked.</p>

 <h2>Unlock Focus if you really want to streamline grinding</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630277">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Characters earn XP and Job Points for successful actions. This means doing damage, healing, or buffing/debuffing something. The fastest way to level up characters is to stock up on potions, leave one enemy in a battle alive, and have everyone keep taking turns while staying healed. Accumulate is a Squire skill that raises your attack. It never misses. And you use it on yourself so you don’t have to move or worry about being in range.</p>

 <p>The quickest way to grind in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is to have everyone learn the skill (it costs 300 points) and stand around using it at the end of a random encounter. Because you can use it as a character’s second skill, it’s helpful no matter what job they are trying to level up, making it a sound strategy over the course of the entire game.</p>

 <h2>Always have a least one character with the Item skill equipped</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630275"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630275">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The ability to use Phoenix Down items is one of the most useful skills in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. That’s because when characters die, they only have three turns before they turn into crystals. Once that happens, they’re dead for the whole game unless you reset. If Ramza dies this way, the game is over. Even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and there’s nothing worse than having a character die early on in a fight and realizing you have no way to bring them back. Make sure at least one character has the Item skill equipped and Phoenix Down unlocked (it’s only 90 JP points) no matter what job they are. I usually have at least two or three.</p>

 <h2>Job Point spillover is your friend</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630278"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630278">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is full of math that never gets overtly explained. One of the most important calculations is called JP spillover. Every time a character earns Job Points, the rest of your characters in battle get 20 percent of those points to that same job. Even if they don’t have the job unlocked yet, the points will still accrue in the background, showing up once it’s available.</p>

 <p>This has two important uses. The first is you can have people double-up on jobs and unlock specific skills much faster. The other is that you can earn a small amount of points that let characters unlock one or two lower-level skills without them ever having actually spent time ranking up in that job. If you have a Chemist in your party earn 2,000 points, that will be enough for everyone else to learn Auto-Potion, one of the most useful counterattack skills in the game.</p>

 <h2>Drag battles out when you can so human enemies turn into crystals</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630283">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>When humans fall in battle, they can turn into treasure chests or crystals. The treasure chests aren’t that useful, but the crystals contain all of the Job skills those soldiers had when they died. This is a really efficient way to unlock skills without spending any points, especially for lower-level stuff on jobs that character isn’t currently using. For example, your Chemist, Knight, or Archer might grab a crystal from a White Mage and learn a bunch of useful secondary skills like Cure, Raise, and Protect without ever grinding as a White Mage. There’s just one caveat: they need to have the job unlocked to be able to earn the skills from it this way.</p> <h2>Stats grow differently depending on the job you have when you level up</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630287">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s some more arcane math the game doesn’t tell you about. Jobs have different base stats, so if you go from being a Knight to a Thief, even if you don’t change anything else, that character will have less health but be faster. Well, these stats also change in the background as you level up (with XP) in particular jobs. Players have spent decades trying to get the rough math right <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/57636648">in charts like these</a>, but there are some key things even casual players should be aware of.</p> <ul> <li>Monks, Knights, and Lancers have the highest health growth multiplier.</li> <li>Monks and Ninjas have the highest attack growth multiplier.</li> <li>Ninjas, Thieves, and Monks have the highest Speed Multiplier.</li> <li>Wizards and Time Mages have the highest magic attack growth multiplier.</li> <li>Priests, Wizards, Time Mages, and Summoners have the highest magic point growth multiplier.</li> </ul> <p>Mimes, the hardest job to unlock in the game, have the highest all around stat growth potential, while Bards have the worst for male characters and Chemists have the worst for Female characters.</p>

 <h2>Ramza kicks ass as a Monk</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630288"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630288">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Thematically, it feels like the main character should be wearing armor and tanking hits out in front. It’s also bad if he dies, so survivability also seems like a priority. But Monks, even though they wear light armor and less of it, can be exceptionally strong, and Ramza, because of his underlying stats, is one of the strongest. In addition to hitting for lots of damage and maintaining good speed, he’ll also unlock all of the Martial Arts skills which include ranged attacks, health and MP healing, status ailment removal, and a revive. Best of all, these skills cost no MP and happen instantly.</p> <h2>Pay attention to Bravery and Faith</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630289"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630289">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>More numbers! Each character in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has a Zodiac sign and two numbers near their name. The first is Bravery and it measures their ability to deal and take physical damage. The second is Faith and it’s involved in calculating the effectiveness of magic spells, both used and received. A high Faith character, for example, will have a higher likelihood of spells working and dealing more damage, but will also be more susceptible to them in return. Take note of these stats in the Recruiter’s office when you’re looking for new party members and when you’re deciding on their job trajectories.</p>

 <p>If someone’s pursuing magic, they’ll do best with a Faith stat over 60 (I like to aim for 70). Same for Bravery when it comes to physical fighters. Bravery also effects the likelihood of counterattacks activating. This is extra important for things like Auto-Potion. A low Bravery character won’t react to being hit with their counterattack skills as much.</p> <h2>You can out-level for story battles but not random encounters</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630280">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re stuck on a story battle like, say, the Dorter Slums or Lionel Castle Gate, you can keep grinding until your characters get powerful enough to overwhelm the enemy with sheer force. Random encounters, however, will always raise enemy levels to around where Ramza’s is, which is worth knowing before you try to go into a fight and grind with characters who are all learning new jobs they haven’t unlocked skills for yet.</p> <h2>Don’t rush into fights!</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630281">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a lesson <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> tries to teach you itself in Ramza’s very first battle out of the academy when Delita warns him about taking things slow. Any time I have ever lost a battle, it is because I got way too aggressive way too early. This will leave your fastest, farthest-moving characters isolated and easy targets to be picked off while also spreading you out across the field too much.</p>

 <p>If you’re facing mostly Archers and Knights, turtle up and take advantage of healing and support spells that hit multiple allies at once. If you’re facing enemy spell casters, separate your party just enough to not have multiple people targeted at once while still being close enough together to burst down one enemy at a time.</p> <h2>Always buy the best armor you can afford</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630282">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Every couple of battles, new gear will become available at the Outfitter’s office. Armor doesn’t increase defense in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. Instead, it raises health and magic point totals. Lighter armor will be a more balanced mix, while heavy armor prioritizes HP. It’s okay to switch things up to suit your character’s skills. A Knight that also casts White Magic will want to wear mage robes instead of a full suit of armor to get more magic points.</p> <p>In the old days, traveling back to town could mean getting stuck in a random encounter, but the remaster gives you the option to flee any battle on the map, so there’s no downside to constantly tracking back for supplies and better armor. Unless you’re playing on easy,<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> will require you to grind for cash and levels every so many story battles. Staying on top of the latest gear available will help even the odds.</p> <h2>Don’t under estimate the power of Move +1</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630292"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630292">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>One is the loneliest number. In a game full of big numbers, it can look especially unimpressive. But the maps in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> aren’t very big, and being able to move one extra square in any direction can pay off in big ways. Combine an early pair of Battle Boots with the Squire’s +1 movement ability and all of a sudden you have a 50-percent move bonus. Especially for characters who aren’t ranged, this can be the difference between contributing something meaningful to the fight during their turn and just constantly getting outmaneuvered until they die.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m surprised it took </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>nearly a decade to have a proper skin creation contest, but Chinese artists are currently </span><a href="https://ow.blizzard.cn/trsj2025/#/"><span>competing for the chance to have a costume concept appear</span></a><span> in the hero shooter. Pushing aside with all our might the fact that it sucks that this is a China-exclusive deal when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comic-zenyatta-ramattra-2000628236"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> is played all around the world, it’s an exciting prospect, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941"><span>thankfully, the competition has a hard ban on AI art</span></a><span>. The team at Blizzard will get the final say in what ends up in the game, but fan voting has a chance to tip the scales. The theme of the contest is “What if the Omnic Crisis never happened?” which, for those who aren’t versed in the lore, means that all of these soldiers and agents would have likely gone on to live normal lives without payload pushing and point capturing. Some of these skins are pretty great, others are going viral on social media for…other reasons. Let’s look at some of the standouts.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000630267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630267"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630267">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The designs currently leading in fan voting are a set of three skins, one each for Cassidy, Kiriko, and Ramattra. Kiriko is dressed as a donut store employee, and even her fox spirit, which she casts out when she uses her ultimate, is carrying a pastry in its mouth. Cassidy hasn’t fallen too far from his roots, as he’s still depicted as a criminal, but as a fugitive on the run and dressed in prison orange. Ramattra is probably my favorite of the three, however; as the radical Omnic no longer has a war to wage, he has become a housekeeper. Making his staff a broom is a fun touch.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630266"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630266">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The current second-place skin is one for the water-wielding hero Wuyang that sees him dressed as a firefighter. In retrospect, this concept is such an obvious fit for him I’m surprised Blizzard hadn’t made one itself. Though I’m not sure if the tank top would pass a regulations check.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630265"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630265">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While some of these skins don’t really seem on-theme and just look like artists wanted to put their favorite character in a pretty dress (valid), my favorites are the ones that truly imagine where these characters might have ended up if they’d been born in a peaceful world. Zenyatta as a traffic police officer throwing tickets instead of his signature orbs is inspired.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630264" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630264"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630264">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>However, one submission circulating in the community has been gaining traction particularly rapidly on social media and, by extension, in the competition. The Chew Time-Huskyrat skin for Junkrat has crossed my desk a few times over the past couple of days, and it’s pretty imaginative, to say the least. At a glance, it’s actually a pretty fun skin that has the explosive hero putting away his bombs for bones and chew toys and looking like a fairly standard mascot character. If you look more closely, though, you see it’s also meant to be a reference to pup play and furry culture, and he’s wearing a diaper, which has plenty of implications you can google if you’re curious. I don’t think there’s a chance in hell that Blizzard puts this one in the game, even if it somehow skyrocketed to the top of the leaderboard, but it has entered the top 10, and fans are losing it as it climbs the ranks.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cancel that Chinese skin vote right fucking now why does the Junkrat furry diaper fetish skin have so many votes</p> <p>— jamie🎐 (@VentureFootJob) <a href="https://twitter.com/VentureFootJob/status/1971794747078726003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the concept of junkrat being a diaper furry if the omnic crisis never happened <a href="https://t.co/WpHSF7AiNr">pic.twitter.com/WpHSF7AiNr</a></p> <p>— matt 🗯 (@6luelights) <a href="https://twitter.com/6luelights/status/1971902800667050158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">being a junkrat fan after the diaperfur skin surfaced <a href="https://t.co/58Qlt1PqPy">https://t.co/58Qlt1PqPy</a></p> <p>— fRankie 🐀💬 #TRANSMASCJUNKRAT💙💗🤍💗💙 (@vishkar_junkrat) <a href="https://twitter.com/vishkar_junkrat/status/1971984646000071042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">STOP SAYING ID LIKE THE JUNKRAT FAN ART I DO NOT. 😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/AA1pzPlvhG">https://t.co/AA1pzPlvhG</a></p> <p>— Aspen (@aspenisoffline) <a href="https://twitter.com/aspenisoffline/status/1972332121793700011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">IS JUNKRAT WEARING A DIAPER 😦 <a href="https://t.co/R2t1Fsj4Jw">pic.twitter.com/R2t1Fsj4Jw</a></p> <p>— Rowan🌱Lifeweaver CEO 🌷 (@adoringniran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adoringniran/status/1971836185359405251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"…and then, in 2025, overwatch finally hosted a fan design contest."<br>⁰"how fabulous! did anyone submit anything good?"<br>⁰"someone drew furry junkrat… in a diaper…"<br>⁰"oh darling, that is simply dreadful!"<br>⁰"i know, rarity. i know…" <a href="https://t.co/QRRGbrzHJQ">pic.twitter.com/QRRGbrzHJQ</a></p> <p>— 𝘱𝘺𝘳𝘢 ໒꒱ (@pyraVT) <a href="https://twitter.com/pyraVT/status/1972252773866725666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>E</span><span>ight winners will be chosen, including one first-place entry, two second-place winners, and two third-place contestants, and a popularity award will be granted to the top three highest-voted designs.

              <p>We’re still about a week out from Prime Day — Amazon’s big sales week ahead of Black Friday in which you can save tons on tech, home goods, and more. Even though the deals event isn’t here yet, some stuff has already begun to see some major discounts. If you’re hoping to save some cash on some new stuff for your PC or laptop, you can. Take this docking station for example. Anker has a USB hub that’s normally priced at $270. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Right now, Amazon has it marked down by 37%. That saves you a cool $100, bringing the price to just $170 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stay Organized and Versatile</h2>
<p>This docking station from Anker can bring all of your devices together in one place. No mess on your desktop. This hub will allow you to connect to multiple displays, transfer data quickly, or even charge all your devices easily from one place.</p>
<p>The anker hub employs a number of different ports to manage your different needs. along the front, you’ll find four USB-C ports, two of which are capable of up to 100W max output and the other two capable of transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, one designed for charging at 12W max and the other for data transfer. When all charging ports are being used, you’ll have a total output of 160W.</p>
<p>The front smart screen display will show you information about the charging output to your plugged-in devices. An audio jack is also on the front beneath that to connect to headphones.</p>



<p>When we turn the Anker docking station around, we find three more USB-A data ports, capable of up to 480Mb/s. Two HDMI 2.0 ports are there so you can connect to multiple displays at once, allowing for up to 4K resolution. You have an Ethernet port capable of up to 1Gb/s. And then we have a USB-C upstream port.</p>
<p>With a ton of electronic devices plugged into the hub, you may be worried about overheating. Well the hub employs ActiveShield temperature monitoring to check temperature levels three million times a day. The airflow system efficiently works to keep the unit cool while it’s on. In the event it does overheat despite that, the smart display can warn you with overheat alerts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">For a limited time, Amazon has the Anker USB-C docking station on sale for a huge $100 discount</a>. The price is down from $270 to just $170 right now.</p>

              <p>If you happen to be on the hunt for a new laptop, whether that’s because you’re a student in need of something to complete assignments, a small business owner looking to handle your business needs, or just some guy looking to watch YouTube and draw pictures, come check out the Dell Inspiron 15. This laptop has a touchscreen and is bundled with some bonus accessories. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/">The Amazon listing has the full price set at $2,200, but the limited time deal indicates its been marked down by 64% to just $800</a>. Some quick napkin math will tell you that’s a $1,400 discount.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that’s absolutely ridiculous. How can this laptop be on sale for that much off? Well, you’re right to be suspicious. When we look at this bundle’s price history, we can see it has only existed on Amazon for about a month. After first being listed, it immediately dropped in price and it’s mostly been at that $800 amount since.</p>

<p>Lots of sellers on Amazon will artificially inflate the list price so that when they mark it down, the sale looks enormous. Even if we go to Dell’s website, we’ll find versions of this model laptop going for about the same as you find it here. All that said, this is a pretty good value.</p>
<p>What you’re getting is a 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop that’s powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U. With that we also have an integrated graphics card, 32GB of memory, and a full 1TB of internal storage on its SSD. This laptop is designed to be able to take on school, work, entertainment, and any other sort of everyday task an average user might encounter — and it’s got the specs to support that.</p>
<p>The screen’s touch controls allow you to operate the laptop as if it’s a tablet, choosing to use pinch, zoom, and swipe gestures like you would on a mobile device. It has a resolution of 1080p and uses an anti-glare coating to help minimize reflections, making for more comfortable viewing in bright settings.</p>



<h2>Bonus Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Along with the laptop, you also get a number of free accessories. This Dell Inspiron 15 comes with a stylus pen to be used on the touchscreen, a cleaning clothe, a laptop sleeve for traveling, a USB flash drive with 128GB on it, as well as some port covers and webcam covers. Plus, the laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro.</p>
