Set in the occult office space world of<em> Control</em>, the co-op experience is unlike anything the <em>Alan Wake 2</em> maker has ever done before and it now has a release date. The Finnish studio revealed that <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is out in June and shared details about the game’s battle pass that make it sound very similar to the one in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196860,197541" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Announced during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream with the developers on Thursday</a></span>, <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on June 17 at the price of $40. As previously confirmed, it’ll also be available via Game Pass on console and PC, as well as PlayStation Plus via the Extra and Premier tiers. Most importantly, Remedy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536600287259918382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536600287259918382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained on Steam</a></span> how the game’s post-launch content will roll out and be monetized. </p><p>Similar to <em>Helldivers 2's </em>Warbonds, <em>Firebreak</em>’s battle passes are called Requisitions. There will be free and paid tiers, each unlocking new weapons, cosmetics, and other items. The “free” Requisitions are purchased with in-game currency while the premium ones are purchased with real money. All Requisitions will also remain permanently available in-game, following the trend kicked-off by <em>Halo: Infinite</em> and others. </p><p>Here’s how the grind works in more detail, per Remedy:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Earn Lost Assets by completing Jobs.</li><li>Spend them to unlock items in any Requisition you have acquired.</li><li>Unlocking items isn’t fully linear; rather, you can choose what you want to unlock.</li><li>You can progress multiple Requisitions at once.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So yes, for anyone who’s played <em>Helldivers 2</em> it should all sound pretty familiar. It makes sense for <em>Firebreak </em>to borrow from that system given both games following a similar session-based PVE gameplay loop. Remedy also confirmed plans for ongoing free post-launch updates in the form of two new missions coming after release, with additional content slated to arrive in 2026. </p><p>But it doesn’t sound like Remedy’s trying to drown players in an endless grind. Instead, <em>Firebreak</em> sounds like live service gaming-lite: it’s not a game you ever really “beat” but it also isn’t meant to feel like a second job, another balancing act <em>Helldivers 2</em> nailed. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Interestingly, <em>Madden 26</em> is finally leaving behind the aging PS4 and Xbox One. Since 2013, <em>Madden </em>has launched on those consoles every year, but no more. Last year’s <em>Madden 25</em> will be the last EA football game to launch on last-gen machines. Funnily enough, the first <em>Madden </em>to launch on Xbox One and PS4 was also called <em>Madden 25</em>, as the franchise was celebrating its 25 year anniversary. Weird stuff! </p><p>It’s a year of change for <em>Madden</em>, because not only is it skipping consoles it has released on for over a decade, but EA is bringing the football series back to Nintendo platforms.<em> Madden 26 </em>is set to launch on Switch 2 in August alongside the other versions of the game on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. This is the first time a <em>Madden </em>game has appeared on a Nintendo platform since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_13&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012's<em> Madden NFL 13</em>. That game launched on Wii and Wii U</a></span>. </p><p>Weirdly, only <em>Madden</em> is making the leap to Switch 2<em>. EA College Football 26</em> will not be available on Nintendo’s new console. Last year,<em> EA College Football 25 </em>became one of the best selling games in the United States after fans waited a decade to play another EA Sports college football game. (The last one was released in 2013.) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118"><em>EA College Football 25 </em>already skipped PS4 and Xbox One last year</a></span>, so its not surprising they are skipping it again this year. </p><p><em> Madden NFL 26</em> launches for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14.<em> College Football 26 </em>launches on July 10. You can pay EA a ransom fee to play three days early via the $100 <em>Madden NFL 26</em> “Deluxe Edition.” On PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, a $150 “MVP Bundle” is also available, and it comes with <em>College Football 26</em> “Deluxe Edition.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
