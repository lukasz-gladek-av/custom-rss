            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="56" data-end="537">With Black Friday weekend finally here, you can save big across essentially every category of products. Whether you’re looking for a new espresso machine to treat yourself to barista-level lattes in the morning or if you’re hoping to snag a new 4K monitor for your gaming PC, now is the weekend to find what you’re looking for. If you’re just perusing the web this weekend for something you maybe don’t “need” but seems like a cool thing to have, this could be just the thing. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6080/">The Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL has come down by 25%.</a> This Bluetooth speaker and lightshow in one normally goes for $180, but Black Friday has it down to just $135. You end up saving yourself $45.</p>
<p data-start="56" data-end="537">Govee’s smart table lamp offers a fun way to mix both sound and light at your next party, synchronizing the light and color to the music playing through its speaker. The lamp’s integrated chipset and advanced algorithm allow it to respond to music in real-time with a 32ms response time. This ensures the lights stay in perfect sync with every beat, making your music come alive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6080/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="56" data-end="537">Set the Perfect Atmosphere</h2>
<p data-start="539" data-end="902">The lamp features 16 different music modes that adjust the lighting based on the rhythm of your music. You can switch between modes to match the mood, whether you’re hosting a lively party or trying to create a more relaxing vibe to wind down to.</p>
<p data-start="904" data-end="1318">This lamp is equipped with 210 high-density LED beads—20% more than previous versions—ensuring sharper, more vibrant colors. You can individually adjust each bead’s color, allowing you to create a personalized lighting scheme. Experiment with the colors as you turn your room into a unique light show.</p>
<p data-start="1320" data-end="1743">Sound quality is just as impressive as the lighting as the Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro is made in collaboration with JBL. Powered by a compact 2.5-inch, 500cc full-range speaker and backed by JBL’s equalizer algorithm, the audio is crisp and full of depth. For a more immersive experience, you can even pair two lamps together for stereo sound, with synchronized light effects to match.</p>


<p data-start="1320" data-end="1743">For those who want to take it even further, the Music DreamView feature allows you to synchronize the lamp with up to 10 other Govee lights. This turns your entire room into a synchronized light and sound experience, heightening the atmosphere (or perhaps causing sensory overload) for any occasion.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2034">This smart lamp offers up to 4.5 hours of continuous light and sound on a single charge. Note that that’s with volume and brightness set at 50%. The lamp has adjustable brightness (600lm) and a wide color temperature range (2700K–6500K). Fine tune it to your needs.</p>
<p data-start="2274" data-end="2533">The Govee Home app unlocks more personalization options, giving you full control over the lighting in your space. Voice control is possible with compatibility for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Matter, allowing you to adjust the settings or switch modes just by asking. Even set custom routines. You can make it so when you say, “Alexa, I’m going up, up, up,” the Govee lamp automatically shifts to a bright, golden hue and starts blasting “Golden” by Huntrix from <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clears-star-wars-imperial-star-destroyer-now-selling-4-8-rated-set-at-new-all-time-low-2000648724</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Putting together a huge LEGO set is one of those rare things that gets kids and adults to stop looking at screens. And when it comes to the Danish toy maker’s line, Star Wars themes are by far the best and the most popular. Harry Potter sets might get some love, but the galaxy far, far away is always at the top of the sales charts.</p>
<p>The problem with famous Star Wars builds is that they almost never go on sale for a lot less, so you have to be patient and wait for the right time to get one at a good price. The good news is that during Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6094/">the iconic Imperial Star destroyer set is on sale for $119 on Amazon, down from its normal price of $159</a>. As you might know, this model is one of the most popular ships in the entire collection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Legendary Ship That Will Actually Fit on Your Shelf</h2>
<p>This<strong> 1,555-piece set</strong> turns the scary wedge-shaped cruiser from<em> A New Hope</em> into a brick model. The size is just right so it doesn’t take up too much space on your display and <strong>the finished model is 18 inches long and just over 6 inches tall</strong> so it stands out on a bookshelf without taking up an entire wall. LEGO made this version with a hidden carry handle that folds into the hull so that this way, younger builders can swoop it around the room during imaginary space battles without it falling apart in their hands.</p>



<p>The real magic happens inside the hull where LEGO packed in <strong>several rooms that show off the Empire’s harsh military style</strong>: There is a real bridge with command stations, a separate control room with technical panels, and even a break room because Stormtroopers need coffee breaks too. The armory has weapons for the crew, and the cargo area has the glowing Kyber Crystal pieces and thermal detonators that refer to deeper Star Wars lore.</p>
<p>These little things on the inside turn the build from a simple display piece into something you can actually explore and move around, which keeps the fun going long after the building is done. The engineering also makes sure that you can get to these areas without having to take down the whole building. The hinged panels swing open easily and lock back into place securely.</p>



<p>There are <strong>seven mini-figures in the box, and the main one is Darth Vader in full black armor and a cape</strong>. There’s also an Imperial Gunner, an Imperial Navy Trooper, and Commander Praji and a standard Stormtrooper is the backbone of the Empire’s forces. The set also comes with a <strong>25th anniversary edition of Cal Kestis</strong> from the Jedi video game series: This is a one-of-a-kind collectible that won’t be available in future releases.</p>
<p>This $40 discount is a big deal for a high-end LEGO set of this size and difficulty, especially since Star Wars collaborations don’t usually get discounts this big outside of big shopping events. You’re paying about $0,076 per piece, which is much less than the usual ratio that LEGO charges for licensed themes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Is Willing to Make Zero Margin on Its USB-C Charger 2-Pack, Cheaper Than Strarbucks Coffee]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/charge-multiple-devices-on-the-go-for-just-11-with-this-2-pack-of-ankers-20w-charger-2000648506</link>
            <guid>1368079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping your devices charged at all times doesn’t have to be complicated. Those who use multiple gadgets to get through their days can greatly benefit from dual-port chargers that make it easy to top up to two essentials at the same time. And today is a great time to pick a couple for literal pennies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/">A 2-pack of Anker’s 20W charger, which typically sits at $19, just dropped to $11 at Amazon, after a whopping 41% discount</a>. Each of these comes with two ports, and with this deal, you’re basically paying just a little over $5 for each. The offer applies to the black color option. Others are discounted too, but the prices vary. For instance, the white option is sitting at $13, while green and purple are going for $14 each. Plus, for every color except black, discounts are only available to Prime members. These are Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals (even though the event is behind us), but they’re selling out fast. Get yours before the stock runs out or Amazon decides to push the price back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, But Safe Charging for Your Essentials</h2>
<p>The charger is designed to be compact and portable. It fits in the palm of your hand, slides into your pocket, and can be tossed into any backpack without bulking things up. Getting two of these means you can keep one for home use, while the other in your laptop bag or car for hassle-free on-the-go usage. Two ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) let you power two devices at the same time. The 20W output isn’t massive, but still decent to juice your essentials up without taking too long. It can fast charge an iPhone 16 from 0 to 50% in around 30 minutes. You’ll enjoy maximum power when using a single port. When both are in use, expect each to deliver 7.5W max output.</p>



<p>A 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable is included with each charger, which is long enough for you to be able to use the connected devices comfortably as they charge. As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a range of devices. These include iPhone Series 15 through 17, iPhone Pro Series (2024, 2023, 2022, 2021), the latest Google Pixel devices, recent Samsung phones, and even Galaxy tablets. You will also be able to power your earbuds, select iPad configurations, plus smartwatches with each. Basically, it covers all the devices you rely on on a regular basis. But despite all the power, the charger stays calm and cool as it works. Anker’s enhanced safety system includes overvoltage protection, temperature control, and other helpful safety features to protect your devices from long-term wear, while also maintaining their battery health.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/">Included in the box are two Anker chargers, a 2-pack 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty, in case something goes wrong. You can now grab this bundle for just $11.</a> It’s open to all shoppers, but Prime members will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, too. If you’re not one, you can still get free delivery, but only on orders above $35. Just don’t wait too long to grab the deal, as it’s going to end soon. Holiday rush is in full swing, and as a general rule, if you spot something you like, jump in on it while there’s still time. Additionally, there’s plenty more going at a discount right now, so it’s a good time to stock up on both the essentials and pricey options without blowing your budget.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-65w-wall-charger-4-ports-hits-record-low-day-after-black-friday-amazon-forgot-to-stop-deals-2000648712</link>

              <p>Having a lot of chargers plugged into every outlet makes a mess of cables and adapters that takes up space and looks bad. The Ugreen Nexode 65W charger combines everything into one small unit so you can charge your laptop, phone, and tablet all at once from one wall outlet. And the good news is that right now, this <strong>four-port GaN charger</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">is down from its usual price of $39 to $24</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charges 4 Devices at Once</h2>
<p>The charger can be so small because of the new Gallium Nitride technology while Standard silicon-based chargers need bigger parts to safely handle 65W output. GaN works better and makes less heat which lets Ugreen fit a lot of charging power into a package that is only 2.64 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches. The <strong>foldable plug design</strong> makes it even more portable because the prongs tuck away flat which keeps other things in your bag from getting scratched and stops the charger from getting stuck on fabric.</p>
<p>The <strong>four-port setup with three USB-C outputs and one USB-A port</strong> works with almost all of your devices. You can charge your MacBook Pro through the main USB-C port at full speed which is 65W. This is the same speed as Apple’s own charger which charges a MacBook Air to 51% in just 30 minutes. The other ports can charge your phone, wireless earbuds, tablet, or even a Steam Deck at the same time.</p>



<p>Built-in protections keep the device from getting too hot or too much current, and they automatically change the power delivery when they sense a problem. You don’t have to worry about power surges or overheating problems that cheap chargers have when you leave devices plugged in overnight.</p>
<p>The <strong>smart power distribution system</strong> gives out watts based on what is connected and what each device needs: When you charge your phone, it gives it the right amount of power to charge quickly without giving it too much power, which could hurt the battery over time. When you add your laptop to the mix, the charger changes its power budget to give priority to the device that needs more power.</p>
<p>You get here <strong>four ports and 65W of power for $24 which is less than what most single-port chargers cost</strong>. Plus, the package is smaller than most laptop adapters.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-playstation-5-has-come-down-by-100-for-black-friday-2000648496</link>
            <guid>1368067</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday weekend is here, and with that comes tons of deals across every product category under the sun ranging from vacuums to coffee makers to, yes, even video games. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Slim on sale for $100 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/">This disc edition of the console has recently been priced as high as $550, but during this weekend, you can grab the system of just $450.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tons of Games</h2>
<p>Okay we all love our memes about the PS5 saving it has no games. And while maybe at this point in the console’s lifecycle we were hoping for a little more, the library of choices you have for what to play is far more than the barren wasteland Twitter makes it out to be.</p>
<p>The new <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is one of the best looking and best playing action games of the generation. <em>Returnal</em> is a fast-paced third-person shooter roguelike with eary vibes reminiscent of <em>Metroid</em>. <em>Astro Bot</em> is our much-needed plunge back into the 3D mascot platforming genre. It’s a brilliantly fun love letter to all things PlayStation and earned its title as 2024’s Game of the Year at The Game Awards last year.</p>
<p>Then if you missed out on the PS4 generation, you have countless titles waiting for you to dip into—some of which even enhanced for their move onto the PlayStation 5.&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part 1 </em>and <em>The Last of Us: Part 2</em> regularly get cited as the best story in video games. Well, at least the first one does (though I am a stark defender of the second one). Form your own opinion on the choices made by the iconic characters in these post-apocalypse stories that went on to inspire and HBO adaptation.</p>
<p>Access a bunch of these instant classics with a subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium. You’ll be able to access hundreds of games across PlayStation generations like&nbsp;<em>Control, Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy VII Remake,&nbsp;</em>and more.</p>



<h2>Expandable Storage</h2>
<p>While this model PlayStation 5 is marketed as having a 1TB SSD, your actual usable storage isn’t quite that. Much of the internal drive’s space is dedicated toward system software that enables the PS5 be, well, a PS5. Out of the box, its more accurate to say you’ll be working with a little over 850GB.</p>
<p>If you’d prefer more space, you can always expand it. The PS5 Slim’s storage is expandable via an internal SSD slot. Brands like Crucial, Samsung, and Wester Digital all make SSDs which come with heatsinks and are compatible for installation in a PlayStation 5. Much of those you’ll be able find on sale this weekend and next between Black Friday and Cyber Week. Installation is pretty easy too. There are any number of tutorial videos to choose from on YouTube. All it takes is a screw driver and five minutes of your time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-space-and-boost-efficiency-with-ankers-675-usb-c-docking-station-while-its-going-for-32-less-2000648509</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Docking stations are a great way to manage multiple devices on your desk without cord clutter. You plug everything into a single unit and keep it beside your monitor for easy access. But what if we told you there’s an even more efficient way of doing things?</p>
<p>Anker’s 675 USB-C Docking Station doubles as a monitor stand and lets you connect up to 12 devices at the same time! <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/">On a regular day, it would run you around $250, but all thanks to Black Friday, you can grab one for just $170 today.</a> That’s after a massive 32% discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy free shipping with your purchase, whether you’re a Prime member or not. The main sale event is technically over, and Cyber Monday is still a couple of days away. This lingering deal is a great way to save on an efficient charging solution if you missed grabbing it yesterday and can’t wait for Monday!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Saves Space</h2>
<p>It looks like a regular monitor/laptop stand, even though it’s anything but that. You’re getting a bunch of ports on the side, including a 100W max USB-C upstream port, 3 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, SD/microSD card slots, a 4K HDMI port, a wireless charging pad, and an Ethernet port. That’s everything you need to connect all your essentials, plus a few extras, without feeling limited. Place your monitor on the top, and then add a keyboard, external storage, headphones, and more. The wireless charging pad makes it easy to top up your smartphone while you’re busy being productive. All of us have our phones on our workstations anyway, so it’s a great way to juice them up instead of letting them sit idle. The 100W max USB-C upstream port charges your laptop as you work, just as well. Note that the dock does not support display via any of the USB-C ports. You can only do that using the single HDMI port. It shouldn’t be a problem, though, unless you’re looking for a bigger, multi-monitor setup with three or four screens.</p>
<p>There’s some space under the dock that you can use to store your keyboard and mouse when not in use. Just push them under once you’re done working, and come back to a clean, tidy setup the next day. Raising your monitor to your eye level also promotes a better posture, as you can easily sit up straight instead of slouching.</p>



<p>Exceptional stability comes from an Aircraft-Grade aluminum alloy body with an anti-slip silicone strip for sturdiness. The curved edge design makes the overall look and feel premium. It’s built to blend into any workstation, from the most basic ones to those that have quite a lot going on in terms of personality. Getting started is straightforward, as just plugging your laptop in wakes your entire workstation up. The dock plays nicely with a wide range of laptops and monitors, including Dell XPS, Lenovo, iMac, MacBook, and more. OS-wise, it works well with Windows 10 and 11, plus macOS 10.14 and above.</p>
<p>The package comes with the docking station, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/"> The current deal brings the price down to just $170, which is basically nothing for the features it offers.</a> You’re saving a nice $80 on a solution that’s going to make your workstation much more efficient and a whole lot cleaner.</p>

<h2 data-start="484" data-end="1070">Built for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p data-start="1072" data-end="1516">AI has taken over the zeitgeist so its unsurprising Apple’s marketing around the M5 chip is leading with the buzzword. It’s been engineered for what Apple calls “Apple Intelligence,” making it powerful enough for automatically compiling tons of code, responding to AI prompts, and generating images based solely on descriptions. Whether you engage with AI or now, the chip’s power still translates into faster performance and more efficiency, so you can get more done in less time.</p>
<p data-start="1518" data-end="1947">Battery life on the 2025 MacBook Pro is exceptional. Thanks to the M5 chip, you can expect up to 24 hours of continuous use on a single charge, which is an incredible improvement over Intel-based MacBook Pro models. In fact, this is up to 14 times longer battery life than previous Intel versions, allowing you to work, stream, and browse for hours without worrying about finding an outlet.</p>
<p data-start="1949" data-end="2358">The MacBook Pro’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina display is another highlight. The screen boasts an impressive 1,600 nits of brightness and supports a wide color gamut, delivering vibrant, true-to-life colors that will make all your photos, videos, and creative projects pop. The display’s able to render one billion colors, ensuring incredible detail and accuracy when watching a movie or editing photos.</p>


<p data-start="2360" data-end="2782">For those who rely on video calls—whether for work, school, or just catching up with loved ones—the MacBook Pro has some great little features . The built-in 12MP camera shoots in full 1080p HD, ensuring that you always look your best during meetings or virtual hangouts. The three-microphone array works alongside the six-speaker system to create an immersive sound experience, using spatial audio technology to ensure clear audio on both ends of the call.</p>
<p data-start="2784" data-end="3289">The camera also features Apple’s Center Stage, which uses AI to automatically adjust the camera’s angle as you move, ensuring you remain centered in the frame throughout video calls. No matter where you are in the room, Center Stage keeps you in view. This feature is compatible with pretty much all the popular video call apps like FaceTime and Zoom.</p>
<p data-start="3291" data-end="3572">This model is available in two elegant color options: space black and silver, so you can choose the one that best suits your style. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Both are on sale for Cyber Monday at its all-time low price of just $1,349.</a></p>

              <p>Since Black Friday Week started, Amazon has sold hundreds of thousands of Xbox controllers. Even though it’s now the weekend after Thanksgiving, there are still great deals on these gaming essentials but the problem is that a lot of the color options are already sold out. However, the famous <em>Carbon Black</em> version is still available this Saturday morning and is now at its lowest price ever: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">$39, down from its usual price of $64</a>. This is the <strong>2025 model with all the newest features</strong> and at this price, you’re getting Microsoft’s best controller for almost 40% less than what you’d normally pay.</p>

<h2>Play on Any Platforms</h2>
<p>The new Xbox wireless controller has some important improvements over older models. For example, it works with more than just traditional gaming setups as you can can<strong> connect this controller to your Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC, Android devices, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong> without wires using Bluetooth. You only need to buy one controller that works with all of your devices so you don’t have to switch between different peripherals for different platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft improved the ergonomics by adding a <strong>textured grip to the triggers, bumpers, and back case</strong>. This makes it easier to control the game for long periods of time. The hybrid D-pad has a faceted design that makes it easier to make both sweeping and exact directional inputs. This makes a big difference in fighting games and platformers where every input counts. The <strong>controller also has a dedicated Share button</strong> that lets you take screenshots and video clips without stopping the game which makes it easier to make content if you like streaming or just want to save special moments.</p>



<p>The included AA batteries last a long time and <strong>give you up to 40 hours of gameplay</strong>. If you want to use rechargeable batteries instead, you can switch to the Play and Charge Kit. You can now keep a stable connection up to 30 feet away from your device, which gives you more options for how to set up your gaming area. Dynamic latency input technology makes the time between pressing a button and an action on the screen shorter. This makes the game feel more responsive, which competitive gamers will love, but casual gamers will also benefit from it.</p>
<p>The Carbon Black color is the <strong>classic Xbox look that never goes out of style</strong>: It has a matte finish that doesn’t show fingerprints as easily as glossy finishes. The housing is sturdy and doesn’t flex or creak, and the buttons give satisfying feedback without being too loud. You can also use the Xbox Accessories app to change the buttons on your controller to fit your needs for certain games or accessibility, which is more customization than most third-party controllers offer.</p>
<p>For $39, you get the newest controller technology from Microsoft which is less than what last generation’s model usually costs. The price is at an all-time low, and the improvements coming in 2025 will make it even better.</p>
