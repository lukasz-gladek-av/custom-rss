There are lots more games that are heavily discounted on PSN right now, from blockbuster PS5 exclusives to some equally amazing but lesser-known games that might not be on your radar. </p><p>You can currently get just about every major Sony first-party blockbuster from the last few years for around $30 or less. Here’s the full list to refresh your memory:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Helldivers 2 </em>- $31 (20 percent off)</li><li><em>Spider-Man 2 </em>- $40 (43 percent off)</li><li><em>God of War Ragnarok </em>- $30 (58 percent off)</li><li><em>Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition </em>- $40 (34 percent off)</li><li><em>Returnal </em>- $30 (58  percent off)<br></li><li><em>Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart Deluxe Edition </em>- $40 (50 percent off)</li><li><em>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut </em>- $30 (58 percent off)</li><li><em>Death Stranding: Director’s Cut </em>- $20 (60 percent off)</li><li><em>The Last of Us Part I </em>- $30 (58 percent off)</li><li><em>The Last of Us Part II </em>- $25 (30 percent off)</li><li><em>Spider-Man Miles Morales </em>- $20 (60 percent off)</li><li><em>Demon’s Souls Deluxe Edition </em>- $50 (45 percent off)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Weirdly, a couple of the games are only on sale for the deluxe editions. Also, <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> and<em> Sackboy: A Big Adventure</em> aren’t on sale at all. The remaster of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> also just came out so it’s still full price and you can no longer get the original PS4 version that was usually on sale for just $10. From the above list, <em>Death Stranding</em> and<em> Ghost of Tsushima </em>are good pickups since both have sequels out next year. </p><p>But there are also a bunch of other games on sale on PSN right now. You can click through the above slideshow for our other favorite picks. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f36bf14d226337b17149b66852ed6f88" data-recommend-id="image://f36bf14d226337b17149b66852ed6f88" data-format="png" data-width="2724" data-height="1533" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud looks at the Shinra office.

Following the attack, Nakamura reverted to his villainous strategy, having promo videos (spoken in his native Japanese tongue) played on the big screen during Knight’s matches in an attempt to distract him. A Survivor Series match was set for LA Knight’s U.S. title. Overall, it was a decent way to reintroduce the former IWGP Heavyweight Champion into storylines.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Nakamura hardly missed in his match with LA Knight, while Knight seemed a bit off, not getting in as much offense as we’ve become accustomed to seeing from the rising star. The story of this somewhat one-sided match was to reestablish Nakamura as a credible opponent and remind the audience of his abilities, which both performers successfully accomplished. The finish saw an incredible back suplex from Nakamura to Knight, leading to a brutal-looking reverse DDT on the champ. This set up Knight to take a nasty running knee (Nakamura’s finisher, the Kinshasa) to the back of his head. The former Intercontinental Champion has now regained the United States Championship in dominating fashion.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-recommend-id="image://7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-format="jpg" data-width="3936" data-height="2624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-recommend-id="image://7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-format="jpg" data-width="3936" data-height="2624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 2</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>After losing to WWE Undisputed World Champion Cody Rhodes at Crown Jewel last month, World Champion Gunther has struggled to maintain his confidence. In the build-up to Survivor Series, former World Champion Damian Priest often got the upper hand on Gunther during in-ring segments and even during a backstage altercation that Gunther initiated. The rivalry has been compelling, although it’s been challenging to convince fans that Priest would win the world title in Vancouver.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> In something of a clash of styles, Gunther looked to neutralize Priest’s mixed martial arts moves by attacking his left arm throughout the battle, even adding additional pressure with a devastating kimura lock that had Priest writhing in pain. The outcome of the match was determined by Priest’s former best friend and stablemate in The Judgment Day, Finn Balor. Balor interfered by hitting a double foot stomp on Priest, who was on the floor outside, while the referee was distracted (surprise, surprise) by Gunther. The WWE World Champion capitalized on this, power-bombing the New York native and putting him to sleep with a sleeper hold. Another great outing from both competitors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-recommend-id="image://c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-recommend-id="image://c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> In recent weeks, the 39-year-old California native has enjoyed well-deserved success. After winning the WWE Women’s Speed Championship in October, Candice LeRae continues to gain momentum. In the lead-up to the Women’s WarGames match, LeRae was aligned with WWE Women’s Champion Nia Jax on SmackDown, often assisting Jax during matches. LeRae played a supporting role during the build to Survivor Series, participating in post-match brawls with the good guys.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> LeRae, a talent who rarely gets the opportunity to fully showcase her abilities in a WWE ring, seized her moment at Survivor Series. Teaming up with current Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan, Nia Jax, current Money in the Bank briefcase holder Tiffany Stratton, and Morgan’s bodyguard Raquel Rodriguez, LeRae faced the challenge of standing out in a star-studded lineup—and she delivered spectacularly.</p><p>LeRae made an immediate impact by pushing Stratton out of harm’s way and executing an impressive double maneuver, performing a Code Breaker on Bayley while simultaneously nailing a Senton on Naomi. She utilized a chair as a launch pad for the move, making it one of the most impressive highlights of the night. LeRae epitomized the concept of making every moment in the ring count, solidifying herself as a standout performer in the chaotic Women’s WarGames match.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-recommend-id="image://d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-recommend-id="image://d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 8</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> The new Tribal Chief, Solo Sikoa, showcased his natural charisma and in-ring presence, solidifying himself as a credible threat to Roman Reigns. Sikoa wasted no time making an impact in the Bloodline match. Early on, he unleashed brutal violence on Jimmy and Jey Uso, slamming a steel door into their heads in a shocking display of dominance.</p><p>Taking charge of his bad-guy team (Tonga, Loa, Reed, and Fatu), Sikoa orchestrated a devastating beatdown of the good guys (Zayn, Punk, Jimmy, and Jey) in the ring. In a dramatic moment, Sikoa attempted to exile his cousin Reigns from the match by unveiling a steel chain and padlock, setting the stage for high-stakes drama. He came close to incapacitating Reigns with two Samoan Spikes, leading to a thrilling false finish. However, the Uso brothers countered with a perfectly timed double superkick.</p><p>Sikoa was pivotal in the match’s climactic moments, enduring an all-out assault by the babyfaces, ultimately falling to Reigns in a decisive conclusion. Despite the loss, Sikoa demonstrated his star potential, proving that his success hinges on the caliber of opponents and storylines he’s paired with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-recommend-id="image://9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-format="jpg" data-width="5518" data-height="3679" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-recommend-id="image://9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-format="jpg" data-width="5518" data-height="3679" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Since debuting in WWE earlier this year, the “Samoan Werewolf” Jacob Fatu has been a force to be reckoned with, striking fear in his opponents from the start. Already a former WWE Tag Team Champion, Fatu is just beginning to make his mark. </p><p>Following his standout performance at WWE Crown Jewel, Fatu would often be the last man standing after on-screen brawls with the OG Bloodline, demonstrating his dominance. His momentum continued as he secured a critical victory against WarGames opponent and older cousin Jey Uso, earning his bad-guy Bloodline team the all-important WarGames advantage.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> It’s clear that someone in WWE management sees immense potential in Jacob Fatu. Upon entering the cage, Fatu faced an immediate double-team from the Usos. While this would have been a major setback for most WWE superstars, the Samoan powerhouse quickly turned the tide. He neutralized Jimmy Uso by hurling the multi-time tag champion into the unforgiving steel frame of the cage and shrugged off a Samoan Drop from former Intercontinental Champion Jey Uso.</p><p>Fatu displayed incredible athleticism, hitting a breathtaking handstand springboard moonsault on Jey Uso, showcasing his unique blend of power and agility. However, the match took a scary turn when Fatu appeared to botch a top-rope move intended for CM Punk, resulting in legitimate pain to his leg. Despite this setback, the resilient Bloodline member pushed through to finish the match, proving his toughness and determination.</p><p>It’s safe to say that Jacob Fatu, the younger cousin of the Usos and older cousin of Solo Sikoa, has solidified his place as a rising star in WWE. His performance at Survivor Series confirmed he is here to stay.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-recommend-id="image://0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="8134" data-height="5425" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-recommend-id="image://0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="8134" data-height="5425" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 6</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> With Seth Rollins currently in his rearview, Bronson Reed turned his attention to his next challenge. Reed defeated former World Champion Rollins on <em>Monday Night Raw</em>, leading to Rollins’ removal from current storylines once again. The “Big” superstar made a significant impact on the November 15th edition of <em>WWE SmackDown</em>, aligning himself with the Bloodline in preparation for a massive 5-on-5 WarGames cage match at Survivor Series. </p><p>During a beatdown of the OG Bloodline, Reed hit a monstrous “Tsunami” on Roman Reigns, which the Original Tribal Chief sold as though his ribs were cracked—an incredible compliment from WWE’s top superstar. Reed fit right in with the Bloodline and carried serious momentum going into the premium live event.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Not only is Reed impressive at his size, but his instincts should be lauded. During the WarGames match, he took control of an unfortunate situation when his tag partner Jacob Fatu missed a moonsault attempt by quickly hitting a Senton on Fatu’s intended target, CM Punk. Another huge spot in the match was Bronson climbing to the top of the cage, aiming to crush Reigns, who was laid out on a table. </p><p>However, Punk pulled Reigns out of the way, causing Reed to crash through the table. Despite his team losing to Sami Zayn, The Usos, CM Punk, and Roman Reigns, Bronson undoubtedly established himself as a top performer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-recommend-id="image://25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-recommend-id="image://25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> The original Damage Control (stylized as Damage CTRL) member has gained momentum lately. After recently winning a battle royal to determine who would face World Champion Liv Morgan, the “Genius of the Sky” found herself involved in the 5-on-5 WarGames match at Survivor Series. Iyo Sky’s introduction to this storyline added significant value, as she brings experience and unmatched natural athleticism.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Sky never disappoints in high-pressure environments. From her introduction to the match, Sky commanded attention as she executed a breathtaking moonsault from the top of the cage, with a purple garbage can covering half her body, eliciting a roar of approval from the audience. The former NXT Champion more than earned her spot on this list with her bravery and consistently impressive moveset.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-recommend-id="image://5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-recommend-id="image://5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 7</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Liv Morgan focused on maintaining her momentum following her historic win at this year’s WWE Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia. After weeks of tensions with Iyo Sky and WWE Tag Champions Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair, a match between them became inevitable. On a recent edition of Monday Night Raw, Iyo Sky earned the opportunity to challenge Morgan, further intensifying the rivalry with the “Genius of the Sky.”<br></p><p>The WWE Women’s World Champion, alongside her bodyguard Raquel Rodriguez, was unsuccessful in defeating Cargill and Belair for the tag titles, foreshadowing a potential rematch. Following an attack on Cargill during an episode of WWE SmackDown, former WWE Champion Bayley was added to the mix, setting the stage for the 5-on-5 Survivor Series WarGames match.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> One thing that stands out about Morgan is her unmatched ability to sell danger. When the World Champion entered the match, she locked eyes with Rhea Ripley, who glared at her with pure hatred. This prompted Morgan to grab a bat in an effort to defend herself. She attempted to cripple Ripley with bat swings reminiscent of Juan Soto’s World Series highlights.</p><p>More creativity came when Morgan executed her Oblivion finisher on Bayley while Bayley was holding a chair. Although the move didn’t look as impressive as likely intended, it was unique enough to be appreciated. Ripley ultimately defeated Team Liv, surprisingly pinning Morgan.</p><p>Despite some sloppy moments in the match (such as Nia Jax mistiming spots, including weak chair shots on Naomi and Bayley), the finish was strong, and the crowd appeared to thoroughly enjoy it. Morgan continues to be a shining light whenever she’s on television.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-recommend-id="image://6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-recommend-id="image://6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> After returning to WWE television following an eye injury, former Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley’s primary objective each week was to destroy the women who kept her out of action for weeks. Ripley versus Liv Morgan inside a steel structure felt like a natural progression. Now sporting a protective face mask, the former Judgment Day member was highly motivated, telling her tag partners for WarGames that she was solely focused on Morgan. Generally speaking, this was the less intriguing of the two advertised WarGames matches. However, the subplot of “who attacked Jade” added an adequate amount of interest.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> As soon as Ripley left the cage, all the bad guys (Nia Jax and Raquel Rodriguez) in the ring waited to confront her, showcasing her intimidation factor. Amid chants of “This is awesome” from the audience, Ripley displayed her brawling prowess by breaking a toilet seat over Rodriguez’s back.</p><p>The 28-year-old superstar also demonstrated her intelligence during the match, capitalizing on her tag partner Iyo Sky’s use of a fire extinguisher to handcuff Rodriguez. The match’s finish saw Ripley deliver a devastating Riptide finisher to Morgan off the ropes and through a table. It was a satisfying conclusion to a rough WarGames match and a strong reminder of why Ripley has remained near the top of WWE’s pecking order for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-recommend-id="image://7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-recommend-id="image://7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 5</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> The Original Tribal Chief has been trying to get his hands on his real-life cousin Solo Sikoa for months, eager to face him in a one-on-one match, though Sikoa has made it clear he’s not interested. The new Bloodline leader defeated the former World Champion at Crown Jewel in a tag team match, serving as a catalyst for the buildup to WarGames at Survivor Series.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the event, Reigns and his cousins, Jimmy and Jey Uso, were searching for teammates for Survivor Series. After finally convincing OG Bloodline member Sami Zayn to rejoin their team, the good guys were still in need of a fifth member to complete the qualifications for the 5-on-5 match. In a shocking twist, the returning “Wise Man,” WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman, introduced the fifth member for the OG Bloodline team: none other than the original “Paul Heyman Guy,” CM Punk.</p><p>Reigns shares an extensive history with Punk, as the former World Champion served as a mercenary for Punk during his debut. This made for absolutely extraordinary television leading up to the 38th annual Survivor Series event.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Upon entering the ring, Reigns looked spectacular, scaling the WarGames cage (after Sikoa attempted to lock him out with his own chain) and hitting a diving crossbody on Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, Jacob Fatu, Bronson Reed, and Solo Sikoa. Even while focused on his offense, Reigns ensured the story of the match remained intact. At one point, Reigns helped each of his teammates to their feet—except Punk—adding tension to their dynamic. This seemed to be a response to Punk pushing Reigns aside (similar to Candice LeRae in her match) to enter the match before him, upsetting the Original Tribal Chief.</p><p>Reigns continued to dominate, landing a low blow on Fatu and delivering a massive spear to Solo. The Head of the Table secured the win after all of his teammates (Sami Zayn, Jimmy and Jey Uso, and CM Punk) surrounded Sikoa, allowing each to land a shot on him. Punk hit the Go to Sleep on Solo, and Reigns finished the match with a bone-rattling spear, earning the elusive pinfall victory. It was an outstanding way to end Survivor Series.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
