              <p><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> is the first 3D game in Nintendo’s ape-starring franchise since <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> way back in 1999, so expectations were high for the titular character’s newest outing. There’s a lot to love about this adventure, which sees Donkey Kong join up with a young Pauline as he punches, rolls, and slaps his way through open-ended levels filled with secrets and challenges. But how many hours will it take you to see everything? Let’s take a look at the length of the <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> campaign and what else there is to do beyond it.</p> <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>?</h2> <p>If you just want to punch your way through to the end of this DK expedition, <b>you can expect to spend around 10-15 hours beating the </b><b><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i></b><b> campaign</b>. This makes it a pretty beefy experience in an age where many 3D platformers come in at half that length or less. And that’s just for the base adventure! There’s still a ton of monkeying around to do beyond that.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-amiibo-letters-ball-outfit-1851786640">Here’s What Amiibos Can Do For You In <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i></a></p> <p><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>‘s world is immensely dense with extra things you can find to do beyond just reaching the end of its campaign. It is a 3D platformer, after all, so it wouldn’t be complete without a treasure trove of stuff to collect—though I hope that’s not bringing back any bad memories of <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> and its thousands of collectibles.</p>

 <p>You can opt to tackle finding everything in <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> during your initial playthrough, or you can dive back in after beating the main story. However you go about it, there’s a great time to be had tracking down all the Golden Bananas, Banandium Gems, music discs, and fossils in the game.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-co-op-support-gameshare-pauline-1851787349">Don’t Sleep On <i>Donkey Kong Banana</i>’s Co-Op Mode</a></p> <p>And while they’re all fun to find, definitely don’t pass up any opportunities to get fossils, even if you’re just trying to mainline the campaign. They’re cool because you can use them to unlock new outfits for DK and Pauline, which you can then mix and match to your fashion tastes. But more importantly, they often sport helpful passive bonuses like improved swimming speed or reduced damage from poison. Any bit of help you can get for survivability is a good thing, yeah?</p> <p>Whether you’re rushing through the campaign or trying to go for 100%, you can start bashing your way through <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> right away. The game is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>After the success of <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2</i> in 2020, it was only a matter of time before more of the famous skater’s beloved games got the remake treatment. After nearly five years, <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> has finally ollied onto the scene sporting a fresh coat of paint and a wide variety of enhancements to make it the best way to experience two skating classics.</p> <p>But if you have some friends who play their games on a different platform than you, you may be left wondering whether you can get into multiplayer matches with them in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i>. You might also be curious just how long these two games will last you. Let’s dive into everything you need to know about this classic skating experience.</p> <h2><span id="does-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3-+-4-support-crossplay"></span>Does <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> support crossplay?<span></span></h2> <p>If you’re hoping you can hop online and skate with friends who game on other platforms, well, you’re in luck! <b><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i></b><b> has full crossplay support across all platforms</b>. This means you can easily hop into multiplayer games with up to seven other players across all consoles and PC, opening up plenty of opportunities for grinding rails and popping tricks together.</p>

 <h2><span id="does-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3-+-4-support-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> support cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>While playing with anyone you want online is a huge win for virtual skaters everywhere, things don’t fare quite as well for cross-progression fans. <b><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i></b><b> does not support cross-progression at all</b>. As a result, any progress you make on one platform will not carry over to another, meaning you’ll need to start over entirely if you pick up the game on more than one device.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-skaters-are-in-the-games"></span>How many skaters are in the games?<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618079"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618079">© Screenshot: Iron Galaxy Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><i>THPS 3 + 4</i> will give you a total of 29 skaters to choose from, with a few hidden ones you can unlock as well.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Andrew Reynolds</li> <li aria-level="1">Aori Nishimura</li> <li aria-level="1">Aurélien Giraud</li> <li aria-level="1">Bob Burnquist</li> <li aria-level="1">Bucky Lasek</li> <li aria-level="1">Chad Muska</li> <li aria-level="1">Chloe Covell</li> <li aria-level="1">Elissa Steamer</li> <li aria-level="1">Eric Koston</li> <li aria-level="1">Geoff Rowley</li> <li aria-level="1">Jamie Foy</li> <li aria-level="1">Jamie Thomas</li> <li aria-level="1">Kareem Campbell</li> <li aria-level="1">Leo Baker</li> <li aria-level="1">Leticia Bufoni</li> <li aria-level="1">Lizzie Armanto</li> <li aria-level="1">Margielyn Didal</li> <li aria-level="1">Nora Vasconcellos</li> <li aria-level="1">Nyjah Huson</li> <li aria-level="1">Rayssa Leal</li> <li aria-level="1">Riley Hawk</li> <li aria-level="1">Rodney Mullen</li> <li aria-level="1">Rune Glifberg</li> <li aria-level="1">Shane O’Neill</li> <li aria-level="1">Steve Cabellero</li> <li aria-level="1">Tony Hawk</li> <li aria-level="1">Tyshawn Jones</li> <li aria-level="1">Yuto Horigome</li> <li aria-level="1">Zion Wright</li> </ul> <p>You can also unlock:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Andy Anderson</li> <li aria-level="1">Bam Margera</li> <li aria-level="1">Birdman</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-thps-3-4-officer-dick-unlock-panda-plush-locations-2000614519">Constable Richard (Officer Dick)</a></li> <li aria-level="1">Michelangelo</li> </ul> <p>The Doom Slayer and Revenant from the recent <i>Doom </i>games is also available via the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>

 <h2><span id="how-long-is-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3+4"></span>How long is <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836"><i>THPS 4 </i>doesn’t have a Career mode</a>, but you’ll still be able to complete certain goals on different parks like Foundry and Shipyard. In <i>THPS 3</i>, there are 9 parks to play on and 10 in <i>THPS 4.</i></p> <p>Each park has ten Standard goals and five Pro goals. It only takes about <b>4-5 hours</b> to complete all of the Standard goals.</p> <p>Once all the Standard goals have been completed, you’ll unlock Pro goals. Even after completing Pro goals, you’ll unlock Platinum goals. Each park has a single one and they usually involve pulling off a certain move somewhere in the park. These steps should take about another <b>5 hours.</b></p>

 <h2><span id="getting-100percent-in-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3+4"></span>Getting 100-percent in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618080" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618080"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618080">© Screenshot: Iron Galaxy Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>After completing all the Pro goals, you’ll unlock Solo Tour, and this is where the real time sink begins. There’s one trophy/achievement called Flying Solo. This requires you to beat the Solo Tour with <b>all 35 characters</b>. Yes, you’ll have to go through this mode at least 35 times. This is easily the most time-consuming part of the journey to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <p>But it’s important to note that you do not need to achieve 100% with every skater, which includes completing things like optional challenges. You only need to complete each skater’s unique career path to count towards Flying Solo.You do NOT need 100% with each skater. Just complete their unique career path once.</p>

 <p>Fortunately, there are no missable trophies/achievements so you can tackle them in any order you wish. There are also no difficulty-related ones, so you can customize the settings to your liking without having to worry. Overall, getting all of the trophies/achievements should take you between <b>25-35 hours.</b></p> <p>However, there are certain assist mods like Perfect Rail Balance and Instant Quick Recovery that can void trophies/achievements. There are two of them, which are “Extra Ball” and “Unprecedented.” Their descriptions specifically state that you cannot have assist mods activated..</p>

 <p><b>Extra Ball: </b>“Without Assist Mods, score 1,000,000 or over in Pinball.”<br> <b>Unprecedented:</b> “Without Assist Mods, earn a score of 10,000,000 in any park in a 2-minute session or single combo.”</p> <p>It seems like these two are the only ones impacted by assist mods, so you can turn them on when going for any other trophies/achievements. Good luck, and have fun!</p> <hr> <p>If you’re ready to team up with some pals and hit some skateparks and beyond in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i>, you can get started right away. The game is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The <i>Gears of War </i>franchise has a long history as one of Xbox’s most beloved properties, but the times are changing. Though it has seen life on PC in the past, <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> marks the time the series has made the move to a Sony platform. Yep, this substantial remaster of the first game in the franchise is finally available on PS5 (as well as Xbox and PC) with all the bells and whistles you’d expect, so it’s time to pick up a chainsaw and start chewing through the Locust horde.</p> <p>If you’d like to go online with <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i>, however, you’ll probably want to link up with your gaming posse. Blasting bodies apart with shotguns is better with friends, after all. So, let’s see if <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> has crossplay support and whether or not you can carry your progress between platforms.</p>  <p>If you’re looking to jump into gory gunfights together with friends, I’ve got some really great news for you! <b><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i></b><b> offers full cross-play support</b>, meaning you can team up with anyone across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC ecosystems. Regardless of platform, you’ll all need to be signed into your Microsoft accounts to make this happen, but <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account">that’s easy enough to set up</a>.</p>

 <p>Crossplay is available for both co-op and competitive multiplayer modes, so you and some friends are free to tackle the campaign or frag nerds online. But whatever you do, just don’t kill me. I’m really bad at <i>Gears</i> multiplayer, so you have to be nice. Mom said so.</p> <h2>Does <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> have cross-progression?</h2> <p>In another twist of good news in a world filled with bad news, <b><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i></b><b> also supports cross-progression</b>. With this feature, your progress can transfer between any platform on which you own the game. So, if you started on PC and decided you wanted to swap over to PS5, that’d be no problem at all! You’d just need to re-buy the game on Sony’s platform, and then you can pick up right where you left off.</p> <p>Cross-progression works for both your campaign and multiplayer progress, so you’ll lose nothing when swapping back and forth. Again, you’ll need a Microsoft account to use this feature, but that’s to be expected.</p> <hr> <p><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> is available August 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ruffy-and-the-riverside-platformer-short-steam-ps5-xbox-2000618070</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-knock-out-this-fun-3d-platformer-in-under-10-hours.1271781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If you’re the kind of person who likes quirky platformers with a whole lot of charm and whimsy, you may have your eyes set on <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i>. In this bizarre 3D platformer, you’re cast as the titular character who possesses the ability to copy and paste textures, allowing you to change the world around you to solve puzzles and reach new areas.</p> <p><i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> can be a whole lot of fun if you’re able to brave its frenetic gameplay and art style. But you may be wondering how long it’ll take you to reach the end of this rowdy adventure and how much extra content there is to dive into. Let’s answer that for you below.</p> <p><b>If you’re just mainlining </b><b><i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i></b><b>‘s campaign, you can likely reach the end of the game in about 6-8 hours</b>. This makes it notably shorter than some similar 3D platformers, but its wacky gameplay and clever puzzles ensure that not a moment is wasted. Even so, you may wish for a few extra hours when you realize how brief the main quest is, especially if you really click with the Swap ability and enjoy blasting textures all over the map.</p>

 <p>Luckily, there are a lot of optional things to do in <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> that can extend your time with the game, especially if you’re aiming to obtain all of its trophies or achievements. You’ll need to find a variety of optional secrets and collectibles, as well as swap textures over a thousand times. But given that a large part of the gameplay loop involves the Swap ability, you’ll be well on your way to that one anyway.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking to push through the campaign or track down every secret, you can get started doing so right away. <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ratshaker-playstation-store-horror-hltb-psn-2000618066</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you%E2%80%99re-on-the-lookout-for-a-short-worthwhile-horror-game-check-out-ratshaker.1271751/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If you look at <i>Ratshaker</i> on the PlayStation store, you might be inclined to write it off as one of hundreds of shovelware games on storefronts designed for easy trophies. I know I did at first. But then, I saw the game gaining traction across multiple subreddits where plenty of users seemed to agree that it’s actually a surreal horror title worth the low cost of entry — I checked it out. I’m glad I did.</p> <p>While <i>Ratshaker</i> may have a low-res visual style, brief runtime, and fairly easy trophy list, it manages to rise above the trappings of shovelware to be something that diehard horror fans can appreciate. The game tasks you with, well, shaking and squeezing a rat to solve some basic adventure-style puzzles around a home where something horrible has happened. Yeah, it’s fucking weird.</p> <p>But while <i>Ratshaker</i>‘s simple premise initially leans toward being quirky and funny in its delivery, don’t let that fool you. As you further explore the home and peel back what happened there, <i>Ratshaker</i> reveals some truly unnerving events that may stick in your head for a while. If that sounds up your alley, here’s how long it’ll take you to beat this bizarre experience.</p>

 <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Ratshaker</i>?</h2> <p><i>Ratshaker</i> is a cheap game with a short runtime, so you shouldn’t go in expecting an epic adventure. Instead, <b>you’re treated to an immensely strange horror mystery that will take about an hour to unravel</b>. But the brief time you spend with <i>Ratshaker</i> will feel like enough. It’s a game that doesn’t <i>need</i> much time to tell its story, which ends up far more unsettling than you may expect, even after engaging with its disturbing opening.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618068">© Screenshot: Sunscorched Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re also playing <i>Ratshaker</i> for its fairly easy platinum trophy, be aware that there are missable trophies throughout the adventure. And you’ll technically need to see both the real ending and a secret ending to earn the platinum trophy, but you can do both on one playthrough if you manage your saves right. Following a guide can help you not miss out on these trophies if you’re not eager to play <i>Ratshaker</i> twice.</p> <p>Even if you’re not seeking the easy platinum trophy, I’d argue that the low price and ominous vibes make <i>Ratshaker</i> a good grab for any horror fan who appreciates weird shit. It’s available now on PS5 and Windows PCs, with a release on additional platforms planned for later this summer. Shake that rat.</p>
