              <p>If you need extra screen space on the go, adding a portable monitor to your setup makes sense. These screens are bigger than tablets, connect to laptops, phones, and other devices using a cable, plus offer multiple viewing options for different needs.</p>
<p>Most solid options with basic functionality out there sit around $100, but you can treat yourself to one for less today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 15.6-inch InnoView portable monitor for just $57, after taking 42% off its retail price.</a> It’s an early Black Friday deal, but there’s a catch. At the time of writing, the deal is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members can grab it at a modest 5% drop, for $94. Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their purchase.</p>
<p>That said, now is a good time to grab a Prime subscription if you’ve been wanting to try it out. Black Friday is tomorrow, and just like this early deal, you can expect plenty of member-exclusive discounts. These are usually much steeper than the regular ones. Prime subscription costs $10 per month or $100 a year, and new users can enjoy a 30-day free trial before committing.</p>

<h2>Portable, But Powerful</h2>
<p>For a little over $50, you’re getting a 15.6-inch portable screen. The size matches that of most standard laptops out there, so you’re getting the same experience, just without the bulk.</p>
<p>This screen pushes a 1920×1080 resolution for clear, bright visuals, plus features an IPL panel for superior color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle makes it easy to enjoy consistent visuals from all angles, meaning you won’t always have to sit right in front of the monitor to see what’s being displayed. It’s great for when you’re sharing the screen with multiple users, as everyone can see clearly without trying to squeeze in. Additionally, low blue light support keeps it easier on the eyes by reducing the blue light radiation damage. You’ll be able to keep using the screen for longer hours without the usual eye strain.</p>



<p>Exceptional compatibility comes from 2 fully functional Type-C ports and 1 HDMI port that let you connect the monitor to a range of devices. Your device should just support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP ALT-mode. The setup is plug-and-play, meaning you only need a single USB-C cable to get started. If your device does not support a USB-C connection, you can still connect it through HDMI, but you’ll need both an HDMI cable and a separate power cable to proceed. There’s no single way to use it; you can expand your laptop’s display to work on the go, pair the monitor with your smartphone to stream on a bigger screen, and even use it with a console to play better. There are multiple display modes to choose from. We’re talking an Extend mode for a large desktop that spans across both screens, a Second screen mode to use both the screens for different tasks, and a Duplicate mode that mirrors your primary display.</p>
<p>The monitor comes with a scratch-resistant smart protective. Beyond protection, it can be used to prop the screen up. Two grooves let you find the right angle, so you can set it up literally anywhere you want, from a desk to even your couch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">The InnoView portable monitor is now down to just $57, all thanks to Black Friday.</a> It not only offers you a large screen, but also delivers stunning visuals, plus lets you choose between multiple viewing modes and even comes with a durable case. It’s great for freelancers, work professionals, students and even gamers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 9100 PRO SSD Falls Below $0.10 per GB Across All Capacities, Black Friday Just Broke the Price Floor]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/upgrade-your-pc-or-playstation5-storage-by-as-much-as-8tb-samsung-9100-pro-up-to-33-off-2000647606</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="318">As game sizes continue to grow with new releases sometimes topping 100GB, it’s becoming harder to make room to play them all. You have two options: either delete games after you finish them or expand your storage. The simpler and more permanent solution? Upgrading to a larger solid-state drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5983/">Currently, the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD is on sale at Amazon, offering discounts up to 33%.&nbsp;</a>This SSD is available in several storage sizes, including 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, and an enormous 8TB option. With the sale, you can save anywhere from $60 to $250 depending on the version you choose. The 1TB model is now $135 (down from $200), the 2TB version is $220 (down from $280), the 4TB model is priced at $370 (down from $470), and the 8TB version is available for $750 (down from $1,000).</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="318">Instead of constantly juggling downloads, you can switch between games whenever you feel like jumping back into an old favorite. This convenience extends to other large applications as well, whether you’re editing 4K footage from large files or storing extensive media collections.</p>

<p data-start="1136" data-end="1568">Beyond just giving you all that extra storage space, the Samsung 9100 Pro will deliver solid performance. With read speeds reaching 14,700 MB/s and write speeds of up to 13,300 MB/s, this SSD offers blazing-fast data transfers while remaining power-efficient. Whether you’re gaming, editing videos, working with large datasets, or whatever else it is you do at your computer, the Samsung 9100 Pro provides the performance you need without putting unnecessary strain on your system’s power usage.</p>
<h2 data-start="1136" data-end="1568">PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2047">If you’re a PlayStation 5 owner, you’ve probably noticed that storage can be tight. The PS5 comes with only 825GB of internal storage, and with the growing size of AAA games, you’ll find yourself deleting and reinstalling games just to make room for new ones. Fortunately, the PS5 allows you to expand its storage with a compatible M.2 SSD, and the Samsung 9100 Pro is one such option. However, if you want to avoid overheating, it’s crucial to get the version with a heatsink. These are small metal casings that sit around the SSD which allow heat to dissipate.</p>


<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Installing the SSD in your PS5 is a straightforward process that you can follow along with watching any number of YouTube tutorials. Right now, the 2TB version with a heatsink is priced at $209, the 4TB version is $399, and the big 8TB version is $800. The 1TB with heatsink option is currently out of stock.</p>
<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Heatsinks on their own go for about $10 to $20. Now when you compare each of the Samsung 9100 Pro SSDs here, with and without heatsink, there’s definitely a drop off in value. The 2TB option with a heatsink is actually cheaper than without so there’s not reason not to pick up that one (where you end up using the heatsink or not). The 4TB model is about $20 more with a heatsink. That isn’t bad but you might be able to pick up the standard version and find a different heatsink for less. Then the 8TB price difference is laughable. It’s $50 more to get it with the heatsink. Don’t do that. Get yourself another one for far less.</p>
