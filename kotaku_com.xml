              <p>Disney’s 20th Century has announced that a new movie based on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544">long-running animated TV sitcom<em> The Simpsons</em></a> is in the works. The newly announced sequel will arrive in 2027, 20 years after the release of the first <em>Simpsons</em> flick.</p> <p>On September 29,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPMgc7Yj0PE/#"> Disney and 20th Century announced on social media</a> that a new <em>Simpsons</em> film was officially in development. No plot details were shared about the movie, but Disney did post a teaser poster for the upcoming sequel. The poster features Homer Simpson grabbing a pink doughnut covered in sprinkles shaped like the number 2, likely hinting that the movie will be titled <em>The Simpsons Movie 2</em>.&nbsp; The tagline “Homer’s combing back for seconds” is included on the poster. So, good news, Homer is back. Shocking, I know, but there you go.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Woohoo! The Simpsons are coming to theaters with an all-new movie on July 23, 2027! <a href="https://t.co/wVqxwn8rLc">pic.twitter.com/wVqxwn8rLc</a></p> <p>— 20th Century Studios (@20thcentury) <a href="https://twitter.com/20thcentury/status/1972723057396690948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Created by Matt Groening and premiering in 1989,&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons</em> is the longest-running sitcom on TV. While many have criticized the show’s quality since the late ’90, the series has remained extremely popular on TV and is considered an anchor of Fox’s Sunday block of animated TV shows. The original <em>Simpsons</em> movie premiered in July 2007 and was a huge box office hit, earning over $536 million at the global box office. That movie featured a story about a giant dome being put over the town of Springfield due to pollution. It also brought back old former writers, took years to make, and featured a more detailed art style.</span></p> <p><span>We’ve heard rumors for years of a second <em>Simpsons</em> movie, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_Who_Came_to_Be_Dinner#:~:text=However%2C%20according%20to,a%20regular%20episode.">including a proposed follow-up featuring the franchise’s alien characters</a> Kang and </span><span>Kodos</span><span>. That movie didn’t move forward as the writing staff couldn’t stretch the plot out to a full-length movie. But now it seems the writers and producers behind the show have finally nailed the plot for the next flick. Now we just have to wait until 2027.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-retro-trailer-judgement-day-snes-1851766852"><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em></a> is an upcoming video game adaptation of the original ’90s action movie sequel that is designed to look, sound, and play like classic 2D games from that era. <em>No Fate</em> looks really awesome. But sadly, due to ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump, this cool-looking <em>Terminator</em> game has been delayed (again) from October to November.</p> <p>On September 28, <em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau announced that the upcoming side-scrolling action game was being delayed a second time until November 26. <a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-november-26-2025">In a statement posted to the publisher’s official website</a>, the company blamed the delay on “ongoing global trade and tariff changes” that caused shipping issues with components needed to produce the Day One and Collector’s Editions versions of the game. And because the studio and publisher want to ship the game to all platforms and users at the same time, <em>No Fate’s</em> release date was pushed back. This delay affects digital and physical copies worldwide.</p>  <p>“We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we’re sorry for this further delay,” said Reef Entertainment. “The team is working hard to make sure your wait is worth it, and we can’t wait to share <em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> with you all this November.”</p> <p>This isn’t the first delay for<em> Terminator 2D: No Fate.</em> In July, the 2D action platformer based on James Cameron’s iconic action flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was delayed from its initial release date of<a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-october-31-2025"> September 5 to October 31, just in time for Halloween</a>. But that’s not happening anymore, and you can directly blame Trump, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">who continues to screw around with tariffs haphazardl</a>y, causing global chaos for those trying to buy, ship, or import products or resources to the United States.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-max-11-tablet-hits-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days-hundreds-cheaper-than-an-ipad-2000627185</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-fire-max-11-tablet-hits-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days-hundreds-cheaper-than-an-ipad.1311784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’d be telling you that this limited-time deal on the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is hot, or that it’s fire, or that it’s a scorcher, but honestly, would you still respect us in the morning? So we’ll dispense with the terrible puns and cut straight to the deal, because it’s one of the better ones we’ve seen in a while on this great, affordable tablet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/">It’s 32% off for a limited time, turning a very good $280 price into a great one at just $190.</a></p>
<p>To put things in perspective, the Amazon Fire Max 11 is an 11-inch tablet with an octa-core processor, 14-hour battery life, expandable storage of up to 1TB via microSD card, and 2.4 million pixel resolution. As an Amazon product it blends seamlessly with the rest of the Amazon ecosystem, including Prime Video, Kindle, Audible, and Luna, along with your smart home devices via either Alexa or the Device Dashboard. And here’s the kicker — at this sale price it’s over $700 less than the 11-inch M4 iPad Pro, and $375 less than the 11-inch M3 iPad Air.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Features, Not Price</h2>
<p>There are probably metrics and benchmark tests that put those pricier iPads ahead of the Fire Max 11, but not nearly enough to quantify the price difference. The octa-core processor at the heard of the Fire Max 11 is certainly no slouch when it comes to streaming, multitasking, and gaming on Luna. The 128GB of storage is small, but so easily and inexpensively expandable thanks to the microSD card slot that the Apple tablets lack.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 speeds, a robust 14-hour battery life, 8MP camera, and options to expand into a more laptop-like experience with the sold-separately Fire Max 11 Keyboard Case — which also happens to be&nbsp;<em>way</em> more affordable than Apple’s Magic Keyboard — all make the Fire Max 11 highly competitive even before you do a price comparison. Once you check out those numbers, this isn’t even a fair contest.</p>



<h2>Beautifully Basic</h2>
<p>When you look at the Fire Max 11 — and this is the latest, most updated iteration of the Fire Max — in the context of being a fully integrated part of the massive Amazon ecosystem, it’s a brilliant tablet, especially for just $190. It’s not going to compete with a laptop as a productivity machine, although this deal does come with a free 3-month Microsoft 365 trial, but as an e-reader, streaming device, smart-home control panel, and light gaming device, it’s an exceptional tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-octa-core-processor-lockscreen/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6?tag=kotaku01-20">This model of the Amazon Fire Max currently on sale for just $190</a> has the max 128GB storage and also comes with lockscreen ads deactivated. The $90 savings on this deal are great, and even greater when you tack them onto the hundreds you save by avoiding the super-bougie competitor tablets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You would think that The Pokémon Company and GameStop would know that turning something that could easily have been distributed digitally into a physical item, only obtainable in stores, would attract the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>Mandibuzz-like vultures who circle the franchise</span></a><span> looking for a way to scalp its merch to make a quick buck. That’s exactly what’s happened with a partnership to give out free codes for rare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny Pokémon</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span>, as scalpers have found a way to ruin something else for everyone.</span></p> <p><span>Here’s what was supposed to happen: from September 26 to October 15, fans who visit GameStops or EB Games locations would be able to get a code to receive either a Shiny Koraidon or Miraidon, the legendary Pokémon that grace </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s covers. These alternate-colored variants have never been available before, so if you’re the kind of collector who wants every Shiny, this is a pretty big deal. No purchase was required to get one of these codes; all you had to do was show up at participating locations. However, many fans are reporting that their local stores are running out of codes weeks before the promotion ends next month, and some locations say they won’t be getting more. Some customers report that stores still have codes but have been </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/1nqg2ay/local_gamestop_shiny_koraidon_and_miraidon/"><span>giving them out only as a promotional item</span></a><span> alongside other purchases, despite the official word on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s website </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/get-shiny-koraidon-or-shiny-miraidon-at-gamestop-and-eb-games"><span>saying no purchase is necessary</span></a><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>Sometimes these events are digital, meaning that you could download an event Pokémon in a store or through the game itself and go on your merry way. But when they involve a physical card with a code on it, supplies actually </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> limited, and when something is limited, a scalper is waiting just around the corner to swoop in. This also happened the same day as a new </span><i><span>Trading Card Game</span></i><span> set drop, so these people smelled blood in the water, and not only got the codes, but have started listing them for sale on places like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=shiny+koraidon+and+miraidon&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1311"><span>eBay</span></a><span>. Some of the prices are fairly cheap at less than $10, while other sellers are getting bold and asking for much more. Even if the price is cheap, these codes are supposed to be free, so even a dollar is a profit for scalpers.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>As some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFl1XUEqcls">commentators have pointed out</a>, <em>Pokémon </em></span><span>loves brand synergy, which is why every facet of its business releases new products around the same time. The games come out, new TCG sets come out alongside it, and more plushes of new critters show up on the Pokémon Center website, so it makes sense that it would offer these rare Pokémon on the same day people are showing up to game shops to buy the new TCG sets. That said, adding scarcity to a digital good just emboldens some of the worst people to keep taking advantage of other fans. Hopefully, these stores get more codes between now and when the promotion ends in October, because only sending enough for one weekend sounds like poor planning on everyone’s part.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-battlefield-6-trailer-is-a-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty.1311775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new live-action trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-have-a-button-that-blows-up-everything-in-a-map-and-its-fun-to-press-it-2000626898">Electronic Arts’ upcoming<em> Battlefield 6</em> </a>features a group of celebrities, including Zac Efron, getting swiftly blown up by a missile in what seems to be a dig at <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s many commercials featuring actors, musicians, and other famous people. It’s the latest example of the two military shooter franchises reacting to one another in a way we’ve not seen in years.</p> <p>On September 28, EA released the “<em>Battlefield 6</em>: Official Launch Live-Action Trailer.” And like many live-action<em> Call of Duty</em> ads from the last decade, the <em>BF6</em> commercial starts off with a group of celebs cosplaying as soldiers and getting ready to fight. But just 24 seconds into the new trailer, a missile flies into frame and blows up all four stars in a large, fiery explosion. A group of soldiers then walks through the area, with one asking, “Who was that?” and the other bluntly replying that it “doesn’t matter” before telling everyone to move out.</p>  <p>While the new ad doesn’t directly mention <em>Call of Duty</em>, it’s obvious what EA is doing here. For many, many years, <em>Call of Duty</em> games have used celebrities like Will Arnett, Jonah Hill, Michael B. Jordan, Cara Delevingne, and many others in various live-action trailers. <a href="https://youtu.be/yXzMOUCYGBs">As recently as 2021,<em> Call of Duty</em> featured numerous celebs in a <em>Warzone</em> ad</a> that was heavily criticized by fans for going too far and feeling too silly. This new <em>BF6</em> trailer feels like a direct nod to those <a href="https://youtu.be/IhPyNuqewZU">celeb-heavy launch ads</a> and a commitment from EA that it won’t follow in <em>CoD’s</em> footsteps, a move that fans in the comments of the trailer seem to greatly appreciate.</p>

 <p>Over the years<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">, longtime <em>CoD</em> players have lamented</a> the franchise’s shift away from grounded combat and realism as bizarre crossover skins and over-the-top future tech have become more prevalent in recent entries. This has all come to a head in 2025 as <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, which had a massively popular open beta earlier this year, has gone the opposite direction and doubled down on being a gritty, grounded, and realistic military shooter. Activision has responded by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-changes-black-ops-7-pre-order-operator-skins/">making changes to skins</a>, rolling back plans to let all <em>Black Ops 6</em> skins move forward into <em>Black Ops 7,</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-blops7-skins-goofy-crossover-turned-down-deals-bf6-grounded-2000628200">even letting devs talk publicly about the series turning down some collaboration cosmetic deals</a>.</p>

 <p>It’s very, very unlikely that <em>Battlefield 6</em> will outsell <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> this year. But it seems like EA’s FPS might take a bigger bite out of the rival shooter series than it has in previous years, and Activision is definitely paying attention. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">The news that EA is being bought up by Saudi Arabia’s PIF</a> as well as other investors, including Jared Kushner’s investment firm, has certainly added <a href="https://kotaku.com/electronic-arts-acquisition-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner-2000629849">an awkwardness to <em>BF6</em>‘s rollout</a>, though.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> will launch on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. EA won’t talk about a Switch 2 port. <em>Black Ops 7</em> launches on consoles and PC in November. <a href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">It also isn’t going to be available on Switch 2.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest YouTube video stunt by one <a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-lawsuit-beast-games-amazon-hidden-cameras-1851775284">James “MrBeast” Donaldson</a> has already wracked up over 46 million views in just one day and it’s not hard to imagine why. Titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo7i8VTpfNM&amp;t=28s">Would You Risk Dying For $500,000?</a>” it shows a series of challenges in which people brave flame-engulfed obstacles in exchange for money. It’s kind of like David Blaine if, instead of doing absurd and wild stuff himself, he paid other people to do it while also explaining how it was all incredibly fake and just for grim lulz.</p> <p>The infernal trap that’s been drawing the most attention is one in which a stuntman is tied to a chair inside a “burning house” and has to escape and save as much money as he can from inside the house in order to earn the highest cash prize possible. Donaldson bounces back and forth between urgent warnings about how real the flames are and mugging the camera with jokes about MrBeast product placement. The entertainment concept is more grotesquely mundane than anything Phillip K. Dick could have imagined and also, clearly, highly entertaining to millions of people.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This blew up, if you’re curious obviously we had ventilation for the smoke and a kill switch to cut off the fires. We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man. I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine.</p> <p>— MrBeast (@MrBeast) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1972507399413260366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Donaldson defended his uniquely gifted intuition for creating the debased content people crave by promising the whole stunt was tested with professionals multiple times, responding to viral posts about the stunt with additional context. The last thing Donaldson needs after lawsuits last year over <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-internal-investigation-findings-sexual-misconduct-1235150941/">alleged safety violations on his Amazon Prime</a> show is people thinking he doesn’t take the premise of potentially roasting another human being alive for less than the median home price after taxes seriously.</p>

 <p>“We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man,” he wrote on X over the weekend. “I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine.” He expanded on the setup in a comment on the YouTube video as well.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6/app.bsky.feed.post/3lzy22r723k2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiglqdgk2xfrl3d2mts5fqecakrqwbllpidp6sbsybsdamtbhqirve"> <p lang="en">Content creators tend to think any spectacle is defensible if they can say health and safety concerns have been attended to behind the scenes, but that’s not really it imho. Mr. Beast’s whole thing is that his subjects’ desperation for cash allows him—a wealthier person—to indulge his sadism.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6?ref_src=embed">southpaw (@nycsouthpaw.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6/post/3lzy22r723k2w?ref_src=embed">2025-09-29T12:45:09.235Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>“In case there’s any concern about the safety of the stuntman contestant, I just wanted to mention that we take safety extremely seriously,” he added. “Every challenge was tested by multiple stuntmen, we have a full rescue team on standby with firefighters, EMTs and divers equipped with an ambulance and fire truck. We also had a pyro team controlling the fires and multiple fire suppression methods on every challenge to ensure we could essentially turn off the fire if there was ever an issue. But our stunt coordinator did an amazing job as always, and none of these systems were ever needed. Just wanted to be transparent with you all since I saw some concern!”</p> <p>This is the Catch-22 at the heart of this entire genre of extremely watchable algorithm-bait. Either the entire thing is so real and authentic that it’s an absolutely monstrous thing for everyone involved to be associated with and signals the utter depravity of modern capitalism, or the stunt is all so fake and performative that none of it matters and you’ve been conned out of 25 minutes of your week just so some guy can hock candy bars.</p> <p>Either way, it kinda sucks!</p>
