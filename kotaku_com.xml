              <p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">has been out in the wild for several months now</a>, but we still know very little about what Nintendo has planned for its future. Could that be about to change? The next Nintendo Direct is reportedly planned for mid-September and seems poised to offer way more than just a deep dive into the company’s holiday lineup.</p> <p>While there’s a big Nintendo Direct almost every September, the company’s post-Switch 2 launch marketing has been all over the place. <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">A new rumor from SwitchForce</a>, however, claims a Nintendo Direct is planned for September 12. That’s a Friday, which would be a bizarre time for a Nintendo showcase. Perhaps that’s the Japan date, which would put the showcase during the late afternoon on Thursday, a much more believable time for a livestream. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/"><em>VGC</em> corroborated the broader claim</a> that Nintendo is holding a mid-September Direct, but was unable to specify the date. It’s possible Nintendo’s plans could still change.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> for the NES arrived on September 13, 1985, making next month the franchise’s 40th anniversary. That would make a Nintendo Direct the perfect time to announce a new Mario-themed Switch 2, Switch Online multiplayer spin-off, the return of <em>Super Mario 3D All-Star</em>s, or something more. I’m hoping for an HD remake of <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em>.</p>

 <h2>Where is the Switch 2’s new 3D <em>Mario</em>?</h2> <p>Fans are also still waiting on a release date for <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, which Nintendo continues to affirm will come out in 2025. With <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> coming in October and <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> in Novembe</a>r, December is looking like the only option at this point, unless the company can sneak out its new sci-fi shooter earlier than expected. There are still some Switch 1 games ripe for Switch 2 updates like <em><a href="https://x.com/MONOLITHSOFT/status/1959813021230149807">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em>.</p> <p>As for what lies beyond this year, there are already some previously announced exclusives, like<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753"><em> The Duskbloods</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179"><em>Splatoon Raiders,</em></a> waiting in the wings. But Nintendo has yet to tease new arrivals in some of its biggest franchises, like <em>Animal Crossing</em>,<em> Super Smash Bros.,</em> and<em> The Legend of Zelda</em>. And then there’s Mario. Reports that the <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> team is a splinter group from the original <em>Mario Odyssey</em> team suggest the plumber’s next big platforming adventure could be just around the corner. Would Nintendo really let the Switch 2 go its whole inaugural year without a new <em>Mario</em> game?</p> <p>The company has seemingly spent the last few years of the Switch 1’s lifecycle saving up big releases for its new hardware. Maybe it’ll finally pull back the curtain on what some of them are next month.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-the-kotaku-review-2000619735</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Reflecting on my time with </span><i><span>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</span></i><span> while I watched the credits roll, I recalled a close friend of mine from high school. Before the start of first period, she’d usually vent to me about how stressed she felt juggling so many extracurricular activities that she wound up staying at school for nearly 12 hours every weekday. Her reason for maintaining such a rigorous afterschool schedule was that so many different people were counting on her, and she didn’t want to let anyone down. Concerned for her health and happiness, the only advice I could offer her was, “You don’t have to be everyone’s friend.”</span></p> <p><span>I won’t bury the lede too deep here: I enjoyed </span><i><span>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</span></i><span>. It’s a cool game that’s rich with Sega nostalgia, and you’ll probably have fun with it if it seems like your kind of thing. However, much like my high school friend, </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>feels stretched thin by the sheer amount of bases it tries to cover despite its relatively small scope.</span></p> <p><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>places players in the shoes of Sega’s original </span><i><span>Shinobi </span></i><span>protagonist, Joe Musashi. His peaceful life with his very pregnant wife is immediately thrust into turmoil after his clan’s village is brutally attacked by a paramilitary organization bent on—you’re not gonna believe this—world domination. With rage boiling in his heart, Joe embarks on a quest to pursue his attackers and exact his revenge. Of course there’s that “save the world” business too, but make no mistake, this battle is personal. Unfortunately, the blade of revenge cuts both ways, and Joe will have to come face to face with the very cycle of life and death itself before he can rest at journey’s end.</span></p>

 <p><span>To address the elemental ninjitsu in the room, </span><i><span>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>is wildly dissimilar to last month’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-2d-blasphemous-1851787265"><i><span>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</span></i></a><span>. Sure, both are revivals of dormant ninja-themed sidescrollers that originated in the late 80s. Heck, Joe’s call to adventure even resembles the way </span><i><span>Ragebound </span></i><span>opens with a demon attack on the Hayabusas’ village. However, while I’d describe </span><i><span>Ragebound </span></i><span>as a retro-influenced game that can appeal to modern audiences, </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance</span></i><span> comes off as a modern character action game distilled into a 2D form that retro enthusiasts can enjoy. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to potatoes.</span></p> <h2><strong>C-C-C-Combo Breaker</strong></h2> <p><span>Though Joe Musashi hasn’t played the starring role in a video game for over three decades (I’m sorry if this makes you feel old), his moveset in </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>shows he’s no worse for wear. From the moment you hit the start button, the ninja master can effortlessly throw kunai, chain together light and heavy attacks, and bust out limited special moves to diffuse otherwise dire situations. As a fledgling ninja-in-training learning the controls, I immediately fell in love with how fluid this combo-heavy combat felt. I could effortlessly weave together strings of attacks while I dashed around enemies after mere minutes of practice, and I loved how Joe could instantly fly straight through weakened enemies all over the screen to perform executions. Even when the game cranks up the challenge later on, it’s one hell of a power fantasy from start to finish.</span></p> <p><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>does take a while to fully unlock its combat system, though. While Joe’s starting kit is serviceable, most of his attacks are locked behind shop upgrades and hidden unlocks (more on this later). That said, this system did let me learn and ease into every move in my arsenal, which the game absolutely rewards. Sure, I </span><i><span>could </span></i><span>button-mash my way to victory if I wanted to. But to efficiently take down opponents, I had to note which attacks deplete enemy armor, inflict the most damage, or just let me strike from an angle that wouldn’t see me eating a counterattack. This might sound daunting, but if anything, fully unlocking Joe’s kit makes it easier to pull off flashy and intuitive combos. </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>feels simultaneously simple and expressive via its controls.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619737" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619737"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619737">©Sega</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Regardless of your skill level, it’s easy to feel like a badass when playing a game as outrageously gorgeous as </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance</span></i><span>. Developer Lizardcube has worked on some great-looking games, so I don’t say lightly that </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance</span></i><span> is by far the team’s best work yet. The hand-drawn character animations look absolutely spectacular, and the level backgrounds are so rich with detail that I often stopped just to soak in the scenery. As I scoured through my screenshots to find images for this review, I couldn’t believe how often the in-game action looked like those impossibly good-looking bullshots that publishers use to market games that never look </span><i><span>that </span></i><span>phenomenal in actuality. To say </span><i><span>Shinobi </span></i><span>has never looked better is an understatement: This is a visual labor of love down to the smallest details.</span></p> <h2><strong>Character action adventure</strong></h2> <p><span>The mechanical foundation and presentation of </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>is fantastic, but where it starts to lose me is in its level design. To answer the question lingering in the minds of any sidescrolling enthusiasts reading this, this game </span><i><span>is </span></i><span>a Metroidvania…kind of. It’s technically stage-based, but each level is expansive and littered with optional paths that lead to collectibles and permanent stat boosts. In true Metroidvania fashion, most of these secrets require late-game traversal upgrades to reach. </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>presents itself as an action game first and foremost, but I got the sense that Lizardcube added these exploratory elements to offer players some optional challenges and pad the total runtime a bit.</span></p>

 <p><span>In practice, most areas were worse off for this “have your cake and eat it too” approach. I didn’t find the level exploration especially compelling, as it usually devolved into finding obvious detours and turning around whenever I saw walls. Additionally, many of these wide-open levels fail to emphasize the game’s stellar combat system. I was genuinely alarmed by how easy it was to just pass by many enemies rather than spend time fighting them. Meanwhile, several instances where combat </span><i><span>is </span></i><span>required consisted of waves of enemies that rarely forced me to switch up my battle strategy. Fortunately, boss battles were always a blast and rewarded mastery of Joe’s abilities, so I always looked forward to those highs at the end of each stage.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000619738" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619738"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619738">© Sega</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some levels do admittedly benefit from the open-ended approach. Neo City is a shining example: Its nonlinear layout creates great replay value, and the backing track from Tee Lopes that perfectly emulates Yuzo Koshiro’s classic </span><i><span>Streets of Rage </span></i><span>sound (Koshiro himself appears on the soundtrack!) made the entire area a joy from start to finish. Meanwhile, stages like the Submarine Base that see Joe s-l-o-w-l-y pushing canisters into holes to unlock doors were okay my first time through, but a genuine slog to revisit in the postgame Arcade Mode.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s not just the exploration that made the game feel a bit stretched thin. </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>sprinkles in numerous platforming challenges, mostly as obstacles to overcome to get those aforementioned secrets. Some stick the landing, like the frantic autoscrolling challenges where Joe has to run away from monsters and enemy gunfire while vaulting from platform to platform.&nbsp; Meanwhile, during the precision platforming segments I sometimes felt as if I was battling against</span> <span>the game’s core controls, such as in moments when I had to hold the jump button at the right time to run up a wall without accidentally double jumping. The platforming’s mostly okay, but it for sure ain’t </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/celeste-the-kotaku-review-1822420606"><i><span>Celeste</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Even the story never settles on a consistent tone. There’s a running gag about Joe only communicating via grunts, which did get a chuckle out of me the first four or five times I saw it. However, </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>absolutely </span><i><span>refuses </span></i><span>to let up this bit, even during dramatic scenes that are otherwise treated seriously. It’s certainly possible to mix drama with absurdity—the edgy </span><i><span>Pac-Man</span></i><span> reboot </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth</span></i> <a href="https://maxutmost.com/review-shadow-labyrinth/"><span>actually did this well</span></a><span>.</span> <span>However, </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance</span></i><span>’s efforts to do so are clunky where deftness is required; the game doesn’t know when to let a serious moment just be a serious moment. Taken together, these issues create a game that feels incohesive despite its strengths.</span></p>

 <h2><strong>It’s everyone’s friend</strong></h2> <p><span>Nothing about </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>made me outright dislike</span> <span>it. Rather, I mostly wish it focused more on exploring its combat system. As much as I loved learning and unlocking all of Joe’s attacks, by the endgame I found myself settling on a couple go-to attacks that efficiently dealt with 90 percent of my opponents. I actually went back and scored S-Ranks in every level just to see if I’d ever feel pressured to change my strategy, but ironically, the opposite happened. Because the scoring system weighs avoiding damage so heavily, I felt outright </span><i><span>discouraged</span></i><span> from getting inventive with the combat when simply jumpkicking everything with the right build was way safer and just as effective.</span></p> <p><span>Still, for all my misgivings, I’ll say that </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>did make me care about </span><i><span>Shinobi </span></i><span>again. As video game historian Jeremy Parish notes in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8QexCK4kIs"><span>his retrospective of </span><i><span>Shinobi</span></i></a><span>, a major strength of this series is its ability to remix its own concepts to “suit the current moment.” Indeed, there is an absolute abundance of inspiration on display here from classic games that </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>draws on, yet the game itself feels distinctly modern in its design philosophy. So if the goal was strictly to recapture the spirit of </span><i><span>Shinobi</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>is undeniably a success.</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Shinobi: Art of Vengeance           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>back-of-the-box quote</p>                 <p>"At long last, the dog from Shadow Dancer returns!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game</p>                 <p>2D hack-and-slash platformer with some Metroidvania elements.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked</p>                 <p>Jaw-dropping visuals, excellent combat mechanics, great boss encounters.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Exploration felt unfulfilling and took focus away from combat, story is tonally inconsistent, platforming is hit or miss.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Sega, Lizardcube</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms</p>                 <p>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC (Played).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date</p>                 <p>August 26, 2025 (Early Access), August 29, 2025 (General Release).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>32 hours. 100% completed the story mode.

I also feel slightly empty as I think back on it. I can respect the effort that was put into the wide net of play experiences the game offers, just as I can see why my friend wanted to know and help everyone she knew. That said, this is also the first time I’ve really remembered that friend in nearly 20 years. Pleasant memories aren’t always lasting memories, and that’s how </span><i><span>Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>sits with me: A game that was worth my time, but didn’t strongly resonate with me either.</span></p> <p><i><span>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance </span></i><span>has all the right stuff at its core. The fluid action is a blast at its best, and the breathtaking visuals are a sight to behold. Unfortunately, the unfulfilling exploration and so-so platforming keep the game from hitting its full potential. It’s an enjoyable playthrough on a rainy day, especially for the person who wants a strong hit of Sega nostalgia or needs to decompress from more intensive games. But like spending time with someone who wants to be everyone’s friend, the experience feels a little too shallow for its own good. <em>Shinobi</em>’s long overdue return is easy to like, I just wish I could love it too.&nbsp;</span></p>
