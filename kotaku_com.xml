If you’re wanting to track some of these items down more often, though, all hope is not lost.</p><h2 id="h211307"><a id=""></a>Where to find Stonesword Keys in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2><p>Given the random nature of every run in <em> Nightreign</em>, there aren’t many spots on the map that can guarantee a specific piece of loot. This obviously applies to Stonesword Keys as well, meaning your chances of grabbing one in an expedition can feel like a stroke of luck. </p><p>However, the good news is that there are a few locations you can aim for that have a higher drop rate for this coveted item. We’re not talking a 100-percent drop rate here, but they drop frequently enough from these points of interest to be worth visiting.</p><figure id="" data-id="0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-recommend-id="image://0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-recommend-id="image://0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here are some good locations to find Stonesword Keys:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Small Castles</strong>: There are usually a few small castles on the map that can be cleared easily. They’ll sometimes have an Abductor Virgin enemy on the base level, but will more often have a quick and simple fight against a knight boss at the top. Behind the boss will be a chest that you can open, which has a good chance of containing a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Medium Castles</strong>: You’ll also sometimes find medium-sized castles that are gated off and require you to enter via the sewers at the very bottom of the structure. Here, you can make your way up the wooden stairs inside to find a room halfway up containing a group of enemies. A side room here has a chest that may contain a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Ruined Cathedrals</strong>: Not to be confused with the small cathedrals where you find flask upgrades, ruined cathedrals are large, broken structures that are hard to miss. You’ll encounter basic enemies here, as well as a boss located either near the altar or by dropping down a hole in the center. Bosses aside, just defeat any nearby foes and check behind the altar in the center of the cathedral for a chest that has a solid chance of dropping a Stonesword Key for you.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to track down some extra Stonesword Keys, get out there and beat some ass at the gaols. Just don’t be surprised if one day you open up a gaol and get a whole lot more than you bargained for…ut that’s a discussion for another day!</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s not clear how exactly, and Benzies is cagey about the details in his<em> GamesIndustry.biz </em>interview, but it sounds an awful lot like Roblox-style exploitation is part of the model.</p><p>“We have plans to add multiplayer, [and] we have plans to make a full open world,” he said. “And of course, we’ve also got to look at what players are creating, and incorporate that into our plans. Given the ease of the tools, we think there’s going to be a high percentage of players who will jump in and give it a pop, see how it feels. Hopefully some will create compelling content we can then promote and make that part of our plans to push to other players.”</p><p>I, too, hope “some will create compelling content,” and by “some” I mean the team at Build A Rocket Boy, which is selling a $60 game and a paid premium pass required to access some of the additional post-launch content. Elsewhere in the interview, Benzies talks about the spectrum of crafting in games, saying he hopes the building tools will be somewhere in the middle between <em>Roblox </em>(hard but expansive) and <em>Minecraft</em> (easy but simple). Epic recently announced it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/epic-games-fortnite-based-roblox-killer-still-has-a-way-to-go&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/epic-games-fortnite-based-roblox-killer-still-has-a-way-to-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paid out over $300 million</a></span> to people making stuff in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>“The dream from the building side is to allow players the opportunity to create their own multiplayer open world games with ease,” Benzies told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. “So anyone could pick up the game, jump in, drive around, stop at a point where they see something of interest, build a little mission, jump back in the car, drive again, build another mission. Once you’ve built a couple of hundred of these, you’ve built your own open world game. So, that’s the build side.”</p><p>Those are lofty goals for a brand-new game from a first-time studio. If the underlying game can deliver something solid, maybe there’s a chance, but if not, I don’t think the promise of user-generated content will be enough to bail <em>MindsEye</em> out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve,” ZeniMax QA tester and bargaining committee member Jessee Leese <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a press release</a></span>. “Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We’re the ones who make these games, and we’ll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment.”</p><p>The contract will now go to the full membership for review with a ratification vote planned for June 20. Once completed, ZeniMax devs, including staff at Bethesda Game Studios, will have won the first collective bargaining agreement of any of the major gaming unions that have formed in recent years. Sega of America staff are also currently in negotiations for a contract, as are developers at other Microsoft-owned studios including the<em> Overwatch 2</em> and <em>World of Warcraft </em>teams at Blizzard as well as <em>Call of Duty </em>testers at Raven Software. </p><p>The ZeniMax contract comes just two months after union employees there <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bethesda-union-eso-6-fallout-doom-indiana-jones-1851774083&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-union-eso-6-fallout-doom-indiana-jones-1851774083">threatened to go on strike</a></span> if an agreement wasn’t reached following a nearly two-year-long negotiation process. The Communications Workers of America, which represents ZeniMax Workers United and other Microsoft gaming unions, previously filed an unfair labor practice charge against the tech giant claiming it was slow-walking the talks. The new contract, once ratified, will provide important benchmarks for other teams currently hashing out agreements. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
