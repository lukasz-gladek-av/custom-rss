                  The best value for money for a Lenovo laptop lately.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Amazon occasionally drops deals that seem too aggressive to be real and this Lenovo gaming laptop falls squarely into that category with specifications that cover gaming, entertainment and serious work tasks across the board. Lenovo’s own website sells this machine at full price without any discounts, but Amazon has slashed 70% off in what appears to be a final clearance situation: You’re looking at a laptop with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6317/">40GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor now priced at $899 instead of the typical $2,999 asking price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6317/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Handle Heavy Workloads</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 5 7535HS processor has six cores and twelve threads</strong> that run at a base clock speed of 3.3GHz and when you need extra power for heavy tasks, it can boost up to 4.55GHz. This chip architecture gives great single-threaded performance for gaming, and the multi-core setup can handle video editing, 3D rendering, or running multiple virtual machines at the same time without any problems. The 16MB L3 cache keeps data that is often accessed close to the processor cores which lowers latency and makes all applications more responsive.</p>



<p>The 40GB DDR5 RAM setup is very good for a laptop in this price range and gives the system enough room to grow, even though most users won’t use it all the time. DDR5 memory has a higher bandwidth than DDR4, which helps integrated graphics work better and speeds up tasks that move a lot of data around. You can have 50 tabs open in Chrome, work on several large files in Photoshop, and keep Spotify streaming in the background and you will still have resources available for whatever you want to do next.</p>
<p>With a PCIe NVMe SSD, the storage space can hold up to 1TB and it loads your operating system in seconds and opens applications almost instantly. The difference in speed between this solid-state storage and regular hard drives changes the way people use computers every day: You no longer have to wait for things to happen when you use your computer, and you can keep your whole game library, a big collection of photos, and work documents all in one place without having to constantly switch between external drives or cloud storage.</p>



<p>The<strong> 15.3-inch screen has a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200</strong> which gives you more vertical space than a standard 1080p screen. This is helpful when working with documents, spreadsheets, or code. The IPS panel keeps colors true and has better viewing angles than TN panels. The 300-nit brightness rating makes sure that the screen can be seen even in bright places or near windows. Anti-glare coating makes it easier on your eyes when you work for a long time by spreading out reflections that would otherwise bounce off the screen.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 is the newest standard for wireless networks, and it offers faster speeds and better performance in crowded network environments than older standards. Bluetooth 5.3 connects your peripherals with a longer range and more stability and <strong>the mix of USB-A and USB-C ports</strong> makes sure that both old and new accessories will work with it. The USB-C port supports Power Delivery 3.0, which lets you charge your devices quickly, and DisplayPort 1.2, which lets you connect external monitors so you can work at a desk. The<strong> HDMI output gives you another way to connect a display</strong>, <strong>the SD card reader</strong> makes it easier to transfer photos from cameras, and the <strong>headphone jack</strong> is for audiophiles who like wired connections.</p>
<p>A $2,100 discount on a laptop is the kind of deal that makes people raise their eyebrows, but looking at the specs shows that you’re getting real hardware instead of old parts dressed up with marketing language. Lenovo usually charges well into the thousands for laptops with this much RAM and storage, so the $899 price is almost too good to be true. The 70% off sale means that Amazon got too much stock and needs to get rid of it quickly.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ignore the Mini 4 Pro, New DJI Mini 5 Pro Bundle With 3 Batteries Drops to New All-Time Low]]></title>

              <p>The DJI Mini 4 Pro held its position as the go-to compact drone for years but<strong> DJI released the Mini 5 Pro in September</strong> with upgrades that push the boundaries of what sub-250-gram drones can accomplish. Staying under that 250-gram threshold matters because it keeps you clear of FAA registration requirements in the United States which this an ideal drone for beginners and enthusiasts who want hassle-free flying.</p>
<p>This <em>Fly More Combo</em> bundle delivers everything you need for serious aerial photography right out of the box, including the DJI RC 2 controller with its built-in screen and three batteries for extended flying sessions. And right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/">Amazon has dropped the price to a record low of $1,099, down from the usual $1,599</a>&nbsp;which makes this the perfect moment to invest in one of the most capable lightweight drones ever made.</p>

<h2>Professional-Quality Video</h2>
<p>The 1-inch CMOS sensor is a big step up from the smaller sensors in older Mini models as it captures a lot more light and detail in each frame. With this bigger sensor, you can record <strong>4K video at 60 frames per second with HDR support</strong> and it gives you footage with a wide dynamic range that keeps details in both bright skies and dark landscapes. The Mini 5 Pro has color depth and clarity that are as good as or better than what you would get from much bigger, more expensive drones. This makes it a real tool for content creators who need professional results without having to carry around heavy equipment.</p>



<p>The <strong>225-degree gimbal rotation gives you creative options</strong> that fixed-angle gimbals can’t match: You can shoot true vertical content for social media without cropping or losing resolution, and you can tilt the camera to get dynamic establishing shots, follow subjects from interesting angles, or get footage from above that smoothly changes into footage from the front. This flexibility is especially useful when filming real estate, action sports, or travel videos, where different angles keep viewers interested. The gimbal stabilization system <strong>keeps the video smooth even when there is a little wind</strong>&nbsp;which is great because amateur drone videos are often shaky.</p>
<p><strong>Omnidirectional obstacle sensing</strong> uses both forward-facing LiDAR and vision sensors to find obstacles in all directions: This makes a safety net that keeps you from crashing even if you’re more focused on framing your shot than watching where you’re flying. The <strong>Nightscape feature</strong> improves this obstacle detection system for flights at night by using LiDAR to map your surroundings when regular vision sensors have trouble seeing in low light.</p>



<p><strong>ActiveTrack 360° has been improved to follow people more reliably</strong> with faster response times and different tracking modes that work in different situations. You can have the drone fly around you while you stay focused, follow behind at a set distance, or track from the side for dynamic parallel shots. The system is better at keeping cyclists and runners centered in the frame, even when they turn or speed up.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Flight Battery Plus that comes with this bundle gives you an extra 52 minutes of battery life, so you can stay in the air for a long time before you need to land and change batteries. With<strong> three batteries, you can fly for more than two and a half hours</strong> before you need to recharge. The charging hub charges all three batteries in about 193 minutes and manages the charging sequence well so you don’t have to wait hours between flying sessions. The <strong>internal storage space is 42GB</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with microSD cards before every flight, and you’ll never miss a shot because your card is full.</p>
<p>The <strong>DJI RC 2 controller has a bright built-in screen</strong> that you can see even in direct sunlight which means you don’t have to connect your phone and drain its battery while flying. It is easy to use the controls because there are separate buttons for key functions. You can change camera settings or start intelligent flight modes without having to go through menus. Both the drone and controller can be folded up and stored in a small bag or backpack, making it easy to take with you on hikes, road trips, or any other adventure where you want to get aerial footage.</p>
<p>It might seem like a lot to spend $1,099 on a drone bundle, but when you look at how much other systems with similar features cost, it doesn’t seem so bad. DJI usually keeps prices steady on new products, so this 31% discount on hardware that just came out a few months ago is a great deal.</p>
