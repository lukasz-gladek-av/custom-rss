It also gives him a gun as a callback to his self-titled game, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>. I never thought I’d see the day an officially-licensed <em>Sonic </em>thing would give Shadow firearms again. But here we are. It’s the Year of Shadow, baby.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below:</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>will apparently include a big tease about what comes next for the franchise, and even though the series uses up one of its biggest possible reveals in Shadow, there’s still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899">a lot of territory the movies haven’t covered yet</a></span>.
