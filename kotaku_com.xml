              <p>The rising cost of PC parts is getting so bad that Nvidia is reportedly going to start making RTX 3060s again, so people have something to buy in the future while all the new shiny tech gets consumed by the AI industry.</p> <p>You’ve likely already noticed that in 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">it became more expensive to build or upgrade a PC</a>. Thanks to hyperscalers and <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">AI-focused tech companies gobbling up PC parts to build datacenters</a>, it’s becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a> for your average person to buy PC RAM and graphics cards. Even the prices on prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will increase by 15 to 20 percent, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to <em>PC World.</em></a> Not great! This will also lead to PC handhelds getting more expensive, and experts expect consoles will undergo price increases too, thanks to growing demand for specific parts.&nbsp; And Nvidia, a company that is making billions from all of this, has a solution to provide PC players with a somewhat affordable GPU in 2026: Start making and selling its old RTX 3060 again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">01.05update<br>rtx3060  Q1 come back… 🥲</p> <p>— hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As recently reported by reliable Nvidia leaker Hongxing2020 and spotted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/"><em>Wccftech</em></a>, Nvidia is seemingly planning to restart production on the RTX 3060 in Q1 of this year. The card first launched in 2021 and is still one of the most popular gaming GPUs around, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">according to data from Steam</a>.</p>

 <p>In 2024, Nvidia began retiring the card as it moved on to the 40 and 50 series of GPUs. However, due to DRAM being rapidly consumed for data centers, it has become harder and more expensive to procure the GDDR7 needed to produce the newer, more powerful RTX 5060. (Sidenote: <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/#the-upcoming-data-center-disaster:~:text=Now%2C%20you%E2%80%99ve%20probably,generation%20of%20GPUs.">Basically, every datacenter built or being built will be out of date in the near future, meaning the billions invested in them will be basically a waste!</a>)</p>

 <p>So it seems like the plan is for Nvidia to start producing 3060s again, using cheaper, easier-to-acquire components that aren’t top of the line and therefore aren’t being sought after by AI tech giants for their massive datacenters. If that is the case, hopefully Nvidia at least prices the new 3060s at $200 or less, as the only market for these cards will be gamers looking to upgrade a PC from an older GPU to something (somewhat) modern. But greed is a nasty thing and has infected all tech companies, including Nvidia, so I wouldn’t hold my breath on a sub-$200 price point despite the 3060 entering its fifth year in 2026.</p>

              <p><span>One advantage </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>had when it launched last year was that the RPG was unburdened by expectations out the gate. Sandfall Interactive was a new developer with a lot of industry talent on its roster, but it wasn’t yet a storied studio with a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161"><span>Game of the Year-winning debut</span></a><span> to live up to. Now that it is, however, folks at the studio claim it won’t just be aiming to meet fan expectations with its next project.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>Edge</span></i><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span>), </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-choice-canon-correct-2000633292"><span>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen</span></a><span> expressed that while she is “”a bit of a people pleaser” and is cognizant of fan expectations, Sandfall Interactive’s mostly concerned with their own interests rather than catering to fandom whims.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Creatively, we’ve always let our North Star be our own personal taste in terms of what we think is cool, what it is we enjoy and want to see,” she said. “I’ve seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what’s there. So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Sandfall has been upfront about wanting to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><span>make another </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>game</span></a><span>, and fans are already clamoring for it to explore some of </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s unsolved mysteries, especially regarding </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kffyby/painters_vs_writers/"><span>some of the major reveals in the RPG’s third act</span></a><span>. But it sounds like the stuff that fans are latching onto isn’t going to guide Sandfall’s creative decisions, so it’s possible the next game may be about something entirely different. It’ll be exciting to see what the studio comes up with, even if it’s not exactly what we’re hoping for. You already know they’re capable of making something great, so why not stay open to what it wants to do next?</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2018’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> </a>is a very big game. Rockstar’s open-world cowboy simulator is also chockablock with secrets and mysteries. And somehow, nearly a decade after launch, players have stumbled upon a whole new one to solve involving mysterious spider webs, feathers, and…guitars?</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0T4J8LYqUi0">As expertly documented by <em>Red Dead</em> YouTuber StrangeMan,</a> in late December, <em>RDR2</em> players discovered <a href="https://youtu.be/OSQPMaU7yz8">a strange spider glyph</a> on a telegraph pole. Above the pole, players spotted a spider web that only appears between the in-game hours of 3 am and 4 am. On the web are some feathers, which can be shot off.</p>

  <p>Things got more interesting when players took the glyph below this secret web and overlaid it onto <em>RDR2</em>‘s map. This led them to more hidden spider webs on telegraph poles. And at the center of all this is a large spider-web hidden inside a tree, which seems to contain a message pointing players to a utility pole that hides a new clue pointing to more poles that seem to be connected to acoustic guitars found at a military fort.</p>

 <p>People have <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-players-are-still-unraveling-all-1832303583">spent years and years digging through <em>RDR2</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-players-keep-finding-creepy-easte-1830502069">all of its mysteries and secrets</a>. Yet despite all those mystery hunters leaving no stone unturned, it seems there’s at least one more secret left unsolved in Rockstar’s massive open-world Western, with all of this apparently hiding in the game, undocumented by players, for the better part of a decade. Might all this also be connected to an obscure mystery in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/4l3n4o/a_guide_of_all_known_spider_webs/"><em> Grand Theft Auto V</em> involving spider webs?</a></p>

 <p>For now, investigators trying to piece it all together are stuck at <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Fort_Wallace">Fort Wallace</a>, where two guitars can be found that many believe are part of the next step in the mystery, but which (at least for now) nobody has cracked yet. There are some theories, some of which are very wild and seem hard to believe. But then again, it sure seems like players have found a seven-year-old secret in <em>RDR2</em> involving disappearing spider webs and glyphs hidden behind the breakable wood of random telegraph poles, so at this point, I’m open to basically any theory, because the reality is plenty weird. If you want to possibly help solve this new mystery before <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>GTA 6</em> arrives later this year</a>, head over to Fort Wallace and see what you can find.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-goty-award-steam-clair-obscur-snub-2000656667</link>

              <p>Millions of votes later, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has officially taken home Steam’s Game of the Year award for 2025. It’s the highest-profile prize yet for the excellent Metroidvania Soulslike after it repeatedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">lost out to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> at recent events like the Game Awards. The game is finally getting its much-deserved flowers just as Valve’s storefront cracked an all-time concurrent player peak to kick off 2026.</p> <p>In addition to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, <em>Silksong</em> was also up against <em>Arc Raiders</em>, <em>Dispatch</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>for Steam’s GOTY, so winning is no small feat. It’s also been the platform’s best-selling game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">throughout the holiday season</a> and continues to set new concurrent player records on PC. Over the weekend <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1808500">it cracked 450,000</a>.</p>

 <p>Here are the rest of the 2025 Steam Awards winners:</p> <ul> <li>VR Game of the Year: <em><strong>The Midnight Walk </strong></em></li> <li>Labor of Love: <em><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game on Steam Deck: <em><strong>Hades 2 </strong></em></li> <li>Better with Friends: <em><strong>Peak </strong></em></li> <li>Outstanding Visual Style: <em><strong>Silent Hill f </strong></em></li> <li>Most Innovative Gameplay: <em><strong>Arc Raiders </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game You Suck At: <strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></strong></li> <li>Best Soundtrack: <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></strong></li> <li>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: <strong><em>Dispatch </em></strong></li> <li>Sit Back and Relax: <strong><em>RV There Yet</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>Are the Steam Awards, where the winners are determined entirely based on user votes, basically a popularity contest? Yes. Could you have predicted most of these winners ahead of time? Probably! But it’s also neat to see so many great games given their flowers across unique categories in which they are unquestionably very deserving of praise.</p>

 <p>The results are certainly more interesting than those at this year’s Game Awards, where <em>Clair Obscur</em> swept and<em> Silksong</em> didn’t even nab the Player’s Voice award. That went to free-to-play gacha action-RPG <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. The Steam Awards are also by far the biggest community-voted prize in gaming. Anyone with an eligible Steam account can participate and the platform recently boasted a new record player peak of 41,746,984. Is it <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-smashes-concurrent-user-record-thanks-to-war-between-two-games-3242035/">catching up to<em> Roblox</em></a> any time soon? Doubtful. But it’s good news for everyone trying to actually make and sell games on Valve’s storefront.</p>
