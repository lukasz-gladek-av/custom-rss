              <p>In early 2009, shortly before the launch of <a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-gotham-knights-suicide-squad-assassins-cr-1848911270"><em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em></a> and a year after Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Dark Knight,</em> developers at Monolith were working on a <em>Batman</em> game that would be connected to Nolan’s films. Gameplay footage of the game, titled Project Apollo, leaked in 2024. But now, even more footage has been uncovered showing off what could have been.</p> <p>On January 12, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social/post/3mcba4da5xk2x">retro game archivist MrTalida uploaded</a> once-deleted-but-now-recovered Project Apollo files that were found on an old hard drive. Included in the files, which were created between April 2009 and January 2010, are video clips of early gameplay and in-engine tests of Project Apollo, with many focused on how sound and music would work in the third-person <em>Batman</em> action game. It’s interesting to see how much progress the team at Monolith made on the game over those 10 months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/project-apollo-documents-and-videos">You can find all of them on the Internet Archive.</a></p>

 <p>Perhaps the biggest and coolest new information gleaned from these leaked files is gameplay footage of the Tumbler, aka Batman’s tank-like Batmobile from the <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy. In the leaked footage, you can see the Tumbler driving through what appears to be a large train yard while escaping police and destroying various objects and explosive barrels. In other words, a pretty standard-looking 2010-era vehicle section, the kind that would often appear in single-player AAA games around that time.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mcbatx32gk2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidyqklm2io4hbu6dko46a2ktvnrmmlkewy32vzgkfrg6ndcpx2yxa"> <p lang="en">Lastly, here's a series of videos showing the progress Monolith had made on the tumbler batmobile sections.  AFAIK, the previous leak didn't show any tumbler footage, so this may be our first peek.</p> <p>You can see how the feature progressed from Oct 2009, to Nov 2009, to Jan 2010.</p> <p>Enjoy the files!<br> 9/9</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf?ref_src=embed">MrTalida (@mrtalida.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/post/3mcbatx32gk2v?ref_src=embed">2026-01-13T00:02:07.387Z</a></p></blockquote></div>   <h2>Why the Nolan <em>Batman</em> game was canned</h2> <p>As mentioned, <a href="https://kotaku.com/canceled-nolan-batman-game-leak-1851387503">we saw footage from a later build of this canned <em>Batman</em> game in 2024,</a> showing off combat, traversal, and more. But even before that, in 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0lRkQd9skU&amp;list=PLO9mxFELVbbHM1dR6VumpP60zBENfQr0b">Liam Robertson extensively covered this canceled project</a>, reporting various details about the title, including the fact that the game had been in development for approximately 18 months before it was killed.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The open world of Gotham could be traversed by either gliding and utilizing the grappling hook (as established in the Arkham games) or by operating the Tumbler/Batmobile. <a href="https://t.co/VZKXJBFsgP">pic.twitter.com/VZKXJBFsgP</a></p> <p>— SpideyRanger 🇬🇭 (@Dageekydude) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dageekydude/status/1775572473330672034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was also planned to be an open-world game and would have featured a system by which randomly generated Gotham City thugs would appear to fight Batman and return, stronger and angrier, later. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Monolith would take this idea and build it into the famous Nemesis System found in 2014’s <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> and its 2017 sequel, <em>Shadow of War</em>.</p>

 <p>As for why it was canceled, Robertson reported that publisher WB Games made it clear to Monolith that the only way the project could move forward was if the studio could get Nolan to approve it. The game was to be set in his version of the <em>Batman</em> universe, after all, and the studio wanted to make sure he was involved. Sadly, Nolan seemed uninterested in the game, and Monolith eventually gave up and pivoted to making <em>Lord of the Rings</em> games. More recently, the studio was working on a <em>Wonder Woman</em> project that would have utilized the Nemesis System, <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">but sadly Monolith was shuttered by WB in February 2025.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Legend Major Nelson Is Unity’s Latest Layoff]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-major-nelson-unity-layoffs-2000659406</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Gaming executive Larry Hyrb, aka Major Nelson, has revealed this week that he’s out at the game engine maker Unity. The Xbox veteran joined as Director of Community and Advocacy only a couple of years ago.</span></p> <p><span>“After nearly three decades of making an impact at Microsoft, I joined Unity in 2024. During my time there, I rebuilt their Community and Advocacy Team with a deliberate strategy that created a clearer, more connected experience for creators, developers, and gamers,” Hyrb </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hryb_ive-always-been-transparent-with-this-community-activity-7416864352840085504-MDJc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACLzsjMBiEcKGm66u9szH_XVpdQ1NU1SZcQ"><span>explained on LinkedIn</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Hyrb continued: “We brought energy back to channels that had gone quiet, restored trust, and showed up consistently where it mattered. I elevated Unity’s visibility at PAX and key industry events, strengthened relationships, and ensured Unity had a clear voice in the broader conversation.”</span></p>   <p><span>It’s not exactly clear when Hyrb was laid off or if the departure is part of a bigger wave of fresh cuts at the software company. “I’ve had invigorating conversations over the past weeks with companies in tech and non-tech spaces to discuss partnerships,” he said on </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hryb.me/post/3mccuyabbv22d"><span>BlueSky</span></a><span>. “I love what I do but I also believe change is necessary. I’ll let you know where I go from here.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Major Nelson was previously an important public figure within the Xbox community. He spent almost 23 years at Microsoft, fostering the Xbox Live community and promoting the Xbox 360’s user-facing features, including the Achievement system, cloud saves, in-game messaging, and party chat.</span></p>

  <p><span>He left </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-major-nelson-larry-hryb-official-podcast-microsoft-1850642324"><span>Microsoft back in 2023</span></a><span>, a move that preceded Xbox’s pivot to being multiplatform and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ps5-exclusives-streaming-1851722886"><span>broader marketing strategy</span></a><span> that didn’t have a single piece of hardware at its center. The brand hasn’t been as public facing, let alone as community-first, since Hyrb’s departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unity has had a rough several years. In 2023, the company announced that it would install a new Runtime Fee, but was eventually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-install-runtime-fees-canceled-ceo-blog-post-price-1851647405"><span>reversed due to immense backlash from developers</span></a><span>. A few months later, then CEO </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-john-riccitiello-ea-intall-fee-resign-fifa-madden-1850914295"><span>John Riccitiello stepped down</span></a><span>. In 2024, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254"><span>Unity laid off a massive chunk of its workforce</span></a><span>, eliminating around 1,800, or 25%, of its employees. Last year, Unity then </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails"><span>laid off its Behavior team</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-scalper-charizard-pikachu-eevee-ebay-price-2000659400</link>
            <guid>1404913</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In a move that will surprise absolutely no one who has paid attention to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the past five years, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><span>very expensive Lego sets</span></a><span> featuring </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>Pikachu, Eevee</span></a><span>, and the Kanto starters are selling out pretty fast. When Pokémon merchandise sells out, it inevitably ends up on reseller sites like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=charizard+lego&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2332490.m570.l1313"><span>Ebay</span></a><span> for astronomical prices. What do you get when you scalp already expensive toy blocks? Prices that’ll cost you enough to buy multiple game consoles and video games.</span></p> <p><span>The set featuring Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur is supposed to run for $649.99, but now that pre-orders are selling out, resellers are listing the 6800+ pieces of Lego blocks for anywhere from </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Lego+pokemon+badges&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313"><span>$800 to over a grand</span></a><span>. Some of the listings include the Kanto Badges set that is being offered to those who bought the starters, while there are others that have only one of the three monsters for sale, despite them not being sold separately by Lego itself. I guess despite the reseller markup, if you really only wanted one of them, this would be cheaper than buying all three at retail price. Live your truth.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though that’s the most expensive of the sets, it’s not the only one that scalpers got a hold of to flip and turn a profit. The </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/257306955329?_skw=pokemon+lego&amp;itmmeta=01KEW627JW5AGPJKXJZ60CN4GG&amp;hash=item3be8b08e41:g:lnkAAeSwn0VpZm0T&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQALAAAA8O7PUuNWmJ%2B%2BUShgI9tQz%2FpNjcghLv%2BTt%2FEVUa7n%2BFKBL3oQ%2BSztckicHbIHKISlddEAhuGmBnxMjo0MNMFFWsHQKGE3fQ6%2Bk94YIwi28ayFOVrzfonRqCks5ykLmQY8zsw60phy2xhRnY%2BCeqasoyUR3ZK%2B9hT3pqDCx%2B3Lly7uxDfgI93mX%2B4NkWiiVl6caiC8OqhC8sPU22%2FjDgWq3vrU2ZBGcrGj82jQVPb96lsqdRQ2bJdcIZcW%2BGd1nQ5VA8yrjS2KHllSMOwrbcr%2FAnsNGqlG4eG1MEBrXvydhlFpwXrepxxc5K%2BrcjjwNUMkqA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9r5iIb3Zg"><span>Pikachu</span></a><span> model is also popping up, though it is much, much cheaper than the Kanto trio. Before you hop on that one, though, do keep in mind that pre-orders for the Pikachu and Eevee models haven’t sold out in the U.S. yet, so you can still get those (very expensive) blocky boys for their original price.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Lego sets will be available in stores on February 27, which marks the series’ 30th anniversary. We’ll also be expecting some major announcements from the company’s annual “Pokémon Day” stream, which usually covers games, toys, and pretty much every other facet of the franchise. </span></p>
