In addition to the upcoming showcase, he confirmed the game will be out within the current fiscal year, a window that’s become much more open since <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> was pushed back to May of 2026. </p><p>Wilson previously suggested that Rockstar Games’ juggernaut was a factor in its launch window calculus. “We believe the game will be great and ready at that time, but if we got close to that timeframe and believed that this wasn’t going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player acquisition opportunity for this <em>Battlefield</em> to be all that it needed to be,” he said earlier this year. </p><p>Is it possible we now see the game arrive earlier than expected and go head-to-head with the next <em>Call of Duty </em>this fall? And will we see the next <em>Battlefield</em> stick to the current $70 price point or hop on the Microsoft bandwagon and target $80 along with certain other releases this holiday season? Those will be some of the questions facing EA as it tries to restore <em>Battlefield</em> to its former glory after a series of missteps in recent entries. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaks-gameplay-bf4-bf3-fps-ea-labs-drag-1851769188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaks-gameplay-bf4-bf3-fps-ea-labs-drag-1851769188">So far the buzz is positive</a></span>. Player tests and ongoing leaks around the next <em>Battlefield</em> have been getting some long-time fans excited that the franchise might be finding its footing again while also returning to its roots. It would be nice to have <em>Battlefield </em>back in the multiplayer mix, even if the live service market is getting more competitive than ever. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though it may lack the polish of many of the games it borrows ideas from, it provides compelling enough gameplay that genre fans may find it worth their time to see how things play out for main character Zoe and her little drone, Koby. But how much time will you need to invest exactly?

For those who enjoy collecting everything in this type of game, though, that won’t be a bad thing, especially since it’s all relatively straightforward.</p><p>You’ll need to buy every upgrade in the game from each of the three skill trees. You’ll also need to find all 114 glitch crystals, as well as various health modules, drones, notes, and more as you explore levels. In other words, you’ll have plenty to look for when you’re not engaged in the game’s stealth and action gameplay. You should expect a completionist run to add another two or three hours.</p><p>If you’re going for every trophy or achievement in <em>Steel Seed</em>, you’ll definitely have to do all of the above—and then some. You’ll need to eliminate a certain number of specific enemy types, ensure you kill 50 enemies using your drone, and even play a couple of melodies on a piano at some point in the game. </p><p>Whether you want to do everything in the game or simply see the campaign through, you can pick up <em>Steel Seed</em> now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
