              <p>It’s been almost a decade since the release of the legendary farming sim <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and it’s easy to be daunted by its massive reputation and dedicated player community. Fortunately, the game is all about chilling out, and isn’t too tough on newcomers. That being said, going in totally blind can be a bit overwhelming in a game so packed with information. So, whether you’re a brand new player or it’s been so long you’ve forgotten the ropes, here are 15 tips for starting a fresh <em>Stardew Valley</em> save in 2026.</p> <h2>Choose the Four Corners, Standard, or Forest Farm</h2> <p>There are eight different farm maps to choose from, but not all are created equal. Be sure to make an informed decision — you can’t change your mind later!</p> <p>The Four Corners farm is described as being ideal for multiplayer, but it’s my favorite for single player, too. Four Corners’ structured layout is great for planning how you want to organize your base later on, and each corner has a different perk to it.<br> The Standard farm is another solid choice since it gives you the most space for raising animals and farming crops. The Forest farm also works well; it doesn’t offer a lot of farming space, but it’s great for foraging, which is a crucial skill in the early game.<br> The other farms make starting out more challenging, and <em>Stardew</em> is already overwhelming enough without adding extra hurdles. I would know; my first ever farm was on the Riverland map (because it’s the prettiest), but I got so frustrated I abandoned the save.</p>

 <h2>Take it easy</h2> <p>It’s inevitable that you’re gonna make a mistake. Whether you can’t get home before 2 a.m., or you give someone a present they don’t like, or you miss out on farming a particular crop before the season changes, don’t beat yourself up about it. <em>Stardew Valley</em> is a game about going at your own pace—it’s not possible to play it “wrong,” so long as you’re having fun. It isn’t the end of the world if you accidentally sell something you need later on. Find the joy in stumbling as you learn.</p> <h2>Plan ahead for the Community Center</h2> <p>That being said, if you do want to strategize, the best thing you can do is keep track of what you’ll need to finish rebuilding the Community Center. I like to keep a physical list of all the stuff I need to complete the Community Center handy for quick reference.</p>

 <h2>Watch TV every day</h2> <p>Flicking through the TV when you wake up will reward you with helpful intel from a variety of channels. The content on every channel changes daily, so make a habit of TV surfing before you head out each morning.</p> <h2>Keep one of every item</h2> <p>As a general rule, I like to keep at least one of every item I stumble upon stored at my base. Odds are the stuff you think is worthless now will turn out to be useful later on.</p>

 <h2>Start a tree farm</h2> <p>You’re gonna need a lot of wood in this game. Trees take forever to grow, so set up a designated area for trees on your farm as early as you can.</p> <h2>Don’t plant too many seeds</h2> <p>Believe it or not, there is such a thing as too much farming. Watering your plants costs energy, which you have a limited amount of each day. There’s much more to explore beyond your farm, so don’t spend all your time trying to till every square inch of your land—keep it manageable.</p>  <h2>Go fishing</h2> <p>Fishing is one of the best things you can do in the early game. Not only is it a quick and easy way to earn some cash, you also have a chance of fishing up rare treasure. Upgrading your rod as soon as you’re able is also a good move.</p>

 <h2>Fish where you see bubbles</h2> <p>If you see bubbles in the water, make sure to cast your line there. Fish are way quicker to bite in bubble spots and you’re less likely to catch trash.</p> <h2>Dig for worms</h2> <p>When you’re walking around, keep an eye out for any grass tiles that have three little worms wriggling on them. Using a hoe on that tile will yield valuable items.</p> <h2>Place chests in key locations</h2> <p>Remember that you can place chests anywhere so long as they aren’t on NPC walking paths. It’s easy to run out of inventory space while spelunking, so having a chest right outside the elevator in the mines is super helpful. I also like to keep chests on the beach and by the river for fishing.</p> <h2>Build a silo ASAP</h2> <p>Silos automatically store all the grass you cut. Constructing one before you start on any other buildings is a good idea because it’ll give you a big reserve of hay for when you do get animals.</p>

 <h2>Pet your animals</h2> <p>Once you get livestock on your farm, right-click to pet them! If you make a daily habit of it, you’ll be rewarded with higher quality animal goods—plus a cute heart animation. It’s my favorite part of the daily farm routine (no I will never buy the auto petters).</p> <h2>Prepare for winter with heaters</h2> <p>Winter is tough. Your farmland is rendered barren and your animals can’t go outside, so you’ll have to rely on resource reservoirs and animal produce to survive. Make sure your animals have a siloful of hay to munch on and a heater in every barn/coop so they don’t go cold.</p>

 <h2>Press and hold right-click to save time</h2> <p>Most repetitive actions can be done en masse by holding down the right mouse button. It makes harvesting crops, petting animals, and collecting items from machines way faster.</p>

              <p><span>Game engine maker Unity is, like most other tech companies, fully embracing generative AI technology in its products (making the already bloated engine even more slow and annoying to use). Still clinging to the AI hype — even after it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594"><span>made their own stock plummet</span></a><span> — Unity is promising to unveil a new version of its AI tool that will supposedly eliminate the need for coding entirely.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"><span>reported</span></a><span> by GameDeveloper, the new Unity AI beta is planned to launch at the GDC Festival of Gaming in March. In </span><a href="https://investors.unity.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"><span>a recent earnings call</span></a><span>, Unity CEO Matthew Bromsberg stated, “AI-driven authoring is our second major area of focus for 2026. At the Game Developer Conference in March, we’ll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform — so it’s simple to move from prototype to finished product.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist. We believe together this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone.”</span></p> <p><span>Half of game developers attending GDC this year think generative AI is </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/one-third-of-game-workers-use-generative-ai-but-half-think-it-s-bad-for-the-industry"><span>bad for the games industry</span></a><span>. Some game developers also report that using generative AI </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><span>actually makes their jobs harder</span></a><span>. Developers are already struggling to get attention for their games in a market where <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/a-terrifying-20-282-games-were-released-on-steam-in-2025-and-just-608-managed-to-get-1-000-reviews-expert-finds-we-might-be-in-a-bit-of-an-indie-golden-age/">20,000 new releases</a> came to Steam last year. AI threatens to flood digital storefronts with even more noise.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our goal is to remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience,” Bromsberg said.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The distaste for generative AI extends to players as well. In a </span><a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2025/12/18/gen-ai/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><span>survey</span></a><span> taken by nearly 2 million players, over 85% have a negative attitude toward generative AI in video games.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>During the Q&amp;A segment of the earnings call, Bromsberg said there will eventually be “tens of millions of more people creating interactive entertainment” using AI tools, and that Unity plans to spearhead that hypothetical movement.</span></p> <p><span>Basically, the AI revolution is coming any day now.
