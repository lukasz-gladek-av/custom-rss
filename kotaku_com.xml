              <p><span>Just as the noise from the fan outcry about the disappointing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> finale</span></a><span> was starting to die down, another project from the Netflix sci-fi series is putting the Hawkins kids back in the limelight. </span><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85</span></i><span> is an animated series that takes place between the main series’ second and third seasons, and all things considered, it looks pretty good in its first trailer.</span></p> <p><span>Netflix has pegged the show as a more kid-friendly “Saturday morning cartoon” take on </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, and it definitely comes off that way based on the clips we’ve seen thus far. It’s colorful, packed with jokes, and even the evil creatures from the Upside Down are kinda cute in its </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span>-esque art style. The main cast of characters are returning in the series, but they are notably not voiced by any of their live-action actors. All of them are grown now, so they probably couldn’t voice their younger selves anyway, and they definitely sound like kids in this first trailer, which you can view below:</span></p>

  <p><span>While the fifth and final season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> created a whirlwind of controversy after some fans were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>disappointed in its conclusion</span></a><span>, even prompting some to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>spin a conspiracy theory</span></a><span> that a secret finale was coming that would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>address all their grievances</span></a><span>, maybe </span><i><span>Tales from ‘85 </span></i><span>could serve as a low-stakes palate cleanser? I also wouldn’t be surprised, though, if the people who were that dissatisfied with season 5 just wash their hands of the series altogether and don’t watch the show. Which is valid. Live your truth, Byler shippers. Just, you know, be normal about it instead of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307"><span>harassing the creators of the show</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85 </span></i><span>will premiere on Netflix on April 23.</span></p>

<h2>A showstopper of a smartwatch for a low price</h2>
<p>The Apple Watch Series 11’s Always-On Retina Display lets users see the time and any other chosen complication or calendar event by simply glancing down at the watch. The glass on the aluminum model has been improved to be twice as scratch-resistant as on the Series 10. Additionally, because the watch has a 50-meter swim-proof rating and is also IP6X dust-resistant, users can wear it in everyday situations and still have confidence in its ability to perform under various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>In addition to tracking your steps and providing information about your physical activity, the watch offers a comprehensive view of your body’s activity. You can use the watch to take an electrocardiogram (ECG), measure your blood oxygen level, and monitor your heart rate using both an electrical heart sensor and a third-generation optical heart sensor. The watch also provides notification alerts to inform you when your heart rate is abnormally high or low, or when it detects irregular heartbeats, potential sleep apnea, or hypertension, as well as the opportunity to review how you slept each night using the built-in Sleep app, along with the sleep score and sleep stage views. Additional apps for Medication, Mindfulness, and Noise provide tools to help you track habits, moods, and exposure to loud environments.</p>



<p>The Apple Watch Series 11 offers multiple options for fitness tracking, including walking, running, cycling, gym sessions, and more. With the watch, you can view detailed metrics for distance, heart rate, and pace for each of these activities. Heart Rate Zones and Training Load Estimates will help you determine how hard you worked out, and other features, such as Pacer and Workout Buddy, which use your nearby iPhone, will provide structure and support for runs and other workouts.</p>
<p>Additional safety and connectivity features make this watch feel like a trusted partner in addition to being a tracker and fitness device. The watch includes Fall Detection and Crash Detection technologies that will detect a severe fall or serious auto accident and help connect you to emergency services if you are unable to respond. Emergency SOS and International Emergency Calling provide you with direct access to emergency services. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6995/">If the Apple Watch Series 11 sounds like the watch for you, now’s the time to buy, as it’s available for $299, down from $399.</a></p>
