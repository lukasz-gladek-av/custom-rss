              <p data-start="107" data-end="536">“Brains like a full-sized PC, body of a Mac Mini, and easier on your checkbook than either” would make a really strong dating site bio for a mini PC, and the Acemagic K1 is well worth swiping right for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">It’s an Amazon’s Choice mini PC preloaded with Windows 11 Pro that’s on sale for a limited time for just $220, a big 37% break from its usual $349.</a></p>
<p data-start="538" data-end="997">This deal isn’t about some janky plug-and-pray rig that you’ll be trying to return or replace within weeks or months — the Acemagic K1 is a bona fide, space-saving desktop replacement that fits in the palm of your hand. It has an AMD Ryzen 4300 processor that can max out at 3.7GHz and enough onboard memory (16GB) and storage (256GB) to juggle web tabs, creative apps, Discord, and whatever random emulator you’ve got open without the dreaded slowdown that turns productivity into an endless loading screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="538" data-end="997">Mini Build, Mini Price</h2>
<p data-start="999" data-end="1440">If you’re eyeing a Mac Mini purely because you want a tiny powerhouse combined with the flex that comes with all things Mac, this Acemagic K1 deal at Amazon is your wallet pleading with you to be reasonable. Yes, Apple’s M4-powered Mini is sleek and whisper-quiet, but it’ll set you back significantly more with similar memory — over twice as much, actually. We’ve seen gaming headsets that cost more than the Acemagic K1.</p>
<p data-start="1442" data-end="1860">But this discounted mini PC squeezes an AMD Ryzen-class processor and that generous RAM into a chassis the size of a thick paperback. You can hide it behind a monitor with a VESA mount, plop it next to your console, or shove it into your streaming cabinet without asking your partner for extra desk real estate. Add a monitor — or as many as three monitors — and keyboard you already own — <em>voila</em>, instant command center.</p>


<h2 data-start="1442" data-end="1860">Palm-Sized Powerhouse</h2>
<p data-start="1862" data-end="2277">To answer the inevitable question of <em data-start="1886" data-end="1911">“why not a laptop?”</em> — this isn’t about portability. The Acemagic K1 is a dedicated little beast with outstanding expansion potential and a whispery high-efficiency cooling system that quietly hum along while your laptop’s fan blasts like it’s trying to take off. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to offload background tasks, run servers, handle video encoding, or just give their main rig a break without dropping a pile of cash.</p>
<p data-start="2279" data-end="2649"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">Like all Amazon deals, this $220 price won’t linger forever.</a> Yesterday it was here, tomorrow it might be back at the full price of $349. If you’ve been mentally earmarking that desk corner for a proper PC that doesn’t look like a suitcase and sound like a jet turbine, your patience has just paid off. Whether it ends up as your primary machine, a home server, or the hub of all your nerdy projects, the Acemagic K1 one of the more legitimately great mini PC deals we’ve seen in a while.</p>

              <p>Google’s Pixel range offers some of the best Android phones on the market. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re after basic features for everyday use or want to enjoy all the latest advancements in the AI world.</p>
<p>The tech giant unveiled its Pixel 10 Series last year, featuring stunning models with a solid build, an impressive camera, a bright display, new AI tools, and a lot more. That said, its previous generation Pixel 9 phones are still an excellent option to consider, and pack many of the features found on the latest models. If you’ve been thinking of treating yourself to one, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">Amazon is offering the 128GB, unlocked Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Hazel at a 36% discount today, which drops its $1,099 price to just $699</a>. Basically, it’s cheaper than the basic Pixel 9 right now. Those willing to trade their older phone can save up to $600 on their purchase, too, but you might not be able to combine both offers. Trade-in credit is offered in the form of Amazon gift cards that you can use towards other purchases. We highly suggest grabbing the offer as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting it to stick around for longer than a day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With AI Features</h2>
<p>Pixel 9 Pro XL features a stunning 6.8-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL Super Actua display, which is both bright and vivid. It offers excellent picture quality in all lighting conditions, whether you’re using it while soaking up some sun or in a dimmer setting at night. At the back, you’ll find a triple rear camera system that not just lets you take professional-level photos, but also high-quality video up to 20x with Super Res Zoom Video. You will also be able to film clearly in low light with Night Sight Video, as well as enhance your videos up to 8K with Video Boost.</p>
<p>AI integration takes the overall experience even further. For instance, there’s Gemini to make everyday tasks easier. It’s an efficient AI assistant that’s ready to help you with research, summarizing documents, creating content, getting reply suggestions, translations, and more – 24/7. Your purchase also includes a year of Google One AI Premium access, which includes Gemini Advanced and more tools, so you can unlock the full potential of your device. It typically costs $239, but here, it’s included for free.</p>



<p>Other cool smart features include “Add Me”, which makes it easy to add the photographer to group photos so no one is left out. It works by taking two shots (one of the group, and the other when the photographer has swapped places with someone) and merging them together into a single photo. Then there’s “Click to Search”, which lets you circle an image or text to perform a quick Google search.</p>
<p>The 128GB space in this version is roomy enough to house all your photos, videos, applications, and documents comfortably. Battery is another strong selling point, as a single charge offers over 24 hours of usage. What’s more, the Extreme Battery Saver extends that to up to 100 hours, making it perfect for off-road trips and power outages.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">You can now upgrade for just $699, after a massive $400 discount. It’s a rare drop, so it’s best to snap it quickly before it expires.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon Is Back at a Record Low in Another Clearance Move on Amazon, Not the Official Store]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-is-back-at-a-record-low-in-another-clearance-move-on-amazon-not-the-official-store-2000662800</link>

              <p>There are deals, and then there are deals that make you say “This is the way.” (It’s OK to mix metaphors in a galaxy far, far away.) Right now, LEGO’s Star Wars Millennium Falcon has been restocked at Amazon after a heavy-duty holiday selling burst and it’s arrived in 2026 in one of those rare price windows where it’s genuinely worth firing up the hyperdrive and snagging it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">The Amazon limited-time deal for the 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is going for $68, 20% off its usual price.</a> That might sound like pocket change compared to what some of us drop on boxed trilogy marathons or obscure action figures, but when a set that’s this beloved dips below its typical tag, it’s actually worth paying attention.</p>

<h2>Grown-Up LEGO Fun</h2>
<p data-start="855" data-end="1359">Now before you go imagining the 7,500-plus-piece Ultimate Collector Series starship that’s the size of a studio apartment and costs about a much — let’s be super clear: This is the smaller 25th Anniversary edition 921-piece Millennium Falcon that’s been popping up in deals lately. That said, 921 pieces is still plenty of bricks to keep your fingers busy and your inner kid grinning ear to ear, and this version comes with a display stand so you aren’t sacrificing precious shelf real estate to chaos.</p>
<p data-start="1361" data-end="1855">This isn’t one of those microfighters you flick at your coffee table. It’s the kind of model that earns a place of prominent display as a collector’s item and conversation piece, and not in a heap of other half-wrecked LEGO sets after a pretend battle. Kids probably <em data-start="1649" data-end="1654">can</em> build it, but this adult-oriented set feels more like a collectible for anyone who’s ever whispered “She’s faster than she looks” at a spaceship dangling from a peg at a toy store.</p>


<h2 data-start="1361" data-end="1855">Use the Force</h2>
<p data-start="1857" data-end="2195">LEGO Star Wars sets — even ones that aren’t giant — don’t linger on sale for long. They’re the kind of things that disappear off retailer sites faster than the Falcon makes the Kessel Run. When the price drops to a fresh low and stock comes back, it’s usually fleeting.</p>
<p data-start="2197" data-end="2503">So if you’ve been on the fence about adding this to your collection, now’s the time to decide. Whether it’s for a gift, a weekend build sesh, or a new centerpiece atop your entertainment center, a 20% drop on a fan-favorite set isn’t something that happens every week. See it while you can, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">while it’s still on sale at Amazon for just $68 — because once it sells out again, there’s no guaranteeing when it’ll be back.</a></p>
