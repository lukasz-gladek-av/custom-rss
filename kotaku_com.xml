        <p><span>This week marks <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968">30 years</a> since </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>were released in Japan. What started as two monster-taming RPGs on the Game Boy three decades ago has since become a multimedia empire of video games, anime, trading cards, apps, toys, and lifestyle merchandise.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When something is as far-reaching and multifaceted as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, the series ends up meaning something a little different to everyone. There are widely shared touchstones like the experience of catching <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-anniversary-art-logos-every-pokedex-serebii-2000672767">your favorite monster for the first time</a>, watching the anime after school as a kid, or taking a stroll while playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Go </span></i><span>back in 2016, but everyone has their own </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>story to tell.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As we approach the 30th anniversary, I asked people across the video game industry, whether they be&nbsp; a developer, a member of the media, or a content creator, to reach out and tell me a story about how </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>affected their life for the better. I tried to give everyone as few parameters as possible so they could interpret the question in a way that was distinctly them. Here are the responses I got:</span></p> <p><i><span>These submissions have been lightly edited for clarity, length, and style.</span></i></p> <h2><em>Pokemon</em> professionals</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000672826" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672826"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672826">© Derek Heemsbergen</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s woven itself through the fabric of my life at every stage, starting with the day I opened my mailbox to find a VHS tape of A Sneak Peek at </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. It connected me to friends throughout all stages of schooling and well into adulthood. In my 20s, I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. I’d come home from a miserable job and lie awake in bed, my heartbeat echoing in my ears. Unable to sleep, I’d make a blanket fort in my living room and pop in a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> DVD. Peering into that bucolic world through a woolen veil, a Nintendo DS in my hand, my body would loosen at last. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was the subject of my first conversation with the man I’d marry. His first Pokémon tattoo was Nidoking. Mine was Pikachu. And in my 30s, against titanic odds, I’d land a job at The Pokémon Company International. Working there felt like a dream some days. More often than not, it just felt like a job. But my coworkers? My coworkers were nothing short of inspirational. Decades later, the themes of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> I’d idolized as a child—camaraderie, self-betterment, community—were reflected not in fantasy, but in a handful of profoundly powerful friendships. Though I’ve since moved on and away, those relationships endure. E, D, A, S, et al.—thank you for teaching me that the real Pokémon were the friends we made along the way.” — </span><b>Derek Heemsbergen</b><span>, senior editor at Marvelous and XSEED</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was probably the first thing that I ever truly obsessed over. How did I catch ’em all? Was it true that the episodes that aired in America weren’t the same as the ones in Japan? Is it THAT tough to get a holographic Charizard card? Is Pikablu real? I could carve off whole days of my life and find that they were solely devoted to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, from crying over the “Bye Bye Butterfree” episode when the show aired on syndication at 6:00 AM to grinding my Dragonite to level 100 in my dark bedroom that night when I was supposed to be sleeping. So when I wrote my first book</span><i><span> Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught A Generation To Catch Them All</span></i><span>, I didn’t want to just recite </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> history, but capture what it was like to exist in the midst of “Pokémania.” I’ve never experienced anything quite like it to this day.” — </span><b>Daniel Dockery</b><span>, freelance writer and author of </span><i><span>Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught A Generation To Catch Them All</span></i></p>

 <hr> <p><span>“The first-ever article I ever wrote was for my school paper and concerned the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TV show. From there, I caught not only the journalism bug but a lifelong desire to write about the art and stories that have meaning to me. The article was centered around disproving the conceit that adults can’t enjoy </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>—something people were still arguing back in 2010, if you can believe it! I’m now a games journalist and have been for about five years now—how time flies.” — </span><b>Cat Bussell</b><span>, former senior gaming editor at </span><i><span>VideoGamer</span></i></p> <hr> <p><span>“My love of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> originally began as an escape. As a young child, I was frequently hospitalized because of my disability. I would regularly bring my Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and eventually Game Boy Advance SP with me to play everything from </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span>. I have over 50 completions of </span><i><span>Pokémon Silver</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span> because I would just replay them every time, allowing me to forget about the daily treatments and general pains of being stuck in the hospital. Even as an adult, I frequently go back to those games when I need some form of emotional comfort. Professionally, I can thank </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> for kickstarting my career. My first ever freelance piece in 2018 explored the </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/05/pokemon-lets-go-will-be-the-first-in-the-franchise-i-cant-play"><span>inaccessibility behind the </span><i><span>Let’s Go</span></i><span> games</span></a><span>. After </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> published it, people within the accessibility space began to follow me and interact with me on socials. A year later, when I joined </span><i><span>Can I Play That</span></i><span>, I had built a reputation for exploring accessibility when it was still within its infancy, and that is directly because of my first freelance story. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, despite its ever-present flaws, will always be my comfort series. There will never be a day where I find myself not wanting to explore each region and catch my favorites.” — </span><b>Grant Stoner</b><span>, freelance writer</span></p>

We’re 14 months apart, and grew up playing the opposite </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games so we could then trade the game-exclusive Pokémon. She was <em>Silver</em>, I was <em>Gold</em>. She was <em>Ruby</em>, I was <em>Sapphire</em>. To this day we still bond over </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. As a Community Director, I recognize the importance of making a game feel impactful and nostalgic. Providing players with meaningful stories and adventures with characters they’ve bonded with, and offering a space to share that excitement. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> gave me a love for gaming, and that love translates to </span><i><span>Warframe</span></i><span> and the growing community.” — </span><b>Megan Everett</b><span>, community director at Digital Extremes</span></p> <hr> <p><span>“My mom isn’t a Gamer™ in any sense (she got me </span><i><span>Pokémon Silver </span></i><span>and my first Game Boy Color when I was six and regretted it for many years thereafter when “I’m in a battle!” became a common refrain in our house), but since around 2017, she’s found IRL community and friendship through </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> with like-minded local players, including coordinating gym takedowns in her neighborhood to ensure the maximum daily coins for everyone or scheduling her day around being online at 6 a.m. to do raids in Asia and Europe. Meanwhile she has none of the terminology or cultural knowledge that gaming audiences take for granted (she followed the </span><i><span>PoGo</span></i><span> meta for years before she knew what “the meta” meant). Industry executives and leads talk a big game about wanting to bring in more players/monetize consumers from all walks of life, but most have no idea how or where to engage with people who aren’t already in gaming spheres (even for mobile gaming!). My mom’s </span><i><span>PoGo</span></i><span> journey has informed so much of my approach to reaching the elusive “non-gamer” audience, especially re: onboarding and retention. It’s also put my career into perspective for my mom for the first time, now that she has a basis of understanding for things like player safety and influencer management. Honestly, as silly as it can get sometimes (she’s stopped random strangers holding their phones on the street to ask them if they’re playing </span><i><span>PoGo</span></i><span>), my sisters and I are relieved that she’s doing this instead of getting radicalized in some internet cesspool. I stopped following the franchise around </span><i><span>Sun and Moon</span></i><span>, but watching my mom have the time of her life in her own Trainer era has been great for my inner kid. And a little bit vindicating.” — </span><b>Livvy Hall</b><span>, community director, formerly Xbox Publishing</span></p> <hr> <p><span>“I would’ve beaten </span><i><span>Pokémon Emerald</span></i><span> around the time that I was 8 years old. And while I’d watched plenty of TV shows and movies, and developed a voracious appetite for reading in class, it always feels like the first adventure I embarked on. The first story I told myself. It’s definitely the first game I have ever beaten. The morning I finished </span><i><span>Pokémon Emerald</span></i><span> was a warm summer Saturday like any other, except I’d unknowingly tackled the game’s final mainline challenge: the Elite Four and their champion, Wallace.&nbsp; It was the greatest test of skill I’d ever been faced with in my relatively short life, and about halfway through my game-winning run against Wallace, my Game Boy blinked, signaling it would imminently die. I jumped out of my bed and moved faster than I’ve ever moved to lock my charger into place just outside my room and plug my device in. I’d salvaged things and continued my grueling slugfest with Hoenn’s champion until I, at last, came out on top.&nbsp; I’d never been the best at anything. I never won first place in my karate tournaments. Despite my efforts, I didn’t win that spelling bee I was coerced into competing in. I wasn’t even the best at whatever card games we played at lunch. But that Saturday morning, I was the better Pokémon trainer. I bested Hoenn’s elite and solidified myself among their upper echelon. I remember my body trembling as I sat slumped against the wall and let the realization set in. I felt invincible. Higher than the clouds in the sky. And though that feeling has dulled on subsequent adventures, victories, and completions, I have never been able to shake that first brush with accomplishment in the face of what seemed to me like impossible odds. I’m grateful for it all these years later and reckon I will be for the rest of my life.” — </span><b>Moises Taveras</b><span>, freelance writer</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> as a franchise has had a monumental effect on my life. On a personal level, it played a pivotal role in my relationship with my lifelong best friend. As we grew up, both enthralled in everything </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> had to offer, we made sure to buy different versions of the game, helping each other complete the Pokédex, while at the same time forging our bond to one another and the franchise with each passing generation. That aspect of what </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> means to me cannot be understated. Whether it’s a renewed interest, my autism, or a weird millennial version of a midlife crisis, I started a personal project early last year to watch every episode of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> anime in chronological order, including the films. It’s all been cataloged on a personal Google Sheet document, and it’s been fun to tackle it at my own pace. I’m coming up on 800 episodes as I finish the final season of Black &amp; White and head into the X &amp; Y era of the show.” —&nbsp;</span><b>Jerrad Wyche</b><span>, host of </span><i><span>Controlled Interests Gamecast</span></i></p> <hr> <p><span>“In The Before Times, pre-1998, my gaming mostly consisted of </span><i><span>World Series Baseball </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: The Movie </span></i><span>on Game Gear. Then, for Christmas in 1998, my brother and I each received a Game Boy Pocket and one of the two versions of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>—I got </span><i><span>Red</span></i><span>, he got </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>. We didn’t know about the games beforehand, so shoutout to my parents for figuring out that this was the hot gift because we were immediately obsessed. The fun part of this story comes from the fact that this was the first RPG I had ever played, and I really had no concept of how games like this worked—including RPG things like leveling up a party, choosing what skills to use…and an underrated little mechanic known as “saving the game.” So over the course of Christmas break, I played up to Pewter City or sometimes Mount Moon dozens of times, turned the Game Boy off when it was time to stop, and started a new game the next time I had a chance to play. This is probably also when we discovered the bottomless well of comedy that is naming your rival “Butt” through all the new games we started. It wasn’t until I got to school on the first day after break and saw that my friends were in parts of the game I’d never seen, with Pokémon levels in the 30’s, that I wondered how they were able to play so long without their parents making them stop or the batteries running out. They kindly pointed me to the big option in the menu that said “SAVE,” and the rest was history. Video games became my favorite hobby, and that love for gaming has endured to this day and directly led to me spending hours per week getting into the nitty-gritty of the games we play on my podcast. It all really started with </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>!” — </span><b>Dave Jackson</b><span>, host of </span><i><span>Tales from the Backlog</span></i></p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon</em> helped bridge the gap between them and others</h2> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon GO</span></i><span> launched the day before I found out my father died. I got the call while I was out hunting mons. He passed after an intense struggle with mental illness that left him agoraphobic and estranged from our family. I’m still unsure if his end didn’t do more good than bad. That summer, </span><i><span>PoGO</span></i><span> saved me. I could see the strains of brainsick that devastated his life within myself. But the antidote to that is sunlight and connection: the things that </span><i><span>GO</span></i><span> brought me in spades that summer.” — </span><b>Dan Manning</b><span>, producer at Whisper Forge</span></p> <hr> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> helped bridge the gap in my relationships with my family and other people. My family had this anti-gaming mindset as they prioritized education. However, when it came to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, they welcomed it with open arms, to the point where they’d get me the new console and game for Christmas. It also helped me bond with my cousins as they introduced me to the franchise. This also expands to the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TCG. My mum would find time after work or during weekly shopping trips to buy me </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> cards when I was a kid. Back then, I didn’t know how the game worked, so I just kept them for collecting purposes and made up my own rules with my brother. But I also lived in the Philippines, so there was a high chance that the cards were fake. But I didn’t care cuz I love </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. In 2018, my family revealed that we had a family connection working at Pokémon International in Seattle, so I got to visit the HQ, hug the giant Pikachu at reception, and see where the magic happened. It was great. If it wasn’t for </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, I wouldn’t be exposed to video games growing up due to my family’s strict nature, and I think the franchise somewhat inspired me to pursue entertainment and gaming journalism as it ignited my passion for the hobby and entertainment in general.” — </span><b>Erielle Sudario</b><span>, writer and podcast editor for Checkpoint Gaming</span></p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000672836" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672836"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672836">© Grace Klich</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I can’t say I have any one story on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>; </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> has just always been a staple in my life. I grew up in the peak of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> hype of the late 90s/early 2000s–I remember playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow </span></i><span>on the Game Boy I got for my birthday and not being able to get past the first rock-type gym using my electric-type Pikachu (I still stand by my belief that</span><i><span> Pokémon</span></i><span> is a pretty difficult game for kids lol). I remember my mom taking me to Books-A-Million to buy booster packs. I still remember how excited I was to pull a holographic Raichu from a Fossil pack; Raichu was my absolute favorite. By high school the nostalgia of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> made me want to seriously start collecting. Now, having been a serious collector since 2010, I have one of the most-well known vintage </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> collections online for my extremely curated items. I have been helping other collectors with my knowledge of items as well as sharing the archival work I have done for the community over the years. It has brought me so much joy to share my love of the franchise with others who share that same love.</span></p>

 <p><span>While I have scaled back in collecting and in my community interactions due to the current demand of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, I will always love and cherish such a wonderful franchise that has been a part of me for my entire life. Thank you </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>.” — </span><b>Grace “mewisme700” Klich</b><span>, content creator</span></p> <hr> <p><span>“I’m a ’94 baby that’s been a Trainer since the beginning (</span><i><span>Crystal</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Yellow</span></i><span> were my first!) so I’ve got lots of fun stories, but I wanted to focus on the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> fangame scene which, through ROM hacking and RPG Maker XP, helped me turn into the full-fledged game dev I am now, and also the overall multiplayer aspect that came very, very late for me (Generation 8, actually!) and how that sorta kinda changed my life!&nbsp; My late father really encouraged me to like these Pocket Monsters, but only a couple shone through the thousand! Raichu serendipitously shares its number with my birth date and its generation number with my birth month! 1/26? Gen 1, #0026! Cinderace is the other absolute fav that ended up shaping my online brand with “Hopscorch” originating directly from what I nicknamed my first Scorbunny for the generation that helped me socially the most!” — </span><b>Hopscorch</b><span>, game developer</span></p> <hr> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> is the first in the many dominoes that led to my overall love of video games. I was very close with my cousins growing up, and </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> is a major reason why. When we were kids growing up in The Netherlands, We were so obsessed with the show that all of our parents pooled some money and got us a booster box of the Jungle expansion of the trading card game. We had no idea how to play, but we loved looking at the cards and trading them between each other. I still have some of those cards today.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>During the second generation of the games, Lays did a campaign where bags of chips would include Pogs (though we called them Flippos) with lenticular pictures of Pokémon that would move or evolve as you moved them. I’ve held on to our collection for decades now, because I cherish those memories of gathering around a bag of chips and being more excited by the Flippo than the chips themselves. While I didn’t own one of the games until </span><i><span>Pokémon Sapphire</span></i><span>, I would frequently watch my cousins and friends play, fascinated by the strange creatures and attack animations. At least one of my cousins credits the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games with helping him learn English at a very young age.</span></p>

 <p><span>That fascination led to wanting to play more games in general. My first proper game was </span><i><span>Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds</span></i><span> on PC, but I could never get </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> out of my head. In 2002, I would save up my allowance and do odd jobs and chores to save up to buy my very own GBA with </span><i><span>Pokémon Sapphire</span></i><span>. It would only continue blossoming from there. As I got older, I would become interested in games as a business and as an art form. I would read reviews and criticism and frequent gaming forums to learn more about them. When I got to university I started blogging about them in the community section of the </span><i><span>Screwattack </span></i><span>website. I made friends there that I still know to this day. I became a freelance games critic in 2021, and in 2023 I took over hosting a Nintendo-focused podcast named </span><i><span>N-Focus</span></i><span>. All this came from </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that I would be a fundamentally different person without it.” — </span><b>Hylke Langhout</b><span>, host at N-Focus</span></p> <h2><em>Pokémon</em> as a pop culture pillar</h2> <p><span>“I’ve always used my immigrant mother’s pop culture awareness to gauge if something is really, really popular. For example, the fact that she knows who Princess Diana and Michael Jackson are means that they are some of the most famous figures in history. Also right up there on that list is a yellow mouse creature named Pikachu.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Like many people growing up in the late 90s and early 2000s, my first exposure to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was through the trifecta of their video games, trading cards, and anime. It felt like it was everywhere. However, with the increasing costs of getting new consoles, handhelds, and games and the rise of free online Flash games, I stopped keeping up with the franchise after Generation III. Everything past that generation felt so foreign to me and I began to fall into the mentality of “</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> stopped being good after the generation that I stopped playing.” Outside of my short stint during the </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> Summer of 2016 where we almost achieved world peace, I never really thought much about the franchise afterwards. However, one random mobile app would eventually change that: </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In 2019 during my first year as a high school science teacher, I began using an ordinary sleep tracking app so I could develop better sleeping habits. I loved how it would specifically wake me up when I was in a light sleep stage so that I would feel less groggy in the mornings. Coincidentally during that same year, the CEO of the Pokémon Company announced a sleep tracking mobile app called </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>. While many people online were commenting on the ridiculousness of it, I was excited by this news! You mean to tell me I could continue tracking my sleep, except now I can have the fun of catching Pokémon?! The next few years after that, there was an unfortunate radio silence about the game’s release. I thought it might have been cancelled but that didn’t stop me from checking online every now and then for any updates.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>My dedication was finally rewarded in Summer 2023 when it was finally available for download on the app store. At the time, I thought it would be a nice, little casual game experience for me. However, it soon became my game of the year for 2023 and my favorite game overall. While </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span> is still a sleep tracker at night, by day it’s like Tamogotchi and your Pokémon team finds food for Snorlax so it can grow bigger and stronger which will help attract more Pokémon for you to catch. As I got more into the game and started joining the </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep </span></i><span>subreddits and Discord servers, I was surprised by how complex the mechanics could be for a sleep tracker game. There’s whole communities dedicated to helping you learn what optimal stats and nature each Pokémon should have and they’ve even made tons of infographics, spreadsheets, and websites for all different types of game calculations.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Through </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span> and its community, I became interested in the franchise again and can confirm that it does stay good after Generation III! Because of </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>, I’ve been getting into other </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games now and I even incorporate Pokémon-based lessons into my classroom. I love this game so much that my students say that I’m obsessed with it; one of them even drew me sleeping next to Snorlax in </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span> as a gift! Oh and yes, I did develop better sleep habits because of the game.” — </span><b>Mashfiq Ahmed</b><span>, teacher and Minecraft Club lead at John Dewey High School</span></p> <hr> <p>“I definitively missed the <em>Pokémon</em> craze.</p> <p>By the time <em>Red</em> and <em>Blue</em> landed in the US, I was 15, and seeing as how the first time I ever heard of <i><span>Pokémon</span></i> was when the news warned us all about a Japanese cartoon giving children seizures, <em>Pokémon</em> was clearly a kids thing. I paid it no attention as I focused on adult things like high school, the WWF Attitude Era, and my N64.</p> <p>Over my nearly 20 years of covering video games professionally, I’ve tried my best to get into <i><span>Pokémon</span></i>, but it never took.

One morning, my wife put on the show she grew up with—<em>Pokémon</em>. Both Ben and I were engrossed.</p> <p>It was suddenly clear to me that I had played every game without reading the source material.

I loved the show, the movies, collected all the cards—though foolishly I sold my collection of the first four sets before I went to college—and kept playing throughout the years. Some of my fondest memories were the sleepovers I had with two close friends where we did battle royales over </span><i><span>Red &amp; Blue, Yellow</span></i><span>, and then </span><i><span>Gold &amp; Silver</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Crystal</span></i><span> (my favorite).

Share</span></i></a><span> where a friend who had never played the games joined me to record our journey playing through all the main games through Gen 9, plus a bunch of side games. Over the years I missed several releases, so especially as a completionist, it’s very satisfying to be able to say that I’ve played all the core games. Not to mention how great it is to engage with the broader <em>Pokémon</em> community (who even if they don’t share my affinity for my favorite Pokémon, Mewtwo and Octillery, do enjoy the tattoos I have of them).” — </span><b>Josh Fjelstad</b><span>, co-host of </span><i><span>EXP. Share</span></i></p> <h2>Forming community through&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em></h2> <p><span>“As a Day 1 </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> fan who vividly remembers trading base set cards on the playground and transferring my team from </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow</span></i><span> into </span><i><span>Pokémon Stadium</span></i><span> to be able to play in glorious 3D, to say the series has had an impact on my life would be a massive understatement. Today, I’m a full time content creator who plays </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games for a living, and while I’ve been fortunate enough to witness the hype cycle of each new generation in real time with my audience, my </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> fandom roots definitely started with the card game. The year is 1999 and the hype for the then-upcoming Fossil set is reaching a fever pitch: my local community college is hosting an official all-ages tournament for the first time and the top prize is a pre-release holographic Aerodactyl from the new set.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As a fresh-faced nine year old with no prior competitive TCG experience, I naively begged my Dad to take me to compete and he happily obliged. With hope in my heart and my “Rain Dance” deck in hand (a water deck centered on the strong base set Blastoise card with the Rain Dance ability), I walked up to the check-in area and was immediately taken aback by all of the adults and teenagers that were prepared and ready to beat me down. At this time, the meta of the card game was new and shifting but a quick damage, easy-to-put-together deck called “Haymaker” was all the rage and this tournament was my first time ever seeing it in action. For the first round, I’m matched up against a 20-something with a “Haymaker” deck and I manage to win by the skin of my teeth. The next round begins, and I’m matched against ANOTHER fully-grown adult with, you guessed it, a variation of “Haymaker.” Once again, I managed to win and after about six more rounds of competitors with “Haymaker” decks, I’m starting to think that victory is within my grasp.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000672837" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672837"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672837">© Roger Diluigi</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As I enter the finals, I’m prepared to take down one more adult “Haymaker” user but I’m surprised to find that my opponent is a 30-something dad, similar in age to me today, competing for his son with what appears to be the “Rain Maker” deck that I managed to make it all the way here with. At this point, it’s important to note that my favorite Pokémon of all time is Lickitung and the Jungle expansion that released just prior to this tournament introduced a powerful, easy-to-use colorless Lickitung card that can do 10 damage and paralyze opponents with just a single energy and a coin flip. The card was common and widely seen as useful, but people hadn’t fully figured out how to use it to compliment their tried-and-true decks yet and this tournament was hardly the place that people were willing to experiment.</span></p> <p><span>As the final match started, my opponent and I played nearly identically and were slowly building up our “Rain Dance” Blastoises but I had a hidden weapon: LICKITUNG. For this final match, I opted to build up the Blastoise on my bench and instead use Lickitung to paralyze my opponent and keep them from doing anything. After 8 turns in a row of successful coin flips and PlusPower-boosted Tongue Wrap attacks, I managed to take down my opponent’s Blastoise and victory was mine. I have my original “Rain Dance” deck and Pre-Release Holographic Aerodactyl to this day, and Lickitung is still my favorite Pokémon!” — </span><b>Roger “RogersBase” DiLuigi</b><span>, content creator</span></p> <hr> <p><span>“One of the most interesting things about </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> after 30 years is learning someone’s favorite Pokémon. If you grew up with </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span>, your favorite could easily be Charizard or Gengar because that’s what you connected with when you first experienced the franchise. Whenever I meet someone my age, I’m never surprised if they pick a Kanto Pokémon as their favorite.</span></p>

 <p><span>1,000+ Pokémon later, there is something special about a newer Pokémon winning over a long-time fan. The question is: if someone loved Bulbasaur for 30 years, for example, could a newer Pokémon eventually become their new favorite? A couple of years ago, I was in Japan for a </span><i><span>Pokémon GO </span></i><span>event taking place in Sendai. I knew that if I played more aggressively than normal, I would finally hit the level cap of 50 that weekend. This was a big accomplishment I wanted to celebrate, so I livestreamed it. As I prepared to catch the last Pokémon I needed to reach my goal, something unexpected happened. An egg attached instead, and a Pawmi gave me the final XP push into level 50.</span></p> <p><span>When Pawmi was first revealed in</span><i><span> Pokémon Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pokémon Violet</span></i><span>, I didn’t think too much of it. But now, after grinding to reach level 50, I will always remember that Pawmi was the Pokémon to complete that journey with me. It might sound silly, but that day, Pawmi cemented a top spot as one of my favorite Pokémon. These moments of connection, of creating memories, with </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>—both new and old—can tell so much about a person. People’s favorites always reveal the most interesting stories.” — </span><b>Steve Sarumi</b><span>, host of </span><i><span>It’s Super Effective</span></i></p> <h2><em>Pokémon</em>‘s musical history</h2> <p><span>“I think it’s a common perspective among Americans to see </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> as this inevitable thing, that it would undoubtedly take over the world, because it came to the States prepackaged and ready to dominate after already doing so in Japan. But the original games were far from a sure thing. They were broken; low on funding; built by a small, troubled team for a console that was considered on the outs. But there were clearly some ingredients in the mix that captured the world’s attention. I’m always inspired to learn that something I love and aspire to was built under constraints that feel familiar to me.</span></p> <p><span>As a musician, I see the music of the first games as a microcosm of that narrative. Composer Junichi Masuda had four channels that could each play one note at a time—three for notes, one for white noise rhythmic sounds or textures—and he wrote a large suite of themes that people continue to adore and seek out today. And what’s truly great about that is, like the games themselves, the music has its flaws. The original </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Green</span></i><span> OST is an impressive body of lovely, diverse themes written with baroque-style polyphony, and composers wanting to learn how to fulfill all the musical needs of an RPG would be hard-pressed to find better examples than that soundtrack. But it’s far from perfect—which makes it all the more inspiring. It’s a scrappy yet clearly ingenious collection of work that has fueled the imaginations of music lovers and creators for decades. It’s something that seems miraculous on a first listen, then, upon closer inspection, shows its rough edges in a way that makes you think, ‘Maybe I can do that.’” — </span><b>Joe Palmer-DeClara</b><span>, composer and sound designer</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span>I was 10 years old when Pokémania hit. It felt like overnight I was issued a pack of trading cards, a new cartoon to watch, and a Game Boy with a red cartridge to rival my brother’s blue one. Adventuring through the world of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> while being steeped in gloriously green pixels unlocked a new part of my imagination, and I’ve since channeled that core experience into my career as a full-time pixel artist and game developer. As the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> franchise celebrates its 30-year anniversary (which also means I must be in my final evolution from that 10-year-old starter kid), there are two things I continue to hold true: (1) I adore that chunky little pixel world; and (2) I will, on occasion, use my frying pan as a “drying” pan. — </span><b>Brandon James Greer</b><span>, YouTuber, creative director at Nano Park Studios</span></p> <h2>Coming back to&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>later in life</h2> <p><span>“I think my story follows a common beginning that a lot of older </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> fans can relate to, but then takes an unusual turn. I’m 34, and </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>will be celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. That is to say, I was the exact demographic that </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> was marketed to when it was first released. I was gifted a Game Boy and </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Yellow</span></i><span> in elementary school, bought and traded the cards with my friends–treasuring my shiny Charizard and Blastoise– and looked forward to whatever mischief Ash, Misty, and Brock would get up to in the next </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>episode.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But as I got older and my interests turned elsewhere, I slowly and then entirely fell away from </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>.

Almost like a tradition that we were creating, my husband and I gifted her the newest </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> games, bought her the trading cards, plushies, and a multitude of other merch (there’s so much now!), and sat down to watch the show with her. In the last year specifically, as I watched her enjoy </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> arguably more than I ever did, I began to regain and cultivate a newfound appreciation for the series. Eventually we started playing</span><i><span> Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon GO</span></i><span> as a family, going to our local conventions and community events, and my eyes turned toward the newest </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> game,</span><i><span> Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000672830" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672830"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672830">© Jahara Jayde</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where I think the twist begins is here, and it honestly feels like so many things fell into place at once! I’m a professional live streamer on Twitch and YouTube, as well as a professional cosplayer. When </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> was announced the internet was flooded with pictures of a new trainer, Jacinthe. I didn’t know anything about her, but she was depicted as this stunning dark-skinned black woman in the prettiest lilac lace dress, and I immediately decided I wanted to cosplay her. And once I began researching into her design, I also gained the desire to try out the new game. I’d long felt that I was no longer the target audience for </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>, but Jacinthe fully changed my mind. So I did both. I crafted her cosplay from scratch and I posted videos and pictures of it online. They blew up. I started streaming </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> and posting clips of my gameplay online. People came to watch. I hadn’t had an audience for </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>before, but both my streaming channels and all my socials started gaining fans rapidly, with people telling me how refreshing it was to see such a “new” and “positive” perspective from someone who still held nostalgia for the series, but hadn’t interacted with it directly since Gen 1 &amp; 2. People told me it was just FUN watching ME have so much FUN and whimsy for the game, and that I was bringing a sort of joy to the community that fans my own age said they felt they’d lost a little.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The response has been immense, and the community has been so welcoming. In all honesty, I don’t think anyone is as surprised as I am, because I didn’t think I’d fall back in love with </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> as quickly and easily as I did, after years of convincing myself that passing that torch down to my daughter meant I couldn’t hold it too.

A friend of one of my siblings lent said sibling their copy of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span> back sometime in the late 90s or early 2000s and then I somehow managed to get my hands on it. I remember playing the game on family vacation, sitting outside and being mesmerized by the mechanics.

I’d saved some cash to buy </span><i><span>Emerald</span></i><span>, for which I was insanely excited. Up until the Switch games, </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span> was the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game I’d spent the most hours playing; clocked close to 300 in it. (Gen 3 rules.) I went to Walmart with my dad—an unsavory guy who, to this day, is still frequently in and out of jail for various offenses, usually drug related—and insisted on buying the game that day despite him urging me to use the money, my money, on anything else.</span></p> <p><span>I started tearing open the packaging as soon as we returned to his beat-up truck, waxing poetic about how cool it was gonna be. He looks at me and says, ‘When are you gonna grow out of this shit?’ and started going on again about how much of a waste of money it was. In that moment, I was fighting harder to hold back tears than I ever would fight in the Battle Frontier.</span></p> <p><span>It wasn’t the first or last time my dad would say or do something that hurt or deeply embedded itself into me, but I think about it the most because it’s the one that I think defines our relationship (or rather, lack thereof).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I wasn’t equipped at 14 to understand his point of view and why he might be acting so belligerently to his son about something he enjoyed, and I can’t say at 35 that I know why he was doing it. He could’ve been high as a kite, for all I know, and not even known how he was acting (this, sadly, is probably the most accurate take). But we never shared a single interest while I was growing up, in part because I don’t know that my dad, by the time I could really know who he was, had any interests outside of survival. In my youth he was a coal-truck driver and a mechanic, and most of his “hobbies” revolved around his labor related to those things. Other things that thrilled him—gambling, drinking beer—were things that wouldn’t captivate me nearly as much, and not for a very long time, obviously.</span></p> <p><span>I never grew out of what he called ‘shit.’ So much of what I loved as a 9-year-old kid and a 14-year-old teenager are the same things I love as a 35-year-old man. I love and think about them differently, but the thought of not having a relationship with </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Power Rangers</span></i><span> or comic books or any number of things my dad had zero interest in hearing me talk about is unfathomable.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And it’s unfathomable for me to think I would ever treat my own son’s interests like my dad treated mine. I have little doubt that our little guy will have a fondness for so many things that I don’t understand and perhaps detest, but I’m so fucking excited to help him explore whatever his passions are.

That was what </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>was for me.</span></p> <p><span>I received my first Game Boy Color (the see-through purple model which remains the best to this day) when I was 6 years old with a copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span>. I remember first being presented with a question that would help define the remainder of my life. Which Pokémon do you choose? I went with Charmander for my first playthrough; however, I would ultimately settle on Bulbasaur being my favorite starter. As I continued to explore the world of Kanto, I found comfort in the variety of ‘mons I could find and how I could maximize my team to become the very best like no one ever was.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> made the days bearable. Whenever life at home would pick up and become hostile, I would be able to escape under the covers with my Game Boy light and hang out with my Pokémon and take out the villains of Team Rocket. It showed me that there was good in the world. Up until now, I had assumed that everyone was dealing with what I was going through within the walls of my home. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>showed me that I could be a kid that took down those that were harming others, and I could do so partnered with my Pokémon team.</span></p> <p><span>This trend would continue as I grew up. I would save up as much money as I could to get </span><i><span>Pokémon Gold</span></i><span> when it launched. I was excited to explore a new region and find even more Pokémon that existed. I found myself continuing to play throughout the night due to the fear I experienced of being awoken by plates breaking or adults shouting. I ended up finding out there was a Pokémon that I could evolve at night time to get a special evolution. This Pokémon was Umbreon. Umbreon became my favorite Pokémon of the generation. I believed that with Umbreon by my side, I could defend myself from anything that happened to come my way once the sun set.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> has always provided a sense of comfort. I am 34 now and whenever times get tough, I’ll open the latest </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game and get lost in the safe space I’ve been able to make for myself. I even celebrate the nights of protection and comfort that </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> provided me by hosting </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> Sleepovers on Twitch whenever a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>drops, where anyone can join to play along with the new game, catch new Pokémon, and have a space to safely escape throughout the night.</span></p> <p><span>I never see myself slowing down with</span><i><span> Pokémon</span></i><span>. In fact, I share my passion for it with “the youth” in my life any chance I get. If </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was able to provide me with the safety I needed when no one knew what I was going through, I believe it can do that for anyone that needs it.” — </span><b>Djacob “djacobok” Young</b><span>, content creator</span></p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000672828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672828"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672828">© GlitchxCity</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“Back in 2014, I got the opportunity to attend both my very first </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> event, which was Pokémon Worlds in Washington D.C, and Pokémon Symphonic Evolutions! </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> music has been a very important pillar in my life, so getting the opportunity to actually hear my favorite video game music in an orchestra was incredible!

I would watch episodes of the anime on VHS on the little CRT I had in my closet growing up. Late at night, I had to sit about a foot from the screen so I could plug my headphones in and watch when I was most definitely supposed to be sleeping. My parents were super fond of the idea of me playing the games, though. On one miraculous morning in 2000, my mother decided to take my sister and I to Toys R Us. To this day I don’t know what came over her, but she bought us a Funtastic Fire Orange Nintendo 64 with copies of </span><i><span>Mario Kart 64</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon Stadium</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Pokémon Snap</span></i><span>. What a delight!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Of course I enjoyed the </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>games, but</span><i><span> Pokémon</span></i><span> was what I really wanted. I played the hell out of</span><i><span> Stadium</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Snap</span></i><span>. Still, they weren’t the mainline games. A year later, I got the translucent Glacier Game Boy Advance with a copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Crystal</span></i><span>. I was STOKED. Finally my very own </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game where I could actually train my own team! Against my parents’ advice, I took the GBA to school with me to show off to my 1st grade class. Now, I was 6 years old; I could hardly read. So a game like </span><i><span>Pokémon Crystal </span></i><span>wasn’t exactly the easiest thing for me to figure out. I needed some help figuring out what to do in the game, so I went up to some older kids at recess to ask for help.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>They had their Game Boys out, so I had high hopes! Unfortunately, I was met with jeers and laughs of “Stupid kid can’t read” and “Wow, what an idiot.” Little Nico was devastated. I immediately started crying and ran off, out into the school field. I only lived a few blocks from school, so I ran home, tears in my eyes, and finally collapsed on my driveway where my mom was doing some yard work. She asked me what was wrong, and I didn’t know how to properly share my feelings, so in a fit of rage, I threw the translucent Glacier Game Boy Advance onto the ground, and it shattered into pieces. My mom came over and consoled me, took care of the plastic bits on the driveway, and walked me back to school. So there it was. I had been bullied out of playing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>at just 6 years old.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I avoided playing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>my entire life after that experience. There was always a bit of jealousy in my heart for those that got to enjoy it. Two decades later, I started streaming on Twitch, and with the encouragement of my wonderful community, I decided to give my very first mainline </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game a go:</span><i><span> Pokémon Sword</span></i><span>. With Sobble by my side, and my first catch Nickit on the team, I trained up my little monsters and beat my very first game. It was an incredibly emotional moment for me. I remember summing up the whole experience with one phrase as I watched the credits: “I have been missing out on this my entire life?!” That moment helped me realize I could finally jump into the world of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> head-on. And I went hard! I started shiny hunting, and am now working towards a National Living Shiny Dex, meaning a shiny of every single Pokémon in the national dex at the same time, kept in </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span>. I currently have 955/1025, putting me at a 93.17 percent completion!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I really did a full 180 as far as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> goes, but truly I couldn’t be happier with where I stand with the franchise now. — </span><b>Nico “nicotendo64” Silvian</b><span>, streamer</span></p> <hr> <p><span>“The first </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game I played was </span><i><span>Gold</span></i><span> back when I was 7 at my cousin’s house. After just a few hours of exploring the Johto region, I left wanting nothing else but to be able to collect them all on my own. Unfortunately, due to my family’s financial struggles, this would never come to fruition, so I spent my whole childhood and teenage years playing every game I could on emulators, collecting and trading any card I could put my hands on, or just reading dedicated websites, anxiously absorbing every piece of information I could get about the series.</span></p> <p><span>Then, almost 14 years ago, when I was old enough to have a job and buy my first console (a black Nintendo 3DS), I hurried up to the closest store and bought my first official copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon White</span></i><span>.

I named this shiny little dude Meteor and started playing what is today my favorite entry in the series.

My school bus pulled up the exact moment that the Poké Ball finally snapped shut…I didn’t have time to save! I had to turn the Game Boy off and get on the bus. By the time I got to school, Articuno was gone, and I was absolutely crushed. When I got home that night, I ran straight to my Game Boy and caught it again!

One of my most cherished is attending the </span><i><span>Ruby</span></i><span> &amp; </span><i><span>Sapphire </span></i><span>Eon Ticket event in 2004 at my local Gamestation store to obtain a Latias. After making sure I met the prerequisites to obtain the ticket, I linked my console with the one being used by a representative of Nintendo. This allowed me to visit Southern Island and capture Latias. It was really cool to explore an area of the Hoenn map and obtain something quite special that few others had. I also received a goodie bag filled with </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> figures, temporary tattoos, and other assorted items especially for this distribution.</span></p> <p><span>I stayed at the event for a few hours and took the chance to speak to the Nintendo representative for a while. I even got involved with the event, helping attendees set up their copies of </span><i><span>Pokémon Ruby</span></i><span> &amp;</span><i><span> Sapphire</span></i><span> so they could obtain the ticket themselves. While doing this, I met a guy named Gavin, who had come to the store to receive a Latias too. We got along really well and exchanged contact details so we could keep in touch. Once the event was over, the Nintendo representative gave me an extra goodie bag for all the help I had given!</span></p> <p><span>Twenty-two years have now passed since that event, and Gavin and I are still friends to this day! We bought </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed</span></i><span> &amp;</span><i><span> LeafGreen</span></i><span> at launch together and tested the distance of the wireless adapter in the local shopping mall. We spent lots of time battling, trading, and bonding over our shared love of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>.

Through my site I met many people but this was the first time that I met anyone through it. I had developed a small group of friends in </span><i><span>Serebii</span></i><span>’s mod team and one day in 2003 the four of us decided to head to London. We did lots of tourist stuff but the key moment was when we went to St. James Park in London and just sat on the grass. We had all brought our Game Boy Advance consoles and a copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Ruby</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span> and we decided to play some Multi Battles. It was just such a good time, and while I can’t remember who won and I haven’t kept in the best contact with those friends, it is a memory that I will cherish forever.</span></p> <p><span>This was the first time that I felt a sense of community with </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and truly saw how awesome the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> community could be, and since then it has snowballed and I see it at every event I attend.

I thought </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was super lame and for babies. That was, until my cousin gave me his </span><i><span>Blue Version</span></i><span> cartridge. I didn’t even know there was a game before then. And I got hopelessly hooked. I read everything about it after that. I discovered my favorite Pokémon was Primeape, only to find out that tragically, you couldn’t get them in </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>. By then all my classmates had moved on to </span><i><span>Dragon Ball Z</span></i><span> and thought </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was a lame game for babies. So I was too embarrassed to admit I was still playing it and needed someone with a </span><i><span>Red</span></i><span> cartridge to trade with me.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Eventually I met someone from a different school who traded with me. I couldn’t name the Primeape since they were traded, but in my head I called them Goku. They were the first Pokémon I got to level 100. A very special one to me.</span></p> <p><span>I think what lingers most in my memory was just how much love I felt for those janky little pixels in my Game Boy. Choosing my own monsters, and training them up myself, made me deeply care about them in a way I hadn’t ever gotten from passing views of the anime. It taught me a lot about what makes games special.” — </span><b>Greg Lobanov</b><span>, director of </span><i><span>Beastieball</span></i></p> <hr> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was something that existed as a constant in my life.

My mom would use Pokémon cards as flash cards to help me learn to read, and by the time I had gotten my own GBA and copy of </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> it felt only natural. I bought every new entry, scrounging up pennies and birthday money, getting gifted </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-related items from relatives, battling and trading with my friends, and even using my hand-me-down GBAs from my siblings to trade with myself. There was never any replacement, no idea of the series faltering or any end in sight, and every year of my life was passively accompanied by something </span><i><span>Pokémon-</span></i><span>related.</span></p> <p><span>But it wasn’t the “online chat-room battling and trading” of the early 2010s that stood out, or even the way that I could memorize every Pokémon name, shiny, fun facts, and other information, but a realization I had in my early 20s that made the culmination of now two and a half decades of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> playing really hit home. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> allowed me to have the confidence to try new things. It sounds silly when saying it aloud, but at every aspect of my life, the 12-year-old kid learning what it means to make a ROM hack and how exciting making a game can be, the 15-year-old kid battling strangers on my 3DS at PAX, overcoming his crippling social anxiety, the 18-year-old rediscovering pixel art and sprite edits he made on MS Paint, turning it into a full-time career, every single new stage in my life I had </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> to thank for being the reason I dived head first into a topic I would otherwise have been terrified to approach. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> became so fundamental to my thinking that I never processed how from personal life, to hobbies, to career, it was the backbone of every decision, subtle in its influence. Even now, as I sit at my desk, surrounded by </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> merch, drawing pixel art of Pokémon as commissions, I always felt lucky that I had such a fun interest to use as a guiding light, but I never thought about how it gave me the comfort I needed, as a kid, a teen, and as an adult, to find familiarity in the unknown, or have the confidence to be the person who aimed so high, and ended up even higher.</span></p> <p><span>Without </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, I may not have had an interest in game-dev or pixel art, or maybe not as strongly, but I absolutely would not have had the confidence or strength to overcome all the challenges of becoming who I am today, and for that I am forever thankful to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>.” — </span><b>JDZombi</b><span>, professional pixel artist</span></p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000672834" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672834"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672834">© Nikky Armstrong</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow</span></i><span> was the first game I ever owned new.

I still have the cartridge, with the box and the Trainer’s Guide (complete with my own notes about how to get past Brock with a Butterfree). It was also the only game I owned for a long time, so I played it constantly, immediately restarting it as soon as I finished. Growlithe was always my favorite Pokémon, and I worked out a strategy so that every playthrough I would get to Cinnabar Island as quickly as possible, catch my Growlithe, and play the rest of the game with him on my team. Growlithe is usually a version exclusive, so I always made sure to buy whichever version of the latest game included my Growlithe buddy.</span></p> <p><span>In my late 20s, after an awful relationship ended, I had the opportunity to get my first ever dog. He’s an orange German Spitz, who I of course called Growlithe. He is exactly what I imagined having a real Growlithe companion would be like for all those years I spent playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow</span></i><span>. He has travelled with me across Australia, and in 2020, moved with me from Australia to England.
