              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> the latest main entry in Nintendo’s <em>Metroid</em> franchise, is finally here after nearly a decade of waiting. Now available on Switch and Switch 2,<em> Prime 4</em> might not be the best game in the series, but it offers up plenty of great levels to explore and aliens to shoot. But before you hop into this new adventure, we have some tips to help you save the day.</p> <h2>Make sure you smash plenty of green crystals!</h2> <p>While exploring the Sol Valley desert in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4,</em></a> you’ll spot lots of green crystals. These can be smashed with your motorcycle and collected. The game tells you to do this, and you really, really should. Not only do you get some upgrades when you bring these crystals back to your base camp, but you’ll hopefully not have to grind much later to finish <em>Prime 4</em> if you collect gems now. You need a lot before the game lets you start the final mission, and I didn’t have enough, so I had to drive around for like 30 minutes collecting more. Don’t be like me! Smash those crystals whenever you see them.</p>

 <h2>Change the morph ball jump button ASAP</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000651425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651425"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651425">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For some strange reason (and it was like this in <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> as well)<em>&nbsp;Prime 4</em> includes two different jump buttons when you first boot it up: One for Samus in her standard human form and one for when you are in her Morph Ball form. Thankfully, after digging through some menus, you can change this to one button and I recommend doing that as soon as the game allows. <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021">Here’s a quick, handy guide on how to do that!</a></p>

 <h2>Mash the A button to (possibly) skip cutscenes</h2> <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> includes some fantastic cutscenes. It also contains a lot of filler-y cutscenes that you’ll see over and over again as Samus transitions to different areas. Thankfully, you can skip these. You do have to wait for the game to finish loading before you can skip these, and it doesn’t tell you when that happens. On Switch 2 at least, I found load times to be fast and got into a habit of mashing the A button during transitional cutscenes so I could end them the moment loading wrapped up.</p>

 <h2>Scan stuff and then scan more stuff!</h2> <p>This is a <em>Metroid Prime</em> game, so I probably don’t need to tell most people to scan items and enemies, but in case this is your first rodeo: Scan everything. Often, these scans can reveal clues as to how a door is open or a puzzle completed. Some enemies even contain info on how to defeat them faster.</p>

 <h2>When stuck, try everything</h2> <p><em>Prime 4</em> does a pretty good job of not making its puzzles too obtuse. But there were still moments where I was left scratching my head as to what to do next. When this happened, I would follow a very simple rule: Try everything, starting with the most recent ability I unlocked. Even if it seems silly to use a bomb or missile or charged blast or whatever on that lock or item, give it a shot. If you do this, you’ll likely find the solution in no time.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651426">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Freeze enemies</h2> <p>While you get access to multiple elemental blasts in<em> Prime 4,</em> my favorite ended up being the ice shot, as it freezes most enemies in place for a few seconds, which can help a lot when you get ambushed by tough aliens. It also makes flying enemies fall out of the sky, which can be very useful in some parts of <em>Prime 4</em>. Oh, and make sure you use the ice shot on fire-themed enemies to quickly take them out.</p> <h2>Mark stuff on your map</h2> <p>As you explore the various levels and the desert in <em>Prime 4</em>, you’ll likely encounter doors you can’t open or things you can’t interact with yet until you get a specific ability. These moments aren’t a waste of time, however, as<em> Prime 4</em> lets you mark these areas on your map using a few different icons. This can be very helpful when, hours later, you want to go back to that scout bot or locked door but don’t remember where it was.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Watch Pokémon And Yu-Gi-Oh’s Heroes Duke It Out In A Pure ’90s Nostalgia Bomb]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been years since I watched a video by Death Battle, the YouTube channel that pits fictional characters from different franchises against each other and breaks down who would win based on science and extensive research. The channel’s latest video, however, is required viewing for ‘90s kids like me who loved the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh </span></i><span>anime growing up. Who would win in a battle, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash Ketchum from </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>or Yugi Moto from </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>? Death Battle answered, and fans of both series are weighing in with impassioned answers, disputes, and celebration.</span></p> <p><span>If you don’t want spoilers out of the gate and instead want to see the whole thing play out for yourself, check out Death Battle’s full 30-minute video below. Not only does the crew give extensive recaps of both heroes’ journeys in their respective shows to illustrate their power as a Pokémon Champion and the King of Games, but it also has a pretty great animated version of the fight that’s full of fun references to both series. The voice performances in this mock-up brawl, by Elsie Lovelock as Ash and Tom Schalk as Yugi. are so spot-on, I thought Death Battle might have gotten </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ash-ketchum-voice-actor-sarah-natochenny-anime-1850234947"><span>Sarah Natochenny</span></a><span> and Dan Green to reprise their roles. We’ll discuss the results underneath the video.</span></p>

  <p><span>Alrighty, now that you’ve presumably watched the video or just want to know the results, Yugi barely manages to win out against Ash in the end, using his Magic Cylinder card to send what would have been a finishing blow back at the Pokémon trainer and his many monsters. It surprisingly ends with a dark homage to the </span><i><span>First Movie</span></i><span>, in which Ash is turned to stone after getting caught in the middle of a psychic battle between Mew and Mewtwo. Yugi walks off like this is perfectly fine. That’s a 10-year-old kid and his many pets you just murdered, my guy.</span></p>

 <p><span>Needless to say, anime fans of a certain age were invested in this match-up when it was </span><a href="https://x.com/OriginTheHero/status/1987594405340180963"><span>teased in November</span></a><span>, with many </span><a href="https://x.com/JoshDL_/status/1987668787886477748?s=20"><span>predicting this fight was an easy win for their preferred side</span></a><span>. Some expected Yugi and Ash to duke it out with their fists, but Death Battle went the extra mile to incorporate most of Ash’s best Pokémon and Yugi’s best cards. Even if you disagree with the result, the fight is a delight to watch if you’re a fan of both series. In all this disagreement and celebration, </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>, and Death Battle fans are all in their feelings. The channel has been around for almost 20 years, so if you grew up watching these series and these videos, it’s a crazy collision of your childhood’s hyperfixations.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah, no, Ash VS Yugi was PEAK!!!</p> <p>The analyses, the fight, the love and references sprinkled in between… There's NO way I can fit all my thoughts in a single tweet…</p> <p>But perhaps another format could do… <a href="https://t.co/eTl5JiGOtT">pic.twitter.com/eTl5JiGOtT</a></p> <p>— AwesomeEthan48 (@AEthan48) <a href="https://twitter.com/AEthan48/status/1997776670124830749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine this happens in Ash Vs.
