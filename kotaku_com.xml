              <p>It certainly looks like it’s going to be a joke. When you create an extraction shooter, but then theme it around cartoon ducks and give it a spoof name based on one of the most popular examples of the genre, it’s hard not to assume <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/"><em>Escape from Duckov</em></a> is just a goof. But I’m here to tell you, nope, this is a solid and astonishingly compelling PvE looter-shooter that deserves every one of its million sales.</p> <p>I’m not a big extraction shooter guy. (These are first- or third-person games that are generally about entering a battlefield and attempting to harvest as much loot and progress as you can, then extracting yourself before either a timer runs out or you get killed.) This high risk/high reward model tends to feel too stressful to me, and never more so than when it’s all about surviving the attacks of an enemy team of real, human players. It’s like a roguelite but with other people laughing at you, and where loss not only means you don’t keep anything you found, but also anything you arrived with. However, it turns out all I needed was for it to be about ducks.</p>

  <p>Inspired by&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em> (the lead developer of the five-person Chinese team behind the game told me he’s an avid, hardcore player), but utterly dissimilar in so many important ways, <em>Escape from Duckov</em> strips the formula down to something that feels far more approachable, although just as ruthless. The game is entirely PvE, and played in single-player, but those web-footed CPU enemies aren’t even vaguely friendly. You’re going to die a <em>lot</em>. But importantly, you’re not going to mind nearly as much.</p>

 <p>The game begins with the most delightful character creator, in which you build yourself a duck avatar with a lot more variety than you might imagine that concept could offer. The wide, blank, pupil-less eyes were irresistible to me, but I could have chosen anything from buttons to metallic binocular-like protrusions. You can have regular cartoon duck legs, or the utter abomination that is human feet. And given this is an offline premium game with no mercenary in-game purchases, you can change up your look any time you want. You then arrive in your bunker, a large, mostly empty space, but for your little bedroom off the side. Down here is Jeff, your duck companion who will show you the ropes, set you quests, and guide you through the process of building out your base.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638622">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To do this, you’re going to need loot, and to get that, you’re going to have to go outside. So originally armed with nothing but a pointy stick, you need to start making tentative ventures into the green and pleasant realm above. It’s just it’s populated by furious birds (and wolves) holding powerful weapons, all determined for unexplained reasons to kill you on sight.</p>

 <p><em>Escape from Duckov</em>‘s greatest trick is just how well it’s designed around welcoming you in. Those early trips can certainly be tricky, but you’ll very quickly be armed (winged?) with a revolver, shooting down opponents (into really quite horrendously gibby goop), and scooping up all the loot from their amusing cooked-carcass remains. You’ll then do all that extraction shooter goodness, like sneaking into abandoned buildings and emptying the cupboards, daring to head a little further each time. The key point is, the game very carefully doesn’t overwhelm you at first, but subtly ramps up those earliest areas once you’re ready to cope. You’re motivated by those early quests, like finding a flat-head screwdriver to fix the local radio tower, but also by that far more powerful drive: revenge. If a group of ducks took you down last time, well, first you’ll want to return to that spot because you’ve got one chance to recover everything you died carrying, but you’ll also want to wipe the smiles off their beaks right away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638627"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638627">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And then the loop has its webbed claws into you. Soon you’ll be adding new stations to your base, letting you craft better health items, weapons, and various other elements essential for crafting the next thing on the compelling list. And each of those stations have upgrade paths themselves. Friendly ducks you meet will end up moving in to run some stations, such as a gym or a weapon-modification store, each with their own quests to give you. Everything you add adds more, becomes another to-do list of improvements to loot for, and drives you to be ever-more brave on your expeditions.</p>

 <p>Holding you back are two elements: nighttime and the Storm. The former is fairly easily dealt with: you can either brave the far more dangerous world, or just go to bed and wait for morning. The latter happens every few hundred in-game hours, and at first just makes the outside world inaccessible for a while (it’s a good chance to get busywork done, or you can just sleep past it). But only at first, because of course this too is an opportunity for progression as you start to seek out a means to survive the purple mists.</p> <p>That’s the core of why&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> is so great, and so successful: it just keeps expanding its scope as you increase your ability to survive, and this loop is so wonderfully compulsive. Of course, this also means that the risk inherent in your run grows so much more, as you head off in your best suit of armor and carrying your finest guns, only to get walloped a few feet from a previously undiscovered extraction point. Then you have to decide, do I risk the exact same super-dangerous run again to recover it all, but this time—you know—without all the equipment you’re trying to rescue? Or do you give it up as heartbreakingly lost, shake it off, and rebuild? (The latter, by the way, is generally the smarter option. I always pick the former.)</p> <figure id="attachment_2000638626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638626"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638626">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So for as silly as it looks, and as daftly as it’s named, this isn’t a goof. This is a fantastic and superbly crafted game that continuously draws you further in like falling down a spiral. There’s a really good reason it’s already sold a million copies in its first week since launch. Extraordinarily, for a single-player game, it’s currently the fifth-most played game on Steam, ahead of even&nbsp;<em>Rust</em> and&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>, peaking at over a quarter of a million simultaneous players just yesterday. It also has an extraordinary 96-percent positive rating on Steam from nearly 15,000 reviews.</p> <p>And yes, it has me completely hooked. I’m writing this so late in my day because I didn’t want to stop playing and get on with my job. I’m going right back to it now that I’m done. And it’s hard to give a game more credit than that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-impressive-switch-2-port-ubisoft-december-2000638603</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the worst-kept secrets of 2025 has finally been officially announced by Ubisoft.<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, the latest entry in the publisher’s sneaky-stabby series of open-world games, is getting a Switch 2 port later this year.</p> <p>On October 23, <a href="https://youtu.be/OzyD_EFZzgc">Ubisoft officially revealed</a> that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. This version of the game will support full cross progression across all platforms and will also feature touchscreen support for all in-game menus, though you’ll be able to use a controller, too. The recently released expansion for <em>AC Shadows</em>, <em>Claws of Awaji</em>, won’t be available for Switch 2 players until “early next year.”</p>

 <p>Here’s the first trailer for the Switch 2 port of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows,</em> which appears to show a seemingly impressive-looking port of the massive and <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">gorgeous open-world game</a> set in feudal Japan.</p>  <p>“We are delighted to bring <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> to Nintendo players,” said <em>AC Shadows</em> director Charles Benoit in a press release announcing the port. “Whether slipping through the shadows as Naoe or facing foes head-on as Yasuke, players will be able to roam the streets and rooftops of feudal Japan at home or anywhere their journey takes them on Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

 <p>Ubisoft’s incredible-looking and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465">Switch 2 port of<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em> earlier this year</a> showed that the company can bring its high-end blockbusters to Nintendo’s less-powerful hardware while still making sure the games look great. And this first trailer for <em>Shadows</em> running on Switch 2 looks equally impressive, with lots of detail and realistic lighting. Sure, it’s not as sharp as <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> running on a PS5 Pro connected to a 4K TV, but I bet it will look fine on the Switch 2’s smaller screen.</p> <p>Of course, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> arriving on Switch 2 isn’t exactly a surprise. <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-preorder-release-date-2000634141">The game was leaked earlier this month</a> following months of rumors. Still, it’s nice to have it officially announced, and it’s great that more people will have a chance to check out what I think is one of Ubisoft’s best games in a long time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even in a packed year for kart racers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> is playing for keeps. Will it earn a place alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></a>? Director Masahiro Sakurai hopes so. The legendary developer said he doesn’t plan on continuing the series; the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive is a one-and-done. “I’ve thrown everything I have into this game,” he said during its latest livestream preview. He certainly has. Just when you thought you knew everything<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> has to offer, Sakurai announces even more modes, characters, and features, including a roguelike adventure called Road Trip.</p> <p>In a second hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZHYjYHHiBM">Direct-style presentation for <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> that went live on Thursday, the famed<em> Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> director reminded fans why he’s the king of content maximalism. If you thought Nintendo’s latest racing game, out November 20, would be just a racing game with a sandbox mode, you would be sorely mistaken, my pink, puffy friend. Some are already calling it the “<a href="https://x.com/TAHK0/status/1981361888173969671">Kirby game of all Kirby games</a>.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry to break the order of my reporting of the Kirby Air Riders Direct, but I needed to share Sakurai's closing speech because what a guy! He is a masterclass in game development. <a href="https://t.co/ngXoBgcj4X">pic.twitter.com/ngXoBgcj4X</a></p> <p>— Kābī (@KirPinkFury) <a href="https://twitter.com/KirPinkFury/status/1981362564576551304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is far from the full list of newly revealed features players will get to mess around with:</p> <ul> <li>Top-down camera view race mode called Top Ride</li> <li>Roguelike mode with random challenges from other modes and unique story beats called Road Trip</li> <li>Match lobby called Paddock where you can interact and move between different online races</li> <li>Variant of Air Ride called Swap Relay where you change machines every lap</li> <li>Machine that can switch configurations called Transform Star</li> <li>Set of achievements called Checklist that lets you chase unlockables throughout the game</li> <li>Global Win Power shows how many times you’ve won in addition to your online class ranking</li> <li>Custom licenses to show off your personality online</li> <li>Boss battles</li> <li>Expanded roster including the spider Taranza, wily duo Lololo &amp; Lalala, the bug-eyed Marx, and others</li> </ul> <h2><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feels like a direct attack on <em>Mario Kart World</em></h2> <p>Like I said, this is an incomplete and abridged rundown of all of the gameplay elements Sakurai dove into during the latest and likely final preview of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> ahead of release. He also mentioned how players will earn miles by playing that are spent to unlock more parts of the Machine Market to outfit your ride. Plus there are new collectibles called Gummies. They sound a bit like the stickers from <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. “Who knows, maybe you’ll become a Gummillionaire!” Nintendo’s words, not mine.</p>

 <p>But wait, there’s still more! <em>Kibry Air Riders</em> is also getting dedicated amiibo figures. There are three, all launching next year starting on March 5 with Meta Knight &amp; Shadow Star, followed later on by King Dedede &amp; Tank Star and Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star. Like the new amiibo Nintendo’s been rolling out, these are bigger, more complex, and will likely have those bigger $30 price tags to match. Has Nintendo given Sakurai a blank check to do whatever he wants with <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> before he makes the next <em>Smash Bros.</em>? Probably.</p> <p>We’ll see how it all adds up in practice, but on paper at least, the game is certainly shaping up to satiate even the most ravenous fans’ demands in a way the somewhat content-lite <em>Mario Kart World</em> maybe didn’t when it debuted back over the summer. “Just so you know, we’re not planning DLC, everything is here,” Sakurai said of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. Ouch! Switch Online subscribers can try the game for free during Global Test Ride events on Nov. 8-9 and Nov. 15-16.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-50-fire-tv-comes-with-a-soundbar-and-is-160-off-2000637805</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re kicking yourself still for not jumping on any of the deals from a couple weeks ago over at Amazon for Prime Big Deals Day, something wonderful just dropped into your lap. Right now, Amazon has one of its Fire TVs on sale for 31% off. And this isn’t a Fire TV Stick, this is a full 50-inch TV with a Fire TV interface.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4953/"> That discount brings the price down from $520 to just $360, saving you a whole $160</a>. <strong>If that’s not enough to get you excited, it also includes a free Fire TV Soundbar.</strong> Those start around at least $100 and it’s bundled here for no extra charge.</p>
<p>The Amazon smart TV measures across at 50-inches making for a pretty sizable display for a living room, den, or any shared space really. This is the 4-series model from 2024. It supports vivid 4K entertainment withy HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Plus which all work together to make an impressive picture for your enjoyment with clear clarity and bright colors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4953/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As an Amazon smart TV, this comes with an Alexa-enabled remote. The Alexa remote is a complete gamechanger when it comes to browsing for content. Those on-screen keypads can be so cumbersome to type on. Every app lays them out differently, with some being in alphabetical order and others following the popularized QWERTY layout. And all you have in the little directional pad to hop over one letter at a time. That can take forever to type out a long title like “<em>Only Murders in the Building</em>.” Sweat not, because with the Alexa remote, you can just hold the button and speak the title aloud, then be brought right to it.</p>



<h2>Fire TV Soundbar Included</h2>
<p>TV speakers have gotten better and better over the years, but they’re still no comparison to a dedicated surround sound system or sound bar. What a treat it is that this TV comes with its own soundbar free of charge. This can be set right in front of your TV on top of your media center so you can enjoy rich, three-dimensional virtual surround sound. It supports DTS Virtual:X and even more detail with Dolby Audio. It’s easy to set up too. Just plug it into the TV with the included HDMI cable to the HDMI eARC/ARC on the TV. Presto, now the soundbar will work just like that.</p>
<p>The TV has three additional HDMI ports along with that HDMI eARC/ARC port so you can connect to a cable box or multiple gaming consoles if you wish.</p>
