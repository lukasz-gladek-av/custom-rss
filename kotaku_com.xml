              <p><em>Marathon</em>‘s pre-launch server slam went live earlier today. Over 100,000 players immediately flocked to give Bungie’s new extraction shooter a try for free on PC and console. Naturally, they immediately tried to type<em> “</em>Arc Raiders,” the name of the game’s biggest genre rival, into chat. You’ll never guess what happened next.</p> <p>Yes, <em>Marathon</em> censored the game name. Typing <em>Arc Raiders</em> into your squad’s group chat returned “*** *******” instead. One Twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lirik/clip/FriendlyEnchantingOpossumRalpherZ-HA7GJI8yzhJd3Uw9">streamer’s clip</a> showing the censorship has already started making the rounds online.</p>  <p><em>Kotaku</em>‘s Zack Zwiezen is currently playing the <em>Marathon</em> beta as well and tested the game’s no–”Arc Raiders” filter a bit further. You can type “arc.” You can type “raiders.” You can type “arcraiders.” You can even type “arc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;raiders.” But you can cannot type “Arc Raiders.” Weird!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000674100" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674100"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674100">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Even weirder, this isn’t the first time “Arc Raiders” has been censored in an online multiplayer shooter. <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-arc-raiders-beta-chat-censor-2000632129">The same thing</a> happened with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> last fall, even though the rogue text filter issue was later patched out. EA was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">reportedly censoring</a> 2025’s hit extraction shooter as well.</p> <p>In <em>Marathon</em>‘s case, the genre rivalry is a bit more straightforward. The game’s success will depend in part on people taking a break from <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ new season to loot robots on Tau Ceti IV instead. <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheating-bans-marathon-exploits-2000673239">Shots were already fired</a> over competing approaches to banning cheaters. So far at least, <em>Marathon</em>‘s free weekend appears to be off to a decent start.</p>

 <p><strong>Update 2/26/2026 4:02 p.m. ET:</strong> The weird bug appears to have been patched out. <em>Arc Raiders</em> love is officially welcome on Tau Ceti again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/mTGwEwSi2h">pic.twitter.com/mTGwEwSi2h</a></p> <p>— Marathon Development Team (@MarathonDevTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2027121247696699432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-marriage-candidates-new-update-1-7-qi-2000674093</link>
            <guid>1447720</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Over the past 10 years, </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> has risen from indie darling to the most popular farming sim ever made. It’s also apparently been a huge labor of love for its creator, Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone, who keeps returning to release new major updates after claiming he’s done. Now, on the game’s 10th anniversary, Barone is looking both to the future and the past with two big reveals: additions to its romanceable cast, and some pretty neat looks back at its development history.</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, in a video commemorating </span><i><span>Stardew’s </span></i><span>10th anniversary, Barone revealed two marriage candidates heading to the game’s 1.7 update: Clint and Sandy. Clint is the town’s blacksmith, and he’s almost universally despised (and occasionally even panned as an incel). On the other hand, Sandy, who lives in the game’s desert area and runs the store there, is pretty cool and mysterious!</span></p>

  <p><span>Barone </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425"><span>revealed that the game would receive new marriage candidates earlier this month</span></a><span>. Players, of course, spent the whole month speculating who they could be—if they’d be new characters entirely, if the Wizard would finally become romanceable, or if there would be a divorce in town that rendered a married couple eligible. Quite a few people hoped it would be Sandy (although her addition seemed unlikely because she lives so far away), while mostly nobody wanted Clint.</span></p> <p><span>The video is also packed with some pretty charming peeks back at the game’s development timeline, especially from the game’s 2012 iteration called </span><i><span>Sprout Valley</span></i><span>. As far as I’m aware, this is the first time he’s shown off so much of that version. The layout of </span><i><span>Sprout Valley’s</span></i><span> world resembles that of the one we know today pretty closely, but the art is vastly different and (sorry) a lot less cohesive. Barone himself didn’t have too many kind words to say about the game’s earlier version either, calling the pixel art “crap” and speculating on what his life would have been like if he hadn’t put more time into development.</span></p>

 <p><span>“If I had just released this game after 6 months,” he said, “where would I be right now?”</span></p> <p><span>However, the footage he showed off later revealed that the game pretty quickly turned into the </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>we all know and love, with the build he showed off from just one year later looking almost identical to the game as it exists today. That’s just a really, really impressive turnaround for a developer to make. “</span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> hit puberty here,” he joked.</span></p>

 <p><span>Footage of the older builds also revealed a few massive features that were completely scrapped. He let on that the mines were initially procedurally generated and inspired by </span><i><span>Terraria</span></i><span>, and there was also an entire underground goblin village that was axed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It was really neat to get a peek at this older gameplay, especially the axed features, the latter of which I’m sure will spawn plenty of theories about the game’s lore. I’m less happy about the marriage candidates, though. As someone who’s married to Emily in the game, I’m absolutely </span><i><span>repulsed </span></i><span>by Clint, who still flirts with Emily constantly despite my farmer literally having two children with her. Maybe it’s good that he can finally find a partner who’s not my freaking wife, I guess? Sandy, on the other hand, is fun! I can definitely see her newfound status as a marriage candidate sparking new challenge runs since players don’t meet her until much later in the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Out of everything today, though, I’m most shocked by Barone’s pronunciation of Qi, the last name of an endgame character who provides the game’s most challenging quests. His last name is apparently pronounced “qwee,” which is possibly the worst thing I’ve learned all week. Thanks, Barone.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Demon Tides Has The Speed And Splendor Of An Old PlayStation Platforming Classic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/demon-tides-steam-review-impressions-platformer-3d-2000674085</link>
            <guid>1447678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m pretty spoiled when it comes to platformers. I grew up on a healthy diet of </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span>, and pretty much every other mascot run-and-jump game you can name, so I’m real particular about whether a platformer’s movement feels good enough to hold my attention. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>, Fabraz’s sequel to 2021’s </span><i><span>Demon Turf</span></i><span>, feels like a mash-up of so many good platformers that, thanks to all those years I spent running and jumping, make it fit like a glove. The game’s impeccable movement design seems to draw on the best of what multiple games have done, fusing them all at once to make something that feels weighty, yet still fast and fluid enough that movement feels like a joy, not just a means to an end.</span></p> <p><span>I’m only a couple of hours into </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>on Steam (it showed up around the same time as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-leon-grace-capcom-ps5-pc-2000673329"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span>, I’m sorry!), but the early segments do a great job of introducing you to all the tools the game gives you to get around. Our spunky hero Beebz can transform into different animals at will, allowing her to seamlessly and effortlessly change how she moves through the environment. She can fly, float, grind, swim, and climb, among other things, and the transition between each of these modes of movement is quick, intuitive, and keeps the momentum going as long as your finger’s on the analog stick.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Over the past decade and a half or so, as some games have started to prioritize map size over many other things, traversal has become a common point of friction for me. If moving through a world isn’t quick and painless, I grow to resent giant worlds for wasting my time, thinking about how I would have once been able to accomplish much more in a smaller area rather than having to spend several minutes walking to the good stuff because someone decided that time spent getting somewhere is the pinnacle of game design. If I’m just walking along or riding a horse to get somewhere, my attention drifts pretty quickly, so if you’re going to have a big world, it had better be engaging to move through, and I’d better get where I need to go fast. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>’ open ocean would be daunting and annoying in most games, but transforming into Beebz’s snake form and slithering at incredible speeds makes getting to my next mission and obstacle course a breeze.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically enough, platformers are probably one of the genres best-suited for open-world game design because movement and flow is paramount to these games, even though we typically associate open worlds with grand RPGs or a </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> metropolis. The promise of a large space is only delivered upon if it’s actually fun to explore, and </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>‘ collage of platforming staples accomplish that by hitting the sweet spot, making sure that your character feels like they have some weight and substance as you push the stick to move but never holding you down. </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>manages to capture the vibe of something retro while giving the modern explorer a big map to sink their teeth into.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though I’m still early and have many hours to go, </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>scratches an itch I used to satisfy several times a year, but don’t get to as often nowadays. Though 3D platformers aren’t as en vogue as they once were, I still yearn for hopping and skipping through an obstacle course every now and then. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span> has all the makings of a game that would have become an early PlayStation classic, and I’m eager to see how much gas it has in the tank as I play on.</span></p>
