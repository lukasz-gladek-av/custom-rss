              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-1-reloaded-remaster-ps5-xbox-pc-summer-1851779167"><em>Gears of War</em> is making the leap to PlayStation 5 later this month</a> in what is one of the biggest signs that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars are over</a>. And while I find the idea of playing <em>Gears</em> on a PlayStation controller strange, franchise creator Cliff “CliffyB” Bleszinski is “thrilled” that something he worked so hard on will soon be available to more players.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-creator-cliff-bleszinski-thrilled-about-seeing-his-once-xbox-exclusive-on-playstation">In a new interview with <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Bleszinski was asked about the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-save-progression-ps5-xbox-2000618072"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>, which is a remaster of the original game’s <em>last</em> remaster. This new version with enhanced visuals and improved performance is launching on both Xbox and, for the first time in franchise history, PlayStation via a PS5 port. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-ps5-remake-remaster-halo-forza-port-1851779186">But while some fans find it all a bit bizarre</a> to chainsaw monsters with the DualSense’s circle button instead of the Xbox gamepad’s B, the original <em>Gears</em> trilogy’s director doesn’t feel the same.</p> <p>“It doesn’t feel strange,” Bleszinski explained to <em>Eurogamer</em> when asked if he finds the PS5 port weird. “I’m thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on.”</p>

And since then, even after Microsoft bought the franchise in 2014 and started making its own third-person cover shooters, fans have continued to ask Bleszinski if he’d ever return to help make another<em> Gears of War</em> game. According to him, he’s asked “nearly every day on social media” about returning.</p> <p>“And I’m like ‘uh, I’ve said it a thousand times, I’m open to consult on any of it’,” said Bleszinski. But it seems Xbox isn’t interested in bringing him back to consult on a future game in the series, with the <em>Gears</em> creator adding, “Crickets. On to the next!” There is some irony in Xbox ignoring Cliff Bleszinski in 2025, despite <a href="https://youtu.be/AXO1mpgc-is">making “CliffyB” the rockstar face of the Xbox 360 </a>at the height of the console war between Microsoft’s device and the PS3 back in 2005, and positioning Epic’s then-upcoming game, <em>Gears of War,</em> as the 360’s killer app. Now they won’t even call him to get his input on the franchise.</p> <p><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on August 26. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gears-of-war-reloaded-game-pass-2000618432">It will be available on day one with Game Pass</a> and will be free to anyone who already owns <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, aka Xbox’s previous remaster of the game.</p>

              <p><em>Game of Thrones</em> author George R.R. Martin recently appeared on a panel at Seattle WorldCon 2025 entitled The Shifting Landscape of Epic Fantasy, alongside Brandon Sanderson, Robin Hobb, Rebecca Roanhorse and Ryan Cahill. However, during the question-and-answer portion at the end of the session, one member of the audience got up in front of the all-star panel to complain that George R.R. Martin was taking far too long to write the penultimate book in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series, <em>The Winds of Winter</em>, and given that he likely doesn’t have that long left to live, shouldn’t he let someone else write it?</p> <p>The outstandingly rude question was met with an astonished murmur in the hall, while the guests on stage looked incredibly uncomfortable and attempted to move the topic on. However, the audience member seemed not to be able to pick up on the mood they’d created, and just continued digging their hole with a series of staccato additional words. You can see the squirm-inducing moment here (thanks&nbsp;<em>ScreenRant</em>):</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GEORGE RR MARTIN WORLDCON PANEL 2025 FULL " width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCiQWbjPtYI?start=7762&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Which somehow means someone choosing to film a two-hour panel in portrait wasn’t close to the most offensive thing that happened.</p>

 <p>The bizarre, rambling question, which begins with the audience member talking somewhat incoherently about Martin Scorsese directing her in a movie, then takes a dramatic left-turn as she declares, “George, you’re not going to be around for much longer.”</p> <p>Martin, who is 76 and clearly still reasonably healthy, didn’t appear to react to the premonition of his death (although the person filming infuriatingly avoided filming him at any point). “This is a tough question,” the person at the mic continues while the audience begins audibly booing and vocally disagreeing, attempting to rescue herself by adding, “this is more directed at Brandon…” The reason being that Brandon Sanderson, a spritely 49, took over writing Robert Jordan’s unfinished <em>The Wheel of Time</em> epic fantasy series after the author died, aged only 58. The questioner wondered if the same could be arranged for <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. “How would you feel about someone else taking over and finishing the books?” she said, seemingly now addressing Martin again, despite various members of the panel loudly saying, “No, no,” and getting up from their seats.</p> <p>“Not me,” you can hear Sanderson say, while Martin gets up from his seat. Even then, the person at the mic keeps going, responding to inaudible comments from the panel, in a room that surely could no longer contain any air at all.</p>

 <p>Obviously a lot of&nbsp;<em>GoT</em> fans are frustrated by <em>The Winds of Winter</em>‘s prolonged absence, given the book was due out 14 years ago. Given the series is <em>two</em> books away from being finished, and given Martin’s current output, it’s reasonable to wonder if any human would live long enough to get it finished at the current rate. Assuming another 14 years, Martin would be 90. However, there are obviously more human and decent ways to approach the subject.</p> <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/george-r-r-martin-howard-waldrop-ugly-chickens-game-of-thrones-1236078329/">Martin said of the delay last year</a>, “How could I be 13 years late? I don’t know, it happens a day at a time.” He then added, “A lot of people are already writing obituaries for me. ‘Oh, he’ll never be finished.’ Maybe they’re right. I don’t know. I’m alive right now! I seem pretty vital!”</p> <p>And who knows! Maybe he’ll surprise everyone and release his version of the story’s conclusion all of a sudden (the <em>Game of Thrones </em>TV series had to write its own ending, given it unexpectedly ran out of source material). In the meantime, maybe don’t yell at the old dude on stage that you reckon he’ll die soon.</p>
