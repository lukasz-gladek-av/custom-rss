But the Twitch star is part of a far bigger industry that spans various countries, cultures, and languages. According to a May 2025 report from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streams Charts and VSTATS</a></span>, the international VTubing landscape continues to grow quarter-over-quarter. While Japanese VTubers dominate the industry’s upper echelons, English-language VTubing is a core niche in the contemporary market. Meaning, if you’re interested in VTubing, now is the perfect time to start streaming.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Just don’t end up sticker shocked. Ordering your very own custom-made Live2D VTuber, or a 2D VTuber rigged to match a performer’s movements and facial expressions, can cost thousands of dollars. Many 3D VTuber commissions start around $1,000, with some high-end models reaching similar prices as their 2D counterparts. Make no mistake: The artists, riggers, modelers, and animators who make VTubing shine deserve every penny for their hard work. They are the backbone of this industry. But for newcomers interested in VTubing, it’s ill-advised to drop a couple grand on your first model. Cutting your teeth on something relatively inexpensive is best.</p><p>Luckily, VTubing is more accessible now than ever before. Plenty of pre-made models exist at an affordable price, allowing newcomers to express themselves creatively without breaking the bank. Programs like VRoid Studio even offer free model creation. And when in doubt, you can always throw a few images together and get started as a PNGTuber. Read on to learn the best ways to become a VTuber today. Literally, today.</p><h2 id="h704822"><a id=""></a>Become a 3D anime girl in an hour</h2><figure id="" data-id="5f2753a218e7148e8f08b3d6e9002817" data-recommend-id="image://5f2753a218e7148e8f08b3d6e9002817" data-format="png" data-width="1763" data-height="1203" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="VRoid Studio offers many customization options for VTubers" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="VRoid Studio offers many customization options for VTubers" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pixiv</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f2753a218e7148e8f08b3d6e9002817" data-recommend-id="image://5f2753a218e7148e8f08b3d6e9002817" data-format="png" data-width="1763" data-height="1203" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="VRoid Studio offers many customization options for VTubers" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/new-to-vtubing-dont-discount-vroid-studio-its-hiding-its-power-level/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/new-to-vtubing-dont-discount-vroid-studio-its-hiding-its-power-level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long sung VRoid Studio’s praises</a></span>.

You’ll want an avatar base</h2><p>While 3D VTubing is popular in its own right, many new VTubers are drawn to the field because they want to stream as a 2D anime character. However, commissioning a bespoke Live2D model can be expensive. Luckily, there’s a relatively affordable way to get started as a 2D VTuber. You can purchase an avatar base and then customize it to your liking.</p><p>Avatar bases are special models created with a wide assortment of modifiable hair, face, eye, and clothing options. Using the popular Live2D VTubing app <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VTube Studio</a></span>, users can import an avatar base and customize its various physical features via the model’s expressions.

It’s that simple.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ko-fi.com/s/3c6b9c0edf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ko-fi.com/s/3c6b9c0edf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suiika Customizable VTuber Model</a></span> is the most popular feminine Live2D avatar base, retailing for €115 (or approximately $135 USD).

Yes, this is literally a form of VTubing where you create content with image files. It’s incredibly simple to get started: Just draw a few images, hook them together with a PNGTuber program, and you’re done. I highly recommend this format for illustrators and digital artists unfamiliar with rigging or 3D modeling. Creating your own PNGTuber doubles as an advertisement for your artistic skills.</p><p>Using luna olmewe’s free program <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veadotube mini</a></span>, you can create your very own PNGTuber with ease. Simply fire up the software, go to the right-hand side, and select different image files that depict your VTuber with their mouth opened, closed, or while blinking in either state. You can then customize how your character moves when standing still or speaking. Make sure the correct microphone is selected, and you’re done! When you speak, your new PNGTuber will open their mouth. You’re officially ready to plug your new VTuber into your broadcasting program of choice.</p><p>Anywhere from two to four images will suffice for your PNGTuber. And for those who aren’t artistically inclined, have no fear. Many artists offer PNGTuber commissions starting at approximately $50 – a perfect option if you’re looking for a more boutique experience without breaking the bank.

That’s how I initially felt about <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>. The high-fidelity trailers looked like an indistinct mashup of <em>Stellar Blade</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.

As everyone’s pointing out, <em>Wuchang</em> isn’t <em>just </em>more derivative Soulslike slop. It’s actually pretty fun and surprisingly deep. I’ve only played about five hours of <em>Wuchang </em>so far. I’m nowhere near ready to render a more definitive verdict on the totality of the game, but it has successfully laid to rest my initial fears and skepticism about it being a purely flashy yet hollow imitation of better games. I mean, it sort of is that in some ways, but there are some cool new twists to play with as well.</p><p>A familiar pace of combat—dodge, dodge, wait for an opening, attack—adds a resource called Skyborn Might that you build up by completing perfect dodges and parries (block to deflect or attack to clash and reflect the damage back). Skyborn Might is in turn used to unleash spells and more powerful attacks, which encourages you to constantly change up the flow of fights to optimize damage output. And instead of pouring points into stats every time you level up, there’s a <em>Final Fantasy X</em>-like Sphere Grid called the Impetus Repository, in which you level up individual nodes that each grant unique benefits. Add in a variety of weapons and armor to swap between, and you get a pretty fun combat loop that makes crafting a build feel less rote than in some other Soulslikes. </p><p>I’ve been playing on PS5, where performance has been fine (it’s also out on Game Pass today), but that’s apparently not the case for many people on PC at the moment. <em>Wuchang </em>is officially out today, and the Steam page is already full of negative reviews slamming the game for a lack of optimization. “Stutterchang: Fallen Frames,” wrote one user. “Stuttering, ghosting, blur visual, frame drop...well really bad performance with RTX 5070,” wrote another. That hasn’t stopped the game from hitting over 130,000 concurrent on Steam. </p><figure id="" data-id="765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-recommend-id="image://765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-format="png" data-width="1511" data-height="862" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Steam / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-recommend-id="image://765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-format="png" data-width="1511" data-height="862" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While some players say they’ve managed just fine on 3000 series cards, only 21 percent of the roughly 8,000 reviews so far are positive. There’s no demo either yet, so you can’t try the game out to see if it runs okay before buying the full thing, though Steam does allow refunds with less than two hours of playtime. “We are confident in the game’s performance within our recommended spec but we’re working on optimization,” the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560?emclan=103582791474575079&amp;emgid=498327923676151994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560?emclan=103582791474575079&amp;emgid=498327923676151994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Steam today</a></span>. “We are looking to issue a patch as soon as we can.”</p><p>For those not on PC, <em>Wuchang</em> is definitely worth a second or third look, especially for Souls fans and anyone else not already completely burnt out on “another one of those.” I do hear it has some pretty absurd difficulty spikes later on, but in the beginning its pretty forgiving. At the very least, don’t write-off <em>Wuchang</em> only because it looks like gooner <em>Souls </em>bait. And unlike <em>Stellar Blade</em>, it actually has plenty of outfits that look cool and aren’t completely absurd. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856]]></content:encoded>
