Instead of a new 3D <em>Mario </em>or <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>deep-dive, the Nintendo Direct will focus on third-party games. </p><p>We’ll presumably get release dates for the upcoming ports of<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>and <em>Elden Ring</em>, but hopefully news about new ones as well.

Are we finally getting <em>Sea of Thieves </em>or <em>Diablo IV</em> on Switch 2?</p><p>Some personal predictions for the event include finally getting a release date for <em>Hades 2</em> (a timed-console exclusive for both Switch 1 and 2) and a mention of Call of Duty’s future on Nintendo’s platform, which Microsoft promised to support with the multiplayer military shooter following for the first time in years. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, one of this year’s best selling coop games and a cross-gen one to boot, also feels like an obvious pickup. </p><p>The mention of the OG Switch suggests players who haven’t upgraded will have some fresh games to look forward to this fall as well. With over 150 million units sold, it wouldn’t be surprising if Nintendo continues to support the older platform for a little while longer. </p><p>At 25 minutes, this won’t be the big Nintendo Direct fans are really waiting for. That’s more likely to come in September. But it should help fill in some of the question marks still outstanding in the Switch 2's first year. And with more powerful specs in tow, this fall could be one of the biggest for a Nintendo console in quite some time.</p><p> If <em>Borderlands 4 </em>can sneak its way onto the handheld hybrid, even at 30fps, who knows what other current-gen games can make the leap. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-elden-ring-ff7-time-date-1851787326]]></content:encoded>

Given the two games are likely to be launching reasonably close together, and will be frantically competing for the same audience, it’d be madness to deliberately out-price the rival. However, Wilson said on the call that $80 prices hadn’t been factored into any of EA’s projected earnings through March 2026. Now, that could be because the company wanted to low-ball and report unexpected profits, or it could always have been planning to release <em>BF6</em> at the previous upper price.</p><p>Of course, when pre-orders are announced there will inevitably be ways to spend <em>vastly</em> more than $70 on <em>Battlefield 6</em>, with ludicrous bundles offering imaginary doodads and different dress-up options for your soldiers for possibly hundreds of dollars. Seventy will get you the very basic version of the game, without a season pass, DLC, etc, and it’ll make sure to let you know what a pedestrian person you are as you choose it. Fortunately, there’s the far smarter option of never pre-ordering anything, because <em>it’s a scam</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292]]></content:encoded>
