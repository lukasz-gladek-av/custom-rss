However, you must first repair the vessel, which requires a shipwright, which is a time-honored career that’s fallen out of grace in modern-day Hawaii. However, <strong>if you follow along with the main story, you’ll meet Clark, a buff old man who claims he can repair any ship on the sea</strong>.</p><p>But the Goromaru is a big ship, and Clark is old. He can’t handle the job solo, which means hiring Julie. You’ll have to acquire $10,000 to pay for the parts and labor to upgrade your ship. But hey, if you played <em>Infinite Wealth</em>, then you probably know how to make money fast in <em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, don’t you? Well, if not, then let’s get to it.</p><h3 id="h3061280"><a id=""></a>Expand your Aloha Links network</h3><figure id="" data-id="54bd2da86e817a87f01e53332138db3e" data-recommend-id="image://54bd2da86e817a87f01e53332138db3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main menu of the Aloha Links social media app in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The main menu of the Aloha Links social media app in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54bd2da86e817a87f01e53332138db3e" data-recommend-id="image://54bd2da86e817a87f01e53332138db3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main menu of the Aloha Links social media app in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shortly after learning how to fix your ship, you’ll set out in search of a crew.

These Substories, or the game’s version of side quests, offer branching, short-lived side stories that expand the universe, provide you a fun little excursion, and earn you some cash and, on occasion, helpful items.</p><p>There are just over 30 Substories in the game, and you’ll find the majority right here in Honolulu. They’re also an excellent way to give yourself a little break from the sprawling main story!</p><h3 id="h3061282"><a id=""></a>Hunt bounties</h3><figure id="" data-id="ab51ce4157ea115b9bec22f9410bdb88" data-recommend-id="image://ab51ce4157ea115b9bec22f9410bdb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ‘Target Apprehended’ screen for a Police Bounty in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A ‘Target Apprehended’ screen for a Police Bounty in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab51ce4157ea115b9bec22f9410bdb88" data-recommend-id="image://ab51ce4157ea115b9bec22f9410bdb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ‘Target Apprehended’ screen for a Police Bounty in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most lucrative ways to earn cash in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is by tracking and beating bounties. Once you reach Honolulu, you’ll gain access to the Police Bounties—a long and growing list of ne’er-do-wells. You’ll find them on your mini-map, marked with a handcuffs icon. </p><p>A few of these bounties fly solo, though they still pose a threat. But it’s when you stumble upon a large group of enemies, like the Anti-Social Smokers, that really test your capabilities. It’s worth it for that cold, hard cash, though!</p><hr><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those games were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D and level based</a></span>. <em>Zombieville USA 3D </em>is, as the name implies, in 3D and is much bigger, featuring randomly generated cartoon towns overrun with deadly zombies. You start with a single pistol and survive as long as you can while racking up cash. When you die, you return to a hub, have the chance to spend your money to buy permeant upgrades, and then return to the fray. </p><p>It’s a simple formula found in plenty of other roguelike games, and <em>Zombieville USA 3D</em> doesn’t really shake any of this up in a major way. Instead, the small team behind it have focused entirely on making a really, really good version of this kind of game with slick visuals and satisfying action. A big reason the combat feels so good is because of excellent feedback via energetic animations. Everything you do, from walking and running to shooting and hacking or smashing enemies to bits looks great thanks to a slick art style and snappy animations that have a nice bounce to them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the game’s lead developer on Reddit</a></span>, who has mostly worked as a VFX artist and animator, the idea is that these “juicy” and “extra” visuals will help <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> stand out among all the other games on Steam. And, in my case at least, it worked. When I was scrolling through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776">Steam’s Spring Sale</a></span>, I randomly spotted this game in the “Under $10” section and its art and animation immediately made me click to see more. A few hours later I had played a ton of <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> on both my PC and my Steam Deck.</p><p>On Steam Deck I recommend knocking the visual settings down to medium and locking the FPS to 60 to get more battery life and a very stable experience. Once I did that,<em> Zombieville 3D USA </em>played perfectly on Valve’s portable PC. On my desktop PC, though,&nbsp;<em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> looks even better with raytracing and high-resolution options.</p><p>Regardless of how you play it, <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is a fantastic little indie zombie shooter that even supports online co-op. It demonstrates that a successful game doesn’t have to be massive or completely reinvent the wheel. Sometimes, all you have to do is perfectly nail a simple gameplay loop and make sure your game looks cool as heck and you’ll end up with something special that catches people’s eyes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is currently available on Steam for $8</a></span>.

He’s the leader of the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE which is trying to save the world from the Shinra megacorporation that is destroying the planet. He’s also a no-nonsense activist known to give a rousing speech or two when the going gets tough. Unlike Sephiroth, he gets right to the heart of what he’s trying to say, doesn’t bloviate about why bad things are actually good, and speaks to real issues with the kinda gusto you need to change the world. If somebody speaks with clarity in favor of the common good, you can probably put it as a caption under Barret’s face and I would believe it to be a genuine screenshot from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="427b5f6e3181cb9dadd4e13a2ef62e45" data-recommend-id="image://427b5f6e3181cb9dadd4e13a2ef62e45" data-format="png" data-width="737" data-height="738" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky post that shows Barret with a speech bubble above a separate post that reads &quot;“I can’t believe they are damaging Elon musks private property”  Why can’t you believe this.

Sephiroth posters, meanwhile, will come looking for you. They just spent 30 minutes coming up with a 300-character diatribe, and they’ll be damned if someone isn’t going to at least be subjected to it long enough for them to hit the block button. But Barret posters, I see you, I hear you, and I know you’re fighting the good fight against these insufferable fucks.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Took us a lot of time to finish it.

I will keep my promise and invite you both to Sweden for an early look of our next game. We´ll be in touch!” </p><p>I doubt they’ll be able to say anything about what they see, but hopefully the duo have a good time checking out Hazelight’s next project. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That message was notably not written by any of the staff members and was the only thing you could see on the website for the past seven months after GameStop wiped the publication’s online archive. But in the teaser, the screen glitches out, and the text “{CONSOLE.WRITELINE (CONTINUE?);” appears on the bottom right corner. It ends with a date, March 25, 2025, teasing some kind of announcement next week.</p><p>After the teaser went live, several members of <em>Game Informer</em>’s staff at the time of the shutdown have posted similar teasers on their personal social media accounts, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-content director Brian Shea</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former editor-in-chief Matt Miller</a></span>.
