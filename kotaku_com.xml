              <p>Let’s be honest, how many play a real-time strategy game for its campaign? Me. I do. It’s like a practice mode before you head into a pub stomp or, in my case, face off against the AI because I’m getting old and I can’t click nearly as fast as my <i>StarCraft 2</i> days. Thankfully, <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a bit more tactical, and it’s less about the clicks-per-second and more about overarching strategy. You’ll have plenty of time to practice said strategy, with an extensive campaign and multiple game modes on the side!</p> <h2>How long does it take to finish <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s singleplayer campaign?</h2> <p>If you’re committed to tackling the main campaign in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, which for most players will serve as an introduction to the game’s units and mechanics, like a tutorial for multiplayer and AI opponents, then expect to spend approximately 20 to 25 hours across its 19 main missions:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Showtime</li> <li aria-level="1">Peacekeeper</li> <li aria-level="1">Airbase Heist</li> <li aria-level="1">The Big Wave</li> <li aria-level="1">Tracked and Furious</li> <li aria-level="1">Blackout</li> <li aria-level="1">Papers Please</li> <li aria-level="1">We Own the Night</li> <li aria-level="1">Self Service</li> <li aria-level="1">Operation Cold Harbour</li> <li aria-level="1">Vampires!</li> <li aria-level="1">Heavy Rain</li> <li aria-level="1">Search &amp; Rescue</li> <li aria-level="1">Forbidden Waters</li> <li aria-level="1">Hunting Season</li> <li aria-level="1">With a Little Help From My Friends</li> <li aria-level="1">The Ride of the VDV</li> <li aria-level="1">Road to The Fiddler’s Green</li> <li aria-level="1">Broken Arrow</li> </ul> <h2>What to do after finishing <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s campaign</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616869" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616869"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616869">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>On top of the lengthy campaign, which we’ll consider the game’s warm up, you’ll have access to a skirmish mode against AI, a full multiplayer mode against human opponents, a scenario editor that you may craft and share…scenarios, and a lot of us will likely spend hours upon hours perfecting our units in the army customization suite.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Skirmish Mode</b>: The game’s skirmish mode pits you against AI opponents on 19 maps, with varying difficulty levels for high replayability.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Multiplayer</b>: If you’re feeling antsy and want to test your abilities online against real-life players, multiplayer matches featuring 5×5 gameplay allow your competitive side to shine through as you vie for dominance of the leaderboards.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Scenario Editor</b>: The scenario editor in <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a comprehensive toolset, identical to the mission editor used by the development team, allowing you to craft custom scenarios complete with visual scripting, cutscenes, and dialogue.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Army Customization</b>: There are currently more than 300 units in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, and over 1,500 combinations, allowing you to tailor your entire army to suit your playstyle and needs. From reconnaissance units to fighting vehicles, helicopters, and missile-laden jets, the battlefield is yours to dominate with the tools of modern warfare.</li> </ul> <hr> <p><i>Broken Arrow</i> is available now on Windows PCs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><span>got a remastered trilogy collection in 2021</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans have been hoping and praying BioWare’s fantasy RPGs might get the same treatment. If there were ever a time to put one out, it would have been before </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>launched in 2024 and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>seemingly wrapped up</span></a><span> most of the universe’s ongoing story threads. According to ex-BioWare boss Mark Darrah, the studio was more than up for remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age: Origins</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span> in one collection and told Electronic Arts as much, but the publisher turned down the pitch.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0"><span>YouTuber MrMattyPlays sat down with Darrah</span></a><span>, who worked as executive producer on the </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> series and the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>troubled loot shooter </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i></a><span>. During the conversation, Darrah reveals that BioWare “soft-pitched” a remaster of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> games but EA turned it down, partially due to its noted dislike of remasters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“EA’s historically been—and I don’t really know why, but they’ve even said this publicly—they’re kind of against remasters,” he said. “I don’t really know why. It’s strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. So that’s part of it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, one of the bigger issues in remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> compared to </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> was that the resources to zhuzh up those games is that they’re on different engines The first two </span><i><span>DA </span></i><span>games were made on BioWare’s internal Eclipse Engine before the team transitioned to Frostbite for </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span>, whereas the first three sci-fi games are all on Unreal Engine. This meant that the technical lift would have been significantly higher for a </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>remaster than it was for </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</span></i><span>. Darrah says the project would have either required hiring a new team to work full-time learning how to use the games’ old tech, or that existing staff at BioWare would have to handle the entire thing on their own. He also says that an internal remaster within BioWare would have been the ideal scenario, but that didn’t pan out.</span></p> <p><span>The soft-pitch Darrah talks about included a sort of “rebrand” of the original games as a trilogy called </span><i><span>The Champions Trilogy</span></i><span>, referencing the three protagonists of each game. If that had come to pass, I would have written you a novel on my feelings about it, considering I think continuity is one of </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>‘s weakest aspects, and branding those games as a trilogy when it decidedly doesn’t follow through on a lot of its connective tissue would be an odd Hail Mary. But since that isn’t happening, I will bite my tongue.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, Darrah doesn’t know what the future holds for </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. He </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-studio-head-dragon-age-producer-both-leave-stu-1845802859"><span>left the company in 2020</span></a><span>, but returned as a consultant to help get </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>past the finish line. Since leaving the company, Darrah </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>has been pretty candid</span></a><span> about what he and his colleagues felt was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-development-mark-darrah-live-service-2000615972"><span>unfair treatment of the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> by management.</span></p>

              <p>McDonald’s running&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> promotions with its Happy Meals is no new phenomenon. Most years, the two corporations team up to include packs of McDonald’s-marked <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards in the kids’ meals, and it generally proves very popular. But recently, something else has changed: over the last year, <em>Pokémon</em> cards have become outlandishly popular, to the point <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">where they remain near-impossible to buy in stores thanks to scalpers and fanatics</a>. This mess is <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-center-tcg-scalpers-journey-together-1851770342">just as bad in Japan</a> as it is in the U.S., and the ridiculous situation has spread to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-pikachu-mcdonalds-japan-happy-meal-1851786307">a simple Happy Meal tie-in</a>, causing the three-day event to be abandoned early amidst chaotic scenes.</p> <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://nintendosoup.com/pokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos/"><em>Nintendo Soup</em></a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokmon-card-giveaway-ends-early-amid-restaurant-chaos-scalping-and-widespread-food-waste-as-fans-buy-dozens-of-happy-meals-only-to-dump-uneaten-burgers"><em>IGN</em></a>), things have gotten so out of control that police were called to multiple McDonald’s locations, alongside massive numbers of Happy Meals being dumped in the streets uneaten once the cards had been removed. Things got so out-of-hand that <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">McDonald’s Japan issued a statement</a> declaring the whole event over after just a single day.</p> <p>“We would like to inform you,” the statement begins, “that the distribution of Pokémon cards to customers who purchased Happy Meals® ‘Pokémon,’ which was scheduled for three days only from Saturday, August 9th to Monday, August 11th (national holiday), has ended at many stores due to higher-than-expected sales.” The company goes on to apologize to customers for “not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who were looking forward to the product due to the early end of distribution.” It then concludes, “Please refrain from contacting stores regarding stock availability.”</p>

 <p>This weekend’s circumstances seem likely to have been primarily caused by a unique Pikachu card contained in the packs, featuring the little mouse-thing sitting down to a fast food meal. McDonald’s sets usually feature re-used art from previous cards, making them not all that collectible, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131">a bespoke Pikachu generally causes everyone to collectively lose their minds</a>.</p> <p>It seems scalpers were a large part of the problem, with individual McDonald’s stores not helping by failing to stick to a five-meals-per-person rule. <a href="https://twitter.com/hapi_tori/status/1953942557660262413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953942557660262413%7Ctwgr%5E2d086785bef7b9afe7ef8b695a52e59037c66c47%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnintendosoup.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos%2F">Photos of people buying dozens of Happy Meals at once</a> were posted to social media (with what looks like plenty of unpleasantly anti-Chinese sentiment to boot), <a href="https://twitter.com/Daiyamato69/status/1954102074129658324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1954102074129658324%7Ctwgr%5E2d086785bef7b9afe7ef8b695a52e59037c66c47%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnintendosoup.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos%2F">as well as pictures of many meals dumped in store doorways</a>, uneaten. The hideous waste of food seems to have driven the public backlash, even more than the lack of availability.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">拡散して‼️</p> <p>大阪のマクドナルドでハッピーセットのおまけのポケカが貰えないから返品させろと要求している外国人転売ヤー‼️💢</p> <p>中国人だかベトナム人だか知らないが、こんな事で警察の手を煩わせるんじゃねーよ💢</p> <p>悪質外国人は日本から出てけ‼️<br>日本の子供達がポケカ貰えなくて悲しんでるだろ💢 <a href="https://t.co/aqzvEPahYt">pic.twitter.com/aqzvEPahYt</a></p> <p>— ティトン (@bcfe70bord) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcfe70bord/status/1954131843088871429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">渋谷だけでなく、色々な地域でマクドナルドのポイ捨てゴミは多いです。</p> <p>今回のハッピーセット騒動も含め、食品を買ったら責任持って食す。<br>ポイ捨てせずに自分で責任持って処理。</p> <p>これは常識中の常識です。 <a href="https://t.co/aX7B0cn19p">pic.twitter.com/aX7B0cn19p</a></p> <p>— スミレンジャーZ（愛称スミレちゃん、元スラウザーです） (@iijNWqUQ7i41630) <a href="https://twitter.com/iijNWqUQ7i41630/status/1954333122260353435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Of course, this embarrassing display really sucks for the kids who just wanted a cool Pokémon pack with their Happy Meal treat. I’ve been there, taking the boy for a rare McDonald’s meal because of a recent Squishmallows tie-in, only to find the restaurant had put in some tat from a previous Disney promotion after scalpers had scooped the lot. It sucks. People ruin everything.</p> <p>However, this is emblematic of a far larger issue regarding the <em>Pokémon TCG</em><em>&nbsp;</em>of late, where massive price hikes for even modern cards are motivating scalpers to snatch everything up, while The Pokémon Company International–<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">despite repeated promises</a>–entirely fails to appropriately step up supply. Let’s hope this ridiculous bubble bursts soon.</p>
