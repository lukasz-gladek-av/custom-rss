              <p>Apple launched the 11-inch iPad with an A16 chip back in March of this year, and now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon’s dropping the 128GB/Wi-Fi mode to a record low of $279 for Black Friday, down from its $349 retail price</a>. You won’t find this discount on Apple’s official website or in their retail stores because the company keeps tight pricing controls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>iPhone Performance to Tablet Form</h2>
<p>The A16 Bionic chip delivers processing power that rivals many laptops and maintains the instant responsiveness that iPads are known for. The 6-core CPU splits tasks between performance and efficiency cores that balance speed and battery life based on workload demands. The 5-core GPU accelerates graphics rendering, gaming performance, and augmented reality applications. It allows the <strong>16-core Neural Engine to process 17 trillion operations per second</strong>&nbsp;and powers machine learning functions like Live Text, subject isolation in Photos, and real-time translation.</p>
<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display pushes 2360 by 1640 resolution with True Tone technology</strong> that adjusts color temperature based on ambient lighting. The display covers the P3 wide color gamut, reproducing vibrant colors that look accurate for photo editing and creative work. The IPS panel maintains excellent viewing angles, so colors and contrast stay consistent when viewing the screen from the side.</p>



<p>A 128GB storage configuration provides enough space for essential apps and working files without forcing you into constant cloud storage management. Modern apps and high-resolution photos consume storage fast, and 128GB is the minimum viable capacity required to enjoy comfortable use. You can store dozens of apps, thousands of photos, hours of offline video content, and still have room for documents and downloads.</p>
<p>With WiFi 6 connectivity, this <strong>iPad offers faster and wireless speeds and better performance</strong> in crowded network conditions than earlier WiFi standards. The increased efficiency reduces battery drain when using the internet for several hours continuously, while the low latency further enhances video calls and online gaming. WiFi 6 routers are slowly becoming commonplace in many homes and businesses, and this iPad fully leverages the new and improved technology.</p>
<p>The<strong> Touch ID built into the power button</strong> allows for secure authentication without the TrueDepth camera setup of Face ID. The fingerprint sensor instantly unlocks the iPad, authorizes purchases, and allows you to switch between user profiles with the touch of a finger. This method of authentication works in any environment with no light limitation and does not require you to position your face in front of the device. Finally, <strong>with all-day battery life, up to 10 hours of web surfing</strong> or video playback on a single charge covers full work days, long flights, or weekend road trips without needing a charger.</p>
<p>The<strong> iPad runs iPadOS</strong> with access to millions of tablet-optimized apps that take advantage of the larger screen compared to the apps on the iPhone. The operating system supports multitasking with <em>Split View</em> and <em>Slide Over</em> which let you run multiple apps at the same time. Support for the Apple Pencil allows for note-taking, digital art, and document annotation, though the stylus sells separately.</p>
<p>For $279, this iPad is cheaper than a lot of budget Android tablets that deliver far worse performance, worse displays and app ecosystems that pale in comparison.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It only took <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> one month to become the top-grossing game released so far this year in the U.S. But that doesn’t even tell the whole story of how well the multiplayer shooter franchise’s return to form has gone. It’s also the best-selling game in any single month in the last three years, meaning it sold even better than <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> did when it debuted in 2023.</p> <p>“<em>Battlefield 6</em> produced the highest single month US physical &amp; digital full game tracked dollar sales total in 3 years,” Circana director of game research Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m62wm6voxa2s">announced on Bluesky today</a>. “The last title to generate a larger full game tracked dollar sales total in a single month was <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em> in October 2022.”</p>

 <p>EA previously confirmed that <em>Battlefield 6</em> had sold over 7 million copies shortly after launch. Its continuing popularity has been enough not only to make it the best-selling game for October 2025 in the U.S. but also to immediately rocket it up to the top of the best-sellers chart for the entire year so far, past <em>NBA 2K26</em>, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, and <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>.</p>   <p>Those stats certainly add more fuel to the fire of the renewed <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-free-battlefield-6-call-of-duty-rivalry-2000633176"><em>Battlefield</em>/<em>Call of Duty</em> rivalry</a>. While people have been picking over weak concurrent numbers on Steam following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">launch of <em>Black Ops 7</em></a>, the proof will be in the November sales data that arrives next month. Last year’s <em>Black Ops 6</em> was the first <em>Call of Duty </em>game to be free on day one with a Game Pass subscription and it’s still the seventh best-selling game of <em>this</em> year.</p>

 <p>Microsoft recently hiked the price of Game Pass to $30 a month, incentivizing more players to pay outright for this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em> rather than rent it through the subscription service. Still, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-under-attack"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a> that In the UK at least, physical launch sales for <em>Black Ops 7</em> are down 61 percent over last year’s entry. It also notes that this fall is extra competitive in the shooter space with the launch of <em>Arc Raiders</em> and<em> Fortnite</em>‘s big <em>Simpsons</em> season.</p> <p>Other notable data points for the month include PS5-exclusive<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> breaking into the top 10 best-selling games of the year and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> ranking seventh for the month, despite being on Game Pass. <em>Borderlands 4</em> fell off in a big way, dropping to 10th for the month. My personal favorite stat, however, is that <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> is hanging around at number 14. It seems likely to break 1 million sales if it hasn’t already. I still have my fingers crossed that we’ll <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">get that sequel after all</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-ultra-slim-15%E2%80%B3-1080p-portable-monitor-goes-for-pennies-as-amazon-goes-all-in-on-black-friday.1359382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop screens restrict your productivity to a cramped workspace, and portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch merit something way more than their diminutive built-in displays. The <em>Arzopa</em> 15.6-inch <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">portable monitor just hit an all-time low of $74 for Black Friday over at Amazon, down from the usual $104</a>. This ultra-slim display solves your need for extra screen real estate without having to carry around bulky monitors. This <strong>monitor weighs in at just 1.6 pounds and measures 0.35 inches thick</strong> which makes it portable – not just technically movable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Looks Good</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel pushes 1920 by 1080 resolution</strong>&nbsp;which provides crisp text for productivity work and detailed visuals for gaming. IPS technology delivers accurate colors and maintains image quality<strong> across a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you don’t see color shifting or contrast loss when viewing the screen from the side. The display adeptly handles everything from work documents to game graphics. The 1080p resolution nets you enough pixels to comfortably read small text or see fine details in games without everything looking blocky.</p>



<p>This ultra-slim design makes the monitor genuinely travel-friendly: At 1.6 pounds, <strong>you hardly notice it in a backpack beside your laptop</strong> while its 0.35-inch thickness lets it slide into laptop sleeves or backpack pockets designed for tablets. Arzopa built the monitor with metal materials that feel solid without adding any unnecessary weight. The compact form factor fits easily on airplane tray tables, coffee shop counters, or hotel desks where space is at a premium.</p>
<p>An<strong> integrated kickstand negates the need to carry around separate stands</strong> or lean the monitor against a stack of books. The stand adjusts across multiple angles, letting you position the screen for comfortable viewing as you sit at a desk or recline on a couch. It reliably holds position, without slowly creeping closed during use. The integrated approach means you have all you need for setting up without any extra accessories cluttering your bag.</p>



<p>Multiple display modes adapt to different use cases without complicated configuration. Duplicate mode simply mirrors your primary display, ideal for presentations or showing content to others. Extend mode gives you more workspace, expanding your desktop across both screens and effectively doubling your screen real estate. Second screen mode makes the portable monitor a stand-alone display for phones or tablets.</p>
<p>The <strong>USB-C and HDMI connectivity covers</strong> just about every device that you might want to connect. With modern laptops that come with USB-C ports, you can send out video and power over a single cable, meaning no need for a separate power adapter if your laptop provides enough juice. HDMI input handles game consoles, older laptops, and any device with standard HDMI output. Thanks to plug-and-play functionality, you connect the cable and the display works right off without drivers installed or visiting configuration menus.</p>
<p><strong>Wide compatibility across laptops, desktops, Macs, phones, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch</strong> means no adapter hassles or workarounds.</p>
<p>For $74, this portable monitor is less than many people spend on a single dinner out and promises legitimate productivity and entertainment value. You get a full HD IPS display with metal construction, integrated stand and universal connectivity for almost 30% off of the regular price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/act-fast-to-snag-the-jbl-flip-5-for-80-after-this-early-black-friday-deal-dropped-it-by-20-2000645565</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-flip-5-bluetooth-speaker-hits-its-deepest-price-cut-ever-the-moment-amazon-black-friday-begins.1359379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Good music means good vibes. The right speaker can bring any party or gathering to life. If you have been after something that delivers powerful sound that’s rich and deep, yet balanced for all your tracks, without spending big bucks, Amazon is making the upgrade easier than ever.</span></p>
<p>The retailer is now offering its early Black Friday sales across a wide range of categories, including audio gear. We are spotting deep discounts on headphones, earbuds, and even some top-rated Bluetooth speakers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5740/">One of our favorite markdowns from the sale? The JBL Flip 5, which is now going for just $80 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> The offer applies to almost all color options, so there’s plenty to choose from. These include black, red, white, teal, and even the most stunning pink!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5740/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Both Prime and non-Prime members can snag the deal, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase. This is the lowest price this speaker has dropped to in the last 30 days, but we don’t expect the discount to stay around for long. Snap it up before it expires for good.</p>

<h2>Portable Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>This can-sized Bluetooth speaker is easy to carry around with you on the go. It features a durable fabric and rugged rubber housing that prevents it from everyday wear and tear. You won’t have to continuously worry about keeping it safe on your trips. Just toss it in your bag and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Don’t let the size fool you, though. With up to 20 watts of power, it delivers JBL signature sound that’s both rich and balanced. It captures all the highs and lows exceptionally well, making podcasts come through clearly and bringing your favorite tracks to life. The sound is big enough to spread evenly through most places, but you can always pair two JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers for stereo sound or multiple compatible speakers for a much larger experience. This way, you can host your very own private concerts right there in the yard!</p>
<p>The IPX7 rating means you can take your speaker with you on the beach, by the pool, or even in the shower without a worry. In fact, the JBL Flip 5 is waterproof up to three feet deep, so even an accidental drop in water won’t hurt these. You can focus on enjoying the songs instead of babysitting the speaker all the time.</p>



<p>The built-in 4800mAh rechargeable battery lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge. That’s enough to keep the party going all night long. Just plug these in the morning for an hour or so, and enjoy all your favorite tracks the entire night with friends. The speaker works well with a range of devices, and you just need to have a stable Bluetooth connection to get started. All that you need to do is turn the speaker on, enable Bluetooth on your desired device, and choose the speaker from the list of available options. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. There’s also a quick start guide included in the box, which you can refer to if you run into any issues while pairing it.</p>
<p>All things considered, this tiny but mighty Bluetooth speaker not only offers powerful, rich sound but also gets you an impressive battery life. It’s reliable enough to take with you on the go, as can handle everyday wear and tear well. If you’re planning to host some fun gatherings during the holiday season or just want to enjoy your favorite songs in a more immersive way, now is the time to act.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-is-powering-every-next-gen-console-and-its-gpus-are-about-to-get-even-more-expensive.1359319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans of AMD’s GPUs, which are typically more cost-effective than those made by Nvidia, might be in for some sticker shock in the near future. Team Red is likely to start raising the price of its goods. And unfortunately, there’s a chance this will affect more than just your graphics card.</p> <p>As <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-rumored-to-raise-gpu-prices-just-as-radeon-rx-9070-xt-finally-reaches-msrp">reported by <i>VideoCardz</i></a>, AMD has informed its partners of an impending price hike for its GPUs. Last month the company reportedly adjusted prices for its corporate partners to reflect changes in the market, though it managed to save retail customers from the shift. This time around, however, retail prices are likely to get hit. The culprit? Well, if you’ve been paying attention to the price fluctuations of computer components, you may already know: the cost of DRAM components, which provide the memory for computers and other electronics, is going up as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-hikes-memory-chip-prices-by-up-60-shortage-worsens-sources-say-2025-11-14/">the AI industry</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/wM8LDVIiwhA">wolfs down</a> the earth.</p>

 <p>And if you’re familiar with what goes inside consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series machines, or even the upcoming Steam Machine, then you know AMD chips power those too.</p> <p>Retail prices haven’t gone up just yet, but the prospect is frustrating.Sure, PC gaming has always been more expensive than just grabbing the latest Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo box and plugging it in, but it’s continued to get worse. And given the central role AMD plays in all of these devices, PC gamers aren’t the only ones likely to get a haircut.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-zeraora-reaction-industry-plant-2000645789</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/damn-pok%C3%A9mon-fans-really-don%E2%80%99t-like-this-digimon-ass-mega-evolution.1359316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, Game Freak announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-zeraora-trailer-reveal-2000645432"><span>Mega Zeraora</span></a><span> will be one of the new Mega Evolutions coming in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. It’s one of the few “cool” Mega designs in the RPG, which has otherwise leaned pretty heavily into silly and exaggerated designs with monsters like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>Starmie</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-feraligatr-totodile-art-redesign-2000645515"><span>Feraligatr</span></a><span>. I like a silly Mega as much as the next guy, but it’s nice to have some that don’t look like jokes, as well. Mega Zeraora, however, is proving surprisingly divisive among Pokémon fans, and those who already had problems with Zeraora’s original art aren’t holding back.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Zeraora is a mythical Pokémon from Generation VII. It debuted in </span><i><span>Ultra Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ultra Moon</span></i><span> as an event-exclusive monster, which means if you didn’t catch it on the 3DS games back in 2018, it’s been mostly unobtainable since. There was a brief window in 2020 where a shiny version was catchable through a </span><i><span>Pokémon Home </span></i><span>event, but </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is the first time Zeraora has left the vault in five years. That’s usually how mythical Pokémon go, so it’s not that different from Pokémon like Mew or Celebi, who set the precedent for mythicals to only be available for a limited time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For a Pokémon that isn’t in that many games, you’d think fans wouldn’t hold as much hate in their heart as they do for Zeraora, but folks are dogpiling on its Mega for looking mostly like a recolored fighting game skin and having “zero aura.” Get it? Because its name is Zeraora?</span></p>

It definitely feels like The Pokémon Company wants to make Zeraora “happen” with its “cool” design and frequent features, leading some fans to accuse it of being an “industry plant.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This title has been given to several Pokémon over the years when they are featured heavily in marketing or “shoehorned” into projects like the anime and games. However, Zeraora is arguably one of The Pokémon Company’s least successful attempts to astroturf a Pokémon to popularity, as evidenced by how people are looking at Mega Zeraora’s design with the same exasperation you feel towards someone who keeps showing up to your parties uninvited.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Personally, I have never had big feelings for Zeraora one way or the other, and though I’m glad to see a more serious Mega design, I’m not won over by its Mega Evolution. It will be interesting to see if some people latch onto it when this new form debuts in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC when it launches on December 10.</span></p>
