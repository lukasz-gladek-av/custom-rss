              <p>Looking to get back into reading in 2026, or just read more? Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>I love my paperbacks, but over time, I have realized how much more convenient digital copies are for reading on the go. You also get more variety, instead of feeling stuck with that one book you grabbed in a hurry and aren’t really in the mood for anymore – coming from someone who often picks a classic when all that the brain needs is some Murakami.</p>
<p>If you’re not a fan of reading on your phone or tablet, a Kindle can be an excellent investment. There are multiple versions available, but right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">Amazon is offering a chance to pick the latest Kindle Colorsoft at a nice 20% discount, for just $200.</a> You’re saving a sweet $50 on a reading solution that makes it easy to have all your favorite titles accessible at all times, wherever you go. Note that this deal ends soon, so it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep All Your Favorite Titles Close</h2>
<p>For $200, you’re getting a modest 7-inch, high-contrast Colorsoft display that’s easy on the eyes. Unlike the Kindle Paperwhite display, which is optimized for black and white reading, this version brings all the colors to life. It’s great for stories that include illustrations and maps – think The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Wheel of Time – plus comics where color really enhances the overall experience. You can even highlight your favorite scenes in yellow, orange, blue, or pink, and come back to revisit the moments later.</p>
<p>The brightness is adjustable. You can tweak the display from white to amber, depending on your environment. Switch to white light when you’re catching up on the latest Arundhati Roy book while soaking up some sun, and move to a warmer setting for bedtime reading. Even better, the Page Color feature inverts the black text and white background of pages of the books for an even more comfortable experience. It’s different from Dark Mode, and still offers colorful images and covers.</p>



<p>Kindle Colorsoft is also waterproof, which means you can take your favorite titles with you by the pool and to the beach, and even in the bathroom! The battery life is another strong selling point, as a single charge via USB-C gets you up to 8 weeks of reading – you read that right. That means you go up to two months without worrying about plugging the device in. This makes it great to take with you on your off-road adventures and long trips.</p>
<p>The Kindle Store lets you browse through more than 15 million titles from authors around the world, while the Kindle Unlimited subscription offers an all-you-can-read access to a wide catalog that includes best sellers. Prime members can read from a selection of eBooks, magazines, comics, manga, and audiobooks with their Prime membership. If you have young readers at home, you can even create a kid’s profile for unlimited access to a kid-friendly library with an Amazon Kids+ subscription.</p>
<p>All things considered, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">we highly recommend the latest Kindle Colorsoft to anyone looking to read more in 2026, especially at its current price of $200.</a> This deal saves you a nice $50 on this device, plus there are no delivery charges to worry about, either. Grab the deal before the price goes back up to $250.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="487">Data plays a crucial role in improving your performance as an athlete. To enhance your speed, boost your endurance, and maintain a consistent training routine, investing in a top-notch running watch is key. Whether you’re preparing for a marathon, gearing up for a local 5K, or simply running a couple times a week, having a reliable running watch is essential to measuring your efforts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">Right now, Amazon is offering a limited-time discount on the Garmin Forerunner 165, slashing its price by $50—down to just $200.</a></p>
<p data-start="489" data-end="801">The Garmin Forerunner 165 is tailored for individuals leading active lifestyles and those focused on fitness. It boasts a 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen that offers crystal-clear visibility, whether you’re running in direct sunlight or during nighttime.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="803" data-end="830">Your Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="832" data-end="1301">The Garmin Forerunner 165’s built-in GPS lets you track your running routes and it provides accurate data on your distance, pace, and other essential metrics. The watch also includes wrist-based heart rate monitoring, making it perfect for athletes who train according to specific heart rate zones. With over 25 pre-loaded activity profiles, it supports a broad range of sports, including running, HIIT, cycling, strength training, and more.</p>
<p data-start="1303" data-end="1670">In addition to its advanced tracking capabilities, the Garmin Forerunner 165 can serve as a personal fitness coach. Using the Garmin Connect app, you can access free adaptive training plans from expert coaches, which can be synced directly to your watch. This takes the guesswork out of your training, ensuring a more efficient approach to improving your performance.</p>
<p data-start="1672" data-end="2095">Beyond workouts, the Garmin Forerunner 165 continues to monitor your overall health throughout the rest of your day. It keeps track of your heart rate, both during physical activities and while at rest. A favorite of mine is the Body Battery score, which evaluates your energy levels based on factors like heart rate and activity. This helps you identify the optimal times to train or rest, ensuring you stay at your peak performance.</p>


<p data-start="2097" data-end="2447">Battery life is impressive on the Forerunner 165. With GPS active, the watch can last up to 19 hours, which is perfect for long runs. When GPS isn’t in use, the battery can last for up to 11 days. Someone who is running multiple times a week will likely find themselves only need to charge the watch once a week. This makes it far superior to other smartwatches, such as the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch, which typically require daily charging.</p>
<p data-start="2449" data-end="2827">The Garmin Forerunner 165 also offers smart features similar to those found on more expensive smartwatches. When connected to a compatible smartphone, the watch allows you to receive notifications for emails, texts, and alerts directly on your wrist. This means you can keep your phone tucked away while staying connected and informed during your workouts or throughout the day.</p>
<p data-start="2829" data-end="3118" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">Typically priced at $250, it’s currently available for just $200 with a 20% discount</a>. You can select between two stylish band colors: black or white, depending on your preference.</p>

              <p>Shopping for a new laptop today? You’re in luck. Amazon is offering plenty of discounts across a wide range of categories, including laptops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/">One of our favorite discounts is this 78% drop on the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, which brings its price down to just $440.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving over $1,500 on a machine that is made to handle all your everyday work and entertainment needs like a pro. Even better, if you place your orders today, you will also enjoy free shipping on your purchase, which sweetens the deal even more!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Made for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>IdeaPad Slim 3 is a lightweight laptop with a basic, yet sleek design. You’re getting a nice 15.3-inch WUXGA IPS display that delivers a stunning 1920×1200 resolution to bring all your favorite content to life. Whether you’re catching up on the last episode of Pluribus or creating a work presentation, expect vivid details and vibrant colors. The narrow bezels offer a larger screen real estate to work on, while the anti-glare coating keeps the visuals consistent across all lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Right above the screen is a built-in 720p webcam with a privacy shutter for easier video calls. You will be able to catch up with friends and hop on meetings without needing an external device. Those who need to type long documents and fill spreadsheets often will also appreciate the full-sized keyboard that features a dedicated numeric keypad. It’s comfortable to use, so you won’t have to deal with sore wrists at the end of a productive day.</p>
<p>Speaking of productivity, the laptop runs on a modest 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13420H processor with 8 cores and 12 threads. It’s made to handle regular tasks – think browsing, streaming, light office work, studying – without slowing you down. The processor is paired with an 8GB DDR5 SDRAM memory that keeps things running smoothly as you work or play. That said, it’s not designed for heavy workloads, so you won’t exactly be able to work on demanding tasks. But as long as your needs are fairly standard, it should get the job done just fine.</p>



<p>Storage capacity is better than most options in this range. You’re getting a spacious 512GB SSD that can house your entire multimedia library on your PC, and more easily. SSDs also offer much faster boot and load times than their traditional counterparts, so you’ll also be able to launch programs and move files around more efficiently.</p>
<p>Connectivity options are just as impressive. You’ve got WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for wireless connections, plus a wide range of ports including two USB-A (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-C (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), with USB PD 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, one HDMI 1.4, one headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), one SD card reader, and one power connector. Translation? You can easily connect a bunch of peripherals like a mouse, a portable screen, microphones, etc, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home also comes pre-installed, which means you can get started with using the machine right away.</p>
<p>Altogether, in a compact, lightweight build, the IdeaPad Slim 3 packs a wide range of features and impressive power for regular tasks. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/">You’re getting a spacious display, a full-sized keyboard, a modest processor, and a spacious SSD for under $450 here</a>. Keep in mind that the deal is only around for a short time. The discount is likely going to expire soon, so it’s best to lock it in quickly.</p>
