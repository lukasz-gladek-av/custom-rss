              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> season five’s finale episode, which is also the series finale, will go live on Netflix on New Year’s Eve. To celebrate that, Lego and Netflix have teamed up with the series creators to create a $300 set that I’m not sure really hits the mark. And I’m a big <em>Stranger Things</em> fan and Lego sicko.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-creel-house-lego-set">Lego and Netflix revealed a new elaborate <em>Stranger Things</em>-themed set</a> that is based on the <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Creel_House">Creel House first seen in season four</a>. This is the place where a young Henry Creel lived and where some horrific shit went down. It also ended up being the home base for season four’s big bad monster man, Vecna. And while that does mean the Creel House is a very important piece of Stranger Things lore, I’m not excited to spend $300 on what mostly looks like a Lego haunted house set.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/stranger-things-the-creel-house-11370">The Creel House Lego set contains 2,593 pieces and 13 minifigs</a>: Eleven, Will, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Steve, Nancy, Robin, Jonathan, Max, Holly, Mr. Whatsit, and Vecna himself. It also includes two vehicle builds. As you might expect, it contains a lot of Easter eggs referencing moments from every season of the popular Netflix series. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit about this set is that it can be split in a way that reveals the “interdimensional horror” below, with Lego and Netflix calling it the “first-ever transforming LEGO house.”</p>

 <p>“We grew up obsessed with the LEGO brand, so seeing <i>Stranger Things</i> rebuilt in bricks is honestly surreal,” explained <em>Stranger Things</em> creators Ross and Matt Duffer. “With the show heading into its final chapter — and hitting the 10-year mark — bringing the Creel House to life this way feels like the perfect celebration of the world and the fans who made all of this possible.”</p>

 <p>Personally, I’d have been much more interested in a Lego diorama recreating Hawkins or a few smaller sets depicting iconic locations and moments from the show that connect into a nice display piece. Something that feels instantly recognizable as <em>Stranger Things.</em> But at least for $300, the house looks detailed, splits apart, and contains a ton of figs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658">I’ll be spending dumb amounts of money on a different big Lego set based on a popular show soon, so I’ll be passing on this house set</a>.</p> <p>The Creel House set will be available to buy on New Year’s Day, about 24 hours after the finale airs. Makes me wonder if there are some interesting spoilers hidden in the set. <em>Stranger Things</em> <em>Vol. 1</em> is out now on Netflix. <em>Vol 2.</em> arrives on December 25. And the finale airs on New Year’s Eve.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this year, Bungie found itself in the center of <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">an unexpectedplagiarism scandal</a>. The studio’s upcoming extraction shooter, <i>Marathon</i>, was found to have included work lifted from online artist Antireal without her knowledge or consent. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/taucetigg.bsky.social/post/3lpcw5x7qlc26">Bungie fessed up and apologized</a>, claiming it was an accident.</p>   <p>Now, five months after the controversy, the artist, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?s=20">Antireal, has posted on X stating</a> that the “<i>Marathon</i> art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.</p> <p>— N² (@4nt1r34l) <a href="https://twitter.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This comes after a few months of silence from both parties. Bungie placed blame on a former employee and stated it would conduct a review of all of its assets to make sure it wouldn’t happen again.</p>

 <p>Antireal hasn’t shared the details of what was involved in the resolution, but as her post indicates, she appears to be happy with how it all shaked out.</p> <p><i>Marathon</i>’s early previews, meanwhile, haven’t been entirely positive. The hero-based extraction shooter has failed to impress fans of the studio and the genre broadly speaking. Still, the gorgeous aesthetic at work in the game’s art was one of the shooter’s highlights. That was all thrown into chaos after the plagiarism revelations.</p> <p>The developer recently conducted some private tests for the shooter, but a release date is still nowhere to be found following the game’s delay earlier this year. Sony has claimed Marathon will launch before April 2026.</p>

              <p><span>The Department of Homeland Security has been using memes and shitposts to promote its Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, including imagery and music from series like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-ice-trump-microsoft-developers-criticism-2000639666"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>to create disgusting viral videos promoting the capture and deportation of people of color. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>said it wasn’t involved</span></a><span> in the September video’s creation, but neither company disavowed the use of its IP to promote state-sanctioned violence. Whoever runs Xbox and The Pokémon Company’s social media accounts and public relations could learn a little bit from pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sabrina-carpenter-icon-skin-leak-festival-1851772197"><span>Sabrina Carpenter</span></a><span>, who did more to shame the Trump Administration’s “inhumane agenda” with a single post than either of those huge franchises.</span></p> <p><span>On Monday, December 1, the White House posted a video of ICE agents arresting people set to Carpenter’s sexy single “Juno.” The song has a line in which the singer asks her partner if he’s “ever tried ‘this one,’” referencing a sexual position. When Carpenter performed this song on the Short n’ Sweet Tour, she would imitate a position on stage that became a viral tour moment, as she rarely did the same position twice. Unfortunately, virality means that the worst people you know become aware of something and co-opt it to make shitty videos in which the “positions” in question are various ways ICE agents pin people down and arrest them.</span></p>

 <p><span>Carpenter, to her credit, has responded to the video and has, in no uncertain terms, told the Trump Administration to keep her songs out of their fuckin’ mouth.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.</p> <p>— Sabrina Carpenter (@SabrinaAnnLynn) <a href="https://twitter.com/SabrinaAnnLynn/status/1995876972405420114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Trump Administration, as it often does, responded with a shitpost that whitewashes the reality of its actions. The statement, issued to <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/trump-white-house-sabrina-carpenter"><em>Zeteo</em></a>, mixes in references to Carpenter’s music (he a fan) and says it’s only deporting “illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles.” This ignores the fact that non-criminal ICE arrests <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-detainee-data-fastest-growing-without-criminal-records-trump/">have skyrocketed under the Trump Administration</a>.</p>

 <p>“Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: We won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in the statement. “Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”</p> <p><span>Carpenter doesn’t make any mention of legal action, though her fans are urging the singer to file a copyright strike against The White House. It’s that easy, Master Chief. Pikachu, I know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-about-detective-pikachu-1834730119"><span>you can say more than your name</span></a><span>, so I don’t know what your excuse is beyond trying to avoid further controversy. That shit is embarrassing.

              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>‘s European concert is selling out in record time. <em>Megabonk</em> is back in the running for The Game Awards. Also RIP to the fish that did what many players couldn’t. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Rockstar Games cofounder Dan Houser likened AI hype to “<a href="https://youtu.be/d4RTTcvFxJU?si=3rw5DLWLXvhGrG7D">Mad Cow disease</a>.” Every game store should add that as a disclaimer: this game was made using generative AI tools. It might slop-ify your brain as a result. Play at your own peril.</p> <h2>The goldfish beat Malenia but couldn’t overcome a systemic bacterial infection</h2> <p>Tortellini, the viral goldfish that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-malenia-boss-goldfish-twitch-stream-1850610071">played<em> Elden Ring</em></a> and other games using a motion censor in its fish tank, has died at the age of three (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/viral-goldfish-that-beat-elden-rings-hardest-bosses-dies-aged-3-3289242/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>). The pet’s owner, YouTuber Pointcrow, said the goldfish had spent weeks battling an infection, and things took a turn for the worse over Thanksgiving week.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately, my goldfish Tortellini has passed away.</p> <p>He's been unwell for the past couple weeks fighting a systemic bacterial infection, and took a turn for the worse last night.

He was a big spender, notably buying an Oil Cooler Inlet Pipe for a Nissan Altima and TWO designer bags,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/PointCrow/status/1994132270530335040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1994132270530335040%7Ctwgr%5Ed298b2c1cbf436e9124962999c8b297578559dc1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fgaming%2Fviral-goldfish-that-beat-elden-rings-hardest-bosses-dies-aged-3-3289242%2F">wrote</a> in a tribute posted last week. “He was there to make us all laugh and bewilder us on how a small fish could do so much. He’s lived a god damn good life. I miss him so much. I’m sure he’s swimming in the great tank in the sky right now as happy as he can be.”</p>

 <h2>Someone finally escaped from <em>Escape from Tarkov</em></h2> <p>A streamer who goes by Tigz has spent years playing the extraction shooter in Early Access, but was finally able to complete its last mission now that the game recently went 1.0 (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>). Unlocking the ending required a harrowing playthrough of the new map Terminal, but Tigz reportedly only got the second-worst ending out of four. While he’s the first player to officially “<a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1995598764103663793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1995598764103663793%7Ctwgr%5Ebebcf1413e76f5906a67c6d4b11fc0f6b352f720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fsomeone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov%2F">beat</a>” the game, someone else out there still has the chance to be the first to unlock<em> Tarkov</em>‘s best ending.</p>

 <h2><em>Megabonk</em> still has a shot at winning The Game Awards</h2> <p>While the game’s creator took the <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">unprecedented step</a> of removing <em>Megabonk</em>‘s nomination for best debut indie game since he said he’d shipped other things in the past, it’s back in the player’s choice category. It’ll have to pass successive rounds of voting to make it into the finals. “I withdrew my other nomination due to <em>Megabonk</em> not fitting the category, but with this new nomination, we’re more back than ever. go vote pls,” Vedinad <a href="https://twitter.com/MegabonkGame/status/1995560069413655012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1995560069413655012%7Ctwgr%5Eacb23534c17e27b9e548b9286fa2df33607769d8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fmegabonk-game-awards-fan-vote-players-choice-category-ballot-vedinad%2F">wrote on X</a> this week.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> concert tickets are gaming’s hottest new collectibles</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Within a minute they’re all gone for London!

Only a few locations, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Strasbourg, still have tickets available. Fans said seats for the concert in the biggest cities like London evaporated immediately. I guess players are into video game concerts after all, <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-cancelled-dates-delay-us-tour-2000632085">but only ones with great music</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Ball X Pit</em> is getting a bunch of free DLC</h2> <p>2025’s hit indie dopamine machine will be giving fans more balls and more pits in early 2026. Publisher Devolver Digital revealed the game has now sold over 1 million copies and has a post-release roadmap. An update titled Regal arrives in January, one called Shadow arrives in April, and one called Natrulaist arrives in July. They’ll all be free and add new balls, evolutions, buildings, characters, “AND MORE.” I guess the arcade roguelike is going to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155">steal a good portion of my game time</a> next year as well.</p> <h2>The architect of the PS5 is in love with <em>Pikmi</em>n</h2> <p>Mark Cerny revealed the Nintendo exclusive was one of his favorite games in a recent interview on Simon Parkin’s <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console">My Perfect Console</a> (via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/im-a-sucker-when-it-comes-to-story-ps45-architect-recalls-transformative-experience-with-a-gamecube-classic"><em>NintendoLife</em></a>). “I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don’t know, <em>Portal</em> or<em> Plants vs Zombies</em> or<em> Flower</em> or <em>Katamari Damacy</em>,” the <em>Marble Madness</em> creator said. “<em>Pikmin</em> I just pick out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story.
