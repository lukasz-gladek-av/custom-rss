<p><i>No Man’s Sky</i> continues to impress with its regular updates, and the most recent one was surely one of the most eventful. That’s because it allows players to build massive ships of their own design, with fully explorable interiors, resulting in some epic ships their creators are sharing across the internet.</p> <p>If you frequent <i>NMS</i> spaces online, you’ve likely seen some of these. But whether you’re a regular spacefarer or it’s been some time since you’ve taken a look at Hello Games’ vast and ever-improving galaxy, I invite you to have a gander at some of the most impressive ship builds out there.</p>

 <h2><span id="from-star-wars-to-the-matrix,-five-awesome-recreations-of-famous-ships"></span>From <i>Star Wars</i> to <i>The Matrix</i>, five awesome recreations of famous ships<span></span></h2> <p>Give folks the ability to make stuff in a video game and you’ll quickly see recreations of beloved people, places, or things from TV shows, film, and other games. In <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, that mostly means ships, and there are tons of excellent recreations of famous ships out there in the <i>NMS </i>galaxy. Here are five standouts.</p>

 <h3>John_Dog_’s Millennium Falcon from <i>Star Wars</i></h3>  <p>It was hard to not just fill this list up with <i>Star Wars</i> recreations. Though it required a bit of glitching to make happen, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nui1ju/i_know_theres_been_a_lot_of_these_but_i_had_to/">this Falcon</a> is one of the most accurate I’ve seen.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Own–Astronomer-1296’s Sea Duck from <i>Duck Tales</i></h3>  <p>Maybe this one technically belongs in the collection of sillier ships you’ll find below, but given how ships can now land on water, there’s a satisfying fusion of form and function in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nhh5qz/i_think_ive_peaked_the_sea_duck/">this <i>Duck Tales</i> recreation</a>.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Due_Willow_137’s Pyramid ship from <i>Destiny 2</i></h3>  <p>No, this is not a screenshot from <i>Destiny 2</i>, though it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nu8e1s/pyramid_vessel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sure as hell looks like one</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>solidsharkey’s Eagle 5 from <i>Space Balls</i></h3>  <p>Having spent countless weeks traveling and living out of a van myself, I’ve often dreamed of having my own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1ndkz7i/spaceballs_the_video_game/">Eagle 5</a> to just cruise space with.</p>

 <hr> <h3>AcoupleofIrishfolk’s Nebuchadnezzar from <i>The Matrix</i></h3>  <p>While the exterior design of this recreation of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n99tpb/the_nebuchadnezzar/">Morpheus’ ship from <i>The Matrix</i> looks sick</a>, it’s the faithfully recreated interior, complete with screens and cables running everywhere, that really sold this build for me.</p>

 <h2><span id="five-sick-original-ship-builds"></span>Five sick original ship builds<span></span></h2> <p>It’s wild how flexible <i>NMS</i>’ shipbuilding system is. I’ve particularly enjoyed seeing builds that deliver on aesthetics not normally found in Hello Games’ otherwise kinda cartoony presentation.</p> <h3>Barbed-Wire’s ‘Lived-in’ corvette</h3>  <p>Maybe I just have a thing for living out of vehicles? I’d call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1njmnts/ive_finally_finished_my_livedin_corvette_build/">this place</a> home.</p> <hr> <h3>schmacobinc’s ‘Biblically Accurate’ corvette</h3>  <p>This one caught my eye immediately. And it’s a fantastic example of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1neq31b/a_biblically_accurate_corvette/">wacky and weird</a> shit you can kitbash together in <i>NMS</i>.</p> <hr> <h3>Leteramma’s ‘Trash Ship’</h3>  <p>There are plenty of OG ship creations that look fit for the cover of some space opera novel. And this “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nhny71/my_trash_ship/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Trash Ship</a>” looks like it has a story all to itself.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Beckhaver’s ‘Mini Salve Outrider with Trailer’</h3>  <p>I love the simplicity and originality of this two-part build. It uses some fancier build techniques to pull off, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nrylm6/voyagers_mini_salvage_outrider_with_trailer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">but it looks so worth it</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>Lopsided_Wealth_7968’s ‘Desert Hovercraft’</h3>  <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nnvyub/desert_hovercraft/">sick-looking spacecraft with outdoor seating</a> for some scenic views? The sandworms won’t catch you here (I hope).</p> <h2><span id="five%e2%80%a6creative-ship-builds"></span>Five…creative ship builds<span></span></h2> <p>Folks will always recreate cool things and come up with wild designs of their own…but then, well, then there’s everything else. Enjoy the silliness.</p>

 <h3>AcoupleofIrishfolk’s interstellar Clippy</h3>  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nc1yqg/it_looks_like_youre_trying_to_explore_the_galaxy/">He’s probably just as annoying</a> in space as he is in a word processor.</p> <hr> <h3>murderwastheface’s starside Slayer performance</h3>  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1napfv0/raining_blood/">Slayer</a> is far from my favorite metal band (I saw them live with Primus a few years ago and Primus was so much better), but I appreciate the creativity.</p> <hr> <h3>Huzbubber_Tim’s forklift corvette</h3>  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n6a31n/made_a_forklift_corvette_lmao">Maybe this belongs in the recreation category</a> as it looks like a more capable version of the driveable forklift from <i>Halo Reach</i>.</p> <hr> <h3>AcoupleofIrishfolk’s Thomas the Tank Engine</h3>  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n71xhw/we_spent_so_long_wondering_if_we_could_we_never/">Obligatory</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>Due_Willow_137’s ‘Larry the Lobster’</h3>  <p>I can’t tell if this is an <i>SNL</i> or a <i>Spongebob</i> reference. Either way, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nme7f0/you_can_call_me_larry_the_lobster/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it’s a sick build</a>.</p> <hr> <p>Whether you opt to rely on straightforward shipcrafting or you mix in a little bit of glitching, <i>NMS</i>’ ship- and corvette-building tools offer some really wild options for the impassioned virtual space mechanic. I’m sure this won’t be the only time I’ll be compelled to round up some highlights.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Jobs In Final Fantasy Tactics, Ranked]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-jobs-in-final-fantasy-tactics-ranked.1314214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is renowned</a> for its clever, quirky, and deeply customizable job system. It might be the best job system in any game ever. It’s certainly the best in Square Enix’s long-running RPG franchise (<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> fans can fight me in the Dorter Slums after work). But how do you decide which one to choose? Here’s my list of the best ones, based on a combination of their sheer power and how fun they are to play with.</p> <p>A word of warning: you won’t find jobs like Time Mage, Mimic, or Arithmetician in the ranking below. That’s because while each of those contains some of the most powerful abilities in the game, they are each highly situational and/or better when paired with other jobs as the primary one. So while you should make sure everyone learns some of the Time Mage’s skills, you should never be fielding one just for fun. And while Mimic and Arithmetician are responsible for some of the deadliest combos in the game, they also both come with huge drawbacks that ultimately disqualify them for our purposes here.</p>

 <p>The jobs below are the ones that will get you <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">the most bang for your buck</a> and are the ones you’ll want to revert back to once your characters have mastered the rest of their skills.</p> <h2>10. Orator (Requires Mystic Lv.3)</h2> <p>Final Fantasy loves experimenting with offbeat character classes and in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> that’s the Mediator. This job talks and carries a gun. That’s it. While not the most powerful or effective, it’s pretty versatile and lots of fun. Intimidate lowers a unit’s Bravery and can turn them into a chicken. Mimic Darlavon can put even some bosses to sleep. All of these abilities cost zero MP and have no cast time. Also the hat rules.</p>

 <h2>9. Geomancer (Requires Monk Lv.4)</h2> <p>What if a knight also had magic? This is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ version of the Blue Mage. Geomancers can carry swords and shields but also hit enemies from far away with environmental magic based on what type of terrain they’re standing on. Each attack comes with its own chance to proc a debuff like slow or petrify. The attacks don’t do much damage but they are free, happen immediately, and can chip away at foes while you’re closing the distance.</p>

 <h2>8. Dragoon (Requires Thief Lv.4)</h2> <p>Dragoons have the tankiest stat growth and also the coolest-looking armor. They can hit from two squares away with javelins, keeping them out of harm’s way for enemy melee counters. Plus they can ignore elevation when moving, and Jump allows them to hit faraway enemies for extra damage while staying out of danger for most of their turn. They aren’t very flashy or fun but they can take a beating and still dish it out, one-shotting pesky enemy mages from far away.</p>

 <h2>7. Black Mage (Requires Chemist Lv.2)</h2> <p>Black Mages have the highest base magic attack power in the game and make things, including on occasion their friends or even themselves, go boom. All you really need to know.</p> <h2>6. White Mage (Requires Chemist Lv.2)</h2> <p>This is the most versatile magic class because it can revive fallen party members and attack with Holy. Like its Black Mage counter-part, Flare, Holy also only targets one square, letting you nuke enemies without fear of friendly fire. In addition to full-heal revives with Arise, Reraise lets you revive allies ahead of time before sending them to draw enemy fire. The only downside is that all of this costs a boatload of MP.</p>

 <h2>5. Summoner (Requires Time Mage Lv.3)</h2> <p>Summoners have the most powerful attack spells in the game. Unlike Black Mages, their summons can’t hurt allies and also have wider areas of impact. Cyclops and Bahamut do incredible damage and their casting times in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster have all been buffed. Plus Lich is absolutely necessary for late-game boss fights where enemies have over 1,000 HP. That’s because it does damage on a percentage of total HP basis, letting it hit for 999 damage. Also Golem is a great support summon for soaking up Archer fire in-between turns.</p>

 <h2>4. Ninja (Requires Archer Lv.4, Thief Lv.5, Geomancer Lv.2)</h2> <p>Two words: Dual-Wield. The only thing cooler than one sword is two swords, and the Ninja job gives you that. Or two flails if you’re an RNG sicko. Ninjas have great movement and speed, and can be outfitted with enough evasion to make their squishy HP less susceptible to being quickly depleted. The throwing attack isn’t the best but it’s another decent ranged option for picking enemies off from afar.</p> <h2>3. Samurai (Requires Knight Lv.4, Monk Lv.5, Dragoon Lv.2)</h2> <p>Okay, maybe I lied. The only thing cooler than two swords is one big sword that you lift up over your head to cast magic with. The Samurai is another interesting riff of the “what if Knight but also Mage?” question. The Iaido abilities scale with magic attack and let you heal, buff, debuff, and damage a big area around your character without having to worry about friendly fire. It can be expensive early on when your swords randomly break in-between uses, but more tanky-ness than the Ninja and Geomancer also adds to the appeal. Some other people would put Ninja ahead of Samurai, and that’s because they get a perverse satisfaction out of constantly having to revive them.</p> <h2>2. Chemist (Unlocked from the start)</h2> <p>Unlocked right from the start, Chemists are the true workhorses of the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> combat economy. They’re far from flashy but they provide incredible value, instantly healing without needing to wait for spells to cast or hoping they have enough MP left in the tank. They also get guns and they automatically discover items hidden beneath them during battle sometimes. There is almost no battle in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> you can’t eventually win simply by throwing dozens and dozens of potions and phoenix downs at it. Plus they have lots of fun pouches.</p> <h2>1. Monk (Requires Knight Lv.3)</h2> <p>The Monk. Where do I begin? They don’t need weapons or hats so you don’t need to spend a ton of money on upkeep. They have the best physical attack growth in the game and the Martial Arts ability is by far the most useful. They have ranged options and can revive allies or get rid of status effects for free. Plus they are the only Job that can restore MP to multiple characters at once, keeping your big Mage guns fueled up. The only drawback is these abilities are severely hampered by differences in elevation so you have to play smart. But when all else fails, just punch everyone in the face really, really hard. Works every time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-saudi-deal-fallout-junk-credit-ratings-risky-ai-bets-and-developer-fears.1314118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re two days out from EA’s announcement that it would <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">sell to Saudia Arabia and private equity</a> for $55 billion, and as the dust settles, concerns continue to mount. Some inside the company are worried about possible cuts, layoffs, and censorship coming down the road, and the logistics of the deal don’t necessarily do much to reassure them. Downgraded credit ratings, rumors of ramped-up AI initiatives, and relative radio silence from the executives and investors involved isn’t helping.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/s-p-says-it-expects-to-cut-electronic-arts-to-junk-status?srnd=phx-fixed-income"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that S&amp;P Global Ratings plans to lower EA’s credit rating to “junk status” once the leveraged buyout deal is completed sometime next year. It’s currently “BBB+” but would fall into the “non-investment grade” or “speculative” territory once saddled with the $20 billion loan required to pay off all of the <i>Battlefield 6 </i>publisher’s existing shareholders at a 25-percent premium. Moody’s Ratings announced it is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/moody-s-says-it-s-likely-to-cut-electronic-arts-following-s-p?srnd=phx-deals">planning a similar reappraisal</a>. And the more context we get around the financing of the deal, the worse it looks.</p>

 <p>“JPMorgan made the commitment through its leveraged-finance arm, not its private credit strategy, and the biggest U.S. bank is expected to share the risk with rival firms to create a global syndicate of underwriters, according to people familiar with the deal,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reported yesterday. “The debt— expected to be rated in the single-B range—is set to be sold through high-yield bonds and leveraged loans in a cross-border, dual-currency transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential details.” Smells like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m23a2o4avs2f">high-interest-rate debt</a>.</p>

 <h2>BioWare on the chopping block</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-battlefield-6-mass-effect-bioware-private-equity-2000629947">Some analysts who spoke to<em> Kotaku</em></a> have suggested that going private could free EA from the whims of a stock market based around quarterly earnings reports, but it could also be that being saddled with a ton of debt completely reshapes the decades-old gaming company as we know it. EA has an infamous reputation for buying up acclaimed studios with big creative ambitions and eventually gutting them when they fail to live up to the earnings potential of the loot-box machines fueling <em>Madden</em> and <em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p>

 <p>Respawn Entertainment recently faced multiple rounds of layoffs and saw multiple projects canceled, including a prototype for a long-awaited return to the world of <em>Titanfall</em>. BioWare has suffered even worse. Following a tumultuous development cycle for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> due to shifting schedules and live-service goals, the RPG powerhouse is back to being a one-game studio (<em>Mass Effect</em>) and a shell of its former self. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> now reports</a> that EA was at one point looking to possibly sell off its $775 million acquisition from back in 2007. At least some developers there are just as worried about a future under Saudi ownership. They told<em> Insider Gaming</em> that it feels like only a matter of time before BioWare is downsized further.</p>

 <p>“For the studios that have more of a track record, especially a track record that maybe doesn’t line up with your own political views…you’re going to look at that studio and wonder how you make them fit into your new structure,” former BioWare project director Mark Darrah said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGc8oq9uq8&amp;t=50s">in a new YouTube video</a>. “It’s hard to imagine that you have BioWare pivot from having very progressive messaging to having the reverse because it’s what the government wants. It’s hard to imagine that the public perception of a game that comes out of BioWare, even if you do do that, isn’t apocalyptically bad.”</p>

 <h2>Pivoting away from human rights</h2> <p>In an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3m23abrrwj22v">FAQ directed at employees</a>, one of the only pieces of communication EA has released since the deal was announced, the company claims, “There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction.” Amid concerns about the abysmal human rights record of Saudi Arabia, where same-sex relationships are outlawed, EA has stopped short of reaffirming its long-standing commitment to inclusivity, which included asserting “<a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-trans-rights-star-wars-jedi-survive-apex-legends-res-1848998351">Trans Rights Are Human Rights</a>” as some US states pushed anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in 2022.</p>

 <p>“Andrew Wilson basically said ‘f you’ to all women and LGTBQ employees at EA with this deal,” one current EA employee <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners-deal">told <em>Game File</em> this week</a>. “It just shows how many people have been collateral this past year for executives to make out rich. Nothing feels great. And we know, when the deal closes, it’s going to get worse before it gets better, if better is even possible.” A separate employee, also speaking anonymously, reiterated those concerns to <em>Kotaku</em>.&nbsp;“Members of the Pride Employee Working Group are currently being very vocal about our concerns for our future,” they told me. “We’re worried LGBTQ content will be deprioritized or cut entirely and that LGBTQ and especially trans employees will be on the chopping block. Few of us feel heard right now.”</p> <p>There’s also concerns about what the new ownership arrangement will mean for EA’s ongoing push around generative AI. It was a big part of the company’s pitch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">at its 2024 Investor Day</a>. At the time, CEO Andrew Wilson said AI was “the very core of our business” and “not merely a buzzword,” claiming there were over 100 “novel AI projects” the publisher was experimenting with to improve how it made games. These lofty promises have reemerged in light of the Saudi deal.</p> <h2>Banking on an AI revolution that may never arrive</h2> <p>Reporting on the sale earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">the<em> Financial Times</em> wrote,</a> “investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in coming years,” according to people involved in the transaction. It continued, “The deal is a huge bet that artificial intelligence can significantly cut EA’s operating costs, allowing the equity consortium to manage a large debt load on a company that historically carried limited net debt.”</p>

 <p>Some employees <em>Kotaku</em> has spoken with say EA has continued beating the drum of AI over the last 12 months, but with varying degrees of urgency. While developers are encouraged to experiment with AI tools as much as they can, none reported being forced to implement them directly into their workflows. At the same time, AI is being incorporated into customer service management, something the company behind microtransaction-fueled sports franchises does a lot of. Where some players might have been routed to humans for help with things like Terms of Service violation reviews in the past, their complaints may no be routed first to AI agents instead.</p> <p>The Saudi deal is the second-biggest gaming merger ever. The first, Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, faced a surprising and prolonged level of scrutiny among regulators in the U.S. and abroad, including an entire lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission. That was under the Biden Administration, however, which made anti-trust enforcement a priority for the federal government. Under the pay-to-play and pay-to-win mechanics of the current Trump Administration, EA’s sale to private equity and a foreign government isn’t expected to hit so many roadblocks, especially with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as one of the buyers.</p> <p>“Kushner has a personal relationship and he has deep ties in Saudi Arabia. He is very comfortable operating in the Middle East. It created a basis of trust,” one source <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>.&nbsp;“We are in a regulatory environment that is welcoming of [Saudi Arabia]. We are not in what was the previous regime,” said another. And according to a third: “What regulator is going to say no to the president’s son-in-law?”</p>

The demo contains two full levels with boss fights, supports both local and online co-op, and features nine playable characters: Rocket Raccoon, Nova, Phyla-Vell, She-Hulk, Venom, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Storm, and Captain America. Here’s a new trailer for the demo:</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced earlier this year</a> during a Nintendo Direct,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is a side-scrolling 2D retro-inspired beat ’em up being developed by the same studio behind the extremely tubular and awesome <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler.&nbsp;<em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past games, is a snappy and action-packed retro throwback. I played the new demo on Steam for a few minutes and immediately had a blast smashing baddies as She-Hulk and Spider-Man. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">Swapping between the two, which is this game’s big gimmick</a>, was great as it let me switch between Spider-Man’s fast and agile action during some segments and She-Hulk’s heavy hits during fights with tougher foes. I did encounter some performance dips, which wasn’t ideal, but hopefully those issues get ironed out when the game launches…eventually.</p>

 <p>While there are nine characters in the demo, that’s not the game’s full line-up. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to include a large roster of 15 characters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-new-heroes-marvel-cosmic-invasion-full-roster-black-panther-ghost-rider-2000626521">We know 12 of the 15 characters</a> that will be playable at launch. Three more have yet to be revealed.</p>

 <p>Now the bad news for console players: The new <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> demo isn’t available on Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch. This has understandably disappointed many players online, with some jumping into the comments of the trailer above to share their frustration.</p> <p>Regardless, we shouldn’t have to wait long, as <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to arrive in 2025. Exactly when hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s not much time left in the year so if it’s not getting delayed, the game is likely weeks away from launching on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Although I’ve sought out a handful of cards featuring my favorite monsters and characters, I generally only pay casual attention to the </span><i><span>Pokémon Trading Card Game</span></i><span>.&nbsp; I grew up with a giant cardboard box of old cards under my bed, but as an adult, I can’t imagine putting in half the time or money I did into it as a kid. It just seems like it would be too much hassle, and that’s not to mention everything that happens around the game. When I do hear stories about the TCG, they’re usually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>stories of controversy</span></a><span>. Images of people nearly destroying the Van Gogh Museum in order to get exclusive cards and merchandise to sell online, as well as grown-ass men fighting and camping out for cards outside of GameStops, are seared into my brain. This toxic, predatory side of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>has pushed a lot of people out of the space</span></a><span>, as memories of excitement at finding your favorite card have been replaced by stories of scams and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241"><span>robberies</span></a><span>. That was how it was for me until fairly recently, when I saw a video from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>vendor @beard_dad_cardz having an extremely sweet interaction with a girl named Sophia at a card show.</span></p>   <p><span>As a fan of his streams, Sophia is excited to be at beard_dad_cardz’s booth, and his viewers are so excited about her excitement that they donate so she can get a card she likes. She says she’s a fan of Umbreon and Espeon, and after she finds a card of the dark-type Eeveelution she likes, beard_dad_cardz gives it to her for free. The moment went viral on multiple social media apps and has accumulated over 17.8 million views on TikTok alone.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card vendors have taken up content creation as an extension of their business, and that means several of them livestream from card shows and capture moments like this regularly. You wouldn’t know it from the news, but there’s a lot of kindness, charity, and community in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards that often gets drowned out by the worst bad actors. And as the stigma around the space has grown, creators and vendors like Chris Daywalt, the owner of HLD Cards and Collectibles, are trying to combat these notions by putting these moments of kindness on the internet, where people can see them.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The rise of videos where you’re seeing people scalping Costco for cards or doing things like that, that’s going to happen any time you really shine a spotlight on something, especially something as big as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,” Daywalt told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “When people start hearing money around it, those people are going to come out of the woodwork. They did the same thing to sneakers and to Supreme clothes, video cards, and PSIs, anything else that they feel like they can make a quick dollar on, but I think what makes </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>different is the 30 years of community that’s been built around it.”</span></p>

    <p><span>Daywalt started HLD as a way to connect with his son Henry, whom the shop and channel are named after. Henry returned from a summer camp trip with his first set of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, which led to the father and son bonding over their collections. Daywalt says this ignited a passion in his son to start collecting and gave them a common interest, as Daywalt has been a lifelong TCG player, and grew up playing and trading with others.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I always used to say ‘I play </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> for the gathering,’ and so I really knew the community part of it before I knew the reselling part of it,” Daywalt said.</span></p> <p><span>What started as an opportunity for Daywalt to pass on his values around taking care of something and finding community quickly became a family business after his brother started making content out of their card show appearances, and his wife started handling other aspects of the business. Daywalt says he’s comfortable sharing this with his son because in his experience, the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community sticks to the messages of kindness the franchise touts. There are still some bad actors that try to take advantage of others, though, which is why Daywalt </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hldcardsandcollectibles/video/7545145575449152799?lang=en"><span>doesn’t do “trade-ups,</span></a><span>” or card exchanges in which the card the event attendee receives is of greater value than the one they part with, with adults, but will do them with kids.</span></p>

   <p><span>Promoting those good moments is why a lot of vendors are branching out into content creation. Sure, it’s another extension of the business and also works as viral marketing, but the narrative of bad actors dominating the space has become so prevalent that long-time fans feel protective of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and the space they’ve cultivated, and want to push back. Aaron Lee, one of the co-founders of Duckbird, grew up watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime and has memories of waiting for new episodes to premiere on WBTV back in the day. As such, he’s been in the space long enough to have encountered people engaged in shady practices at card shows time and time again. However, he says a lot of these are less common at in-person events than one might think, and he especially experiences them less in his small North Carolina town.</span></p>

 <p><span>“You’ll see people who you can tell are, like, obviously there to make a quick buck,” Lee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “There will be even kids and adults who are obviously there trying to make money essentially; taking advantage of vendors and whatnot, and have their kids try to do a trade-up challenge to get them a better card. That’s a big one that I’ve seen a lot, and that has come from a lot of influencers or YouTube content creators being able to do that. But if it’s, you know, someone who knows what they’re doing and[is] just trying to take advantage of people, that’s something that’s not so fun.”</span></p>   <p><span>For Lee and his partner, “Duck,” trying to make people feel welcome at card shows is important. Lee says that the pair tries to give free stuff to kids who show up, especially if they seem to be in the early days of their own collection journey.</span></p> <p><span>“We kind of do like a rock-paper-scissors game, but we use Poké Balls with different types [of Pokémon], and we give them free packs if they win,” Lee says. “Even if they lose, we still give them free packs. We’ll do coin flips with kids for free, and then even if they lose, we’ll keep flipping until they win. So it’s stuff like that to just make sure that anybody who we feel like is new to the hobby or is genuinely passionate about collecting is able to have a positive experience when they go to a show or if they stop by our stream. Anything to just let them know,&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>‘Hey, there are still people out there who really enjoy the space and just want to grow the community in the right direction.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Stories of vendors going out of their way to help kids get cards they’re looking for are pretty common at these events. Which is why, despite all the talk of big money in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>these days, a lot of the biggest transactions are completely free.</span></p> <p><span>“I had people who were trying to find a card for a kid who’s looking for, like, a specific Pikachu card,” Lee said. “They’ll tell their buddies and their buddies will tell their buddies, and then the whole show will be searching for a card and bringing it to the kid. Half the time, they give it to the kid for free. It really just depends on where you are and who you talk with, but I would say like 80 to 90 percent of vendors that you see in real life are kind. They go out of their way to help the kid out or help somebody out when they’re looking for something specific. I see a lot of kindness with vendors when, sometimes, you might be trying to trade a card in that might not necessarily move as well. A lot of times, vendors will match the card 100 percent and just give the kid what they want, just to help the kid out. That’s where it starts, when you’re a kid and you don’t really wanna look at this in a monetary way. You just want to collect cards. You can really tell if a kid is just trying to collect cards, you know, versus trying to make some money. And that’s what I like to see.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with all these positive stories, piercing through all the constant reports of crimes and the viral moments showing scalpers acting a fool at major events can feel impossible. When I asked Daywalt what advice he’d give to someone trying to enter the space, he said the average collector and vendor is not going to be making thousands of dollars off these cards, and if you go into the hobby expecting that, you’re likely going to be disappointed.</span></p> <p><span>“If it’s about the money, go trade stocks or work in finance,” Daywalt says. “What I always say to people is that the reason I don’t necessarily worry if the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>market crashes tomorrow is because I’ll look at it as an opportunity to go get all the cards I wanted. They have a value to me outside of what a TCG player says the market value is. Don’t put that pressure on something, you know, buy it because you like it and it’s something that brings you joy intrinsically, not extrinsically, because it could make you some money.”</span></p>   <p><span>Lee echoed the sentiment and said that some of the best cards are ones you won’t find selling for three or more figures, and if you aren’t interested in the art or community, there are easier ways to make money.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We get tons of people coming up asking for particular Pokémon because they want to collect all of that Pokémon,” Lee says. “Then if it’s a less popular Pokémon like Dunsparce, then, you know, the cards aren’t gonna be as expensive, and it makes for a really fun time.”</span></p> <p><span>Daywalt says that even after the time he’s put into buying, selling, and collecting, HLD isn’t paying his family’s bills, and that every dollar they make at these shows is going back into the business. While he admits he does get invested in predicting the market, he encourages people who are hoping to find the golden ticket in a Target booster pack to interrogate whether they’re in it for the right reasons.</span></p> <p><span>“There’s a lot of knowledge and a lot of really sharp people that are already in the space, and you’re not going to catch up to them tomorrow,” Daywalt says. “I don’t care how many YouTube videos you watch or how many articles you read about it. If you want to get into this space, do it because it brings you joy. Do what you like, and make the money a secondary part of it if it’s important to you.”</span></p>   <p><span>After talking to vendors and seeing these kinds of wholesome interactions online, I still don’t know that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card collecting is for me. I have a collection of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371">Raichu</a> and Professor Turo cards on my shelf, and I think that’s probably enough. But after seeing the uptick in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card scams and content mills over the past few years, it was disheartening for a while to know a series that had brought me so much joy had become a symbol of predatory greed. At the very least, it’s comforting to know that some people are keeping the childlike wonder alive, and that they’re posting reminders of it online.</span></p>
