The only thing standing between the surviving trio and having their greatest desires granted is one last trial and the looming presence of Agatha’s newly revealed ex, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598">Death</a></span> (Plaza). The first half of the two-part finale focuses on this trial, which asks the witches to make something grow in a concrete and metal enclosure bereft of life.</p><p>Despite having twice as long to tell the end of its tale, however, <em>Agatha All Along</em> rushes through the end of the Witches’ Road. This results in Jen, whose story about being mysteriously bound a century ago has been teased for several episodes, getting a quick bow tied to her whole arc and being sent away with little fanfare. It’s a deflating moment, as the show has implied that this is some big thing waiting to be revealed, but when the only revelation is that Agatha accidentally bound Jen in the past for some quick cash, it goes nowhere and the two resolve their differences in a couple of minutes. Jen has never been one of the strongest characters on the show, and concluding her arc with this haphazard ending a week after Patti LuPone delivered the show’s best performance in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-disney-episode-7-death-reveal-1851680675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-disney-episode-7-death-reveal-1851680675">defining episode</a></span> is a major misstep.</p><p>Once Jen is out of the picture, <em>Agatha All Along</em> is free to refocus on its greatest aspect, the relationship between Agatha and Billy. With death seemingly imminent for the two as they can’t pass the trial, Agatha is able to help Billy connect with his powers and discover where his lost brother is, thus fulfilling the wish that led him to the Witches’ Road and sending him to safety, leaving Agatha alone to die. This moment also leads to the show’s most gut-wrenching revelation: Agatha’s son wasn’t sacrificed by her on the Witches’ Road at all, he just died. When Kathryn Hahn quietly tells Billy that sometimes boys just die, it’s a heartbreaking confession that there is no power in the world that can keep death away. </p><p>But as this is a Marvel property and we aren’t even through the first half of this finale yet, we can’t end on that emotional note. The climax of part one devolves into another special-effects-heavy brawl as Death and the team of Billy and Agatha fire different colored magical blasts at each other. Until now, <em>Agatha All Along</em> has largely steered clear of action, instead choosing to focus on interesting puzzles the coven has to face in each trial. Trading all that originality in for action that makes your eyes glaze over just made me wish the show would end as quickly as possible.</p><p>Thankfully, the show comes to an end quick enough. Agatha chooses to sacrifice herself in order to save Billy, which she does by sharing a passionate kiss with her longtime lover, Death, that immediately leads to Agatha keeling over and dropping dead. It’s nice that we actually got a kiss between Plaza and Hahn in the show as they’ve played their characters as explicitly queer, but it’s almost laughable that Agatha is killed off immediately after this display in what has to be one of the most eye-rolling cases of “kill your gays.” Oh, and we actually have a whole other episode to get through!</p><figure id="" data-id="e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-recommend-id="image://e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-recommend-id="image://e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You might wonder what there is left to wrap up, the show’s titular character just died! But part one ends with the reveal that the Witches’ Road was conjured into existence by Billy’s powers unconsciously turning his dreams into reality. It’s a reveal that fans had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-witches-road-wiccan-theory-1851677479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-witches-road-wiccan-theory-1851677479">already clocked</a></span>, but one that still feels like a cheap trick that does nothing but take away meaning from what has largely been an excellent show.</p><p>Yet before we even get to that, the last episode of <em>Agatha All Along</em> begins with a lengthy flashback that reveals the story of Agatha’s son, Nicholas. It turns out that the boy was fated to die in childbirth, until Agatha pleaded with her lover to spare his life. All deals have a price, of course, and Death warned Agatha that his time would still be limited. Naturally Agatha and Nicholas live a fairly happy life for a few years, until one night Nicholas dies in his sleep. What’s supposed to be a window into Agatha’s soul at her most vulnerable, however, feels instead like padding to a finale that has already overstayed its welcome. Marvel projects, on both the big and small screens, seem to think subtlety is the enemy. This is just another example of that mentality, as the single quiet moment between Billy and Agatha in the first part of the finale contains exponentially more meaning and power than this extended sequence. Instead of “show, don’t tell,” Marvel chooses to show and show and keep showing until they’ve beaten you over the head with the awareness that this should be sad. A parent outliving their child is inherently tragic, of course, but stretching this emotion to its limit has diminishing returns.</p><p>As its final and grandest reveal, <em>Agatha All Along</em> reframes everything we’ve seen before in a much poorer light. Rather than really being a show about Agatha, this is first and foremost Billy’s show. The deaths of every other coven member (minus Jen, who survives) are just footnotes in his origin story. To justify the show’s choices, Agatha appears to Billy to act as his debate partner one more time, now in the form of a ghost—perhaps the most egregious example yet of Marvel so clearly being unwilling to commit to killing off a fan-favorite character despite the death it wrote them into. Like the show has stated before, this whole journey just shows that Billy is a killer just like his mother, one who is unable to control his dark powers. Just like the dead coven members who are nothing more than fodder for Wiccan character growth, the entirety of <em>Agatha All Along</em> feels like one more Marvel project that isn’t meant to stand on its own but is instead fodder for the grand MCU machine. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the last day of October and Nintendo still hasn’t revealed the one thing every fan is waiting for. Instead, we’ve gotten almost everything else the company could think of, from random ports of cult Wii U games to literal alarm clocks. What else could the gaming giant throw at fans while it continues running out the clock on a new console announcement in 2024?</p><p>The signs were there, from mysterious leakers to the company’s own president. “We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year,” Shuntaro Furukawa tweeted back in May. Technically, Nintendo’s fiscal year runs until March 31, but my god, man! Give us a single image of the hardware, an official name, anything! Five months later, fans have survived heart-stopping levels of hype ever since the company ditched its regular September Nintendo Direct and chatter from developers and others about an imminent announcement reached a fever pitch. </p><p>With all eyes on the mustachioed plumber, the console manufacturer decided on a different course of action. Instead of revealing the Switch 2, Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-clock-mario-date-preorder-1851668614?_gl=1*1yaztip*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDM4NzgyNi41NC4wLjE3MzAzODc4NTAuMzYuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-clock-mario-date-preorder-1851668614?_gl=1*1yaztip*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDM4NzgyNi41NC4wLjE3MzAzODc4NTAuMzYuMC4w">announced Alarmo</a></span>, a $100 device that uses video-game sounds to get you out of bed, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">at least if you’re single</a></span>.

On a random Tuesday, Nintendo decided to drop the news that niche <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-switch-2-port-release-date-rpg-1851683819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-switch-2-port-release-date-rpg-1851683819">Wii U exclusive <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a></span> would all of a sudden, 10 years later, arrive on Switch next spring. And then last night the company busted out even more news: Nintendo music <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1851747457853440212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1851747457853440212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now has a standalone app</a></span> for smartphone listening as part of Switch Online. </p><p>It now feels like time is running out for Nintendo to actually reveal the Switch 2 before the end of 2024. Maybe there’s a small pocket of time in November before the holiday, but why would the company decide to steal thunder  from <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> or its big holiday push to help sell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733">another 10 million more Switches this year</a></span>. Maybe Nintendo just does not give a fuck anymore, confident in the knowledge that, whenever it chooses to announce its next console, the news will bend the attention economy to its will no matter the manner or timing in which it unfolds. Or maybe this means we really aren’t getting a Switch 2 reveal before mid-January after the holiday break. </p><p>In the meantime, here are nine more things I would be less shocked to see Nintendo announce between now and then that aren’t a Switch 2. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6579cf2f9c94813e3b0bce1b4fd62154" data-recommend-id="image://6579cf2f9c94813e3b0bce1b4fd62154" data-format="png" data-width="1900" data-height="950" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange N64 sits on a white surface.

I will always take a new sequel over a remake, but at the rate it now takes for new games to come out, I wouldn’t be opposed to an <em>Ocarina of Time</em> remake. I’ve been reading the manga based on the game with my kid and would love to show him the original game but I don’t have the patience to teach him those finicky camera controls after the boundless freedom of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-recommend-id="image://516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-recommend-id="image://516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The fans cry out for a savior. Is it Birdo? No. But that wouldn’t stop her from finally getting the solo spin-off she’s earned from grinding it out across all of those multiplayer franchises. I’m imagining a classic 2D platformer where she collects eggs to get new abilities that open up the map, Metroidvania-style. Knowing Nintendo though, a Birdo game will be something so much weirder. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-recommend-id="image://0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="shutterstock" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Romolo Tavani / Netflix / Nintendo / Kotaku<!-- --> (<!-- -->Shutterstock<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-recommend-id="image://0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Switch went nearly eight years without letting anyone watch Netflix shows on it.

Why finally announce a sequel when Nintendo could just keep turning around all of the remaining levels from older games that haven’t already been added yet? There are still so many to bring back, like Wuhu Island, Dry Dry Ruins, and <em>Double Dash</em>’s Rainbow Road. Nintendo will keep selling you DLC and you’ll like it because <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is one of like 20 perfect games that’s ever existed. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Evan Amos</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every other major tech company and electronics manufacturer is struggling with VR right now. An entire freaking <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> game came to Meta Quest 3 this month and nobody even remembers because virtual reality is a black hole that just sucks up money and makes people nauseous. So of course that means its the perfect time for Nintendo to get back into the market for VR headsets. While Meta and others pivot to augmented reality wearables, I fully expect Nintendo to unveil a 5-pound VR helmet shaped like a mushroom that lets you watch Netflix inside your <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>house. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-recommend-id="image://7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="597" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nobuhiro Imagawa</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-recommend-id="image://7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="597" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If there’s one company that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Reggie/status/1760728487114232002&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Reggie/status/1760728487114232002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will never cave to peer pressure</a></span>, it’s Nintendo.
