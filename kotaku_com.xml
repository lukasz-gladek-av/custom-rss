One notable feature that isn’t explained at all are the handful of giant vehicles you can briefly take over. It doesn’t take long to figure out that driving into the large question mark opening on their backside is key to controlling them, but none of that matters if you can’t find any to begin with. Read on for a handy breakdown on where to find every transforming vehicle.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196698" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="196698,195719,196572" data-current="196698"><div><p>Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22254.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h78848"><a id=""></a>Where to find Semi-Trucks</h2><figure id="" data-id="97c1eee0a9821de5386044c59c54364b" data-recommend-id="image://97c1eee0a9821de5386044c59c54364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Semi-Truck that says Mario Kart on its side drives on a bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Semi-Truck that says Mario Kart on its side drives on a bridge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97c1eee0a9821de5386044c59c54364b" data-recommend-id="image://97c1eee0a9821de5386044c59c54364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Semi-Truck that says Mario Kart on its side drives on a bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The one you’ve likely seen the most is the Semi-Truck. This is the biggest NPC vehicle by far. It stands out with its two containers that display <em>Mario Kart</em> in large red letters. <strong>Semi-Trucks are typically encountered on wide paved roads with multiple lanes.</strong> I’ve often seen them in connecting races with Toad’s Factory as well as the Golden Gate Bridge lookalike that connects Crown City and Faraway Oasis.</p><p>The standard circuit races don’t feature long stretches as much, so you won’t see any of these unless you’re driving between tracks. No need to worry about the sanctity of an old-fashioned race ruined by an obnoxiously fast automobile.</p><p>Another way to drive Semi-Trucks, as well as the other vehicles we’ll be covering, is to take on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">P-Switch Challenges</a></span>.

Pushing the stick up will plunge the nose of the boat into the water, while pushing the stick down will lift the nose up. Alternating between the two can help you soar above big waves.</p><h2 id="h78850"><a id=""></a>Where to find Helicopters</h2><figure id="" data-id="a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-recommend-id="image://a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-recommend-id="image://a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Special vehicles only get rarer from here. First up is the Helicopter, which is easy to spot in the air thanks to their chunky orange design. Bear in mind that these are separate from the tiny yellow MKTV helicopters that spectate races. <strong>Helicopters fly in a preset loop, so the best way to take one over in Free Roam is to follow it until it lands for a short period.</strong></p><p>Finding them during a race is also a mixed-bag. They’re not located in similar environments the way Semi-Trucks and Speedboats are. I’ve also seen more variance in how they’re presented, such as being an integral part of the race from DK Spaceport to Peace Stadium. Conversely, you can find one hidden behind a building when racing between Mario Bros. Circuit to Toad Factory. </p><p>Controls for the Helicopter also make full use of your Joy-con’s stick, and in proper inverted orientation for flight: Moving it up will make the Helicopter descend, while moving it down makes the Helicopter climb up.</p><h2 id="h78851"><a id=""></a>Where to find UFOs</h2><figure id="" data-id="36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-recommend-id="image://36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-recommend-id="image://36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That brings us to the last and rarest of the bunch–the UFO. I’ve yet to see this one during an actual race, although it does appear randomly in the Free Roam mode. Keep an eye on the sky and you just might see this saucer with colorful lights hovering by. <strong>UFOs typically stay in motion, but following one for long enough will make it come down to the ground and allow you to drive into its tractor beam to take it over.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You don’t have to rely on luck to find one out in the wild. There is at least one UFO that remains idle in the Free Roam mode and resets after you’ve interacted with it. <strong>This stationary UFO can be found on a cliff overlooking the river between Dry Bones Burnout and Mario Bros. Circuit.</strong> More specifically, it’s on the cliff to the left of the great staircase that leads towards the Dry Bones Burnout area. Follow the mountainside left until you can drive up the slope and see a set of torches and a metal fence. Drive along the path to find the UFO, a couple of cows, and a Nabbit to catch.</p><p>Controls for the UFO are similar to the Helicopter, with the stick controlling both descension and ascension. One standout difference is that pressing the R button will enable the tractor beam. You can use this to pick up everything from other cars, coins, and even enemy NPCs.</p><p>Even if the open world can feel bare at times, <em>Mario Kart World</em> has a lot of fun interactables and secrets to discover. Keep exploring the environment and the tracks themselves! You never know where any large vehicles might be available.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-semi-truck-ufo-helicopter-1851786066]]></content:encoded>

But when I die, if there is a big oasis in the sky waiting for me, I’ll be happy to meet up with old family and friends. And then I’ll ask them where the room is that contains all the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766">(good) <em>Tony Hawk</em> games</a></span>. If heaven is truly paradise, a place where I’ll be happy forever, I expect <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. They are some of the best video games ever made, blending snappy controls, fun level design, and awesome music into an incredible skateboarding experience that I’ve always enjoyed since I was a young boy.</p><p>And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-demo-review-huge-combos-million-points-bam-ps5-1851784238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-demo-review-huge-combos-million-points-bam-ps5-1851784238"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em></a></span>, the latest entry in the franchise, continues the franchise’s history of delivering pure, concentrated joy, one kickflip and combo at a time. Sure, some changes might ruffle feathers, and I ran into one too many bugs, but<em> THPS 3+4</em> overcomes its mistakes and has become one of my favorite games of 2025.</p><h2 id="h78918"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4?</em></strong></h2><p>If you’ve never played a <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>game before, let me explain how these things work. You have a collection of levels and each has goals, like score a high number of points or collect a certain number of items. You have two minutes to complete these goals, but you can try as many times as you like. Completing enough goals unlocks new levels to skate. Do everything you can, and you unlock more goals that are harder. </p><p>And that’s basically it. It’s a shockingly simple formula, but it works because it adds<em> just enough </em>tension. Each two-minute run is a mad dash to complete a specific goal, reach a certain area, or find that last item you desperately need. Every crash or mistake in a two-minute run in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804"><em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span> feels painful as you lose some time.</p><p>However, the two-minute timer, which was a key part of the first three games, wasn’t a feature in <em>THPS 4.</em> Instead, that game used a semi-open world structure, letting players complete various goals as they saw fit in bigger levels than those in past games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836">All of that is gone in the new remake</a></span>. As someone who didn’t play much <em>Pro Skater 4</em>, I don’t mind the remake taking levels from that game and remixing them into the classic two-minute format. But I also get that for some people, this is a huge change that ruins half of <em>THPS 3+4’</em>s package.</p><p><em>THPS 3+4</em> does offer the option to increase the run timer to as high as 60 minutes, which sort of recreates the laidback, open-world vibes of the original<em> THPS 4</em>, though it likely won’t be enough for people who consider the fourth entry in the skateboarding series their favorite.</p><p>It’s not just how you play the levels that has changed in the remake, as the very levels themselves have received big graphical updates, and here, the changes are almost all positive. All of the levels in<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 </em>are filled with new details, high-res textures, and improved models, making them feel more alive than in the old games. But developer Iron Galaxy (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925">who worked on the PC port of <em>THPS 1+2</em></a></span>) was careful to make sure the classic levels still feel great to skate and aren’t too visually busy or messy. You can still clearly see ramps, rails, collectibles, and more. </p><p>This is key in a game where you are often moving very fast in the middle of some huge combo and have to make decisions with little time to think. I never experienced a moment in the remake where I was confused about a piece of the level or what was skateable.</p><h2 id="h78919"><a id=""></a><strong>Something new, please</strong></h2><p>Interestingly, Iron Galaxy has created three new levels in <em>THPS 3+4.</em> One is a large dilapidated waterpark, another a movie studio, and the other places you inside of a pinball machine played by Tony Hawk. </p><p>I was concerned that these levels might not be able to hold their own next to the classic parks. Thankfully, Iron Galaxy nailed it. The waterpark-themed area feels like something original <em>THPS </em>devs Neversoft (a studio killed by Activision) would have created back in the PS2 days. Likewise, the pinball level injects some more absurdity into the collection in a way I really appreciated and which is true to the series. I mean, the first game included an Area 51-like level with a UFO and an alien. Oh, and the pinball level includes a very nice nod to original devs Neversoft. Finally, the movie studio level feels so much like an original park that I forgot to include it in the first draft of this review. </p><p>Speaking of changes, <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4’</em>s soundtrack isn’t just the same songs from the old games. Again, like the changes made to<em> THPS 4</em>’s levels, some fans won’t like that most of the old songs are gone. But they’ve been replaced by a soundtrack filled with bangers, including new songs from artists featured in the original <em>THPS 3</em> and <em>THPS 4. </em>It makes the package feel less like a nostalgic retread and more like a new game. It’s not. It’s still very much a remake, cashing in on nostalgia. But when I was playing one of the new parks, listening to new music, and playing as one of the many new skaters included in the game alongside old <em>THPS</em> vets, I found myself enjoying something I didn’t expect to have in 2025: A new <em>Tony Hawk</em> game. A good one, too. What a wonderful treat buried in this fantastic remake.</p><p>For fans who like to get creative, <em>THPS 3+4 </em>features a very powerful skatepark creator that lets you build basically any kind of level you want. And you can share them across all platforms, too. People are already recreating levels from other <em>Tony Hawk</em> games, and I’ve spotted at least one Mario-inspired track, too. If enough talented creators pick up <em>THPS 3+4</em>, I might have an endless number of new levels to skate, complete with custom goals and collectibles. The remake also supports online play. So you and a few friends can free skate together on a user-created remake of<em> Doom</em>’s E1M1. What a world we live in! There’s also a create-a-skater option, but these can’t be shared online.</p><h2 id="h78920"><a id=""></a><strong>Happiness is a skateboard</strong></h2><p>I’m realizing that I’m nearly done with this review, and I’ve not mentioned yet how skating feels in <em>THPS 3+4</em>. That’s because it’s just so perfect that I don’t have much to add beyond that. It takes what was created for <em>THPS 1+2 </em>and builds on it ever so slightly, but without breaking anything. Skating around a level, even in free skate mode with no goals or timers, is a joyful experience. It just feels so damn good. I always felt in control as I skated, and tricks felt snappy and responsive. Popping a random kickflip on my way to a goal never failed to make me feel a jolt of endorphins firing off in my brain. I have no notes to share about skating in <em>THPS 3+4.</em> It’s very good. It makes me happy. I love it.</p><p>What I don’t love are some of the bugs I encountered while playing <em>THPS 3+4</em>. None of them were game-breaking, but sometimes I’d have my screen go black or the camera get stuck in a weird spot. A quick level reset usually fixed these problems, but some screen tearing on Xbox continued to happen when booting up a level. Performance remained solid, but it was a small annoyance I spotted over and over. Hopefully, a future patch can fix some of these bugs and the tearing issue.</p><p>Even if the issues are never patched,<em> THPS 3+4 </em>is still a fantastic game. If you’ve enjoyed playing <em>Tony Hawk</em> games in the past, then you should check this thing out ASAP. While the changes to <em>THPS 4</em>’s levels might disappoint some, the new music and levels are rad, and the skating feels as perfect as ever. If that gaming room in heaven exists, it better have a copy of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4.</em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124]]></content:encoded>

The repair experts—who champion repairability, sustainability, and quality—didn’t mince words about Nintendo’s new and expensive controller. </p><p>For example, it’s “absurdly” difficult to replace the controller’s built-in battery, which will eventually fail—like all batteries—and will need to be replaced. To do so, you have to do all of this: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Remove the top plastic face plate held down by tons of adhesive to reach seven screws. Then remove finicky plastic wedge sections. Then, using more force than expected, yank off the two thumbsticks. Next, remove more screws. Then remove another plastic covering. After that, remove the bumpers. Then take out more screws and disconnect the rumble packs. Finally, remove a few more hidden screws, and now you can remove the internal guts of the controller and reach the battery pack.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, that’s a lot of work to simply replace a permanently dead battery. And to reassemble the controller, you have to source your own adhesive to reinstall the front plate properly, or it will rattle while gaming. </p><p>And it gets <em>worse</em>. To remove the joysticks completely is a “pain in the ass” and requires more digging into the controller’s guts. And what iFixit found in there is alarming: some very low-profile joysticks that are prone to drifting. What’s more, the sticks appear to be using the same components found in the cheaper Joy Cons. The only good thing iFixit had to say about the controller was how easy it is to replace the headset jack. </p><p>The company suggests gamers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-controllers-wireless-wired-pro-1851784358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-controllers-wireless-wired-pro-1851784358">buy third-party controllers</a></span> that contain easier-to-access batteries and better thumbsticks, like the Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit. “A cash grab riding high on the Nintendo brand” is how iFixit summed up the Pro Controller 2. And yeah, seems like it. While the controller feels great in your hands and has some nifty extra buttons, it seems it’s far from being “Pro” grade hardware. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pro-controller-piss-poor-stick-drift-ifixit-1851786109]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> had a black-and-white option called Kurosawa Mode. The tribute to the legendary film director was meant to add a vintage aesthetic and heightened gravity to the samurai adventure’s panoramic vistas and cinematic showdowns, to varying levels of success. To be honest, I don’t think it worked that well. It felt more like an Instagram filter gimmick than anything else (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-kurosawa-tribute-is-more-than-skin-d-1844555620&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-kurosawa-tribute-is-more-than-skin-d-1844555620">though others really liked it</a></span>). <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-protagonist-atsu-wolf-ps5-1851657667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-protagonist-atsu-wolf-ps5-1851657667">the PlayStation 5 sequel out this fall</a></span>, is getting a dedicated lo-fi beats mode.

The lo-fi beats mode was arranged by <em>Cowboy Bebop </em>and <em>Samurai Champloo </em>director Shinichirō Watanabe. Based on the brief preview, it sounds not unlike what you might get by streaming a lo-fi beats playlist on the PS5 Spotify app in the background while playing the game. This one just happens to be incorporated directly into it, and with Watanabe’s input, it will hopefully include some unique tracks that complement the open-world exploration and fighting taking place on screen. </p><p>It’s another gimmick, sure, but unlike the Kurosawa mode, it’s not being used as a visual shorthand to impart unearned meanings and depth to the game’s world, characters, and story. Instead, it’s a nod to the way people actually play big open-world games full of backtracking and side content. For every dramatic scene, emotional relationship, or thematically rich detail, there are hours, sometimes dozens, spent doing fun, weird, and extremely repetitive gamer shit. While immersive environments and organic exploration are part of the appeal of the open-world genre, so too is the <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>-like serenity and satisfaction of methodically cleaning up every enemy camp and collectible icon on the map. </p><p>Lots of people already listen to other stuff while doing this busywork. Sometimes it’s turning the game’s soundtrack off and putting on other music. Sometimes it’s catching up on five-hour-long podcasts. Some people even watch other shows and movies entirely during these activities. Sony designed an entire $200 accessory exactly for this purpose called the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770">PlayStation Portal</a></span>. It sold unexpectedly well. The lo-fi beats mode doesn’t just accept this, it embraces it by trying to add<em> Ghost of Yotei</em>’s own bespoke take on the practice. </p><p>This is basically how radio stations function in the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series. Zipping around Rockstar’s cities would be completely different without the deep catalog of licensed tunes players can flip through while getting to the next mission marker or dodging the cops. More games deserve them, whether they make fictional sense or not. Who knows if <em>Yotei</em>’s lo-fi beats mode will be as good. Fans are hoping for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wK27xW4OFI&amp;list=RD2wK27xW4OFI&amp;start_radio=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wK27xW4OFI&amp;list=RD2wK27xW4OFI&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least one Nujabes track</a></span>, among others. But it’s a worthwhile acknowledgement of the way people actually engage with games.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-tsushima-2-cowboy-bebop-lofi-1851786114]]></content:encoded>

It’s not often I get to put on that old hat for this job, but watching professional musicians react in real time to some of the bonkers compositional choices Fox makes in <em>Deltarune</em>’s soundtrack has been a marriage of two of my passions. The first time I heard “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1RK1m7qvc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f1RK1m7qvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Third Sanctuary,”</a></span> one of the incredible tracks from <em>Deltarune</em>’s latest chapters, was when a video of game music cover band <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzU4BlZcS8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GzU4BlZcS8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lame Genie’s</a></span> drummer, Kyle Sawaia, blind reacting to its odd, shifting time signature, crossed my For You page.</p><p>First off, props to Sawaia for keeping up with those time signature changes on the fly. Second, Fox’s compositions didn’t need to go that hard, and yet he did it anyway. I still don’t really know the context for when this track plays, but it is not only a compositional feat; it also evokes a frantic, emotional battle between two tragically opposing forces. Is that what’s happening when you hear the song in-game? I have no idea, but hearing it out of context only made me want to boot up the game more to find out.</p><p>Lame Genie isn’t the only group of musicians in awe of “The Third Sanctuary” and the rest of <em>Deltarune</em>’s incredible soundtrack. Dozens of reactions from musicians have been sprouting up on TikTok and YouTube.</p><p>I’m the type of person who can listen to a song hundreds (if not thousands) of times on loop without getting tired of it, but eventually you do lose that initial awe you feel when you hear something for the first time. Watching others experience something is about as close as I get to feeling that again, which is why I’ve started watching more reaction videos to music and other media. In cases like <em>Deltarune</em>, musicians reacting to it drew my attention to something I hadn’t really been paying attention to. Most of my exposure to Fox’s music has been through his work on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1v1sAYXQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1v1sAYXQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon </em>franchise</a></span>, but it’s nice to be reminded that he’s cooking when he’s working on his own stuff, too.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/deltarune-ost-soundtrack-music-third-sanctuary-reaction-1851786110]]></content:encoded>
