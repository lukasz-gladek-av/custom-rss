              <p>The homestretch of the 2025 holiday shopping season is going to be full of surprises, flash deals, and more as manufacturers pull out all the stops to hit their year-end numbers. That’s good news for shoppers, as anyone on the hunt for a great new smartwatch will see when they notice this Amazon deal on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/">One of the best new wearables of 2025, the big 46mm model of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is at its all-time low price right now, just $400.</a></p>
<p>Amazon’s red-flagged this 20%-off deal with a big “selling fast” sign, which could very well mean a rapidly shrinking inventory that could cause the deal to vanish as suddenly as it appeared. Not surprising, considering how the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is one of the best Android smartwatches at its original $500 price point, and now it’s $100 under that number.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Shape Shifter</h2>
<p>One of the cool features of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is that it’s designed to take on an elegant, traditional look, complete with a detailed rotating bezel that directs you to your apps, and a face that looks like a luxury chronograph even when you get up close to it. With that face, the beautiful stainless steel bezel and crown, and a black eco leather and band, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is perfectly at home on a date or at a formal occasion.</p>
<p>Its best work, of course, happens when you’re active, and in need of a reliable health and workout tracker with a robust suite of apps and features. It has a built-in Running Coach feature that takes into account your age, weight, heart rate, and even your oxygen level as you run, keeping you at a pace that works for both your fitness and training goals and your overall health. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic also has one of the better Sleep Coaching features of any midrange smartwatch, along with helpful metrics that aren’t commonly found in smartwatches like Vascular Load readings to track the amount of stress on your heart, and an Antioxidant Index that tracks the level of antioxidants in your body to help inform your food and lifestyle choices.</p>



<h2>Smart, Watch</h2>
<p>Any Samsung Galaxy smartwatch is going to come loaded with the best smart tech and interactivity with the rest of the Samsung universe. That means Galaxy AI and Google Gemini to serve as your hands-free assistants on the go whenever you need something, instant updates from your calendar and any other app you want to keep abreast of, and of course seamless connections to the Samsung family of smartphones, wireless earbuds, tablets, and laptops.</p>
<p>Call this Amazon deal one of the better somewhat-last-minute finds of the holiday shopping season. But whatever you call it, do it soon, because t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/">he 46mm Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is flying out of inventory faster than anticipated at its all-time low price of $400.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro 3 Drops Below Its Black Friday Price, Now as Cheap as the Pro 2 on Sale]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-airpods-pro-3-is-now-as-cheap-as-the-pro-2-sale-price-and-even-lower-than-its-black-friday-deal-2000652626</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple unveiled its latest pair of earbuds – the Apple AirPods Pro 3 – in September this year, and our audio experts loved the upgrades these brought. They launched at the standard $249 price, but we just spotted a deal that lets you pick them up for less today.</p>
<p>Amazon has now dropped the AirPods Pro 3 to $199, after taking 20% off, bringing the pair back to its lowest price ever. All shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, and placing your orders today can help you get them just in time for Christmas. If you’ve been meaning to upgrade your audio gear, or surprise a music lover in your life this holiday season, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Sound, Better ANC Capabilities</h2>
<p>These look quite similar to AirPods Pro 2, but feature a slightly redesigned shape with new foam-infused silicone ear tips for a better fit. The new acoustic architecture gives sound quality a boost, delivering rich, deep audio that lets you enjoy your favorite tracks and podcasts with detailed clarity. It lets you feel every instrument, with vivid vocals like never before.</p>
<p>Active noise cancellation capabilities have improved, too, as this pair is capable of removing up to 2x more unwanted noise than AirPods Pro 2; great for when you want to stay fully immersed in the moment with your favorite track playing. The ANC mode works well when you don’t want background sounds to distract you. You can enable it when you’re working in a busy cafe or trying to focus on an important task in the office. Of course, this level of noise blocking doesn’t work for every situation – sometimes it’s better to stay present and aware of what’s happening around. For that, there’s the transparency mode, which lets some ambient sound in.</p>



<p>Regardless of the mode, AirPods Pro 3 customize the sound signature for your unique ear geometry and fit with its next-generation Adaptive EQ. What’s more, these protect your hearing health, too. You can take an at-home hearing test that checks your hearing in a broader range of everyday conditions, or use the pair as a hearing aid when you need the voices around you amplified. Those often exposed to loud environmental noise can put them on to prevent hearing loss as well. Other health features include heart rate sensing, which monitors your heart rate, plus calories burned for up to 50 different workout types.</p>
<p>Another solid selling point is the Live Translation feature, which uses Apple Intelligence to offer real-time translation for face-to-face conversations around the world. Basically, the earbuds pick up on what someone is saying and translate it instantly, letting you reply in your preferred language using your iPhone or their AirPods. As for the battery life, you’ll enjoy up to 8 hours of listening on a single charge with Active Noise Cancellation on, and up to 10 hours in Transparency using the Hearing Aid feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">This deal brings the price of this feature-packed pair to $199, from $249</a>. It’s a big discount, sure, considering how these just launched, it’s still a welcome drop. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly before it wraps up. Ordering now will also help you enjoy free shipping with your purchase!</p>
