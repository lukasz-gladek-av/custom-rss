Arrowhead Game Studios might take some time before kicking off whatever it has planned to let players catch their breath. Maybe the development team is lining up a revenge campaign, or maybe there’s still another shoe to drop and Super Earth isn’t quite in the clear after all. A new president? In this economy? Maybe they’re just an Illuminate plant after all, ready to control Super Earth from within. The beauty of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s fascist space satire is that nothing is ever quite out of the question. </p><p>May kicked off one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s biggest balance patches and content updates in some time, including a new Warbond battle pass with additional melee weapons and the ability to level up and customize most of the shooter’s guns. I wouldn’t bet on any other big updates anytime soon. That said, Summer Game Fest is just around the corner and Arrowhead used host Geoff Keighley’s last big gaming showcase to announce the addition of the Illuminate to the fray. Who knows what’s in store for the second half of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s second year?</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
