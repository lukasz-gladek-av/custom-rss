French studio Sandfall Interactive—the devs behind this stylistic turn-based RPG—set a record for the show winning in nine separate categories including Game of the Year.

However for a limited time, Amazon is selling it for an 8% discount. This shaves the price down by $50, bringing it to just $600.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s take a quick detour into the Xbox Series X’s price history. Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the former of which was priced at just $500. Back in May, Microsoft announced the company would be increasing the console prices, which raised the Series X by a whole $100 to $600. Then just a couple months back, they did it again—by $50 to $650. This might just be the only console generation to see it’s systems go up in price rather than down. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">So with all that said, this discount does save you $50, by bringing the Xbox consoles back down to it’s Spring and Summer MSRP.</a></p>
