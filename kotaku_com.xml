              <p>If you haven’t ever used a curved monitor, it may feel like it’s just a gimmick. As an curved display gamer myself, I can assure you it’s so much more. When sitting at the right angle and distance, the curvature really sucks you in. Prices have been coming down over the pas few years too so they’re really not too much to add to your gaming desk. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3840/">The Alienware 34 curved gaming monitor right now is 20% off too. It’s listed on Amazon at $400, but with the discount, it comes down to just $320.</a> That’s an extra $80 you get to keep in your bank account.</p>

<h2>Designed for Gamers</h2>
<p>The Alienware monitor measures in at a massive 34 inches. It’s ultra-wide and comes in at a curvature of 1500R. This better reflects the way we perceive our surroundings through our eyes. Our environment isn’t just in front of us, it’s all around us. As overused as the term has becomes, a curved display like this one really does allow your gaming to feel more immersive.</p>
<p>The display is working with a QHD resolution of 1440p and maximum refresh rate of 180 Hz. You can expect smooth and clear responsive gameplay with a low response time of 1ms. AMD FreeSync Premium and VESA Adaptive Sync help improve performance and eliminate screen tearing while you game.</p>
<p>I think we all know at this point staring at a bright screen for hours on end isn’t exactly&nbsp;<em>good</em> for you. If you like to marathon gaming session, the Alienware curved display comes with hardware-based tools in its dedicated console to limit blue light. This can help reduce eyestrain during those long hours of play or work while still preserving a wide depth of color.</p>



<p>Breaking down the various ports and slots, along the read you’ll find two HDMI ports along with one DisplayPort. This will let you connect multiple sources to your Alienware monitor at once. You can use it primarily for your gaming PC but also choose to hook up a console like your Nintendo Switch 2. Just hop between input instead of having to disconnect and rearrange anything on your desk. The display also has two USB-A ports. The display makes cable management simple in its stand design.</p>
<p>Speaking of the stand, it’s fully adjustable. Raise and lower it or tilt the screen toward you with ease. The footprint base is small to save space on your desk despite the massive size of the screen itself.</p>
