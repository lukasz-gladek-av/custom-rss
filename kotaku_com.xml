              <p>A smattering of classic<em> Final Fantasy</em> games are now available to buy and play via Good Old Games. It’s the first time any games from Square Enix’s popular RPG franchise have been made available on GOG, and to celebrate, the newly added titles are currently on sale.</p> <p>On January 29, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/four_iconic_final_fantasy_titles_are_here">GOG announced</a> that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/final_fantasy">four <em>Final Fantasy</em> games were now available on the PC gaming storefront</a>. If you were expecting the first four entries into the series to be the first ones to arrive on GOG, you’ll be in for a surprise when you look below to check out the list of FF games added today.</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy III (3D Remake)</em> – $6.40 ($16)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake)</em> – $6.40 ($16)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy VIII – Remastered</em> – $8 ($20)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy IX </em>– $8.40 ($21)</li> </ul> <p>GOG says these entries “represent different eras of the series” which might help explain the scattershot release. But I guess you gotta start somewhere? All four <em>Final Fantasy</em> RPGs on GOG are also part of the store’s fantastic <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Good Old Game preservation program</a>, ensuring they will work on modern PCs for years to come, even if Square Enix removes them from sale or doesn’t want to update them in the future, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-warcraft-1-2-classic-remaster-drm-preservation-1851711097">something that has happened before</a>.</p> <p>“Few video game series have shaped the medium quite like <em>Final Fantasy,”</em> said GOG in a news post on Thursday. “For decades, it has defined storytelling in games, pushed technical and artistic boundaries, and created worlds and characters that resonate far beyond the screen. Today, we’re proud to announce that four landmark entries in the franchise are coming to GOG!”</p>

 <p>All four <em>Final Fantasy</em> games are available now. I expect more will be added in the future. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-caught-using-ai-generated-artwork-2000663836">Now, go tell GOG to stop using gross AI art for banners</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-goes-all-in-on-portable-power-station-clearance-river-2-pro-generator-drops-40-with-a-5-year-warranty-2000663939</link>
            <guid>1419784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Investing in a power station can be a smart decision if you’re often out and about or want to have a backup option during outages. The best options out there offer multiple ports and a reliable battery life, but they often don’t come cheap. That, however, is changing today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Right now, you can snag the EF Ecoflow River 2 Pro portable power station for just $315 at Amazon, after the retailer knocked 40% off its usual $529 price tag.</a> The offer is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon. Grab yours now, before Amazon decides to shoot the price back up (which can be any moment now).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for a Wide Range of Devices</h2>
<p>The River 2 Pro weighs just 17.2 lbs and features a built-in handle, both of which make it easy to carry the power station around. You’re getting a total of 11 ports, including four AC outlets, one USB-C port, three USB-A ports, two DC outlets, and one car outlet. That’s more than enough to keep all your important devices powered in cases of emergency. Think plugging your smartphone, laptop, an electric blanket, a coffee machine, and lights – all at the same time, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>The output of up to 1600W makes the thing perfectly capable of running around 80% off all your appliances, even high-wattage ones. It can recharge your phone from 0 to 100% 57 times on a single charge, and your laptop for over 10. When at home, it keeps your electric blanket powered for 12 hours, your refrigerator for five, and even your PC for over an hour. That means you can rely on it to get work done during an unexpected outage, plus keep other essentials running for extended periods.</p>



<p>When it comes to recharging the power bank itself, that doesn’t take forever either. You can power it back up via an AC outlet, a solar panel, a Type-C cable, or your car. Using an AC outlet is the fastest option, juicing it back to 100% in just 70 minutes. A 220w solar panel will take around 3.5 hours, while plugging it into a 12v/24v 8A car outlet gets the job done in about nine hours. This flexibility comes in handy when you’re camping in the wild, traveling, or dealing with electricity supply issues at home. Additionally, the LFP battery cells are long-lasting, letting you recharge the River 2 Pro more than 3000 times before dropping to 80% capacity. For reference, that’s nearly 10 years of regular use. What’s more, the power station includes advanced BMS protection that monitors voltage, current, and temperature to ensure longevity. Basically, it’s made to support all your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Included in the box are the power station itself, an AC charging cable, a user manual, and a 5-year service for added peace of mind</a>. Altogether, the EcoFlow River 2 Pro portable power station is great for anyone looking to invest in a reliable power solution without putting a dent in their wallet. This deal makes the upgrade easier than ever. Just make sure you grab the offer before it’s too late.</p>

              <p>Working out with your favorite tunes in the background can really give you that boost of energy you need to get moving. If you’re tired of your current buds or over-ear headphones falling off when things get a bit intense, you need an open-ear option that’s designed specifically for workouts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6941/">Shokz makes some of the best options on the market, and you can grab its OpenMove headphones at a 38% discount at Amazon today.</a> This offer brings the price of this $80 option to just $50, saving you $30. All color options, including grey, blue, and pink, are discounted, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best. One thing to note here is that the deal is a limited-time one, so we’re not expecting it to last long. Grab it now to avoid paying the full price later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6941/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Secure Fit</h2>
<p>Open-ear bone conduction headphones feature a wraparound headband and sit outside the ear canal. These rest on your cheekbones just in front of the ears, and transmit sound through vibration to your inner ear directly. Your ear canal stays open to keep you aware of your surroundings, while the lightweight frame makes it easy to have the headphones on for longer periods.</p>
<p>The OpenMove headphones offer a secure fit with the wraparound titanium frame. Whether you’re taking a walk around the town or just running some early morning errands, these stay in place. They’re also ultralight at just 29g, which ensures all-day comfort. As for the performance, Shokz has packed OpenMove with a patented 7th-generation bone conduction technology that pushes deep dynamic stereo sound for all your favorite tracks. Everything from LoFi music to energy-packed songs and even podcasts comes through clearly.</p>



<p>There are dual noise-cancelling microphones that eliminate external noise while isolating yours. The result? Clear phone and video calls, even when you’re in a packed subway or a busy cafe. You won’t have to constantly repeat yourself or apologize for the background noise. Additionally, the open design keeps you aware of what’s happening around without having to take the headphones off completely.</p>
<p>Sweaty workout sessions or light rain won’t be a problem either, thanks to OpenMove’s IP55 rating. Battery-wise, a single charge offers up to 6 hours of continuous listening. It’s not massive, but it’s still enough to support you through daily workouts, runs, and walks. Recharging is made easy with the included USB-C cable, which juices them back up in no time.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to treat yourself to open-ear headphones that not just offer a stable fit but also deliver powerful sound, the Shokz OpenMove sport headphones are an excellent option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6941/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $80 for these, but you can pick one today for just $50.</a> Again, the offer won’t be around forever. It’s best to place your orders before it’s too late!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Miis Can Finally Be Gay (And Nonbinary)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-gay-nonbinary-nintendo-switch-2000664147</link>
            <guid>1419721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Since the wacky life sim series kicked off in 2009, Nintendo’s </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span> has been like a big, beloved dollhouse where players watch their Miis get into the weirdest relationships possible. There’s just been one caveat: until today, Miis have never been allowed to be gay.</span></p> <p><span>Just seconds into Thursday’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg"><i><span>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </span></i><span>Direct</span></a><span>, Nintendo confirmed that players will finally be able to make their Miis queer through a surprisingly inclusive settings menu that occurs during the usual Mii creation process. Players can pick each Mii’s “dating preferences,” allowing them to date and marry multiple genders (or none at all).</span></p>

 <p><span>Possibly more impressively was the game’s use of the word “nonbinary” as a third gender option, which comes as a surprise for fans—in recent Nintendo games like </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>, the developer has evaded the topic by including two ambiguous options called “styles” that are still tied to traditional perceptions of gender. Adding the term, and an entire third gender option, is a </span><i><span>massive </span></i><span>step forward for the developer.</span></p> <p><span>In 2014’s </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span>, Miis were forced to be heterosexual and be solely male or female, so queer players resorted to using various mods. Another common workaround for the marriage issue, and my personal favorite, was setting one Mii up as the other gender and just ignoring the game’s pronouns (and annoying little comments on them disliking any gendered clothes they wore).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664149">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nintendo’s decision to leave gay marriage out of </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span>, the first game in the series to be released outside of Japan, drew quite a bit of criticism. In 2014, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fighting-for-gay-marriage-in-a-nintendo-game-1572026032"><span>fans petitioned for Nintendo to add gay marriage</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-responds-terribly-to-gay-marriage-petition-1572973952"><span>Nintendo responded pretty harshly</span></a><span>. At one point, there was even </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rumor-nintendo-ending-gay-marriage-bug-in-popular-game-504266729"><span>a rumored bug</span></a><span> that allowed gay marriage, and a strange translation of some Japanese patch notes made fans believe Nintendo had cruelly patched it out.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Just a few days after its first statement, however, Nintendo circled back with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-apologizes-for-not-putting-gay-marriage-in-tom-1574185262"><span>a slightly more empathetic promise</span></a><span>: “We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Players have anticipated the addition of gay marriage to the game since then, so it wasn’t exactly a surprise. Still, after nearly 12 years of anticipation, it’s just a huge relief that we got some confirmation today (with the added bonus of a nonbinary option, which nobody seemed to expect). I’m not the only person who’s relieved after today’s announcement—the livestream’s comments were flooded with gay flag emojis, and a quick glance in the game’s Subreddit makes it pretty clear that </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tomodachilife/comments/1qq9fnw/we_wonnnnnn/"><span>everyone else is delighted</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>I personally cannot </span><i><span>wait </span></i><span>to have a more diverse island, and I’m honestly thrilled to make my poor little Miis get into some even messier relationships when </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</span></i><span> releases on April 16.</span></p>
