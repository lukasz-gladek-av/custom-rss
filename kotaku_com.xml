The event puts the spotlight on smaller projects ahead of Summer Game Fest season and returned this year with updates on a whopping 36 games, including world premieres for a few that look really cool. </p><p>There was news about 2019 action platforming hit <em>Katana Zero</em> and its long-promised DLC, as well as brand new reveals for upcoming releases. There was <em>Void/Breaker</em>, a frenetic roguelike cyberpunk FPS from Stubby Games that looks like it builds off of some of the ideas in the team’s 2022 FPS puzzle adventure<em> The Entropy Centre</em>. There was also <em>Frostrail</em>, a post-apocalyptic survival crafting shooter from Shiro Unlimited and FakeFish. Another one of those? Yes, but this one revolves around a train that serves as your home base, transportation, and salvation from the cold and the “horrifying abominations” hiding in it.</p><p>The most surprising announcement for me personally was the latest free DLC for <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. While the bullet hell roguelite getting more content is nothing new, this update is a crossover with Square Enix’s lesser known<em> SaGa</em> franchise. Out now, the DLC drops<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond"> <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em></a></span>’s characters into the game’s chaotic arcade adventure. What franchise collab should be next? I’m still holding out for <em>Mega Man</em>. You can watch the full showcase below or scroll through for a look at everything else announced during the 2025 Triple-i Initiative showcase. </p></div></div><div><p>Real ones know and have been waiting almost five years for a glimpse of what was once likened to <em>Katana Zero 1.5</em>. With “all new characters, levels, gameplay and story,” this “massive” DLC still doesn’t have a release date but sounds oh so close. </p></div><div><p>The high-speed shooter is coming later this year and offers weapon crafting, gun modding, and environmental destruction. An open playtest is currently running on Steam through April 24. </p></div><div><p>The first-person shooter is all about open-world survival crafting to upgrade the train that’s keeping you and your friends alive. It hits Early Access for PC in 2026.</p></div><div><p>11 Bit Studios’ latest project is about a space mission worker named Jan Dolski who must create alternate versions of himself with unique skills but shared memories in order to survive. It now has a release date of June 13, 2025.</p></div><div><p>A nightmarish life sim, <em>Neverway</em> features the work of <em>Celeste </em>and<em> TowerFall</em>’s pixel artist and the music of Disasterpeace who composed the mesmerizing soundscapes for both <em>Fez </em>and <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>.  That’s it. That’s all I needed to know. </p></div><div><p> If you guessed that <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</em> would feature the mining horde mode shooter’s mechanics with new run-based roguelike elements, you’d be correct. Players can sign up for a Closed Alpha happening now. </p></div><div><p>One of the better <em>Vampire Survivors</em> copycats now has a 1.0 launch date. After winning fans over in Early Access, the full version is coming out September 17, 2025. </p></div><div><p>The twee van-life sim about crafting and sustainability will feature a closed alpha on April 14. Upgrade your vehicle, grow crops, and explore a beautiful alternate world where hope still abounds. </p></div><div><p><em>SpeedRunners 2: King of Speed</em> was announced with a release window of 2025 for PC and 2026 for console. The <em>Nickelodeon All-Stars Brawl</em> team is making it, and for anyone unfamiliar with the original, the hook is the game’s 8-player platforming races with a battle royale-like “ever-shrinking ring of fire.”</p></div><div><p> A workshop apprentice goes on an adventure. Many 3D action-platformer hijinks ensue. Will there be collectibles in this modern re-imagining of a retro throwback? Players can find out when it hits PC and console in 2026. <br></p></div><div><p> Control cabin boy Sam and loyal husky Ellie in solo or co-op to explore an uncharted island and uncover a bleak mystery. Who’s ready to cry?!</p></div><div><p> But what is it exactly? I’ll let the devs explain. According to them, <em>Into the Fire</em> is “a disaster extraction survival with arcade elements.” Neat! Players can face volcanic demons in Dante’s Archipelago in Early Access later this year. </p></div><div><p>Arcade medieval army brawler<em> Tears of Metal </em>has a great art style and some really rad-looking combat. You can try the hack-and-slash roguelike online with friends in the current Steam beta running until April 17. </p></div><div><p><em> Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama</em> is the hit arcade roguelite’s latest free update featuring a cross over with Square Enix. It’s out on every platform right now. </p></div><div><p> The long-awaited strategy follow-up now has an Early Access launch window of summer 2025. I can’t wait. </p></div><div><p> Interstellar politics is about to get more complicated. A free summer update for<em> X4: Foundations </em>will add new strategic elements for alliance building, including sending agents out on missions to influence partners and rivals.</p></div><div><p> The escape room game lets you solve puzzles in Dracula’s castle or deep space starships. Players can go hands-on with the sequel now on Steam. </p></div><div><p> You’re stuck in a gross prison cell. Pay off your debt with nothing but an ATM and a slot machine. It’s coming to Steam later this year and also has a free demo available to try now. </p></div><div><p> The action-roguelike spin-off is getting a couch co-op mode for two players and content from <em>Dead Cells</em> sometime this summer. </p></div><div><p> The survival crafting Soulslike is getting a new Thralls of Twilight update in May as it continues its Early Access journey. </p></div><div><p><em> Olden Era</em> is a new entry in the beloved  turn-based strategy series. It’s being developed by<em> Iratus </em>makers Unfrozen and published by Ubisoft and takes players to the previously unexplored continent of Jadame. </p></div><div><p><em> Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> takes the shopkeeper roguelite into 3D in just a few months. The dungeon crawler will be starting out in Early Access. </p></div><div><p> The character action roguelite in which you transform into different characters to unleash powerful attacks hits Early Access this summer. </p></div><div><p>The next game from the maker of <em>Art of Rally</em> lets you drive classic off-roading vehicles through trails and scenic landscapes for the colorful, lo-fi escape we all need right now. </p></div><div><p> But horror fans may be enthused. Navigate a  post-catastrophic world where creatures disguise themselves as humans in a very <em>Night Trap</em> meets <em>Maniac Mansion </em>meets Aphex Twin kind of way. </p></div><div><p><em>The Forgotten Depths </em>is a free content drop out today that adds a new biome to the pixel art-looking combat crafting sim. <em>Necesse</em> is slated to leave Early Access this summer. </p></div><div><p> The top-down survival game is getting Invaders of Oakveil on April 28. Players will explore a new venomous area, collect poisonous weapons, and fight the  Serpent Queen Megara. </p></div><div><p> The narrative-driven adventure game has you use old cameras to explore a place outside of reality uncovering secrets, and probably dealing with past traumas, to make your way home. The music and art looks excellent. </p></div><div><p>“Embark on an epic quest as Ezekiel, a devoted young bishop of the god Sheol, who must recover the sacred Malkora and cleanse Antioch from heretics,” reads the plot summary. If the whole game looks and sounds as good as the trailer, sure!</p></div><div><p>The Dimension Update arrives June 2 for the construction management game. It adds a bunch of new features including a refined placement system, multi-floor platforms, and various quality-of-life improvements. </p></div><div><p>The next project from the makers of <em>Dorfromantik</em> is <em>Star Birds</em>. You lead spacefaring birds across the galaxy by automating systems on an asteroid. Its first demo is just a few months away. </p></div><div><p>It’s a roguelite city builder in which you harvest, build, mine, cook, brew, and grow in order to defend against invasions. You can lead the human or undead kingdoms, each rendered with an old-school 8-bit look. </p></div><div><p>In <em>Timberborn </em>Update 7 the post-apocalyptic beaver masses are taking to the skies and water-sealed tubeways. “By putting up the dirt in layers, they now can build hanging gardens, grow plants on their roofs, and even create tunnels and artificial caves.” It hits May 8.</p></div><div><p>The blacksmithing sim lands in Early Access on May 25. Run a medieval smithy from top to bottom, supervising ore shipments and selling the finished products. </p></div><div><p>  <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> will land sometime in 2025 and is boasting an all-star cast of composers when it does, with contributions from Kevin Penkin (<em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, <em>Made in Abyss</em>, <em>Florence</em>), Mason Lieberman (<em>Overwatch 2</em>, <em>Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical</em>,<em> League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>), Pete Lepley (<em>Wargroove</em>, <em>Sky Rogue</em>), and Yasunori Nishiki (<em>Octopath Traveler</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>).<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Calling this “Complete” does seem to imply that Naughty Dog is done making new games in the franchise. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-could-happen-if-the-stars-align-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6530741/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-could-happen-if-the-stars-align-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6530741/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And even Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann</a></span> has stated that he thinks there will not be more games in the series, though he doesn’t rule it out completely, “if the stars align.” Perhaps we’ll get a game that isn’t part of the Joel and Ellie saga, but features new characters in the same universe?</p><p>Regardless, I fully expect at remastered remake of these rereleased games just in time for the PlayStation 6. Everyone dies. Everyone pays taxes. Every <em>Last of Us</em> game gets released forever. Some things you can’t escape. </p><p> . <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
