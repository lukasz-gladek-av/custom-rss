            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span>Here’s a reminder to turn your television down and not yell so much when playing games online. Over this past weekend, police in Northern California received reports of possible gunshots and arrived on the scene to discover, thankfully, that it was just someone playing games too loudly with their window open.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span><a href="https://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/chico-police-respond-to-loud-video-game-mistaken-for-gunshots/article_456898e1-4925-41f0-a71e-fee8a012852a.html">As reported by <em>Action News Now</em></a>, police in Chico, California, received a call from a local resident who claimed to have heard “threatening words” as well as “pop sounds” that sounded an awful lot like gunshots. <em>ANN</em> says a heavy police presence arrived at the scene around 5:30 p.m. on Saturday to investigate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Police discovered that the situation wasn’t dangerous at all, just annoying. Apparently, a gamer in Chico was playing a video game at a very loud volume with their window open. No other details were shared about the incident.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Neither the report nor the police confirmed which game it was, but I’d assume a recently released FPS like <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Black Ops 7 </em></a>or <em>Battlefield 6.</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ActionNewsNow/posts/police-confirmed-that-reported-gunshot-sounds-in-chico-on-saturday-night-were-ac/1258647912960506/">Over on the news network’s Facebook page</a>, commenters are also curious if it was <em>BF6 or CoD.&nbsp;</em></span></p> <p><span>It’s a silly story with a not-horrible ending, which isn’t always the case <a href="https://kotaku.com/swatting-the-hip-new-griefing-trend-sends-the-cops-5838927">when gamers and police get involved.</a> We’ve seen far too many cases of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fatal-call-of-duty-swatter-pleads-guilty-to-51-charges-1830434368">SWAT teams being called on random gamers and Twitch streamers</a> by assholes. </span><span>Thankfully, it seems that if a SWAT-like team was called, it didn’t escalate into something more serious. </span></p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/guy-played-video-games-so-loud-the-cops-showed-up-2000647237]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Holiday shopping is on the rise, and if you haven’t grabbed a fun string of Christmas lights to brighten up your outdoor and indoor space, today is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/">Govee, a brand that offers some of our favorite smart lighting solutions out there, is now offering its outdoor-friendly, 164-foot Christmas Lights 2 for $130 on Amazon</a>. That’s after a sweet, straightforward 35% discount on the retail price of $200, thanks to an early Black Friday deal.</p>
<p>These are already high in demand on regular days, and the current discount makes them an even more popular pick. It’s best to grab yours before the stock disappears for good, which could be any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Generated Light Show</h2>
<p>These aren’t your average, golden string lights. The string comes with 500 LEDs, each of which has a built-in IC chip to realize single control. Govee adds white LED beads to the color mix for a brighter setting with high color accuracy. There are 16 million color options to choose from (you read that right), meaning you can have a different one every single day of the year and still have plenty left to explore. Go with neon green in the morning, red in the evening, and wind down with a subtle golden at night; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>If plain, solid colors start to feel boring, especially during festivities, there are over 130 animated lighting effects for every possible occasion. For instance, the Thanksgiving option features warmer colors for cozy gatherings and hearty meals, while the Christmas one brings brighter colors to lift the energy of the whole house instantly. You can switch colors and patterns, plus create your own effects when feeling a bit creative. Not sure what to go for? Share your vision with the Govee AI Lighting Bot, and it’s going to create one based on your preferences. You can even upload some images to give it an idea of the vibe you’re hoping to achieve. Say something like “Give me a dancing Christmas effect”, and wait for the ultimate showdown.</p>



<p>As for the installation, setting the lights up is fairly straightforward. The 164-foot length is enough to line the roof, wrap around your Christmas tree, or frame the main door. It’s ideal for most homes, but if you need another size, these lights also come in 66ft, 99ft, and 328ft size options. The prices vary, but almost all the options are going for less right now. Once you have the lights up, you can manage them using the dedicated smartphone app or through your voice with Alexa and Google Assistant. You can ask the voice assistants to turn the lights on/off, change the patterns, adjust the brightness, and more, without even getting up from your couch.</p>
<p>Finally, Govee has designed the lights to be both waterproof and dustproof. They can handle extreme weather conditions (rain, harsh sunlight, snow) like a champ, so nothing is going to dim that spark, pun intended.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5918/">The current Black Friday deal brings the price down to just $130, which is quite affordable considering all the features you’re getting.</a> Even though these are labelled as “Christmas lights”, you can use them all year round for every occasion, whether it’s birthdays, anniversaries, or even just casually at home. The brand is also offering plenty of its other top-rated lighting solutions for less, so now is a great time to stock up on both indoor and outdoor smart lights. Just be sure to act fast, as early deals tend to wrap up quickly.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-final-clearance-on-anker-iphone-charger-basically-giving-it-away-for-free-at-this-point-2000647203</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-goes-final-clearance-on-anker-iphone-charger-basically-giving-it-away-for-free-at-this-point.1364092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This Anker charging bundle has become the <strong>#1 bestselling charger on Amazon over Black Friday</strong> and the pricing explains the overwhelming popularity immediately. Apple asks for $20 for a single 20W charger that doesn’t even include a cable and forces separate purchases that drive total costs upward quickly.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">$11, down from $18, you’re getting here two complete 20W Anker chargers + two USB-C to USB-C cables</a> in a single package that costs less than one official Apple charger alone. Anker’s good reputation as an <strong>Apple-approved accessory manufacturer</strong> sold in the Apple Stores instills confidence that these chargers meet quality and safety standards without paying Apple Tax premiums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20W Fast Charging That Meets Apple’s Official Specs</h2>
<p>This 20W power output provides the <strong>fastest charging speed supported by the USB-C ports</strong> of the iPhone 15, 16, and 17 models-just like Apple’s own charger specifications. Compared to the old 5W adapters that came packaged with earlier iPhones, this wattage offers noticeably quicker charging: by up to 50% for most devices.</p>
<p>You will be able to charge your iPhone 17 to about 50% in roughly 30 minutes when paired with a 20W charging system. For phones supporting fast, seamless top-ups during daily routines or during stopovers at home between activities, the charging speed works just as well with iPads, Samsung phones, and other USB-C devices equipped with Power Delivery fast-charging protocols.</p>



<p>The compact<strong> dual-port design includes both USB-C and USB-A outputs</strong> to charge two devices at once with no compromise in speed and without occupying multiple wall outlets. A configuration like this proves to be a real asset in homes where wall outlets remain scarce and several family members fight for a chance to charge their devices.</p>
<p>Charge your iPhone through USB-C while powering AirPods, Apple Watch, or older Lightning devices via the USB-A port with the appropriate cables. The intelligent power distribution ensures that both ports deliver optimal charging speeds rather than splitting power inefficiently, which would slow both devices down.</p>



<p>Anker has several safety features including <strong>overvoltage protection</strong> to prevent excessive voltage from damaging connected devices, temperature control that reduces power output if overheating occurs, and short circuit protection to shut off power during fault conditions. Such protections count because many no-name low-cost chargers have inadequate safety implementations and poses the risk of fire or even device damage through poorly regulated power delivery.</p>
<p>The <strong>included 5-foot USB-C-to-USB-C cables</strong> are long enough to support comfortable device use while charging, from floor outlets to desks or bedside tables, without tight stretching. The length of the cable balances portability for travel and practicality for daily use at home, where often 3-foot cables can be frustratingly short.</p>
<p>At $11, the Anker 2-pack includes four pieces in total: two 20W dual-port chargers and two 5-foot USB-C cables, all at 41% below retail this Black Friday. Apple sells its single 20W charger sans cables for nearly double which makes Anker’s value proposition for buyers needing more than one charging point absurdly favorable.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-tab-s10-fe-drops-to-record-low-for-pennies-might-be-time-to-offload-that-ipad-now.1364089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung and Apple battle relentlessly across every product category from smartphones to laptops to tablets, with each company trying to outdo the other on features, performance, and ecosystem integration. The <strong>Galaxy Tab S10 FE launched just months ago</strong> as Samsung’s direct challenge to standard iPads and offers comparable performance and features at more aggressive pricing.</p>
<p>The <em>Fan Edition</em> designation indicates this model <strong>prioritizes value over bleeding-edge specs</strong>, and positions it as the sweet spot in Samsung’s tablet lineup where you get flagship features without paying flagship premiums. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5676/">At $359, down from $499, this 128GB/WiFi model has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday that undercuts not just the standard iPad but also Samsung’s own higher-tier Tab S10 models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5676/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Rivals iPads</h2>
<p>The <strong>10.9-inch LCD display at 2304 x 1440 resolution</strong> contributes to sharp visuals above the standard iPad resolution while matching the pixel density of more expensive tablets. You get an <strong>on-screen refresh rate of 90Hz</strong> that results in notably smoother scrolling, animations, and gaming compared to the 60Hz screens still common on tablets from rivals in this price range. This higher refresh rate makes daily interactions feel more responsive and fluid and reduces the subtle lag that plagues lower-refresh screens when you scroll rapidly through long documents or social media feeds.</p>



<p>The<strong> included S Pen stylus is a significant added value</strong> and allows handwriting, drawing, and precise input sans separate purchases like the Apple Pencil, which adds $129 to iPad prices. The pressure-sensitive tip and low latency make writing experiences that truly feel like pen on paper, rather than plastic on glass and encourages actual note-taking and sketching rather than awkward finger drawing</p>
<p><strong>Powered by the Exynos 1580 processor</strong>, it delivers ample performance for all multitasking, gaming and media consumption needs without thermal throttling and battery draining, issues that plagued mid-range tablet chips from yesteryear. It’s <strong>optimized by Samsung for smooth performance</strong> across productivity apps such as Microsoft Office, creative tools such as Adobe apps, and entertainment platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, and mobile games.</p>



<p>The<strong> IP68 rating for water resistance speaks to the exceptional durability</strong> for tablets that are normally kept away from water exposure. It certifies submersion up to 1.5 meters in water for up to 30 minutes, covers everything from kitchen spills to poolside use to bathroom entertainment without anxiety. Protection extends the tablet’s life by surviving accidents that would destroy unprotected devices.</p>
<p>It features a large-capacity cell and efficient power management<strong> for a battery life of up to 20 hours of mixed-use</strong>&nbsp;and covers several days of normal use between charges. Super Fast Charging reduces downtime when recharging becomes necessary, providing hours of use from brief charging sessions. The starting storage configuration is 128GB, <strong>with microSD expansion supporting up to 1TB additional capacity</strong> to ensure ample room for apps and documents.</p>
<p>At $359, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE gives you a 10.9-inch 90Hz display, Exynos 1580 processor, included S Pen with AI features, IP68 water resistance, a 20-hour battery, and expandable storage at 28% below retail this Black Friday. Fan Edition positioning delivers the optimal balance of features and pricing that makes premium tablet capabilities accessible without iPad premiums or flagship Galaxy pricing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-clears-32-165hz-gaming-monitor-odyssey-curved-display-now-goes-40-off-2000647195</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-clears-32%E2%80%B3-165hz-gaming-monitor-odyssey-curved-display-now-goes-40-off.1364053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 57-inch Odyssey G9 ultrawide monitor commands attention and premium pricing,<a href="https://kotaku.com/samsung-57-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitor-240hz-1ms-is-800-off-hardcore-gamings-holy-grail-at-a-record-low-2000646508"> even when sales roll around</a>, but not everyone wants or can accommodate a display that dominates entire desks and requires dedicated space planning.</p>
<p>Standard-sized desks deserve premium gaming monitors too, and the <strong>32-inch Odyssey G55C delivers flagship features</strong> in dimensions that fit normal workspaces without sacrificing immersion or performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/">At $199, down from $329, this QHD curved gaming monitor has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and became the <strong>best-selling model across Samsung’s entire Odyssey lineup</strong>. That combination of 1000R curvature, 165Hz refresh rate, and genuine HDR10 support at this aggressive discount explains why it’s so popular.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1000R Curvature That Matches Human Vision</h2>
<p>This <strong>2560 x 1440 QHD resolution packs 1.7 times more pixel density than standard 1080p displays</strong>&nbsp;and makes for noticeably sharper visuals where text stays crisp and game details remain clear during fast motion. As it is a sweet spot in resolution, it offers meaningful visual improvement over Full HD without the extreme GPU horsepower that 4K displays require to maintain high frame rates in demanding games.</p>
<p>Modern mid-range graphics cards handle QHD gaming comfortably at high settings, something that often forces compromise between visual quality and smooth performance if using 4K. Its wider aspect provides more horizontal screen real estate, which benefits both gaming and productivity by allowing the display of more content simultaneously, whether tracking enemies in competitive shooters or managing multiple windows during work sessions.</p>



<p>The <strong>aggressive 1000R curve radius comes closer to the natural curvature of human peripheral vision</strong> than, say, gentler curves at 1800R or even flat panels, making for immersive viewing that wraps content around your field of view. That tight curvature puts every part of the screen an equal distance from your eyes when properly positioned, minimising eye movement required to scan across the display while maintaining consistency in focus between centre and edges.</p>
<p>Racing games are dramatically better-the curved display creates peripheral awareness of oncoming corners and competitors. First-person shooters pick up situational awareness with better peripheral enemy detection. The effect of immersion proves most pronounced during longer gaming sessions, where the curved display pulls you into game worlds more effectively than flat monitors do, which maintain psychological distance between viewer and content.</p>



<p>The <strong>165Hz refresh rate ensures smooth motion rendering</strong> that eliminates the choppiness plaguing 60Hz displays when the game’s camera pans fast or the character is moving at incredible speeds. In competitive games, high refresh enables reduced motion blur and better target tracking to give you clear views of enemies in movement and quicker reaction capability when events catch you by surprise.</p>
<p>The <strong>response time of 1ms MPRT complements</strong> the high refresh by making sure pixel transitions are done fast enough to prevent ghost trails behind moving objects. FreeSync from AMD Radeon synchronizes display refresh with your GPU’s frame output and removes screen tearing for fluid visuals without the stutter that occurs when refresh and frame rates desync.</p>
<p><strong>HDR10 support extends the color range</strong> and contrast ratio beyond what standard dynamic range displays are capable of showing, revealing details in both shadows and highlights that SDR crushes into solid blacks or blown-out whites. Game scenes gain dramatic impact through deeper blacks, brighter highlights, and more saturated colors, making virtual worlds feel more alive and realistic.</p>
<p>At $199, the Samsung Odyssey hits that perfect sweet spot between immersion and practicality for standard desks, while the feature set compares well to premium monitors available for as much as twice the price.</p>

              <p>Valve’s cheapest Steam Deck model just got cheaper. The<span><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507"> Steam Deck LCD 256GB</a> will be 80 percent off for Black Friday 2025, making it somehow $20&nbsp;<em>less</em> than the portable gaming console that Nintendo released back in 2017.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Normally $400</a>, Valve’s three-year-old PC gaming handheld will be 20 percent off through December 1, making it just $320 to pick up compared to a new Switch after Nintendo raised the prices earlier this year over tariffs. It’s also $100 less than a Switch 2, which runs games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> better, but doesn’t have access to Steam’s ever-growing library of new weekly indie hits like this year’s<em> Megabonk</em>.</p> <p>Valve also ran this promotion for the LCD Steam Deck ahead of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/autumn-2025-steam-deck-sale-cheap-pc-gaming-handheld-2000627631">Autumn Steam Sale back in September</a>, suggesting to me that it’s looking to clear out stock as it focuses production on the superior but more expensive OLED models. The Steam Deck is out matched on specs by more recent PC gaming handhelds like the Rog Xbox Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go 2 but still offers the most bang for your buck.</p>

 <p>It might struggle with some newer high-end blockbusters, but even games like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>can run <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-deck-performance-worth-it-1851777121">surprisingly well</a>. Plus, Steam remains the day-one launch pad for Early Access games and all of the big hits from <em>Vampire Survivors</em> to <em>Balatro</em>.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Deck 2 is still just vaporware</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2-amd-magnus-apu-ps6-xbox-1851786832">As for a&nbsp; Steam Deck successor</a>, well, it doesn’t sound like Valve is planning on launching one anytime soon. “We’re really interested to work on what’s next for Steam Deck…the thing we’re making sure of is that it’s a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product,” Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">told <em>IG</em>N</a> earlier this month.</p>

 <p>That echoed comments he made back in 2023 tempering expectations of a hardware revision anytime soon. “I don’t anticipate such a leap to be possible in the next couple of years, but we’re still closely monitoring innovations in architectures and fabrication processes to see where things are going there,” he said.</p> <p>Sounds like nothing’s changed. The current Steam Deck should be Valve’s default at least for a couple more years.</p>
