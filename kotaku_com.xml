Floyd takes a lot of inspiration from those earlier examples by tasking players with specific challenges just to trigger a fight against him. The community has done an amazing job piecing together everything about this hidden ninja, but it can be a bit of an information overload for more casual players. We’re streamlining all the necessary knowledge and resources you need to fight <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s newest ninja and unlock some amazing rewards.</p><h2 id="h175410"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Prepare for Floyd</strong></h2><p>Both the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> community, and modder thethiny in particular, deserve all the flowers for figuring out so much of this. Without their continued findings and resources, it’s possible we still wouldn’t know how to fight this elusive boss.</p><p>The secret to meeting the obvious <em>Pink Floyd</em> referencing character revolves around 37 Floyd Challenges. <strong>You thankfully only need to complete ten to trigger the Floyd fight.</strong> The bad news is that it’s completely random which ones you need to do. Even worse, you’ll have to start all over with ten more randomized challenges if you fail to defeat him. Successfully completing a correct one will result in a pink “Floyd” notification popping up along with an accompanying guitar riff.</p><p>Once you’ve received a notification for the tenth, you’ll be thrust into a fight against the pink ninja with whichever set of characters you’re using. It takes place on a stage called The Field, which is based on the serene location shown in the announcement trailer. You have three opportunities to defeat him in a standard two-round match. Quitting out during or in-between matches will forfeit your chance entirely and require you to complete ten random challenges again. For this reason, <strong>it’s best to finish character-specific challenges first so you can do your final challenge with characters you’re used to</strong>. Losing against Floyd because you don’t know how to play someone you’re stuck with is not ideal.</p><p>The most efficient way to do that is to keep track of which ones you might have to do and how many you have left. I wholeheartedly recommend that you check out thethiny’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh5hLG2oi85zvyFvLkl4cCNViDRHX83y-Qn1LdlGozg/edit?gid=0#gid=0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh5hLG2oi85zvyFvLkl4cCNViDRHX83y-Qn1LdlGozg/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Challenges spreadsheet</a></span>, as well as their <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://floydtracker.thethiny.xyz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://floydtracker.thethiny.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Tracker</a></span>. The former lists every possible challenge and how to complete each. The latter monitors a few informative metrics, most importantly how many challenges you need to finish before the next fight will trigger.</p><p>If you’re looking for answers on your phone, or simply don’t want to bother with a spreadsheet, we’ve compiled an easy-to-read list. Try to remember which ones you’ve already done if you decide to take a break. This can get monotonous.</p><h2 id="h175411"><a id=""></a><strong>Every Floyd Challenge</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5cb1326037adb5228b9545a5617c9c8a" data-recommend-id="image://5cb1326037adb5228b9545a5617c9c8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Scorpion fighting another Scorpion in a match, with a Pink Floyd notification displaying on the left side of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Scorpion fighting another Scorpion in a match, with a Pink Floyd notification displaying on the left side of the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetherRealm Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cb1326037adb5228b9545a5617c9c8a" data-recommend-id="image://5cb1326037adb5228b9545a5617c9c8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Scorpion fighting another Scorpion in a match, with a Pink Floyd notification displaying on the left side of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Below is a list of every Floyd Challenge. <strong>All of them can be completed in single-player modes and a majority can be done in versus mode.</strong> Adjusting the AI difficulty all the way down to the easiest, or using a second controller, will make this a lot easier. The final five challenges need to be done in Story mode and Towers of Time, but the notifications won’t pop up until you’ve started another local Versus match.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-towers-of-time-mode-guide-1851664040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-towers-of-time-mode-guide-1851664040"><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s Towers Of Time Mode Isn’t Explained Well, So We Made It Simple</a></span></p><p>It is possible to finish multiple challenges at the same time. It will only show a single notification if this happens, which is why the aforementioned Floyd Tracker comes in handy here. If you’re using a second controller to cheese through these, the Floyd notifications can pop up on their side too. Ignore these, since they’re also completely random and don’t count towards your own total. Finally, I’ve bolded any of the challenges that will give you a notification during a match. Feel free to disregard them and move on if no notification pops up after you’ve done their task.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Total Disrespect</strong> - Taunt four times during a match.</li><li>Jumping Gets You Nowhere - Win without jumping.</li><li>Klean Sweep - Perform exactly 13 Sweeps in a match and win.</li><li>Get Over Here Already - Win as Scorpion and perform a Fatality or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-animality-animalities-finisher-inputs-1851662135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-1-animality-animalities-finisher-inputs-1851662135">Animality</a></span>.</li><li>Flipping Out - Flip your stance exactly 16 times in a match and win.</li><li>Up &amp; Away - Perform five uppercuts exactly in a match and win.</li><li><strong>No Elder God</strong> - Get the first hit while fighting against Raiden.</li><li>I Make The Rules - Get a Double Flawless as Liu Kang.</li><li>No Luna - Get a Double Flawless against Reptile.</li><li><strong>Fire &amp; Ice</strong> - Achieve a minimum 400 damage combo using Scorpion and Kameo Sub-Zero.</li><li><strong>Ice &amp; Fire</strong> - Achieve a minimum five-hit combo using Sub-Zero and Kameo Scorpion.</li><li>Perfect Kouple - Get a Double Flawless using Johnny Cage and Kameo Sonya.</li><li><strong>Get The Horns</strong> - While playing Shao Kahn and Kameo Motaro, activate your Fatal Blow and then press the Kameo button (R1/RB) during the start-up.</li><li>Hip Hop 4 Ever - Jump exactly 22 times during a match and win.</li><li>Yeet!!! - Throw your opponent exactly seven times during a match and win.</li><li>This Is Where You Fall Down - Lose to Johnny Cage with less than nine seconds left.</li><li>Timed Out - Lose by running out of time.</li><li>You Suck - Lose to Shao Kahn in the final round when he has Critical Health.</li><li>I’m Down Too - Win by spamming down 2 into the Klassic uppercut brutality.

He doesn’t have a Kameo assist and seemingly makes up for it with a hefty 1337 health pool. His AI difficulty will be set to Very Hard, although he does leave himself wide open with occasionally taunting.</p><p>Floyd primarily uses a combination of special moves from many of the series’ ninja characters. This includes Scorpion’s Spear, Sub-Zero’s Ice Ball, and Ermac’s Force Lift. What makes this all the more oppressive is that his versions of these moves are typically quicker and recover faster too. It’s very common to see him use these repeatedly in a combo, and chain them together as well. His sole original move, The Wall, summons a crystal that acts as a temporary wall that can easily corner you.</p><p>While this can be a difficult fight, he does have exploitable weaknesses! <strong>Just like any other AI you play against in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, Floyd doesn’t defend well against jump attacks.</strong> A lot of players have demolished him by spamming a short jump-kick-into-uppercut combo. He can occasionally use an anti-air and follow up with a combo of his own, but they never feel as devastating as his other combos. He seemed more likely to drop any combos that started from an anti-air as well, in my experience.</p><p>If you would rather not cheese through this fight, it’s still possible to beat Floyd fair and square. Chaining together special moves is how he inflicts the most damage. As simple as it sounds, playing more defensively is a viable strategy. When he uses meter to enhance his special moves, he’ll leave himself open after you’ve blocked or ducked under his attacks. Land some combos when the opportunities arise and then return to defense. <strong>The only time you should for sure go on the offensive is when he taunts you.</strong> It lasts a while and he won’t be able to block your attacks. This is a free hit moment that you can turn into a free combo.</p><hr><p>Defeating Floyd in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> doesn’t just net you mad respect for all the time you invested. The exclusive rewards include the gorgeous Field stage, a set of two pink palettes for the Scorpion and Sub-Zero kameo characters, and a handful of Floyd-themed Kombat Kards. There isn’t a way to unlock Floyd as a playable character, even if you trigger his fight repeatedly, but maybe he’ll return for the next entry.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While it doesn’t elaborate any further on which assets are made with AI and how, the confession has reaffirmed what some fans had been claiming for months. </p><p>The <em>Black Ops 6</em> slop controversy began last October, a week before the game released, with allegations <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LZ0kokKBQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LZ0kokKBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spreading on YouTube</a></span> of certain prestige emblems looking AI-generated.

Loading screens depicted hands with extra digits, a tell-tale sign of work produced by algorithms built on stealing other artists’ work, but not knowing how to count. One loading screen included a black glove with six fingers holding billiard balls. </p><p> The second was a zombie Santa holding up hand that had six fingers. Both were laughably egregious at the time, but also fostered fears that other less obvious examples might also have been AI-generated.

But if you’re looking for an easy-to-pick-up hero with more flexibility, there is plenty of fun to be had with Magik.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Damage Heroes, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>The young mutant is a powerhouse of a duelist who can deal substantial damage and steal health from enemies at the same time. Her kit is admittedly a bit all over the place, but we have the tips to help you master the Limbo ruler and bully the opposition.</p><h2 id="h174699"><a id=""></a><strong>You can dive in or be an off-tank</strong></h2><p>Magik has two prominent play-styles that can find success. The more popular strategy in my experience is using her as a dive character. This means using her Stepping Discs to teleport in from the sides or behind the enemy team, getting an elimination or two, and then returning to safety. I wouldn’t recommend taking on a Vanguard, but any <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-strategist-supports-best-worst-luna-snow-1851738627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-strategist-supports-best-worst-luna-snow-1851738627">support heroes</a></span> or lonely ranged attackers are perfect targets.</p><p>Another viable strategy is to play Magik as more of an off-tank, to keep enemies from focusing on your team’s Vanguards. The main difference is that you’ll be fighting on the frontline alongside your Vanguards. Feel free to mix it up occasionally and use your stepping stones for a quick dive on the opposing team as well.</p><h2 id="h174700"><a id=""></a><strong>Watch out for the damage falloff on her primary Soulsword attack</strong></h2><p>One of my favorite qualities about Magik is her sword’s reach. The 6.5m length outclasses all other melee units and has helped me get numerous eliminations that seemed just out of reach. However, it does come with a unique drawback of damage falloff. Her primary Soulsword melee only deals the maximum 65 damage if the enemy is within 4.5m. It will then fall to 50 percent at the end of its range.</p><p>This drawback exists in her Darkchild form as well. Although her Soulsword range increases to 10m, the damage falloff begins at 6m and drops to a measly 25 percent damage at maximum range. The key takeaway here is that it’s better to be up close and personal when swinging this sword.</p><h2 id="h174701"><a id=""></a><strong>Animation canceling is your friend</strong></h2><p>Another drawback with Magik’s Soulsword is the slow rate of the attacks. Thankfully, just like other heroes, you can get a lot more damage in with animation canceling. Many of her abilities can instantly cancel the swinging animation, but the sweet spot is right after the sword makes contact. My go-to combos typically follow a loop of Soulsword &gt; universal melee &gt; another ability. Thanks to the damage buff she receives from her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-bonus-team-up-health-damage-1851725468&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-bonus-team-up-health-damage-1851725468">Season Bonus</a></span>, I usually just need another Soulsword swing plus melee added to ensure that combo eliminates weaker heroes.</p><h2 id="h174702"><a id=""></a><strong>Stepping Discs and Umbral Incursion should be used often</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-recommend-id="image://ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-recommend-id="image://ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Outside of animation canceling, the proper balance to her weighty attacks is some nifty mobility techniques with Stepping Discs and Umbral Incursion. Stepping Discs is a two-charge ability that teleports her horizontally in whichever direction she’s moving. Aside from becoming invincible to damage during the movement, it also allows her to cast one of two additional attacks for three seconds after teleporting. These special attacks include a wide area-of-effect swing and a demon familiar summon.</p><p>Umbral Incursion is a rapid dash that will slash enemies upward if it makes contact. Its range is longer than her teleport and the potential launcher is a great way to deal more damage. While she isn’t invincible during the dash, Magik can use it to dash upward or downward.</p><p>My advice is to use these liberally with fights and general movement alike. Both abilities are perfect for repositioning around enemies and putting the hurt on them. Pair them together and you can even get in the face of flying heroes like Iron Man. Equally important, the invincibility of Stepping Discs and verticality of Umbral Incursion makes them perfect for making a quick exit.</p><h2 id="h174703"><a id=""></a><strong>If your health gets low in a fight, keep on fighting</strong></h2><p>Whenever a fight gets too dicey for most heroes, the solution is either to use a protective or healing ability, or to escape. The appropriate response in Magik’s case is usually to keep swinging that sword and using her abilities. Thanks to her Limbo’s Might passive, Magik converts 30 percent of the damage she inflicts as bonus health. I can tell you from experience playing with her and against her that she can last a long time in a fight. Once the odds get stacked against her, such as a pesky ranged hero joining the fray, it’s time to leave.</p><figure id="" data-id="b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-recommend-id="image://b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-recommend-id="image://b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h174704"><a id=""></a><strong>Play even more aggressively as Darkchild</strong></h2><p>Magik’s ultimate has her transform into the corrupted Darkchild for 12 seconds. Unlike the Hulk, the ability moveset is the same across both forms. The difference is that everything is enhanced as Darkchild. Attacks can do more damage and land additional hits, Umbral Incursion reaches a longer range at a quicker speed, and cooldowns are lowered across the board. All of it comes together to allow her to deal massive amounts of damage and gain a decent amount of bonus health at the same time.</p><p>Whether you’re diving in the back or pushing up front, the goal of Darkchild is to be aggressive and do whatever you can to get some eliminations. Earning the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529">Ace title</a></span> can be a cinch with an ultimate like this. Just don’t activate it in the middle of a fight, since her low health can quickly get depleted and waste your opportunity.</p><p>Magik isn’t without her weaknesses in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but she is still one of the deadliest dive heroes on the roster.
