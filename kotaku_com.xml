              <p>LEGO sets is a holiday gifting staple that works for kids and adults but as Christmas approaches, finding products that actually arrive before December 25th becomes increasingly critical. This <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> building set <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">currently sells for $140 on Amazon, down from its regular $169 price</a>, and more importantly, it ships with guaranteed delivery before Christmas through Amazon’s fast shipping network.</p>
<p>This 2,660-piece display model recreates the most iconic location from the Harry Potter universe in impressive detail which makes it perfect for adult collectors and Harry Potter fans.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Castle Recreation with Amazing Detail</h2>
<p>The model shows how complicated the architecture of Hogwarts Castle is by including the <strong>Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards, bridges, greenhouses, the Boathouse, and even the Black Lake</strong>. Each part fits together to make a complete picture of the castle grounds that matches the size and layout fans know from the books and movies.</p>
<p>The castle’s interior details make famous places come to life, like the <strong>Chamber of Secrets</strong> with its snake-shaped architecture, the Winged Key room from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges, the Potions Classroom where Snape scared students, and the Chessboard Chamber with its checkered floor pattern. These hidden details are worth looking for closely, and they add depth to the model beyond its impressive shape.</p>



<p>The grounds around the castle add to the experience by including important parts of the larger Hogwarts setting. The Durmstrang Ship is ready to take students who are visiting, and the Beauxbatons Carriage is a nice touch that fits with the story of the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow is standing there with its unique twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia is nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>



<p>One of the best things about the model is how good it looks: When finished, <strong>it is over 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong> and the castle stands out on a shelf, desk, or display area without taking up too much space or needing a whole bookcase to hold it. The gold-colored Hogwarts architect statue mini-figure that comes with it is the icing on the cake, and the <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate makes it a collectible display piece.</p>
<p>You’re saving here almost $30 on a big LEGO set that has a lot of pieces and detail for the price. In this size range, LEGO sets that are similar to castles or buildings usually cost the same or more, so this deal is a good deal for adults who like LEGO and the promise of delivery before Christmas takes away the stress of ordering gifts so close to the holiday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-dumps-the-eero-pro-wi-fi-6e-system-3-pack-at-40-off-breaking-the-price-down-to-almost-nothing-per-router-2000653948</link>
            <guid>1385923</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The year is coming to a close. While you’re crossing off every name on your list of who you need to shop for this holiday season, make sure not to forget someone especially important—you. That’s right, you deserve a big upgrade this time of year. How about saying goodbye to slow, spotty internet with the help of a Wi-Fi 6E mesh network? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6467/">Right now, you can save as much as 40% on an eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi router.</a> Individually, the router normally goes for $250, but the limited time deal has it marked down to just $160. You’ll save a solid $90.</p>
<p>A mesh Wi-Fi router’s real value lies in its ability to create a mesh network, which requires more than one router. Amazon offers these routers both individually and in bundled sets, including two, three, and four packs. Currently, these bundles are all heavily discounted. The two-pack, originally priced at $400, is now down to $240; the three-pack, originally $550, is now available for $330; and the four-pack, originally $800, has been reduced to $490. The best value right now is the three-pack, as each node costs just $110, making it the most affordable choice for expanding your network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6467/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Home Coverage</h2>
<p>Slow or unreliable internet can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you’re trying to load web pages or stay connected to your devices at home. A Wi-Fi 6E mesh network, like the eero Pro 6E system, can resolve these issues by providing consistent coverage. Each eero node covers up to 2,000 sq. ft. and can support more than 100 Wi-Fi-enabled devices. The system’s patented TrueMesh technology ensures that your network traffic is routed efficiently, reducing dead zones and drop-offs.</p>
<p>With a three-node setup, you’ll be able to cover up to 6,000 sq. ft., connecting over 300 devices simultaneously. If that’s not enough, you can easily add more nodes later on to further expand both your coverage area and device capacity.</p>



<p>With the addition of Wi-Fi 6E, which introduces access to the 6 GHz band. It operates as a third lane, separate from the traditional 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. You’ll experience faster speeds and improved performance across more devices. And setting up your mesh network is straightforward. The eero smartphone app provides step-by-step guidance to get your system up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In addition to excellent wireless coverage, three eero Pro 6E routers all together feature six built-in Ethernet ports, which can support speeds of up to 1 Gbps (1,000 Mbps). This makes them ideal for high-demand activities like streaming 4K video or playing cloud-based games. With the growing number of devices that support cloud gaming, such as Fire TV sticks and Samsung smart TVs, you can enjoy smooth gaming experiences without needing a physical console, thanks to the fast and reliable internet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Friendslop’ And RPGs Dominated The Top-Selling Games On Steam In 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-top-selling-2025-friendslop-rpgs-sales-2000654157</link>
            <guid>1385920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What were the most popular Steam games of 2025? Players have a sense based on Steam charts, general vibes, and what dominated conversations this year, but analyst Simon Carless recently shared official <em>GameDiscoverCo</em>. estimates for the top-performing games that show <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-cost-goty-sandfall-2000652590">just how much RPGs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-roblox-cliff-knock-off-aggro-crab-2000614671">multiplayer games</a> reigned supreme.</p> <p>The latest edition of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-top-new-pc-and-console-58">his excellent newsletter</a> contains estimates for the top-20&nbsp;<em>new</em> games on Steam this year by both total sales and total revenue. Here’s the list of games with the most copies sold:</p> <blockquote><p>20. Revenge on Gold Diggers<br> 19. Borderlands 4<br> 18. Dispatch<br> 17. Mage Arena<br> 16. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered<br> 15. Split Fiction<br> 14. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2<br> 13. Stellar Blade<br> 12. Megabonk<br> 11. Elden Ring Nightreign<br> 10. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<br> 9. RV There Yet?<br> 8. Escape From Duckov<br> 7. Hollow Knight: Silksong<br> 6. Arc Raiders<br> 5. Monster Hunter Wilds<br> 4. Schedule I<br> 3. Battlefield 6<br> 2. Peak<br> 1. R.E.P.O.</p></blockquote> <p>What stands out? Well, as Carless notes, the “<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/friendslop-peak-repo-fortnite-trend">friendslop</a>” like <em>Peak</em> and <em>R.E.P.O.</em> were huge, suggesting that many players do indeed just want to play games in which the co-op mechanics encourage goofing around with others. Multiplayer games in general were dominant, taking the six top slots. Fantasy RPGs were also super popular, with <em>Oblivion</em>, <em>Deliverance 2</em>, and <em>Clair Obscur</em> all having strong showings. I also think it’s worth calling out <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> specifically. Both struggled with PC optimization and word-of-mouth probably did them no favors, but they landed spots here regardless. Even so, it’s surprising to see <em>Borderlands 4</em> <em>below</em> an episodic narrative game like <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

 <p>This list is arranged by total sales though, and <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched at $70. When you look at the list of top 20 games by revenue instead, <em>Borderlands 4</em> breaks into the top 10 and<em> Dispatch</em> (which is only $30) falls to number 19. That list is still very much skewed back toward 2025’s conventional blockbusters, with <em>Battlefield 6</em> at number 1. Clearly a big part of which games break out big time on Steam comes down to a lower barrier to entry. <em>Schedule I</em> is only $20, <em>R.E.P.O</em> is only $10, and <em>Peak</em> is just $8.</p> <p>Are games that engineer viral moments and encourage you to bully your friends into buying them the key to unlocking success on Steam, or has “friendslop” run its course? At the very least, these games are cheaper and quicker to make than MMOs, MOBAs, and RPGs, so we probably won’t have to put up with a bunch of knock-offs that missed the boat launching in 2028.</p>
