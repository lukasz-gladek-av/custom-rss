              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><span>coming on December 10</span></a><span>, and the $30 expansion is bringing new Pokémon to Lumiose City that weren’t in the base game. Some of these monsters are getting Mega Evolutions, and we already know Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur will definitely be getting these powerful transformations next month. And because these three were confirmed in today’s trailer, we also probably know all the others that will be added thanks to fans datamining the game.</span></p>  <p><span>The supposed list of new Megas that began circulating last month included Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur, so it stands to reason that it’s at least a partial view of what new Mega forms will debut in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. Notably, some Pokémon who already have Mega Evolutions in the base game are supposedly getting a second Mega Evolution that fans are calling “Z” forms, but it’s unclear at the moment what they’ll actually be called in-game. The full list reads as follows:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu X</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu Y</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Chimecho</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Absol</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Staraptor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Garchomp</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Lucario</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golurk</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Meowstic</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Crabominable</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golisopod</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Magearna</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Scovillain</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Glimmora</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tatsugiri</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baxcalibur</span></li> </ul> <p><span>I’m not holding my breath, but it would be cool if there were even more Mega Evolutions that we don’t know about. Corviknight, the armored bird from the Galar region, is shown in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>trailer, and one of my favorites, so I would love it if he got a surprise Mega form as well. I can’t get too greedy, though. Raichu is finally getting a Mega Evolution after a decade of disrespect, so I should probably just shut the fuck up.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>appears to take place in the post-game, so you will likely have to beat the main story before you can play it. You better get to grinding up those Z-A Royale ranks if you haven’t </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>seen the credits yet</span></a><span>.</span></p>
