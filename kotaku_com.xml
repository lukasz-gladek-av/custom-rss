              <p>It’s hard to think of the last time something changed home lighting as much and as radically as the advent of the multi-colored app-driven LED light. Edison, maybe? But even the Wizard of Menlo Park would have been blown away by the lighting setups that Govee keeps coming out with. If you’re&nbsp;<em>really</em> fast, you can order one like this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/">Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp while it’s 41% off at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>While this limited-time deal is still going, the Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is easily the best $100 full-room transformation you can make. Even above the 1500 lumens of brightness that will fill your space, it comes with over 64 pre-programmed scenes and lighting effects, and the DIY potential to create your own is virtually limitless. It’s all app-controlled and smart home friendly, and it takes up precious little space in proportion to the way it fills a room with incredible lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tall Cool One</h2>
<p>The Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is perfectly designed for corners, standing an impressive 68.8 inches hight but only 10.3 inches at the base and an especially slender 3.2 inches across the top of the cylinder. When we say “some assembly required,” we mean very, very little — it comes in five pieces, all of which screw together by hand. No tools required and certainly no knowledge of wiring or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>Once it’s up and running, you’ll go to the app to start experimenting. This is an easy rabbit hole to enjoyably go down, because there are literally millions of colors available. The brightness, timer, and patterns are all entirely under your control through the intuitive and free Govee Home App. The lamp can be set for accent lighting, fun party effects, or full-on room-brightening.</p>



<h2>How Customizable?</h2>
<p>The level of customization of the Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp’s effects is beyond impressive. Aside from having a palette of millions of colors to choose from and mix together, the Govee Home App even has a Finger Sketch feature that lets you draw a pattern with those colors, and then see the pattern take shape on the LED cylinder. Add your pattern or any other color scheme you create to the six different music sync modes to watch them dance in beat with whatever tunes you’re playing. Or, stick with the generous library of 64 preloaded scenes. There’s no shortage of compelling, mood-setting lighting effects available, from sedate to dramatic to whimsical.</p>
<p>The Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is normally a $170 purchase, and well worth it for the amount of personal touch it adds to whatever space you use it in. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/">With this limited-time Amazon deal taking 41% off that price, it’s just $100.</a></p>

              <p>A great pair of earbuds can change the way you experience your favorite music. If it’s time to try something new, you should get a pair of Apple AirPods Pro 3 Wireless Earbuds. These earbuds provide high-quality audio, top-notch noise cancellation, and easy connectivity for Apple devices. And you can get a pair on sale right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">To take advantage of their sale price, which is now priced at $199 (down from its original price of $249),</a> just shop Amazon to claim the discount and see how much these AirPods can transform the way you listen to music, podcasts, and make or take calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds that provide excellent audio</h2>
<p>These earbuds have Active Noise Cancellation technology to help eliminate ambient sound so you can clearly listen to whatever it is you’re playing. Whether you’re using the earbuds while commuting through heavy traffic or you’d like to listen to music without distractions at home, the Active Noise Cancellation feature automatically adjusts to your surroundings.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you need to be aware of your surroundings, such as in a crowded restaurant or while walking through a busy airport, the Transparency Mode allows you to hear your surroundings by allowing ambient sounds to filter into the earbuds without needing to remove them.</p>
<p>All of that, and the AirPods sound great, too. They boast clear, balanced audio with crisp high notes and powerful low notes that make music feel alive. In addition, the Adaptive Equalizer (Adaptive EQ) dynamically adjusts the sound to the unique shape of your ears providing a customized listening experience without manual adjustment of the EQ settings.</p>



<p>But that’s not it, because there are some customization options, too. Each pair comes with multiple ear tip options so you can choose the one that provides the most comfortable fit for your ears. Once fitted correctly, the earbuds sit comfortably against your ear without being overly tight and can accommodate extended periods of use, whether for listening or working out. In addition, the AirPods Pro 3 Wireless Earbuds are water-resistant and sweat-resistant, ensuring they can withstand minor exposure to rain or sweat during a workout or other physically demanding activities.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life, these AirPods boast several hours of playback per charge and the compact charging case can give you plenty of additional power. In addition, when you need to recharge the earbuds, simply place them back in the case and they begin charging immediately. Then charge up your case and do it all again when it’s all depleted.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">For just $199, you really can’t beat the latest Apple AirPods model.</a> They’re a smart investment for anyone looking for great audio, especially if you’re already a part of the iOS ecosystem.</p>

            <guid>1392469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="470">If you’ve been considering upgrading your smartphone, now is the perfect time to treat yourself to something fresh and exciting. Amazon has just made it even easier for you to do so, with the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro being offered at some hefty discounts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6590/">The Pixel 10, featuring 128GB of storage, has dropped from $799 to as low as $549</a>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage is now available for just $749, down from its original price of $999.</a></p>
<p data-start="472" data-end="1445">Both the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro come equipped with a 6.3-inch display that boasts a resolution of 1280 x 2856. While this isn’t quite as large as the Pixel XL’s 6.8-inch screen, it still provides an optimal viewing experience, making it perfect for reading tex messages and watching videos alike. The display is bright, vibrant, and remains clear even under direct sunlight. Plus, it supports a smooth 120 Hz refresh rate, which makes gaming and general use feel fluid and responsive. The Pixel 10 Pro is available in a range of colors, and regardless of the option you choose, they are all part of the deal that brings the price down to just $749. For the standard Pixel 10, the frost and obsidian (white and black) colors are available for $599, while the funkier lemongrass and indigo options are discounted by an additional $50, bringing them down to $549. Though, you were likely planning to slap a case on it right away, so who needs to worry about color, right?</p>

<h2 data-start="1447" data-end="1481">Pro-Level Photography Features</h2>
<p data-start="1482" data-end="2068">When it comes to photography, the Pixel 10 Pro stands out with its impressive triple rear camera system. The 50 MP main camera is paired with a 48 MP telephoto lens, offering pro-grade zoom capabilities. You can now take photos or record videos at up to 100x Pro Res Zoom, which delivers the best zoom quality the Pixel series has seen to date. There’s also a 48 MP ultrawide camera that allows for macro focus, making it easy to capture incredibly detailed close-up shots of small subjects. On the front, a 42 MP camera ensures your selfies and video calls are crystal clear and sharp.</p>


<p data-start="2070" data-end="2427">The Pixel 10 Pro also comes with built-in Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, which seems to be getting baked into everything these days whether you want it or not — including in smartphones. Gemini is designed to help by doing things like creating group shots from multiple photos, generating images, summarizing unread emails, and other stuff of the like. It’s powered by Google’s next-gen chip, which enables the phone with the processing power needed to fully utilize AI.</p>
<p data-start="2429" data-end="2784" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">As for cellular service, the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are both unlocked, meaning you can choose the carrier and data plan that best fits your needs—whether that’s Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, or any other major carrier. Currently, you can save up to $250 on either the Google Pixel 10 or Pixel 10 Pro, making this an ideal time to upgrade your device.</p>
