            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a lot to love about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>. The kart racer is just under a week away from launch, and I’ve been playing it and really enjoying Sonic and friends’ latest run around the racetrack. It’s got a surprising amount of depth with its customizable builds, a wide spread of tracks referencing </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>history, and its races are chaotic, fast-paced fun. But one of the best things the game does happens just before the races. In single-player modes, you’re pitted against a specific Rival racer, and before the first race, they’ll exchange some words with whoever you’re playing as. These brief back-and-forths are absolutely delightful, and show that everyone in the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cast is a professional trash talker.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CNSbEod2FF">pic.twitter.com/CNSbEod2FF</a></p> <p>— Mlick (@Mlickles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mlickles/status/1968720889840562281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>When I play </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>, I play almost exclusively as Shadow the Hedgehog, so I’ve seen just how vicious Sonic Team has made my boy when talking to pretty much everyone on the roster. Now that reviews are out and more coverage is circulating, I’m seeing a lot more of this banter and realizing that there’s some grade-A smack talk happening in this game. </span><i><span>Crossworlds&nbsp; </span></i><span>doesn’t really have a story like previous </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racing games, so most of the character interactions come from these pre-race rap battles. Everyone in the roster has a little bit of attitude, and it means that if you put them in a competitive situation, they’re gonna try to rustle their opponents’ feathers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not all of these interactions are hostile, though. These races are all in good fun, so if characters who vibe get paired up as rivals, they’re usually pretty chill, and it’s sometimes illuminating to hear them talk, especially if they haven’t really had much screentime together over the years. So sit back and enjoy some of the best exchanges I’ve seen online thus far.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMEGA REALLY SAID YOU HAVE  NO MONEY, NO LEADS NO BITCHES</p> <p>OH MY GOD😭😭😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF">https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF</a></p> <p>— Chonzo (COMMS OPEN) (@chonzodraws) <a href="https://twitter.com/chonzodraws/status/1968712490281287904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get the feeling Shadow might not like Charmy.</p> <p>Though to be fair he doesn't seem to like a lot of people. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZhyKA60fqu">pic.twitter.com/ZhyKA60fqu</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968672404940451959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don't think you can blame Shadow for this TBH they've barely even interacted beyond that one recent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDWSonic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IDWSonic</a> issue. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/C1ubko6qvn">pic.twitter.com/C1ubko6qvn</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968745172587471248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn, Jet is really mad at Big <a href="https://t.co/8u3lIcKwzz">pic.twitter.com/8u3lIcKwzz</a></p> <p>— Funkin 🦉🐓 (@funkin03) <a href="https://twitter.com/funkin03/status/1968711269621383350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is why Shadow is the best Sonic character.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-50000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon-2000627131</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-50-000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon.1302735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all been there: that moment when your iPhone runs out of battery when you desperately need it to last. Even if you do have a power bank, more often than not, it’s the wrong cable, or worse, the standby battery isn’t even charged. That’s the frustration this 50,000mAh power bank seeks to eliminate entirely: It’s enormous in size, has all the cables you could possibly need integrated right in, and is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/">currently priced at an all-time low of $34 on Amazon, down dramatically from its usual $199</a>. That’s an <strong>83 percent off sale on a charger</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An Actual Power Bank That Fixes Everyday Charging</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the number that means the most: <strong>50,000mAh</strong>. That is just a phenomenal amount of mobile power. In all realism, you could <strong>charge your iPhone more than a dozen times before this battery depletes itself</strong>. That’s seven days of continuous use without having to use a wall charger, or more than enough power to charge your phone, your earbuds, your tablet, and even a friend’s phone when you and your group are all running low on power. The appeal is that you don’t need to bring a lot of extra accessories with you. Instead <strong>of working with adapters and wires, all you need is built-in</strong>. The unit contains four cables built in (USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB-A) so you just grab one out and plug in straight into your device.</p>



<p>And on top of that, this charger isn’t just small, but fast: With <strong>22.5W fast charging backed by PD 3.0 and QC 3.0/4.0 technology,</strong> it recognizes your device instantly and adjusts for optimal charging. For example, an iPhone 17 can go from zero to about 60 percent in half an hour. That’s faster than the old wall chargers Apple used to pack, and it’s incredibly useful when you’ve only got a few minutes before heading out the door.</p>
<p>Safety has been integrated into the system as well: The company also had a monitoring chip that keeps an eye on<strong> charging by milliseconds to avoid risks like overvoltage, overcurrent, or short circuits</strong>. Protection steps in if something goes amiss. That is, all your gadgets (whether the new iPhone 17, an iPad Pro, a Galaxy S25, or a Pixel phone) are charging without harm effectively.</p>
<p>If battery drain ever stranded or stressed you, grabbing this 50,000mAh power bank at its all-time lowest price is one of those genius purchases you won’t regret.</p>

              <p><span>In the wake of the assassination last week of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration and other reactionary movements have wielded the act as a tool to silence critics of Kirk’s views, and those who are critical of the Trump administration more broadly. One of the most highly publicized instances of this was Disney-owned ABC’s pulling of </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i><span>, following pressure from the FCC, after the talk show ran a segment that said the Trump administration had latched onto the event in order to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHT7ICvMtlA"><span>“score political points.”</span></a><span> In response, several public figures have spoken out in protest, including some actors who have prominently worked for Disney by appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span></p> <p><span>Marisa Tomei, who plays Spider-Man’s Aunt May in the superhero franchise, took to Instagram to urge people to boycott Disney, including the Marvel movies she starred in, from </span><i><span>Captain America: Civil War </span></i><span>in 2016 to </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home </span></i><span>in 2021. May was killed in the last </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>movie by the Green Goblin, and given that her death was a thematic pillar of the film, it was unlikely that Tomei would have been asked to reprise the role, but still, speaking out against one of the most powerful companies in modern media isn’t nothing.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marisa Tomei reshares post urging for the boycott of Disney brands. <a href="https://t.co/7Ni0CSu3ui">pic.twitter.com/7Ni0CSu3ui</a></p> <p>— Buzzing Pop (@BuzzingPop) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzingPop/status/1968833688759591240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Meanwhile Tatiana Maslany, the actor behind the titular hero of </span><i><span>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</span></i><span>, posted on social media urging people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. Maslany’s post was even more pointed, with her Instagram story featuring a photo of her in a motion capture suit while shooting the </span><i><span>She-Hulk </span></i><span>series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not everyone would risk their entire career for what’s right. Tatiana Maslany just did.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaked-song-limp-bizkit-songs-intel-nvidia-gpu-switch-2-amazon-2000627132</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Zack here, filling in as your host today for your regularly scheduled Ethan edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of news and other stuff you might care about. Let’s get through this thing together, and then at the end we can listen to some music and celebrate the upcoming weekend.</p> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> contains a big list of licensed songs and a lot of Limb Bizkit</strong></h2> <p>According to a new <em>Battlefield 6</em> leak, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1968725668042063960">as reported by <em>Battlefield Bulletin</em>,</a> the upcoming military shooter contains a surprisingly large list of licensed music. <em>BF Bulletin</em> says these songs will be played on the radio when driving in-game vehicles, but EA has yet to confirm any of this. Here’s the track listing, which contains three different songs credited to Limp Bizkit. Seriously.</p> <ul> <li>“Awake” – Godsmack</li> <li>“Bodies” – Drowning Pool</li> <li>“Break Stuff” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Can’t Stop” – Red Hot Chili Peppers</li> <li>“Domination” – Pantera</li> <li>“Got Each Other” – The Interrupters ft. Rancid</li> <li>“Hey Man, Nice Shot” – Filter</li> <li>“Invaders Must Die” – The Prodigy</li> <li>“Making Love to Morgan Wallen” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Master of War” – Bob Dylan</li> <li>“Nuthin’ But A G Thang” – Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg</li> <li>“Pain” – Chalk</li> <li>“You’ll Never Guess Who Died” – The Kinison</li> <li>“Battlefield: The After-party” by Henry Jackman &amp; Limp Bizkit</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://youtu.be/iCEGrHGmb1o">one of the listed Limp Bizkit songs was uploaded to Limp Bizkit’s official YouTube channel last week</a>. And the artwork for the song includes the singer on a tank that has <em>BF6</em> graffiti on it and the song’s credits list EA Music.&nbsp; So, yeah, I think we can deduce that this list is probably accurate.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">When I traveled to Los Angeles earlier this year</a> to attend the game’s big multiplayer reveal, I was shocked that its big trailer featured the Limp Bizkit song “Break Stuff.” I assumed it was a fun joke or a one-off thing. But it seems like EA and the people making <em>Battlefield 6</em> have partnered up with Limp Bizkit in some capacity, and folks, I’m not sure how I feel about any of this.</p> <h2><strong>Intel is still going to make its own GPUs following the Nvidia deal</strong></h2> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that GPU maker and tech giant Nvidia was partnering up with Intel as part of a large, long-term plan. Nvidia is investing billions into Intel and the two will work together on new products. Wild stuff. And if you were wondering if this meant the end of Intel’s own GPUs, that doesn’t seem to be the case for now. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/intel-says-arc-gpus-arent-going-anywhere-just-yet-despite-the-new-nvidia-collaboration/">As <em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>, Intel still has plans to keep making Intel Arc cards for the foreseeable future. We’ll see how long that lasts.</p>

 <h2><strong>It seems like you can just buy a Switch 2 on Amazon now</strong></h2> <p>If you’ve been wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch 2, well, it’s pretty easy to do now. As pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-for-sale-on-amazon-no-invite-required-132503609.html">Engadget</a></em>, Amazon is now selling the console in the United States without any waiting list or hoops to jump through. You just fork over $500 and wait a couple of days, and there you go. I’ve also seen multiple Switch 2 units at my local Target. So it seems like you’ll be able to snag a Switch 2 without much effort ahead of the holidays.</p> <h2><strong><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>‘s excellent soundtrack now available on Nintendo’s Music app</strong></h2> <p>I’m so mad at myself that I’ve not finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. And a big reason for that is because I miss listening to the 3D smasher-jumper, which has one of the best Nintendo soundtracks in years. Thankfully, the songs are now available on the Nintendo Music app. Now, I just need to find time to finish that game.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-have-a-button-that-blows-up-everything-in-a-map-and-its-fun-to-press-it-2000626898"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and the big button that blows everything up</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Law enforcement is reportedly digging into the gaming history of Charlie Kirk’s killer</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">The legal battle between Sony and Tencent over a knock-off <em>Horizon</em> game continues</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>Sure, why not?</p>  
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaked-song-limp-bizkit-songs-intel-nvidia-gpu-switch-2-amazon-2000627132]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Purchasing chargers is just as overwhelming as buying the phone itself. Apple actually sells and endorses Anker products in their own retail stores, so that says a lot about how much confidence the brand has established. And ight now, Anker’s 20W fast USB-C charger (the exact power rate needed to fast charge iPhones such as Apple’s new iPhone 17 and 17 Pro) is available on Amazon basically impossible to pass up. With the coupon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">you can obtain a 2-pack with cables for just $11, down from $19</a>. That’s<strong> basically $6 per charger</strong>, when Apple charges an identical standalone version for $30.</p>

<h2>Why This Charger Deal Is Too Good To Pass Up</h2>
<p>If you’ve owned an iPhone in the past few years, you may have noticed that <strong>Apple started no longer putting wall chargers in the box</strong>. Now, you’re stuck either paying Apple’s own adapter for way too much or settling for slower, less convenient knockoffs. The Anker 20W fast charger solves that problem without cutting corners. It’s certified and just as reliable as the official Apple version – except you’re paying a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>Beyond the obvious savings, the performance is what you’d expect from a charger in 2025. The 20W output gives you the charging speeds that newer iPhones are built to handle. Insert an iPhone 15/16/17, and y<strong>ou can fuel up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes</strong>. The<strong> included USB-C to USB-C cable</strong> ensures you’re set from the start without hunting down extra accessories, and it’s Apple-certified for safety and reliability.</p>
<p>A <strong>USB-C and a USB-A port are both included</strong> in every charger block, so you can charge two devices at once (your iPhone and your AirPods, for example) without sacrificing charging speed. It’s small enough to throw into a pocket or travel case, so you don’t have to spend much time thinking about what’s going on before you head out of the house.</p>
<p>Anker also gives you peace of mind with its MultiProtect safety system. That’s a <strong>multi-layered system that guards against overheating, overcharging, and short circuits</strong>. It’s the type of feature that you don’t even consider until you need it, and it’s another reason why Apple feels comfortable to recommend this brand.</p>
<p>At this price, the deal is more than an accommodation: It’s about having a sufficient number of chargers where you need them. You leave one at home, the other in your pocket so that you never end up digging around in the office or airport lounge. And at about 6 dollars an item, you can equip both locations for under the cost of a single Apple adapter.</p>
