As you slice and dice droids and criminals, you experience a condensed retelling of 1999's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311?_gl=1*1dp6uhr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY0ODc5NC4xNDguMS4xNzM3NjUxNzg3LjE5LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311?_gl=1*1dp6uhr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY0ODc5NC4xNDguMS4xNzM3NjUxNzg3LjE5LjAuMA.."><em>The Phantom Menace</em></a></span>. And uh, the game wasn’t very good, with clunky combat and bad platforming segments. But, that hasn’t stopped<em> Jedi Power Battles </em>from returning in 2025 via a newly released remaster. </p><p>Developed by Aspyr, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">the same studio behind last year’s <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunter</em> remaster</a></span>, this new and improved version of <em>Jedi Power Battles</em> is out now on basically every platform under the sun. And like the original it includes local co-op as well as multiple characters (include non-Jedi ones) to play as, and 10 levels to work through. </p><p>As you would expect, Aspyr has visually upgraded <em>Jedi Power Battles</em>, too. So you get improved textures, better looking menus, and increased performance, which is much appreciated as the original PlayStation game looked rough and played poorly. (I should know, last year I streamed and beat the original.) This spiffy port also includes new characters to play as and all the original unlockable characters now included right from the get go.</p><p>And all the remastered aspects of this new port are great. In fact, this is a perfect version of <em>Jedi Power Battles</em>. It includes everything, looks great, runs well, and also features <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-announce&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-announce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice bonus features</a></span> that will make super<em> Star Wars</em> nerds (like me) happy. For example, you can swap Mace Windu’s lightsaber color from the original, inaccurate blue seen in the game to a perfect purple. If you want to play <em>Jedi Power Battles</em> in 2025, this is the way to do so. No question about it.</p><p>However, I would point out that I’m not sure anyone really wanted to replay <em>Jedi Power Battles </em>25 years later. I mean, sure, there are probably people who grew up with this game and have nostalgia for it. I was one of those kids who played hours and hours of this game back in 2000. But whenever I return to it, most recently to play this remaster, I find a bad, clunky game. Combat feels stiff and unresponsive; enemies take way too many hits; levels, like the section on Coruscant, go on forever and feel miserable. Playing in co-op is a bit more fun and some boss fights are entertaining, but overall <em>Jedi Power Battles </em>is a bad game that would have been forgotten if it weren’t connected to <em>Star Wars. </em></p><p>So where does that leave the remaster of <em>Jedi Power Battles?</em> Well, if you are really desperate for a new couch co-op<em> Star Wars </em>game—which there aren’t many of—then you might have a fine time. For everyone else, well, I’d recommend only buying and playing this remaster if you are super nostalgic for the original game. Just be warned: You likely won’t enjoy <em>Star Wars: Episode 1: Jedi Power Battles</em> as much in 2025 as you did in 2000.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Again</a></span>.</p><p>It’s clear that Ubisoft really needs a big win here and is betting a lot on <em>Shadows</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-release-date-star-wars-1851657285?_gl=1*we5t6x*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgxOTgxLjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-release-date-star-wars-1851657285?_gl=1*we5t6x*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgxOTgxLjU0LjAuMA..">giving the devs as much time as possible</a></span> to make a great game that it hopes sells really, really well. So yeah, there’s a lot riding on this game. And while I can’t say, after my hands-on demo, whether or not the full game is going to be enough to help turn things around for Ubisoft, I’m at least convinced  that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> could be a very good game. In fact, it might be <em>two </em>good games smashed into one package. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039?_gl=1*iv8elb*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDQzMzczLjQ0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039?_gl=1*iv8elb*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDQzMzczLjQ0LjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em> </em>is set in Japan during the 16th century, toward the end of the Sengoku period. During this time, Japan was rife with civil war and guns were becoming more common on the battlefield. As with many past <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, <em>Shadows </em>features members of the Assassin Brotherhood fighting the Templars and their various proxies. </p><p>However, rather than the series’ ongoing, interconnected lore, my demo was focused mostly on the two main characters—Yasuke and Naoe—and their involvement in a war between clans and family. And after four hours of playing <em>Shadows </em>over a mostly stable livestream connection under the watchful eye of a Ubisoft representative, those two characters really stood out to me, not least because they offer two drastically different ways to play.</p><h2 id="h6066"><a id=""></a>A tale of two assassins</h2><p>First up, there’s Yasuke, a Black man who has made his way to Japan via Christian missionaries. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754?_gl=1*6ey1xx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ0MTIzMS4yNTkuMC4xNzM2NDQxMjM5LjUyLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754?_gl=1*6ey1xx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ0MTIzMS4yNTkuMC4xNzM2NDQxMjM5LjUyLjAuMA..">This character is based on a real person</a></span> from history, though the exact details have been changed to better fit the world of <em>Shadows</em>. And yeah, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..">a corner of the internet is angry about a black man being in <em>Shadows</em></a></span>. Who cares! Anyway, Yasuke is a tough, combat-focused character who plays a lot like the heroes from<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-origins-the-kotaku-review-1819862017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-origins-the-kotaku-review-1819862017"><em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em></a></span><em>, Odyssey, </em>and <em>Valhalla.</em> Yasuke can kick people across a room, break down doors, and wield large weapons against crowds of enemies. And while he can sneak around a bit and do some parkour, he’s slower and less effective at stealth than his counterpart. </p><p>On the flipside, you have Naoe, a ninja-like Assassin who plays a lot more like the heroes of older <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a></span>—stuff like <em>AC2, Rogue, </em>and <em>Unity. </em>Naoe is skilled at sneaking in an out of places and taking out people without anyone noticing. She’s also really fast and can easily scale walls and roofs in seconds. </p><p>In my time with <em>Shadows</em>, what surprised me the most was just how different the game felt depending on who you selected.</p><p>As Yasuke, I could do a bit of stealth to get into a base and then fight my way through using a big sword and abilities like a charge attack. He played a lot like a walking samurai tank; able to destroy enemies easily while taking a lot of damage. Naoe is the opposite.  Returning as Naoe to the small enemy base I’d previously ransacked as Yasuke was interesting. I could take advantage of all the shadows around the base more easily, hiding from enemies and taking them out with my hidden blade. I could escape quickly with smoke bombs, too. </p><p>As I bounced between the two characters, I got the sense that Ubisoft really wants this<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>entry to appeal to all of the franchise’s fans. Ever since <em>Origins</em>, which was a more RPG-focused action game compared to past titles, a split has developed between fans. There are those who like that type of action-focused game and others who miss the stealth gameplay of the older installments. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">2023's <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a></span> was Ubisoft’s attempt to provide  those older fans with something that would make them happy, and it worked.  But <em>Mirage </em>might have scared away the players who want a big new open-world, RPG-style <em>Assassin’s Creed. </em></p><p>With <em>Shadows </em>and its two characters, Ubisoft is trying to merge both playstyles and fanbases into one big package. You love sneaking around and using a hidden blade? Play as Naoe! Prefer a big sword and large fights? Good news, you can play as Yasuke.</p><p> It’s a smart approach that worked shockingly well in my four-hour preview. At times I’d force myself to play as one or the other, and I was always able to  make progress regardless of the situation. And while there will be parts that force you to switch to one or the other, Ubisoft seems dedicated to mostly leaving the option of who to play as in the hands of players.</p><p>For those who want to frequently swap between both and enjoy everything the game has to offer, Ubisoft has your back. Every mission I played featured numerous points where I could swap between characters. And outside of quests, I was able to freely swap between Yasuke and Naoe as long as I wasn’t in combat. Ubisoft really, really wants everyone to be happy, and while that approach can sometimes lead to games that feel bland or sanded down, my admittedly limited demo left me with the feeling that in <em>Shadows</em>, it could work really well. </p><h2 id="h6067"><a id=""></a>Exploration, questing, and the open world</h2><p>Beyond the two-character approach, Ubisoft is also trying to encourage more exploration and a slower pace in <em>Shadows</em>.</p><p> Quests aren’t automatically marked on your map, for example, with the game instead encouraging you to read clues, explore the area, and find your next objective yourself. If that doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, however, you can also use scouts to find places to go, so there’s a way to skip the searching and get to the killing. Another example of Ubisoft trying to satisfy everyone. </p><p>Between those quests, I found a gorgeous world packed with a ton of detail. I came across some deer fighting in the woods, sneaked close to them, and was reward with some XP and a short cutscene of my character drawing the animals. Later, I cut my way through some bushes and discovered that a lot of stuff can be cut and destroyed in <em>Shadows</em>. Trees, bushes, paper doors, crates, and more are all dynamic and can be broken or sliced. Fighting some guards near a bush I was hiding in led to the bush getting cut up and me losing my sneaky spot. Oops! </p><p>Sadly, I was only granted access to a small section of what looks like a really big map to explore. But even so, there was some neat stuff to experience. I spent a lot of my time riding a horse, though you can walk around the map if you prefer. At one point I stumbled upon a challenge to hit targets with my bow while on horseback. Another time, I prayed at a small temple. Nothing mind-blowingly cool, but in general, I got the sense that <em>Shadows </em>wants you to slow down and poke around the world more than past <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games. </p><p>My only major disappointment with the demo was that a lot of the quests boiled down to go somewhere, kill some stuff or sneak in, and then leave. Sprinkled between these moments were cutscenes that featured dialogue choices and I did enjoy these moments as I got to better define Yasuke and Naoe. But the quests weren’t that memorable, and I worry that trying to support two very different characters might prove tricky when it comes to designing engaging and varied missions. </p><p>We’ll have to wait and see if the rest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-base-building-rpg-settlement-1851655892&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-base-building-rpg-settlement-1851655892"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span> has more interesting missions and if the slower pace and dual-character approach works in the long run. I’m not sure<em> Shadows </em>is the game that will save Ubisoft, mainly because I’m not sure one single game can do that. But it might be the game that finally unites the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fanbase, and that would be impressive, too.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 20. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-ac-shadows-ps4-xbox-one-next-gen-only-1851479764&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-ac-shadows-ps4-xbox-one-next-gen-only-1851479764">It will be the first game in the franchise to skip PS4 in over a decade.</a></span></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact if you remove the EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes <em>Madden 25 </em>and <em>Sports FC 25</em>,  games already on the list elsewhere, then over a third of the top-20 list includes old games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li><li><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></li><li><em>Helldivers II </em></li><li><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em></li><li><em>NBA 2K25 </em></li><li><em>Madden NFL 25</em></li><li><strong><em> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023) </em></strong></li><li><em>EA Sports FC 25 </em></li><li><strong><em>Elden Ring </em></strong></li><li><em>EA Sports MVP Bundle </em></li><li><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy </em></strong></li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma II </em></li><li><em>WWE 2K24 </em></li><li><em>MLB: The Show 24 </em></li><li><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto V </em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Minecraft </em></strong></li><li><em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth </em></li><li><em>Tekken 8 </em></li><li><strong><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 </em></strong></li><li><strong><em>NBA2K24</em></strong>﻿</li></ol></blockquote><p>It’s hard to come up with any unifying theory of why these seven games (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us.816495/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us.816495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three more than 2023</a></span>) remained such huge sellers last year. Annual sports games like <em>NBA 2K24</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>’s unparalleled popularity have historically helped them stick around months after release. <em>GTA V</em> is required to play<em> GTA Online</em>, which continues to be one of the most popular multiplayer games, and the launch of <em>GTA VI </em>is closer than ever. And every year there’s a new generation of kids getting hooked on <em>Minecraft</em>. </p><p><em>Elden Ring</em> was no doubt helped by its GOTY contender expansion,<em> Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, coming out in 2024. And <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>? Well, who knows. It hit Switch in late 2023 and finally started getting its price slashed in half during recent sales. <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, meanwhile, seems like people’s go-to game when they upgrade to a PS5 for the first time.</p><p>Other notable takeaways from last year’s best-selling games are that not a single Nintendo first-party game charted, a testament to what a week year overall it was for the console despite a late breakout in <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em>. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> didn’t chart at all either. In fact a Ubisoft game hasn’t charted in the top 10 since 2020's <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, no doubt part of its calculous in delaying <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> a second time for extra polish as the family-owned publisher battles for survival. </p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> was another high-profile absence. In addition to not making the list despite its predecessor eventually selling over 10 million, it wasn’t a top-20 best-selling game for December 2024 either, less than two months after it launched.

Whether that was an unrealistic goal to make up for the game’s notoriously long and difficult development cycle is another matter. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
