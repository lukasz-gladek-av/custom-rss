Team Ninja and Platinum Games announced <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> as a joint venture at this week’s Xbox Developer Direct where they provided a deep dive into the story, new mechanics, and updated combat. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196578" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The sequel puts players into the shoes of a new hero, Yakumo, who will battle enemies in an apocalyptic-looking Tokyo ravaged by a demonic Rain of Darkrot. Series mainstay Ryu Hayabusa will still make an appearance, however, and Team Ninja confirmed he’ll play a pivotal role in the larger story. The game is coming sometime in fall 2025 and will be on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate day-one on both Xbox Series X/S and PC. It’ll also be available on to play on PlayStation 5 and Steam. </p><p>In a series known for its very challenging and hyper-frenetic combat, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> seems like it will be upping the ante with massive environments, grappling hook platforming, and even flashier attacks. “We are staying true to the challenge and deep action that defines the <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>series, while incorporating the speed and dynamic expression of PlatinumGames,” director and producer Yuji Nakao said during the showcase. </p><p>To whet players’ appetites for the sequel, especially those who may not be familiar with the franchise after its extended absence, Team Ninja also revealed an Unreal Engine 5 remake of <em>Ninja Gaiden 2 </em>called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFjWCZIVZDw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFjWCZIVZDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em></a></span>&nbsp;that is out on PC and consoles today. It includes additional characters and tweaks to various battle support features, and is available on Game Pass Ultimate as well.

Lo-poly shapes and rich colors make the road trip look anything but tedious, ditching its predecessor’s finely tuned race tracks for open-ended exploration in the wilderness. </p><p>A press release announcing the game promises lots of different biomes, a day-and-night cycle, changing weather, and even mysterious portals linking disparate environments. Co-op will let players navigate the challenges and discover new areas together, and there’s even a gear system for outfitting vehicles before excursions. It’ll be the next joint venture between Funselektor and Strelka Games following <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/remap-radio-52-the-summer-of-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/remap-radio-52-the-summer-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024's racing sim manager, <em>Golden Lap</em></a></span>. </p><p>“After having developed several games about motorsport, we wanted to go off-track by offering players a vast world to lose themselves at a slower pace,” Funselektor founder Dune Casu said. “In a way, this game is similar to the experience I’ve had journeying across North America in my trusty camper van. There’s something special about being in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere, from the peace, the sounds of nature and less distraction from the civilized world. I hope this game can really drive that feeling home.”</p><p>The minimalism of past games like <em>Art of Rally</em>, while an aesthetic eye-catcher, has also carried through to the rest of the design. “<em>Art of Rally’s</em> minimalism serves a purpose,” former <em>Kotaku </em>writer Luke Plunkett <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/art-of-rally-turns-driving-into-meditation-1845099850&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/art-of-rally-turns-driving-into-meditation-1845099850">wrote previously</a></span>. “It’s not just a random aesthetic choice. It’s there to help create a zen-like experience. As is the electronic soundtrack that quickly retreats, kicks its feet up and puts on its slippers in the background. There’s no commentary, no pop-ups warning you about stuff, no other drivers out there, it’s just you, the car and a lot of gravel corners.”</p><p>I hope that vibe carries over into <em>over the hill</em> too, but with some extra companions along for the ride this time. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
