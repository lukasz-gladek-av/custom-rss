            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> got a fresh set of <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/duck-update-patch-notes-1-3-0">patch notes</a> for its 1.3.0 update this morning. The update includes a variety of changes across the board, but perhaps most important are the changes to a two-shot pistol that’s been causing havoc and devastation for anyone on the receiving end of its twin barrels. Here are all the changes impacting in-game weapons and items:</p> <h2>The Venator gets ‘re-tuned’ and explosions are less explosive</h2> <p>A blue rare gun, the Venator is a girl’s best friend as a sidearm and a seriously reliable primary weapon if you like maining pistols. That might change a bit as the gun was previously “capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons,” according to the patch notes.</p>

 <p>The other notable change here is that explosions have been tweaked. To be honest, I kinda saw this one coming as it’s been pretty damn easy lately to take out the larger Arc threats with things that go boom. The most significant of these changes sees the Hullcracker launcher, great for taking down Arc, requiring more accuracy, while explosions on large enemies “deal a bit less damage,” as Embark puts it.</p>

 <p>The cost of ammo for the Hullcracker has also shifted, and arguably not for the better. Whereas you could snag a pack of 10 from the in-game traders for 6,000 Coins, you’ll now get 6 launcher ammo for 4,500.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p1z2on/comment/npu81ec/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment thread on Reddit discusses</a>, this might have the run-on effect of seeing fewer people rushing the Arc Queen as they’ll be a little less equipped, and with weaponry that requires some more careful aiming.</p>

 <h2>Embark takes aim at bugs and wall-glitching, but some issues remain</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ performance is mostly reliable, but folks found some unfortunate bugs that affected bullet collision, as well as exploits that allow players to glitch into rooms that are otherwise locked.</p> <p>The update brings improvements to those bullet issues on the map Blue Gate. It’s a nice start, but I know I’ve seen similar issues elsewhere, too. The patch notes detail “railing props [that] mistakenly blocked bullets” but say that “shots now pass through as expected.” Across the other maps, some other player collision issues were touched up.</p>

 <p>Players have also been exploiting some wall-glitching, allowing them to enter locked rooms without keys or to hide in unreachable ambush spots. Dam Battlegrounds has had an exploit that allowed access to the Control Tower fixed, while a specific wall in Spaceport that players were glitching into to jump unsuspecting players will no longer allow for this.</p>

 <p>Still, I’ve seen all sorts of locked doors bypassed by folks, not just the ones addressed by this patch. Hopefully there’ll be less of this.</p> <p>But perhaps the most frustrating movement issue occurs when trying to access an escape hatch while in a downed-but-not-out status. Normally, until you’re fully knocked out, you can crawl your way to an escape as the game lets you activate the elevator or escape hatch terminals while you’re down. But as documented well in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oxzevn/i_need_to_have_a_word_with_whoever_designed_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">this video on Reddit</a>, most hatches seem to sit atop a slope that can’t be climbed while crawling.</p>

   <p>It’s hard to tell if this is intentional or an oversight. But it’s clearly been a frustrating experience for those who’ve tried to make a daring last-minute escape via a hatch, only to find out they can’t crawl over a hump.</p> <h2>Good news (maybe) for duck fans</h2> <p>Lastly, update 1.3.0 will fill your Raider’s room with more rubber ducks, letting them spill over the floor if you have enough in your stash.</p> <p>It’s cute! But if you ask me, those ducks aren’t valuable enough to extract with and are otherwise too pointless for me to have them taking up room in my stash. So fear not, any rubber ducks I come across are deliberately left behind on the battlefield. You’re welcome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today’s Xbox Partner Preview had a bunch of big announcements and trailers like a new look at the upcoming <em>007 First Light </em>and the reveal of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860">follow-up to&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, but one of the surprise standouts for me was <em>Zoopunk</em>, a new action game by <em>F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch&nbsp;</em>developer TiGames, starring a bunch of anthropomorphic animals in a sort of dark, science-fiction post-apocalypse. However, as more news is trickling out, it’s beginning to look like the game might be using AI generation tools, and that has deflated my interest.</p> <p><em>Zoopunk</em>‘s fast-paced combat looks slick and stylish, but maybe a little stiff at first glance. I’m curious to see how it feels when the controller’s in my hands. Growing up playing&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>made me very picky about character action games in the PS2 era, so if one doesn’t feel good to play, I tend to bounce off of it very quickly. But what TiGames showed in the first trailer has potential.</p>

  <p>However, what didn’t come up during the Xbox showcase was that <i>Zoopunk </i>was also used as part of a Stable Diffusion AI asset generation demo earlier this year. The video, which is currently “unlisted” on the game’s YouTube channel, shows a user drawing simplistic equipment designs, which are then used to generate an in-game model. At the moment, it’s unclear if this is integrated into the game itself, or if <em>Zoopunk&nbsp;</em>was just used as a demo for the AI model. An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint/">NVIDIA announcement</a> from earlier this year also names the game as using AI-powered NPCs. We’ve reached out to TiGames for comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</p>  <p>Generative AI is creeping into video games more and more over recent years, with several executives at big companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">insisting it should become the norm within the industry</a>. Despite this, generative AI <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-slop-regulation-2000644735">has become a legal battleground</a> as these models are being trained on copyrighted works.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-philips-hue-3-bulb-pack-hits-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-on-black-fridays-first-day-2000645817</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-philips-hue-3-bulb-pack-hits-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-on-black-friday%E2%80%99s-first-day.1359922/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Traditional light switches offer exactly two settings: on and off, which leaves you stuck with whatever harsh overhead lighting the previous homeowner installed. The Philips Hue 3-pack <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/">just dropped to a record low of $69 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from the usual $109 price</a>.</p>
<p>Philips maintains strict pricing on Hue products throughout the year which makes Black Friday the only time these smart bulbs receive meaningful discounts. <strong>Smart lighting completely changes room ambiance</strong> by letting you tune color temperature, brightness and even hue to match your activity or mood rather than accepting whatever your builder-grade fixtures emit.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors</h2>
<p>The <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> range reproduces millions of distinct colors alongside the full spectrum of white light, <strong>from 2000K warm amber to 6500K cool daylight</strong>. You can bathe your living room in deep blue for movie nights, shift to energizing daylight white for morning routines or create warm orange tones for dinner ambiance. The color accuracy spans the entire visible spectrum, giving you precise control over the exact shade you want rather than cycling through preset options. Each bulb can display different colors simultaneously, so you might have blue accent lighting in one lamp while maintaining warm white in overhead fixtures. The 60W-<strong>equivalent brightness delivers 800 lumens at full power,</strong> and provides enough light for reading or detailed work rather than just mood lighting.</p>



<p>The<strong> bulbs connect directly to your home Wi-Fi network without needing a separate hub</strong>, but with the addition of a Hue Bridge come more advanced features: remote control from anywhere and more stable connections that don’t tax your router. Matter compatibility integrates Hue bulbs with other smart home devices across manufacturers, creating unified automation regardless of which ecosystem you’ve invested in. You can trigger lights based on motion sensors, door contacts, or time schedules without maintaining separate apps for each device brand. Secure connection protocols block unauthorized access to your lighting system while maintaining responsive control.</p>
<p><strong>Preset scenes</strong> offer one-touch lighting setups for frequent activities and times of day. The 24-hour natural light scene automatically adjusts color temperature throughout the day to simulate sunlight, gradually changing from warm tones at sunrise to bright daylight in the afternoon and back to amber hues at sunset. Such circadian lighting supports your body’s natural rhythm and could give you better sleep quality by reducing blue light exposure before going to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Voice control via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit</strong> means you won’t have to reach for your phone every time you want to issue basic lighting commands. The voice commands work with individual bulbs, rooms or zones that group multiple lights together. This is pretty handy when you’ve got messy hands from cooking, are settling into bed, or trying to get through the door while carrying groceries.</p>
<p>The <strong>standard A19 form factor fits any fixture</strong> designed for traditional bulbs, from table lamps to ceiling fixtures to bathroom vanities. The bulb screws into E26 sockets designed for standard medium-base bulbs, requiring no special adapters or modifications. LED technology remains cool to the touch and uses a mere 9 watts while delivering <strong>brightness equivalent to 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong>, and reduces electricity costs while lasting 25,000 hours or roughly 22 years at three hours daily use.</p>
<p>At $69 for three bulbs, this Black Friday deal brings the per-bulb cost down to $23, which undercuts Philips’s regular single-bulb pricing of $49. You’re getting full-color smart bulbs from the industry leader in smart lighting for less than many color-changing bulbs from unknown brands.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-dumps-its-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-with-4-ports-now-going-for-pocket-change-2000645791</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ugreen-dumps-its-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-with-4-ports-now-going-for-pocket-change.1359919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wall outlets disappear fast when every device needs its own charging brick cluttering power strips and blocking adjacent sockets. The <strong>Ugreen</strong> <em>Nexode</em> 65W GaN charger <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">just hit a record low of $24 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from its usual $39 price</a>. This four-port charger consolidates multiple charging bricks into a single compact unit that occupies one outlet while powering your laptop, phone, tablet, and wireless earbuds simultaneously. When traveling, carrying four separate chargers involves dedicating a lot of valuable bag space to power adapters, whereas this single charger handles everything. GaN technology keeps the charger cool and efficient while intelligently outputting a total 65W across three USB-C ports and one USB-A port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Powers Your MacBook at Full Speed</h2>
<p>The<strong> 65W maximum output is enough to fast-charge a MacBook Air at its full charging rate,</strong> and reach 51% battery in just 30 minutes. This matches the charging speed you’d get from Apple’s own 61W charger, so you’re not settling with the Ugreen as some kind of compromise. Power delivery is via USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 protocol that negotiates optimal charging rates with compatible devices automatically.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-port configuration includes three USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong> that can cover modern devices alongside legacy gadgets. That three-USB-C setup means you can charge your laptop, phone, and tablet simultaneously using the same type of cable without hunting for different connectors. This design leaves the USB-A port for older devices, wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and accessories that haven’t transitioned to USB-C yet. Dynamic distribution of the total 65W output by intelligent power distribution allows for the <strong>charger to adjust the output based on what devices you plug in</strong> and their power requirements.</p>
<p>Gallium nitride technology replaces traditional silicon components found in the charger with more efficient materials that conduct electricity much better while generating less heat. This efficiency enables Ugreen to pack 65W of charging power<strong> into a charger that is significantly smaller than older silicon-based 65W adapters</strong>.</p>



<p>At compact dimensions,<strong> it measures just 2.64 by 1.65 by 1.5 inches</strong> and this charger is smaller than Apple’s single-port 67W adapter despite offering four ports and comparable power. This reduction in size matters enormously for travel: the charger easily fits into laptop bags, toiletry pouches, or jacket pockets without consuming excessive space. The foldable prongs collapse flat against the charger body and prevents them from snagging on bag contents or poking holes in pouches.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility includes MacBook Pro and Air series, iPhone 17/16/… series, Samsung Galaxy S25/S24/…, Pixel 10/9/…, iPad Pro, Steam Deck, and quite basically everything that charges via USB. It’s compatible across manufacturers and platforms without the need for brand-specific adapters or configurations. Charge Apple devices from USB-C ports and charge Android devices from the same ports without any compatibility issues.</p>
<p>At $24, this Ugreen 65W charger is 39% off retail while bringing features and performance that are in line with chargers costing upwards of $60 from premium brands.</p>
