              <p>A catastrophic data loss goes way beyond just losing files. You could have digitized photos or home movies on your hard drive, and if they’re not backed up when your computer meets with a sudden disaster, they’re gone forever. That’s when your data loss becomes a huge ball of emotional stress that you really could do without.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">The $70 price attached to the Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive at Amazon during a limited-time deal</a> might be the least expensive insurance policy you’ll find today, and that’s true for PC and Mac users, and also Xbox and PlayStation gamers. (Because losing game data also sucks.) It’s two terabytes of plug-and-play, cross-platform-compatible peace of mind at an exceptional price.</p>

<h2>Fast and Secure</h2>
<p>The Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive works with USB 3.0 for super-fast file transfers of up to 120MB/s, and also with USB 2.0 on older devices. Either way, there’s no app or driver you need to install, and it doesn’t need any external power source. It’s strictly plug-and-play across all of its compatible platforms. The included 18-inch USB 3.0 cable gives you flexibility when it comes to where to set up the drive. (There’s really nothing worse than those cheap 4-inch cables packaged with other drives.)</p>
<p>The Seagate 2TB drive works with automatic backup apps like Apple’s Time Machine, and also as a drag-and-drop interface. If you want to take your data or game files on the go, the Seagate is literally pocket-sized, barely over a half-inch in thickness and exceptionally light, and built sturdily enough that you don’t have to worry about tossing it into a backpack on your way out the door.</p>



<h2>Backup for your Backup</h2>
<p>Things <em>do</em> happen, which is why you’re buying a reliable backup drive in the first place. And if some awful fate were to befall your Seagate drive, it comes with a year of Seagate’s Rescue Service, which depending on the severity of the damage would either repair the drive or extract the data from it and send it back to you on a new drive.</p>
<p>A smart and increasingly common practice is to copy your most precious and/or sensitive data and files onto one drive and store it in a safe location outside of your home, thus covering yourself in case of fire or other natural disaster. At the current $70 Amazon price for the 2TB Seagate Portable Hard Drive, having one emergency backup drive offsite and another to keep with your computer is a smart tactic. But having at least one fast, reliable backup drive is essential, so <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">head to Amazon now and grab a Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive while it’s on sale for just $70.</a></p>

              <p>What is good noise? “Golden” by Hunter/X from <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em> is good noise. New episodes of Jamie Loftus’ <em>Sixteenth Minute (of Fame) </em>podcast is good noise. The guns firing in the bank heist scene of Michael Mann’s <em>Heat</em> is good noise. What about bad noise? The couple on the bus with you arguing is bad noise. The turbine engines on flight is bad noise. Your cubicle’s neighbor punching away at their mechanical keyboard is bad noise. Wouldn’t it be swell if we could just cancel out the bad noise so we can focus in on the good noise? Well, you can do just that with <strong>the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless noise cancelling headphones.</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">For a limited time, Amazon has them for a whopping 43% off this labor day weekend. Normally priced at $348, you can currently pick them up for a solid $150 off.</a> That means you only have to pay $198.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones utilize digital noise cancellation to ensure you can hear each and every note or word clearly with no disruptive sounds from your environment coming through. Two microphones in each earcup work together to capture and eliminate surrounding noise when listening to your music, podcasts, or audiobooks, removing it in real time with the help of the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1.</p>

<p>The noise-cancelling tech also works to amplify your voice during calls. Five microphones work to deliver clear voice quality. They isolate your voice from any background noise so the person on the other end hears you and just you.</p>
<p>The headphones are designed for all day listening. You can expect a full 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. That’ll last you the whole workday, your commute, and beyond. If you ever find yourself having forgotten to charge it, no need to worry. Just plugging it in for 10 minutes will let you listen for a solid five hours.</p>



<h2>Multipoint Connection</h2>
<p>One standout convenience with the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones is that they can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at once. This is great as it allows you to be connected to your phone and a gaming console at the same time. It’s perfect for wanting to listen to your own music or podcasts through Spotify or something while playing a game on your Nintendo Switch. You can take a call without disconnecting and reconnecting anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">Through Labor Day weekend, you can grab yourself a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless noise-cancelling headphones for $150 off.</a> The price is down to just $198 for a limited time.</p>
