The Switch game was announced at last year’s Pokémon Day Presents showcase, but we only saw a teaser and got a few sparse details about what the game will entail. Since <em>Z-A </em>is supposed to launch this year, this show is developer Game Freak’s opportunity to finally start the marketing campaign in earnest and show people what they can expect to play later this year. Right now we know the game takes place <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552">entirely in the metropolis of Lumiose City</a></span>, which sounds like a departure from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-gameplay-model-scarlet-violet-1849105177&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-gameplay-model-scarlet-violet-1849105177"><em>Legends: Arceus</em>’</a></span> open zone structure that took you to multiple areas and ecosystems within the Hisui region. If you’re hoping to see the next generation of <em>Pokémon </em>during the stream, it’s probably best to temper your expectations, as <em>Z-A </em>will likely be the focus on the RPG side of things. But hey, both <em>Legends: Arceus</em> and <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> launched in the same year, so crazier things have happened.</p><p>Beyond the big RPGs, The Pokémon Company uses these presentations to provide updates on the various live-service games in its portfolio. So expect to hear about the future of the creature-catching app <em>Pokémon Go</em>, the MOBA <em>Pokémon Unite</em>, the card-collecting game <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>, and the gacha game <em>Pokémon Masters EX</em>. We’ll also probably hear something new about the anime, whether that be the syndicated show <em>Pokémon Horizons</em> or the limited-run series that the company posts to YouTube. An animated short called <em>Dragonite and the Postman</em> is set to premiere online that day.</p><p><em>Pokemon </em>had a somewhat quiet year in 2024 without a big new RPG, but that also meant it wasn’t as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-van-gogh-go-remote-raids-1851128900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-van-gogh-go-remote-raids-1851128900">embroiled in controversy</a></span> as it was in 2023.

And in a lot of ways it does feel cut from the same cloth as its predecessor, but there are also some very important ways in which it doesn’t. The biggest of those is speed. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unless you’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257">mastered <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span> across multiple playthroughs, it can have a deceivingly plodding pace. You can run, jump, and explore anywhere you want. But <em>Elden Ring</em>, like other FromSoftware games, quickly teaches you to be wary of leaping before you look. Unexpected hazards and low-level enemies threaten to kill unsuspecting players around every corner. Through trial and error, <em>Elden Ring </em>trains its tarnished to be cautious, watchful, and prepared. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-beta-test-dark-souls-1851761180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-beta-test-dark-souls-1851761180"><em>Nightreign</em> is the opposite of that</a></span>. The multiplayer roguelite is not technically a battle royale, but it can often feel like one. Giant birds carry you through the sky and drop you off at specified locations. A damage-dealing ring of blue light is constantly closing in around you and your teammates across a randomized map based on the original game’s Limgrave. You then race to grind XP and collect loot before a day-night cycle ends with a showdown against a past FromSoftware boss at the center of the map. <br></p><p>I played a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-fromsoftware-ps5-1851763458?_gl=1*nw4ssz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAxNTA5LjM2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-fromsoftware-ps5-1851763458?_gl=1*nw4ssz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAxNTA5LjM2LjAuMA..">few hours of <em>Nightreign</em>’s network test last weekend</a></span> and was surprised just how much the game encourages you not to dilly-dally. In addition to moving much, much faster than you do in <em>Elden Ring</em>, you also have to race against the clock to level up and find better gear in preparation for the scaling difficulty of the ensuing encounters. I thought our random trio would be methodically canvasing the map for secrets and fighting at one another’s backs. Instead, exploration was a chaotic scramble to ransack the map. </p><p>That is not the type of experience I associate with <em>Elden Rin</em>g, but that doesn’t make it a bad one. In some ways, <em>Nightreign</em> is closer to a multiplayer <em>Hades</em> than a traditional Soulsborne. Its action is more arcade-y, and the runs progress quickly and efficiently. And what can feel like a shallow free-for-all in the beginning comes into sharper focus during the boss fights which pit players against everything from Margit, The Fell Omen to a pack of three-headed hounds that spit fire. Here the pace slows back down some and offers a deep challenge more inline with the learning curves and the satisfying games of cat-and-mouse I associate with <em>Elden Ring</em> proper. </p><p>My squad and I weren’t able to finish any runs, ultimately dying each time to the Cerberus Night Lord with only half its health depleted. While you can revive companions by hacking away at their downed corpses, health potions are still finite and the last leg of the boss fight eventually depleted both our resources and our resolve. But even in failure I immediately wanted to plunge back into <em>Nightreign </em>and start a new run, not usually the feeling I get from  repeatedly dying in a FromSoftware game. That tells me <em>Nightreign</em>, while unorthodox, is on the right track, perhaps especially for those like me who enjoy the studio’s games but aren’t ride-or-die fans of them. </p><p>It helps that each run, win or lose, nets you new Relics that can be equipped for better stat bonuses on subsequent attempts. It’s this  loop, coupled with multiple classes (eight in the full game) and the teamwork around boss fights, that gives <em>Nightreign</em> a bit of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s loot flavor within its larger roguelite RPG framework. It’s not trying to be a live-service game, but it is the kind of thing I see myself getting the crew together to play in between <em>Rocket League</em> matches and <em>Helldivers 2</em> missions. It’s already been revealed that additional bosses and character classes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will eventually arrive in DLC</a></span>. For now, I’m looking forward to digging deeper into what’s already there when the full game drops on May 30. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
