              <p>LEGO released its 2025 Advent calendars just a few weeks ago, and they‚Äôre already vanishing from Amazon‚Äôs shelves at an alarming rate. The<strong> Lego City calendar is completely sold out</strong>, <strong>Minecraft has disappeared</strong>&nbsp;and most other themes have either limited stock or inflated prices. Surprisingly, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/">Lego Friends Advent Calendar remains available and has dropped to an all-time low of $20, down from its original $34 price</a>. For parents trying to stretch holiday budgets while keeping the magic alive through December, this is one of those deals that won‚Äôt last long once word gets out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Advent calendars solve a specific parenting challenge every December: Kids need something to channel their excitement during those long weeks leading up to Christmas, and a daily surprise keeps them engaged without the sugar overload of chocolate-filled alternatives. This<strong>&nbsp;set delivers 237 pieces spread across 24 doors, giving children aged six and up</strong> a new building project each morning.</p>
<h2>What‚Äôs Different This Year About The Calendar?</h2>
<p>LEGO recently rebranded the Friends theme with greater emphasis on varied storytelling and everyday situations that children are more likely to connect with. This 2025 calendar shows that transition with a holiday sleepover theme that seems more down to earth than releases from earlier years. The package <strong>contains five mini-dolls: Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo</strong>&nbsp;who come with sleeping mats that complete a whole indoor campout setup. The choice of characters reflects varied personality types and interests so that children may enter the narrative on several different levels.</p>



<p>The animal companions add another layer of play value: <strong>Two dogs, a guinea pig, a gecko, and a cat</strong> come with their own accessories like food stations, water dispensers, scratching posts and pet beds. Each animal‚Äôs accessories are scaled to match the mini-doll world so kids can actually integrate them into ongoing play scenarios beyond December.</p>



<p>The day-by-day builds range from tiny accessories in early December to larger interactive pieces as we build up to Christmas. Early dates may open with wrapped gift boxes or a table lamp, while later dates open up the fireplace with flame elements, a working sled with space for a minidoll, and a life-sized LEGO reindeer figure. The karaoke machine features a microphone piece that is compatible with a minidoll‚Äôs hand, and the hot chocolate stand includes mugs proportionate to the figures.</p>
<p>The scene-building potential extends well past December 25th. The sofa seats two minidolls comfortably, the Christmas tree comes with decorative elements that can be rearranged, and the hobbyhorse has a spring mechanism built into its base. These aren‚Äôt single-use holiday decorations. They <strong>become permanent additions to any existing LEGO Friends collection, compatible with playsets like the Heartlake City buildings</strong> and vehicles sold separately.</p>
<p>At $20, this calendar is cheaper than several single LEGO Friends expansion packs while offering more variety. The retail price of $34 already offered good value compared to purchasing single blind bags or accessory packs over the course of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Selling autographed merchandise has become so lucrative that celebrities and athletes are told </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-very-important-reason-celebrities-wont-use-blue-pens-for-autographs_uk_658059cee4b08e9b410b51f7"><span>not to sign anything with blue ink</span></a><span> because it‚Äôs believed that this makes their John Hancock easier to scan and forge. It‚Äôs true that if you don‚Äôt actually see someone sign something in front of you, it‚Äôs pretty difficult to verify if a signature is legitimate, so it‚Äôs good to be cautious when buying signed merchandise from a third party. Luckily some public figures, like </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>director Yoko Taro, are willing to call out phonies peddling fake autographs for profit.</span></p> <p><span>A </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fan on X sent Taro a screenshot of a now-deleted auction of an autographed </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>soundtrack CD that the director had seemingly signed. At a glance, you wouldn‚Äôt know that it was forged. It even has a little sketch of Emil, a character from the </span><i><span>Nier</span></i><span> series whose mask Taro wears during public appearances and that he often includes in his signatures. However, Taro himself replied that ‚Äúnearly half‚Äù of the items for sale that are ostensibly bearing his signature are forged, including the one the fan had originally sent. After Taro put it on blast, the original auction listing was taken down.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn‚Äôt genuine. I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.<br>Ôºà‚óéË°Ä‚óéÔºâ <a href="https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo">https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo</a></p> <p>‚Äî yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1980304441493582021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Taro says he includes ‚Äúsmall, unknown features‚Äù in his signature to identify forgeries. A fan posted an image of Taro‚Äôs real signature as seen at a Square Enix event, and the differences are subtle but noticeable upon comparison. The R is longer, and the Y is kind of squiggly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">heres a real signature to compare everyone from the square enix cafe <a href="https://t.co/Heahqg06bI">pic.twitter.com/Heahqg06bI</a></p> <p>‚Äî la reina (rena) üåΩüêìüêüüíÄüêÖüòä (@ashykitten_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashykitten_/status/1980400732768817636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Well, that‚Äôs another scammer‚Äôs day ruined, at least. Hopefully, now that </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fans have been made aware of this, they won‚Äôt buy any fake Yoko Taro autographs. It‚Äôs also possible that forgeries get better now that those looking to make a quick buck know what to look for. So be careful out there, y‚Äôall.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Normally, this is where I‚Äôd talk about what Taro is working on right now, but we don‚Äôt really know, actually. I just finished a replay of </span><i><span>Nier: Automata, </span></i><span>and as much as I know people want more of those games, I‚Äôm pretty content with where it all ended. Hopefully Square Enix is considering giving </span><i><span>Nier Reincarnation </span></i><span>the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-demo-hands-on-impressions-jrpg-2000622687"><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>treatment</span></a><span> to bring it to consoles, given that the gacha game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><span>no longer playable</span></a><span> but contains a lot of major story revelations. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you‚Äôve ever dreamed of owning a piece of the Star Wars universe without needing a hangar bay or hyperdrive fuel, this might be your moment: The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary edition) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has just dropped to an all-time low of $67 on Amazon, down from its usual $84 price tag</a>. For fans who‚Äôve spent decades watching Han Solo‚Äôs legendary <em>‚Äúhunk of junk‚Äù</em> outrun Imperial Star Destroyers, this mid-scale collectible brings that iconic vessel right into your living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another Lego set that‚Äôs going to end up collecting dust in a closet: The <strong>921-piece build provides adult fans with something more</strong>: a moment to quit staring at a screen and immerse themselves in a trance-like building experience that requires several intense hours to complete. The set depicts the Millennium Falcon as it was seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with all of the details that made it so iconic in its debut.</p>
<h2>Unique LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is part of LEGO‚Äôs starship collection which is a special line of <strong>mid-scale models designed exclusively for display purposes rather than play</strong>. The completed model stands 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide so it‚Äôs massive enough to draw attention on a bookshelf or desk without dominating your available space. The stand that comes with it does more than simply support the ship upright. It‚Äôs designed to angle the Falcon dynamically so that it looks as if it‚Äôs banked hard on a turn while it makes a daring escape.</p>



<p>The build process itself rewards patience and attention to detail. With 921 pieces, <strong>you‚Äôre looking at roughly 4-6 hours of construction time</strong> depending on your experience level. Each section reveals new layers of complexity as you work from the interior framework outward to the iconic hull plating. The cockpit section alone requires careful placement of transparent pieces to recreate those viewport windows, while the external paneling uses clever techniques to achieve the ship‚Äôs famously asymmetrical profile. The rotating satellite dish connects through a simple but satisfying mechanism that lets you adjust its position after completion.</p>
<p>This price drop represents genuine value for collectors: The set typically hovers around $84, and previous sales rarely dipped below $75. At $67, you‚Äôre getting a premium adult-focused building experience for roughly the cost of a standard mid-range LEGO set. The <strong>4.9-star rating across more than 1,800 reviews</strong> speaks to consistent quality.</p>

              <p>If you‚Äôre going to play games on your desktop PC, any old monitor won‚Äôt do. Sure, it would be nice to have a massive OLED ultra-wide curved display, but that‚Äôs not really necessary either. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4896/">Samsung has an excellent low budget gaming monitor that‚Äôs usually in the couple hundred dollar range, but happens to be on sale right now for as much as 45% off.</a> We‚Äôre in a bit of a deals drought between the Amazon Prime Big Deals Days and next month‚Äôs Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, so this is a pretty darn good savings for this time of year.</p>

That discount knocks off an even $100, taking the price down from $280 to just $180.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ceo-weighs-in-on-streamer-assault-at-twitchcon-%E2%80%98i-care-deeply-about-emiru%E2%80%99.1330261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A video showing a fan assaulting <a href="https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2000637226&amp;action=edit">cosplay livestreamer Emily ‚ÄúEmiru‚Äù Schunk at TwitchCon 2025</a> made every online content creator‚Äôs worst nightmare go viral. It‚Äôs created a new crisis of confidence in Twitch as streamers worry about how seriously the Amazon-owned platform is taking their safety and security. Comments from Twitch‚Äôs CEO did little to dispel those concerns.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe safety of our creators is our top priority,‚Äù Dan Clancy told Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602">in an interview</a> the day after the incident took place. ‚ÄúThe challenge we face is a challenge in today‚Äôs society. It‚Äôs not limited to Twitch, it extends throughout our society.‚Äù</p>

 <p>The executive waxed philosophical about community moderation before talking specifically about what happened with Emiru.&nbsp;‚ÄúI do think that when you‚Äôre livestreaming, in many ways, since you control your community and you can ban people, you can make it so that those people that you don‚Äôt want engaging with you and participating with you, aren‚Äôt there.‚Äù</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I asked Twitch CEO Dan Clancy about <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emiru</a> getting assaulted at Twitchcon and whether creators can trust the platform to keep them safe. Full interview will be out on my YouTube channel/podcast feed on Wednesday <a href="https://t.co/wTH13vhjBH">pic.twitter.com/wTH13vhjBH</a></p> <p>‚Äî Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Now, what happened yesterday, obviously, was something that we care deeply about securing this environment. We‚Äôre looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi. She‚Äôs a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there‚Äôs always more work to be done, because that‚Äôs the world we live in now.</p></blockquote> <p>But the actions of ‚Äúleaders in the industry‚Äù is not how Emiru has been describing Twitch‚Äôs response to the assault at its most recent event. In a video published the same day as the Clancy interview took place, she accused Twitch of lying about its response, claiming the platform‚Äôs initial desire was to just ban the alleged suspect for 30 days instead of for life. Emiru also claimed that no one from Twitch security immediately came to her aid or apprehended the suspect to escort him from the show.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúLike if you watch the clip, the security guard who pushes the guy away is my security,‚Äù Emiru said. ‚ÄúThe woman who pulls me to the back, my manager. If you‚Äôre a small streamer and you don‚Äôt have those resources or someone in your line‚Äôs not filming, what the fuck do you do? No one would have known.‚Äù</p> <p>The incident has led to renewed warnings about Twitch personalities attending in-person events and even, in some cases, calls for new ownership of Twitch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lego has released plenty of Harry Potter sets over the years, and with Halloween just around the corner, Amazon‚Äôs kicking off the celebrations early by putting quite a few of them on sale. We‚Äôve spotted Hagrid‚Äôs hut, Hogwarts Castle, and Aragog in the Forbidden Forest dropping in prices previously. But today, things are taking an even more magical turn ‚Äì straight into the dungeons.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/">Amazon is being generous with a 35% discount on the Hogwarts Castle: Potions Class Building set, offering it for just $26</a>. That‚Äôs a nice $14 discount on a set that‚Äôll fit beautifully into your current Harry Potter Lego setup, and even make a memorable gift for a fan in your family or friends. There‚Äôs no word on how long the discount will last, so it‚Äôs best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Four Key Characters From the Movies</h2>
<p>This set lets you recreate Professor Severus Snape‚Äôs lessons in his dungeon classroom. It comes with 397 pieces, and includes a blackboard, potion bottles, ingredient jars, shelves, and all the other elements you‚Äôll need to bring the setup to life. You‚Äôll also get four minifigures; a very angry Severus Snape (not even surprised), Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, and Seamus Finnigan. We would‚Äôve loved to see a confused Ron or Malfoy up to some mischief, but this lineup works just fine too.</p>



<p>The set also includes two randomly selected collectible Hogwarts portraits. These are part of a larger collection of 14, and can be a valuable addition to your collection if you‚Äôve got one. As with all Lego sets, you‚Äôll get a step-by-step instruction book that walks you through the entire build. It‚Äôs pretty easy to follow, even for kids who are building for the first time, but if you need more help, we recommend installing the Lego Builder app. You‚Äôll get 3D instructions, so you can view every step from all angles to get a better idea. There‚Äôs also a ‚ÄúBuild Together‚Äù mode, which is great for when multiple people are working on the same set. Plus, you can keep track of your progress, and see all your Lego projects in one place.</p>
<p>All in all, this set offers a great chance to relive a classic Harry Potter moment, and bring your favorite characters home. It‚Äôs made for ages 8 and up, but you can also treat yourself to it (no judgements), or gift it to a Wizarding World fan in your life.</p>
