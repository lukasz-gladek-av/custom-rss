Others slowly accrue cult status over months and years. Some are finally released and quickly overlooked, cherished by a small coterie of early players and completely unknown to everyone else who might have fallen in love with them. Every year we try to give a handful of the most underappreciated games a quick plug in hopes that others will give them a much-deserved first or second look. Here are some of our favorite hidden gems from 2024.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tiny-terry-turbo-trip-review-simpsons-hit-run-steam-pc-1851517168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-terry-turbo-trip-review-simpsons-hit-run-steam-pc-1851517168"><em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</em></a></span><em> </em>is for <em>Simpsons: Hit and Run</em> sickos. You’re a kid who lies to his family to get a job with a taxi company completing jobs and collecting junk to upgrade your ride. It’s colorful, funny, and has the responsive-feeling controls to match its quirky world. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p><em>Crypt Custodian</em> is a top-down Metroidvania with <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>vibes. You play a cat who’s the janitor of the afterlife. Lots of platforming and puzzling ensues. The art direction is top-notch, the music is calming, and the world is masterfully crafted for an alluring but not frustrating time exploring a gorgeous world. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>If you want something that looks like <em>Pentiment</em> but plays like a <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>-style 2D tactics game, look no farther <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/inkulinati-pc-xbox-medieval-art-manuscript-impressions-1850205499?_gl=1*1m8y9w2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDY0NjIwMy4xNTYuMC4xNzM0NjQ2MzkyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/inkulinati-pc-xbox-medieval-art-manuscript-impressions-1850205499?_gl=1*1m8y9w2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDY0NjIwMy4xNTYuMC4xNzM0NjQ2MzkyLjYwLjAuMA..">than <em>Inkulinati</em></a></span>. The game takes place inside a medieval manuscript and features plenty of challenging strategic scenarios and goofy animal humor. It came out of Early Access this year and offers a deep and engaging package despite the small scale and straightforward ideas. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Starstruck: Hands of Time</em> feels like the sort of bonkers genre mashup we don’t really get anymore. A time-traveling rhythm game, there’s elements of <em>Katamari</em> and <em>Guitar Hero </em>with an original art style borrowing from 3D sculpture and 2D collage. It doesn’t completely deliver on its ambitions, but swings for the fences like anything can happen. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A twin-stick shooter meets <em>Zelda </em>dungeoneering sounds like putting peanut butter on pickles and tastes just as good. <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> is like playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</em> as Star Fox. You explore a top-down map to unlock new paths and upgrades and take on bosses with punchy shooting that controls like a classic arcade game. It’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765">just damned brilliant</a></span>.” — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>I was turned onto Mask Quest by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em>’s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell</a></span>. It’s a precision platformer about controlling your breath while navigating a modern city and all of its contemporary socio-political hazards. It’s short, thoughtful, and brutal. “The cleverness of the game’s level design is as double-edged as the humor,” writes Evans-Thirlwell. ”It gracefully weaponizes and politicizes the casual sadism of any game that defines itself as a series of goals and punishments.” — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>What if<em> Hotline Miami </em>was more like <em>Silent Hill</em>? Enter <em>Conscript</em>, a WWI top-down horror stealth game about smashing enemy soldiers’ heads in while trying to escape the trenches. It’s slow, plodding, and at times tortuous. It’s all beautifully and hauntingly presented. It lures you into a sense of tedious exhaustion and then—BANG—you’re dead. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A cozy sandbox builder where you make shops and homes by the water, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing <em>Summerhouse</em></a></span> is like inhabiting a postcard from a long-lost friend. It’s reminiscent of what <em>Kingdom</em> did for tower defense strategy games, imposing 2D pixel art constraints to bring the virtues into sharper relief. It’s chill, adorable, and breathtaking. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Dungeons of Dreadrock</em> was a sleeper hit in 2022 that now frequently appears in “best of” lists, a fantastically smart puzzle game in which you descended 100 floors of a tower to save your brother from a grisly sacrifice. Its sequel repeats the formula, but this time from a second perspective, a character you likely forgot meeting in the first game, going through her own 100-story challenge. And the result is an even smarter set of excellent puzzles and lovely dialogue that nimbly sets up the third and final part of the trilogy. — John Walker </p></div><div><p>If <em>Minit </em>were a slide puzzle game, it would look like <em>Slider</em>. You move pieces of the world around to rearrange, rebuild, and progress through it. It can be incredibly simple and devastatingly hard at the same time. It’s free and no one has an excuse not to give it a try. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Master Key</em> is another riff on<em> Zelda</em>. This one is is as monochromatic and stripped down as it gets, focusing on the items you collect and the obstacles they help you to overcome. It shares DNA with modern indie gems like <em>Animal Well</em> and <em>Tunic</em>, though it’s more rough around the edges. Do yourself a favor and play it on easy. —Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Too many games are mawkish, and not enough games are honestly sad. <em>The Night Is Grey</em>, with its wonderfully solemn and beautiful story, defies this trend. This point-and-click adventure is a tangle of haunted pasts, and one that is self-aware enough to avoid the traditionally silly puzzles of the genre, even coldly chastising the player when one such traditional, silly solution is tried. It’s a game about a man trying to protect a small child, but it rebels against the tropes of that formula in a way that’ll gut-punch you hard. — John Walker </p></div><div><p><em>Dread Delusion</em> is a <em>Morrowind</em>-inspired low-poly RPG that finally hit 1.0 this year and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896">didn’t disappoint</a></span>. What it lacks in deep first-person combat, it makes up for with an incredible-looking world to explore and a mythical atmosphere suffused with whimsy and horror. The exploration, writing, and story deliver an experience unlike any other. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>The Crimson Diamond</em> looks and plays like something from 1988, an adventure game with gorgeous, vibrant EGA graphics and a text parser interface. Yes, that means you must actually type things like “look” and “open door,” a thought which may have some potential players rolling their eyes, but it’s actually great! The game deftly pulls you into its early-20th-century murder mystery with its plucky heroine and colorful cast of suspects. The text parser, meanwhile, lets you engage with those suspects and the environment in delightful and engaging ways that, despite being nods to games from nearly 40 years ago, feel fresh and invigorating, and make me more optimistic about the state of the adventure game genre today. I’ll allow myself a pun here and just end by saying that this game is a real gem. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>If you like reading random internet pages about made-up things and then leveraging your new expertise in creepy, intimate scenarios with complete strangers, <em>Home Safety Hotline</em> is the game for you. It’s a <em>Papers, Please</em>-like that combines soul crushing call center work with a beautiful Windows 97 aesthetic and a Cryptid-infused riff on <em>Night Trap</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p> There are plenty of city builders on Steam, but not many (if any) are all about creating bustling towns on the side of a giant mountain. <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em>, out in Early Access, asks you to develop and grow thriving cities using tiny cliffs as you and your crew climb up a mountain. The game is a bit tricky at times, but at least the view is lovely up there. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
