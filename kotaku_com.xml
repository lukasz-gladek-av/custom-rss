But according to the devs, they wanted to make a bigger, better game, and cutting multiplayer let them do that. </p><p>“There’s only the campaign, and we decided that from the beginning,” said Stratton. “We wanted to free ourselves to create experiences like the mech and the dragon. Those are both like their own mini-games in the game. We decided to put all our effort into creating the biggest and best campaign we’ve ever made.”</p><p>Martin added: “We didn’t do multiplayer so that we could make a better single-player game. Like, we couldn’t have done the mech and the dragon and all that other stuff if we spread the resources around different game pillars, so we’ve really just focused on single player.”</p><p>Martin and Stratton were also asked if <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is an open-world game. Id Software says it’s the biggest game they have ever made and features the largest levels seen in a <em>Doom </em>game, but the devs were clear that this isn’t an open-world game like <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Assasssin’s Creed. </em></p><p>“It’s definitely not an open-world game, but it is the most expansive world we’ve ever built,” explained Stratton. </p><p>“You really feel like you’re on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear <em>Doom</em> to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.”</p><h2 id="h26651"><a id=""></a><em>Dark Ages</em> isn’t inspired by <em>Quake </em>and it’s not the end of a trilogy</h2><p>Martin also said that a big thing they learned from <em>Eternal </em>was that too many currencies and skill trees can complicate a game in ways that aren’t fun. So instead, this time around exploring will make you stronger via <em>The Dark Ages</em>’ simplified progression system. </p><p>Martin also denied that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is inspired by <em>Quake</em>. Instead, <em>Batman</em> comics inspired the developers. “The inspiration was more something like <em>Batman: Year One</em> and <em>300</em>,” said Martin. </p><p>“I’m a pretty big comic book fan. But yeah, there were rumors that it was called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253"><em>Doom: Year Zero</em></a></span> and that was what we called it internally. I still think it was a really cool name, although <em>Dark Age</em>s is pretty cool, too.”</p><p>Finally, Martin was asked if <em>Dark Ages</em>, being the third game in a trilogy, is the end of this era of <em>Doom</em>. </p><p>“I don’t think I can answer that. We’re not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, I like making <em>Doom </em>games. I wouldn’t have a problem doing this for a long time. But this isn’t designed to be the end of something.”</p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on May 15 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, and Game Pass. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Naturally, that also means they’re a hot commodity for merchants too. <strong>It’s worth checking out every shop and NPC merchant as many will be selling unique clothes.</strong> <br></p><p>This ranges from the shops open all the time to the ones that only appear during a specific time of day. From what I can tell, all clothing is limited stock and sold out once you’ve purchased them. This is a stark contrast to shops with crafting materials that will eventually restock over time.</p><h2 id="h8710"><a id="nodes"></a>Upgrade nodes in the Heart of Infinity</h2><figure id="" data-id="b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-recommend-id="image://b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-recommend-id="image://b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Heart of Infinity fulfills the role of the game’s skill tree.

You’ll have plenty of time to explore, but something sure to catch your eye is the Gumball-machine-looking device called the Surprise-O-Matic.</p><p><strong>Acting like its own gacha banner with an exclusive item pool, the Surprise-O-Matic will drop a random piece of clothing every time you use it.</strong> The catch is that it costs 20,000 Bling to make a single pull. Additionally, there is no pity system to help you attain the rarer pieces. You could easily spend millions of Bling here before you get a 5-star piece.

They do have a pity system to guarantee you receive a certain rarity after a while, but it still operates mostly on chance. If you see a particular item you just have to get, I recommend grinding out for the appropriate crystals.</p><h2 id="h8713"><a id="store"></a>Use Stellarites at the in-game store</h2><figure id="" data-id="f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-recommend-id="image://f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-recommend-id="image://f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll be able to exchange for <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s various currencies through the in-game shop. This includes Diamonds, the aforementioned gacha-related crystals, and the premium currency known as Stellarite. <strong>This Store offers many things to buy with Stellarite, including exclusive outfits that can’t be unlocked elsewhere.</strong></p><p>Many of these outfits are offered on a limited-time basis. They also cost between 60 and 2980 Stellarite, which roughly translates to $1-$45. Make sure to have a calculator out to help with the awkward bundle amounts and first-time double bonuses.</p><hr><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> has a ton of clothing items to discover and craft. We’re sure to get even more outfits and maybe even more ways to unlock them once some big updates have rolled out. Needless to say, you’ll always have plenty of choices to make the right fit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s January, and that means Xbox held another one of its annual Developer Direct showcases to talk about some games coming to Xbox Series X/S and Windows. We knew a few games that would be featured, including <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>South of Midnight</em>, but Microsoft had also teased a surprise announcement from a mystery studio, and the presentation started by reminding viewers that each game shown will be available on Game Pass at launch. If you want to watch the show yourself you can do so below, but for those who just want the bullet points, read on.</p></div></div><div><p>Kicking off the show was the surprise game: <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta </em>developer PlatinumGames are working on a new <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>game in the style of the series’ 3D reboot trilogy that ran from 2004 to 2012. It  will feature two playable characters in returning protagonist Ryu Hayabusa and a new character named Yakumo who is following in Ryu’s footsteps to become a master ninja. Platinum seems like a perfect choice for reviving the series, which is known for stylish, fast-paced combat and its punishing difficulty. It will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall.</p></div><div><p>After the <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>showcase, Team Ninja also announced it’s bringing a revamped version of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> to modern platforms today in the form of <em>Ninja Gaiden II Black</em>. It’s available on PC and Xbox Game Pass, so if you’re a subscriber you can grab it as part of your membership.</p></div><div><p>Next up was Compulsion Games showing off its dark fantasy adventure <em>South of Midnight</em>. The studio showed a bit of protagonist Hazel’s nature-based magic and how she utilizes it when fighting monsters that are inspired by Southern folklore and the game’s “Southern gothic” aesthetic. It’s giving PS2-era action game and I’m here for it. <em>South of Midnight </em>is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S on April 8.</p></div><div><p>To give us a quick break between all the action-oriented games, Sandfall Interactive showed off <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. As the name implies, the turn-based RPG follows an expedition of people in a French-based fantasy world that is ruled over by a malevolent goddess who is able to kill people over a certain age. <em>Expedition 33 </em>marries real-time and turn-based combat, though it seems this will be highly customizable and those who prefer to keep the real-time elements to a minimum can do so. The game will launch on April 24 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show was an extended look at <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. The game is a prequel to the 2016 <em>Doom</em> and takes place in a hellscape that feels both futuristic and Middle Ages, a fusion that’s also reflected in the game’s  medieval-style weapons and mayhem. The shield saw, which basically functions like a Captain America shield with a buzzsaw attachment, was the star of the show, and you can use it to deflect attacks or throw it at enemies and watch it slice into them as you close in with your shotgun. Developer id Software also showed off giant mech and dragon combat, and I have to hand it to the <em>Doom </em>series, it knows how to capture “middle-school binder” excess and make it work. The game will launch on PC, Playstation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 15.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, we get to see the Doom Slayer<em> </em>during the wars in Hell that happened eons ago in the franchise’s timeline. (Yes, the series has lore, its not all super shotguns and demons.)</p><p>Here’s the full <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> presentation from the event: </p><p>In <em>Dark Ages</em>, the iconic Doom Slayer will face more enemies than ever before in <em>Serious Sam</em>-like battles in large battlefields.

And this time around, Id Software wants you to feel like a big, heavy tank instead of a high-flying jet fighter. The studio really wants players to “stand and fight” in this entry. To help really sell the fantasy of being an unstoppable warrior, <em>Dark Ages f</em>eatures three melee weapons with upgrades and finishers. Oh but don’t worry, there are plenty of wild medieval-themed firearms, too. And yes, you get a fully drivable mech, something teased in past games.</p><p>It ain’t all killing and blasting, though, as Id Software promises a lot of exploration and secrets to find. Large open levels, described by Id as “<em>Doom </em>sandboxes,” will include platforms and puzzles, and if you complete these challenges you’ll unlock upgrades to make the Doom Slayer a stronger murder machine. (Okay, I guess it does all come back to killing.) </p><p><em>Dark Ages</em> also features a bunch of difficulty sliders that will let you change how fast and hard the game is, making it easy for everyone to hop in and kill demons. </p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Game Pass on May 15. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
