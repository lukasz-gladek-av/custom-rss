              <p>Amazon sells Insignia-branded TVs despite the brand being owned by competitor Best Buy and creates the unusual situation where Amazon’s platform promotes a rival’s house brand.&nbsp;Several popular sizes including <strong>55-inch and 75-inch variants have already sold out</strong> completely, but remaining models like this 50-inch version offer exceptional value that doesn’t justify spending significantly more on competing brands.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">55-inch TV costs $169 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299, and hits a record-low 43% discount</a> that makes 4K smart TVs cost less than many soundbars or streaming devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fire TV integration</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD resolution at 2160p has four times as many pixels as 1080p Full HD</strong>. This makes images sharper with text that is still readable, faces that show detail, and faraway objects that stay clear instead of becoming blurry copies. HDR10 support improves dynamic range by using metadata to adjust brightness and color on a scene-by-scene basis, and this lets you see more detail in shadows in dark scenes while keeping bright highlight information.</p>



<p>The wide color gamut shows more colors than standard dynamic range and makes images that are more colorful and realistic like what we see in real life, instead of the flat colors that SDR content has. The upscaling engine looks at content with lower resolution and smartly adds detail to make it look like 4K quality.</p>
<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate works well with regular TV and movie content</strong> because it has native frame rate support that stops the judder from happening on displays with different refresh rates. The refresh rate is good enough for almost all types of content, including streaming services, cable TV, and DVDs and Blu-rays, which never go above 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>You don’t need any extra streaming sticks or boxes to <strong>use the built-in Fire TV operating system to get to streaming services</strong> like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and thousands of other apps right away. The all-in-one design gets rid of the HDMI port, the need to switch between remotes, and the mess of cables that come with separate streaming devices.</p>



<p>With the <strong>smart home hub</strong>, you can watch camera feeds from compatible video doorbells and security cameras directly on the TV in picture-in-picture or full-screen mode. You can use voice commands to control Alexa-compatible lights, thermostats, and smart plugs through the TV remote. This makes it easier to manage your smart home without needing separate Echo devices or phone apps.</p>
<p>Insignia’s 50-inch 4K Fire TV is now the cheapest on Black Friday at $169: It <strong>costs less than many 32-inch TVs but has a much bigger screen and all the smart features you could want</strong>. This deal makes 4K smart TVs available at prices that have never been seen before so you can get big-screen entertainment without losing any of the important features.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crucial-x10-1tb-ssd-now-costs-less-than-a-dime-per-gb-actually-only-0-08-while-black-friday-supplies-last-2000647763</link>
            <guid>1367566</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cruising Amazon for the best Black Friday deals is a hunting expedition for those red digits next to the price — the negative numbers with the percentage sign that guide you to the biggest price drops. It was -13% that led us to the deal on the Crucial X10 1TB Portable SSD, but it was the Crucial name and the features of this awesome drive that led us to click “buy now.”</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">The new $85 Black Friday price on the Crucial X10 is well worth jumping on.</a> The 1TB capacity of this model of the X10 is enough to serve as a secure backup for tens of thousands of irreplaceable files. It’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, and many gaming consoles. The Crucial X10 transfers data at a fast 2,100MB/s, and it has advanced dust, water, and drop resistance built in. Crucial might not have as recognizable a name as SanDisk or Samsung or some of the other big tech companies, but the reputation and the performance are impeccable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny Yet Enormous</h2>
<p>When you click over to Amazon to check out the Crucial X10 the first thing you’ll notice is how much smaller it is than most other portable SSDs. Just 2.55 by 1.96 inches square and a truly remarkable 0.39 inches thick, it’s probably the most pocket-sized 4TB drive on the market. Even so, you don’t have to treat it with kid gloves — the Crucial X10 has IP65 dust and water resistance ratings, and drop resistance of nearly 10 feet.</p>
<p>With that kind of rugged construction combined with the 1TB capacity and outstanding speed of data transfer make the Crucial X10 a prime candidate for anything you would use a portable SSD for. Add 1TB of storage to your gaming console — it works with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox — and bring the extra games with you on the road. It’s a perfect Time Machine drive for automatic Mac backups, and as storage or transport for huge files like hi-res photo and video files, it’s a massive amount of space in a tiny package, and it can move the files back and forth to your editing station with great speed.</p>
<h2>Ditch the Thumb Drive</h2>
<p>Students, remote workers, and frequent business travelers have mostly relied on USB thumb drives for ferrying their files. They’re pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and inexpensive, so that tracks. But the Crucial X10? Pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and for a exceptionally fast, nearly universally compatible, massive-capacity drive, inexpensive. And unlike those thumb drives, the Crucial X10 can take a little bit of abuse, and isn’t going to glitch out on you like those cheap thumb drives. It’s a worthy investment in keeping your irreplaceable files safe and secure, especially during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">Amazon Black Friday sale with the fat 13% price drop that makes the Crucial X10 one of the best portable SSD buys of the day at just $230.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Dumps 22,000Pa Robot Vacuum at Zero-Profit, Self-Emptying Tech Now at All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-dumps-22000pa-robot-vacuum-at-zero-profit-self-emptying-tech-now-at-all-time-low-2000648426</link>
            <guid>1367527</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cheap robot vacuums that bump randomly around rooms, miss entire areas and get stuck constantly serve no purpose beyond cluttering the market and disappointing <strong>buyers who conclude that robot vacuums fundamentally don’t work</strong>. These failures damage the category’s reputation while advanced models demonstrate what’s actually possible when engineering takes priority over cost-cutting that creates barely functional products.</p>
<p>The <strong>Roborock Saros 10R</strong> represents ultra-premium robot vacuum technology that handles everything, and it is now available at <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">$999 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $1,599</a>. The $600 reduction brings this flagship model to pricing closer to Roborock’s mid-tier offerings before this sale, and makes the best autonomous cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>3.14-Inch Ultra-Slim Design That Fits Everywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>new slim 3.14-inch profile gets rid of the raised LiDAR towers</strong> that stop regular robot vacuums from getting under furniture with low clearance, where dust builds up without being disturbed. Cleaning beds, sofas, cabinets, and coffee tables is now possible instead of having to manually vacuum or let dust build up all the time.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000Pa suction gives it cleaning power that rivals high-end upright vacuums</strong>&nbsp;and the robot itself is small and can move around on its own. This powerful suction pulls out pet hair that is stuck deep in carpet fibers that weaker robots can’t reach, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines, and picks up fine dust from hardwood floors in one pass without needing to clean again. The <em>DuoDivide</em> main brush and <em>FlexiArm</em> <em>Riser</em> side brush don’t get tangled up so they can handle hair up to 40 cm long without the problems that other robots have.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm Riser</em> technology is the first of its kind in the industry: It lets <strong>both the side brush and the mop automatically reach corners and edges</strong> that fixed-position cleaning heads can’t get to. Watch the arm swing out when it gets close to baseboards. It cleans all the way up to the walls instead of leaving the one-inch dirt lines that regular robots leave along the edges.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis has wheels that can be <strong>adjusted independently and can climb over things up to 4 cm high</strong> like door thresholds, thick rugs, and cable runs that stop regular robots from working without help. The system changes the height of each wheel based on the terrain, keeping the robot stable as it goes over obstacles that would tip or beach standard robots with fixed chassis heights.</p>
<p>The dock does all of the maintenance work such as removing the mop automatically for vacuum-only modes, washing the mop with 176°F hot water to get rid of tough stains, drying it with 131°F hot air to stop mildew, c<strong>ollecting dust automatically every 60 days</strong>, refilling the tank automatically, dispensing detergent automatically, and cleaning the hot water dock itself.</p>
<p>Roborock’s best technology costs $999 on Black Friday which is the lowest price ever and it saves you $600. Their mid-range models don’t have the ultra-slim design, <em>FlexiArm</em> extension, <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis, or full dock automation that their best models do. If you want to really get rid of manual floor cleaning with technology that works, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-fire-tv-cube-is-2x-faster-than-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-and-can-be-yours-now-for-just-90-2000647768</link>
            <guid>1367524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is on a mission to make streaming easy for everyone with its compact, feature-packed devices, and the retailer is now letting you bring one home without paying the full price.</p>
<p>Black Friday kicks off tomorrow, but Amazon is already offering up to 50% off its top-rated entertainment gadgets, smart home devices, TVs, and more.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/"> The sale also brings the price of Amazon’s fastest-ever streaming media player — the Fire TV Cube — down to just $90.</a> That’s after a whopping 36% drop on the retail price of $140. Best of all, using the code ALEXAPLUS10 at checkout nets you another $10 discount in Amazon Credit with your purchase.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have an older Fire TV device lying around, you can trade it in to get an additional 20% off your total, plus an Amazon gift card, making the purchase even sweeter. But just note that such offers tend to wrap up fast, so you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the discounts. If you have been looking to give your entertainment experience a boost, now is the time to make that happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Hands-Free Streaming</h2>
<p>The cube, in a way, blends the functionality of both a streaming stick and an Echo. It comes with a built-in HDMI input and features additional ports for you to connect other entertainment devices for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>The new octa-core 2.0 GHz processor at the center makes it twice as fast as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, letting you launch apps and browse content within seconds. Support for Wi-Fi 6E translates into smoother 4K streaming with faster speeds, more bandwidth, and low latency, meaning you can search your favorite content fast, plus enjoy an uninterrupted, cinema-like viewing experience right from your couch. Visuals and sound don’t take a hit, either. 4K Ultra HD keeps picture quality lifelike, while Dolby Atmos Audio support puts the sound all around for a 3D experience. Super Resolution Upscaling makes it easy to convert an HD picture to 4K for better detail, so all your favorite classics are going to come to life, as well.</p>



<p>Navigating around is made easy with voice control. Not in the mood to press some buttons? Just ask Alexa to do it for you. You can find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. Just say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Christmas movies” or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and it’s going to pull every relevant title up in no time. Entertainment options come built right in, as well. The cube lets you stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes. You’ll have all your favorite streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more) in a single place. It even doubles as a speaker when you’re in the mood to listen to some songs in the background as you finish house chores.</p>
<p>Setting everything up couldn’t be easier. Simply connect the Fire TV Cube to your TV’s HDMI port, and then your WiFi. Follow the on-screen prompts to finish the process; as simple as that. If you have speakers around, it’s recommended to place the cube at least 1 to 2 feet away from them to avoid interference. The device also comes with early access to Alexa+, which is an advanced, more sophisticated version of the OG Alexa. It communicates better, understands context well, and can remember information from previous parts of a conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Thanks to Black Friday, the Fire TV Cube is now sitting at just $90, plus there are additional offers you can take advantage of to maximize your savings.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget $4,000 Apple VR Headset, Meta Quest 3S Drops to All-Time Low With 50K Units Sold on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-4000-apple-vr-headset-meta-quest-3s-drops-to-all-time-low-with-50k-units-sold-on-amazon-2000648422</link>
            <guid>1367458</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Meta Quest 3 established new VR standards when it launched but its premium pricing kept virtual reality aspirational rather than accessible for mainstream buyers. Meta addressed this barrier by releasing the Quest 3<strong>S</strong> as a lighter and more affordable variant that maintains core functionality while cutting costs through strategic compromises that most users won’t notice during actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the Quest 3S costs $249 for the 128GB model during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299</a>, which makes this the <strong>best entry point into modern VR</strong> without the $499 Quest 3 investment. The aggressive pricing combined with complete wireless freedom and instant access to 40-plus games creates exceptional value that explains why the 3S outsells its premium sibling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 That Works Well</h2>
<p>Qualcomm’s newest XR-specific silicon is optimized for the unique computational needs of virtual reality and it gives the processor twice the graphical processing power of the previous Quest 2 generation. Games load quickly so you don’t have to wait around like you did with older headsets and complex scenes render smoothly at high frame rates, which is important for avoiding motion sickness.</p>
<p>The next-generation graphics make the<strong> visuals almost as good as those on the PlayStation 5</strong> and they do it in standalone wireless headset form factors, which means you don’t need a gaming PC like you did with older VR systems, which were expensive and hard to use. The performance is good enough for demanding games like realistic simulators, fast-paced shooters and detailed adventure games that would stutter or crash on hardware that isn’t powerful enough.</p>



<p>The <strong>8GB of RAM is 33% more than what most budget VR headsets offer</strong>: This makes it easier to switch between VR environments, load textures with more detail without pop-in, and generally make the game more responsive. With more memory, developers can make more ambitious experiences with bigger worlds, more things on screen at once, and better graphics without having to make the trade-offs that come with limited RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>freedom of wireless technology gets rid of the cords</strong> that made early VR systems so annoying: Players had to always be aware of where the cords were so they wouldn’t trip or pull on the headsets while playing. During room-scale VR experiences for instance, you can move naturally through physical spaces. In shooters, you can spin 360 degrees to track enemies from all directions. This makes setup much easier and lets you use VR anywhere, not just in dedicated gaming rooms.</p>
<p>The <strong>two RGB color cameras let you see everything in full color and mix virtual objects with your real-world surroundings</strong> through mixed reality experiences. You can see your real furniture, walls, and surroundings in color, and virtual objects look like they belong there. This lets you play games that interact with real spaces. With passthrough, you can clearly see the real world instead of the grainy black-and-white feeds that made earlier systems confusing.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gorilla Tag bundle gives Quest 3S buyers special in-game items and 1,000 shiny rocks currency</strong>: This makes the social VR game even more valuable, and it’s become a huge hit. Instead of using traditional joystick controls, Gorilla Tag uses arm-swinging locomotion to simulate how gorillas move. This gives the game a unique physicality that makes it very popular even though the graphics are simple.</p>
<p>The <strong>included three-month trial gives you instant access to more than 40 games</strong> which means you won’t have to pay for software right after you buy new hardware. You can try out different types of VR experiences, like action games, creative tools, fitness apps, and social platforms, without spending hundreds of dollars on software before you know what types of games you like.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts for more than two hours</strong> which is enough for most gaming sessions without needing to stop and charge in the middle of a game, which breaks immersion. However, for longer marathon sessions, you’ll need to use a power bank or take breaks to charge. The runtime is long enough for most people who play for 30 to 90 minutes, which is about the same as the average attention span for active VR gameplay, which is more physically engaging than passive screen entertainment.</p>
<p>Meta’s current-generation VR technology costs less than many game consoles at the record-low price of $249 on Black Friday. If you’ve been curious about virtual reality but didn’t want to pay a lot for it, this deal makes modern VR possible at prices that make it worth it to try.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nothing Headphone (1) Clearly Can’t Make Profit at This Record Low, Now Over 2× Cheaper Than AirPods Max]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nothing-headphone-1-come-down-to-their-lowest-price-yet-for-black-friday-2000647680</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="62" data-end="797">There are countless reasons to invest in a quality pair of headphones—especially ones equipped with active noise cancellation. Being able to shut out the world and immerse yourself in what you <em data-start="255" data-end="265">actually</em> want to hear makes a huge difference, whether you’re stuck on a long, noisy flight or trying to concentrate in a busy workspace. If you’re in the market for a stylish and capable option, the Nothing headphones are worth a look. With their distinctive transparent design and sleek, technical aesthetic, they stand out visually. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">Currently, they’re available at a 20% discount. Normally priced at $299, you can pick them up now for $239, saving $60 for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>
<p data-start="799" data-end="1484">These headphones feature advanced, intelligent noise cancellation technology. Using next-generation processing and adaptive microphones, they continuously analyze your surroundings and automatically adjust the level of noise reduction. The over-ear design further enhances isolation by forming a secure acoustic seal around your ears. The result is a listening experience free from interruptions—perfect for music, audiobooks, or podcasts. When you need to re-engage with your environment, you can switch it over to Transparency Mode which lets outside sounds pass through naturally. This is especially helpful when walking through busy areas or responding to a coworker without removing your headphones.</p>

<h2 data-start="1486" data-end="1508">Hands-Free Control</h2>
<p data-start="1510" data-end="2171">The Nothing headphones conveniently offers an onboard control system that minimizes the need to reach for your phone. A dedicated side button allows quick access to apps like Spotify, letting you launch your audio without digging into your pocket. On the opposite earcup, a paddle lets you skip tracks or jump ahead in podcasts. Holding it down allows you to scrub through your audio with precision. Above this, a roller gives you intuitive control over volume, playback, and toggling between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode. Altogether, the controls are designed to keep your listening experience smooth and uninterrupted.</p>
<p data-start="2173" data-end="2652">Battery life is reliably long. With ANC turned off, you can enjoy up to an impressive 80 hours of listening time—enough for several days of use without recharging. Even with ANC enabled, the headphones still deliver around 35 hours of playback, which is more than sufficient for long workdays, commutes, or travel. And if the battery does run low, a quick 5-minute charge provides about 5 hours of additional listening time, ensuring you’re rarely stuck without sound.</p>


<p data-start="2654" data-end="3000">Comfort is equally important for long sessions, and Nothing has put real thought into the design. The ear cushions are made from memory foam wrapped in PU material, which resists oils and makeup to stay clean over time. The reinforced aluminum core adds durability while keeping the headphones lightweight, making them suitable for extended wear.</p>
<p data-start="3002" data-end="3186" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">For a limited time, you can grab the Nothing headphones at a $60 discount on Amazon.</a> With them, you get style, comfort, and premium noise cancellation in one package. Makes for a great gift for any music lover this holiday season.</p>
