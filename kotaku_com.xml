              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-preservation-program-private-detectives-drm-2000635611">Digital video game storefront Good Old Games</a>, aka GOG, is hosting a massive sales event dedicated to open-world games. Or, well, <em>mostly</em> open-world games. It really depends on how you define what is and isn’t an open-world game.</p> <p>This week, GOG launched a big ol’ sales event featuring some remarkably steep discounts on a variety of games that it classifies as open world. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20251015_open_world_promo?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true#Catalog">The sales event runs until October 25 and features nearly 400 PC games</a>, including some big hits lik<em>e <a href="https://kotaku.com/saint-s-row-the-third-remastered-looks-nice-but-feels-1843608576">The Outer Worlds, Saints Row: The Third,</a> Shadow of Mordor, Sleeping Dogs, </em>and <em>Far Cry 2.&nbsp;</em>All of these games are only available on PC and, like all other games on GOG, don’t feature any DRM. Which is great! This is a good sale. And if all you care about is seeing a list of some of the best and biggest deals I spotted from the sale, scroll past the next paragraph and check that list out. Enjoy it! Happy shopping.</p> <p>Okay, the real sickos are still here. Good. Scrolling through GOG’s list of open-world games made me ponder what is an open-world game. How do you define it? Is <em>Slime Rancher</em> an open-world game, or just a game that features a large map you can freely explore? Do open-world games need side quests? Activities to complete? I think so, but perhaps my definition is too strict? Or maybe trying to categorize every piece of media into various genres and subgenres is silly, and I should stop thinking about this so much? Probably that one.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><strong><em>Deadly Premontion: Director’s Cut</em> </strong>– $1.25 ($25)</li> <li><strong><em>Dropsy</em> </strong>– $1 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds</em> </strong>– $8 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Greedfall</em> </strong>– $3 ($35)</li> <li><strong><em>Slime Rancher</em></strong> – $5 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Hard West</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em></strong> – $4 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of War Definitive Edition</em> </strong>– $6 ($60)</li> <li><strong><em>Rebel Galaxy</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw</em></strong> – $5 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row 2</em> </strong>– $1.5 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row: The Third Remastered</em> </strong>– $3 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em></strong> – 3 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row: Gat out of Hell</em> </strong>– $4 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>Dungeon Siege Collection </em></strong>(1,2,3) – $5 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>LEGO DC Super-Villains Deluxe Edition</em></strong> – $9 ($55)</li> <li><strong><em>Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition</em></strong> – $3 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>American Fugitive</em></strong> – $4 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Rustler (Grand Theft Horse)</em></strong> – $5 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Brutal Legend</em></strong> – $3 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>No Man’s Sky</em> </strong>– $24 ($60)</li> <li><strong><em>Far Cry</em></strong> – $3 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Far Cry 2</em> </strong>– $3 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Two Worlds Epic Edition</em></strong> – $5 ($15)</li> </ul>

              <p><span>If you missed it the first time, Netflix is bringing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, its animated musical about a group of demon-killing pop stars, back to theaters for a weekend.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The singalong showings will play in theaters from October 31 to November 2, and unlike the last run, it will be shown at AMC theaters. In a statement to </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/kpop-demon-hunters-theaters-return-amc-1236587369/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span>, an AMC representative said, “Netflix, the world’s largest streaming service, and AMC Entertainment, the world’s largest theatre chain, have jointly decided to work together.” Historically, AMC hasn’t played Netflix’s movies, though it made an exception for 2022’s </span><i><span>Glass Onion</span></i><span>. But hey, having </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>a cultural phenomenon like </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>do so well in its first run melts even the iciest of cold shoulders. I saw the movie in theaters twice during the previous theatrical run in August, and neither of my crowds </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>passed the vibe check</span></a><span>. Those were at the Alamo Drafthouse, which is notorious for its strict etiquette rules, so maybe I’ll go to an AMC showing this time around and find my people who are willing to sing along. That’s how it’s done, done, done, baby.</span></p> <p><span>Since these showings are all happening on Halloween weekend, I fully expect to see moviegoers dressed up as their favorites from Huntr/x and the Saja Boys. Maybe it’s time for me to buy Rumi’s jacket and a purple beanie to do a genderbent cosplay of my bias. It’s only two weeks away, though, so I gotta act fast.</span></p> <p><span>Since its release in June, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has gone on to become Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>most-popular film of all time</span></a><span>, so it’s not terribly surprising that everyone wants in on this theatrical run. Enjoy it while it lasts, folks. It’s probably gonna be a long time before we see a sequel, but it sounds like a short film might be just around the corner.</span></p>
