            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it comes to vlogging, the right tools can both elevate your content and make your workflow easier. The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 does both. Keep your phone in your pocket and use this dedicated vlogging camera to capture your footage. The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 vlogging camera is designed with YouTubers, TikTokers, and InstagramReelers in mind. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/">Plus, right now, Amazon has the camera discounted by 27%. It’s normally listed at $799, but for a limited time, that price has been cut down to just $585. That will save you whole $214.</a></p>
<p>So why reach for the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 over your phone? Your phone is a camera after all. Heck, it’s a pretty good one. The iPhone 16 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 both have remarkable photography and videography capability, but there’s something they don’t have — unlimited storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>That’s not to say the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 has unlimited storage, but it does use MicroSD. You can stock up on as many as you need with as large capacities as you need. And more importantly, keep them separate from your day-to-day stuff you are recording on your phone. That’s important for digital horders like me who constantly find themselves needing to delete old videos just to take a selfie.</p>
<h2>Impressive Videography</h2>
<p>While SD cards aren’t the main selling point here, the specs are. This camera shoots stunning footage in 4K resolution at up to 120 fps. That means you can slow your recordings down in the editing bay to slow-mo.</p>
<p>Keep your audience captivated with dynamic footage that follow your subject. The les is on a swivel which can auto-focus to your main point or person of interest and then track them as the move. It uses an advanced three-axis mechanical stabilization to help remove any shakiness that would be in your video otherwise.</p>



<p>The camera can be turned to point forward or backward. So you can be the person behind the camera, following along with the built in display, or have it turned facing you to record selfie footage while seeing how everything looks in frame.</p>
<p>The mini-display measures on inch across, has touch controls, and can be pivoted either vertical or horizontal. This way you can record for the audience your video is intended.</p>
<p>Advanced color-grading tech is working behind the scenes to capture in 10-bit color depth, recoding up to one billion colors. You’re achieve impressive visual quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/">For a limited time, you can grab yourself the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 vlogging camera for a reduced price. Amazon has the camera discounted by 27% off.</a></p>

              <p>Losing power can be frustrating, whether you’re chilling at home or exploring out there in the wild. If you’re looking for a backup solution that can juice all your essentials up and is easier to carry around with you on the go, Anker makes some solid options. Even better, you can grab one of its best power stations for less right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Anker Solix C1000 portable power station by 50%, bringing it down to just $398.</a> That’s a serious discount on a solution that takes care of all your energy needs, but the offer ends soon. Grab it for less while there’s still some time left.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11 Ports to Charge All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>For under $400, Solix C1000 offers 1800W of power with a 2400W peak output. Without sugarcoating anything, this is enough power to juice up pretty much all your essentials. The 11 built-in ports are a mix of AC outlets, USB-A, USB-C, and a car socket, meaning whether you’re looking to charge your smartphone or a kitchen appliance like a coffee maker, it can power it all. According to Anker’s own testing, the Solix C1000 can run a projector for up to 23.4 hours, a portable coffee maker for 2.7 hours, an electric grill for 1 hour, and even a kettle for just under an hour. You can manage everything using the Anker app on your phone. That includes checking the power status, getting low power alerts, and even customizing charging speeds using it.</p>



<p>Recharging the power station itself is fast, too. If you plug it into a wall outlet and enable UltraFast recharging via the Anker app, it can go from 0 to 80% in just 43 minutes. Prefer using solar panels to recharge? The Solix C1000 should be up and running in just 1.8 hours. Battery longevity is impressive, thanks to its LiFePO4 battery, which is rated for over 3,000 charging cycles. That translates to around 10 years of use without worrying about degradation.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the power station is surprisingly small. In fact, it is about 15% smaller than other 1kWh-class power stations. Carrying it around on your trip won’t be an issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/">This deal brings the price down to less than $400, after a whopping 50% discount.</a> This is the lowest we have seen this power station drop to in a long while, which is why we recommend acting fast to grab it before the deal expires.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>It just got more expensive to keep up with Warner Bros. new DC universe. Just a couple of weeks after <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2 wrapped up, HBO has quietly announced another set of price hikes. The move comes shortly after CEO David Zaslav <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">foreshadowed</a> putting a fresh squeeze on existing customers.</p><p>The hikes range from $1 to $2 a month, and from $10 to $20 annually. Here are the new prices, effective October 21:</p><div> <ul> <li>HBO Max Basic with ads: $11 monthly ($1 increase) / $110 yearly ($10 increase)</li> <li>HBO Max Standard: $18.50 monthly ($1.50 increase) / $185 yearly ($15 increase)</li> <li>HBO Max Premium: $23 monthly ($2 increase) / $230 yearly ($20 increase)</li> </ul> <p>This latest batch of increases, which users have 30 days to decline before getting auto-renewed at the higher rate, comes just a year after the last round, which saw the standard ad-free plan and 4K ad-free plans both go up by $1 a month each. At this rate, HBO with ads will be more than HBO for cable used to be before the end of the decade.</p> <p>“I think our ability to raise price as people become more and more in love with the quality that we have and the series that we have and the offering that we have will have a real ability because I think the pricing across the board—not only is there too many players, in order to stay alive, a lot of the players have just decided to drop prices aggressively,” Zaslav <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">told Wall Street</a> last month.</p> <p>The latest subscriber crunch, which includes a crackdown on password sharing, comes months ahead of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> spin-off <em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em>‘ debut in January 2026, followed by a raft of other new shows and movies. In other news, Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-of-potential-alternatives-to-maximize-shareholder-value-302590176.html">announced on Tuesday</a> that it’s happy to sell if anyone is looking to buy.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-price-game-thrones-last-us-superman-2000637662]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kylo Ren/Ben Solo actor Adam Driver recently revealed that after working on the sequel trilogy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797"><em>Star Wars</em> films</a>, he and acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh pitched a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie to Lucasfilm. But because the movie was set after <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-okay-lets-talk-about-star-wars-the-rise-of-skyw-1840561224">2019’s<em> Rise of Skywalker</em></a> and starred Ben Solo, who dies at the end of that film, Disney allegedly passed on the project, which was tentatively named <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/adam-driver-star-wars-soderbergh-jarmusch-4e08164d0419759f1b5b50d69864975d">In a new interview with the <em>Associated Press</em>,</a> Driver talked about his career, his love of working with talented filmmakers, and the struggle to get projects funded and approved. And during this conversation, he talked about a previously unknown<em> Star Wars</em> film that he and Soderbergh were pitching to Lucasfilm and Disney around 2021.</p>

 <p>“I always was interested in doing another <em>Star Wars</em>,” Driver told the <em>AP</em>. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. [Lucasfilm] had reached out. I always said: With a great director and a great story, I’d be there in a second. I loved [Kylo Ren] and loved playing him.”</p>

  <p>So Driver teamed up with director Soderbergh and Rebecca Blunt to create an outline for a film that would star Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo, who in the sequel trilogy has fallen to the Dark Side and become Kylo Ren. However, by the end of <em>The Rise of Skywalker,</em> Solo has redeemed himself, turned good, and eventually sacrifices his life to save Rey’s. Apparently, according to Driver, Lucasfilm execs loved it. So the group hired Scott Z. Burns to write a full script, which Driver told the <em>AP</em> was “one of the coolest (expletive) scripts I had ever been a part of.” Next, it was time to pitch the movie to Disney. And that’s when it all fell apart.</p>

 <p>“We took it to [Disney CEO] Bob Iger and [Disney co-chairman] Alan Bergman, and they said no,” said Driver. “They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that. It was called <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo,</em> and it was really cool. But it is no more, so I can finally talk about it.”</p>

 <p>The AP reached out to Soderbergh, who confirmed Driver’s story and added, “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”</p> <p>According to Driver, the plan was to be “judicial” and “economical” with the proposed film’s budget, and for it to be in the “same spirit” <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311">as older <em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, which are “handmade and character driven.” But sadly, Disney didn’t want to bring back Ben Solo. Meanwhile, remember when Disney brought the fucking Emperor back to life because it gave up on the sequel trilogy’s main villains halfway through? We live in the worst timeline.</p>
