              <p><span>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched this summer, a cheaper, Japanese-only version of the console was made available domestically. Some speculated the more affordable console (which cost around $340 compared to the multi-language Switch 2’s $480) was offered to address a weak yen or the cost of living in Japan, but whatever the reason, it helped: the Switch 2 was Japan’s biggest ever console launch, according to </span><i><span>Video Games Chronicle.&nbsp;</span></i></p> <p><span>In June, the other Japanese gaming behemoth, Sony, said it was keeping an eye on the Switch 2 in terms of competition, but wasn’t all that concerned because of the PlayStation 5’s “differentiated strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/606826/sony-ps5-vs-switch-2-sales/"><span>as reported by </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishini said that the PlayStation 5 was “the best place of play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“We believe PS5’s level of performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering to players and creators in this current console generation,” Nishino said.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But over the last few weeks, Sony has displayed a renewed interest in its Japanese market, holding a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049"><span>Japan-centric State of Play on November 11</span></a><span> that focused on games developed in the region, and also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085"><span>announced a cheaper PS5 that</span></a><span>, similar to the Switch 2, is only for use in Japan. It’s the first region-locked console Sony has released since the PlayStation 2, and a new report suggests this maneuver may be because Sony is finally considering Nintendo a proper competitor.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000643118" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643118"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643118">©Sony</figcaption></figure> <p><span>According to a report from </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/playstation-ceo-pushed-through-cut-price-ps5-in-japan-after-seeing-system-slump-against-switch-2"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span> (based on a translation from </span><a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/media-create-sales-week-45-2025-nov-03-nov-09.4147/page-7#post-367685"><span>Install Base user Hartmann</span></a><span>, which lines up with machine translation of the segment), Japanese media outlet </span><a href="https://txbiz.tv-tokyo.co.jp/original2/vod/post_329817"><i><span>TV Tokyo</span></i></a><span> discussed the price drop with local experts, who suggested that Sony wasn’t bothered by PlayStation’s shrinking market in Japan until hearing of Nintendo’s cheaper Switch 2. According to the </span><i><span>TV Tokyo </span></i><span>segment, Sony executives decided to ape Nintendo’s approach, and allegedly approved the PS5 price cut in just four months. The reporters also suggest that Sony president Nishino, who stepped into the role this past April after taking over for Dutch-born Hermen Hulst, felt so strongly about PlayStation’s flagging brand in Japan (Nishino is Japanese) that he helped push the region-specific console to market.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Japanese-only digital version of the PS5 goes on sale on November 21.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p><span>Back in June, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-mcdonalds-job-application-boosting-smurfing-dev-riot-games-2000616955"><span>Riot Games</span></a><span> canceled </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Minecraft-</span></i><span>inspired survival game by Hypixel Studios. This was five years after the </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>company acquired the studio in 2015, and the team was shut down as a result. A lot can change in five months, though, ands Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme recently revealed some good news: he’s been able to get the rights to the project back from Riot to continue making the game.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><span>blog post</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>official site, Collins-Laflamme says Hypixel has rehired “more than 30” developers who were part of the original development team, with more expected to follow. The studio is fully independent now, and is “committed to funding </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> for the next 10 years.” But the exact terms of the deal with Riot and the source of funding for </span><i><span>Hypixel 2.0</span></i><span> haven’t been shared, beyond the fact that Collins-Laflamme and co-founder Philippe Touchette are co-funding the project.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> from Riot Games,” the announcement reads. “While it didn’t make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what’s best for players, and that’s for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Riot </span><a href="https://x.com/riotgames/status/1990480588797849881"><span>confirmed the news</span></a><span> as well, saying the deal is “giving this community its best shot” with a revised version of </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>. Collins-Laflamme spoke more candidly about the deal </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1990479580088435017"><span>on his personal X account</span></a><span>, saying that the game may have some “rough edges” right now, but the team wants to get it out to players sooner rather than later. That should come as a relief to fans who have been waiting years for something to actually ship.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This game has always been close to my heart, and I’m excited to bring it back home,” he writes. “Real talk: </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>isn’t some polished AAA release waiting in the wings. It’s messy. It’s janky. And there’s a lot of work to be done. My plan? Get it out to you as soon as possible. No more waiting. You’ll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won’t be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we’ll shape it into something truly special.”</span></p> <p><span>Hypixel says it will be rolling out its full early access plan, along with some transparent behind-the-scenes communication, so people know more about the state of the game following its recent cancellation saga. For now, the team asks that fans “be patient when things break and trust the long-term vision.” Hopefully, it all turns out well for everyone involved, and this can be a win for both game preservation and keeping developers employed. God knows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-revive-fan-servers-mod-sony-playstation-dmca-2000644800"><span>we need more stories</span></a><span> like that these days.</span></p>
