            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I am convinced that I can get better at <a href="https://kotaku.com/ballxpit-devolver-kenny-sun-brickbreaker-indie-2000635720">playing <em>Ball X Pit</em></a>, but whether I win or lose often seems to have little connection to my actual moment-to-moment skill. Sure, I can be smarter about my upgrade picks. I can aim and maneuver to maximize my DPS and avoid some attacks. But in the aggregate, my success feels more or less predetermined by an invisible curve that’s slowly progressing me through the metagame.</p> <p>“I think there is a bit of a skill curve, but I do think it plateaus pretty quickly,” lead developer Kenny Sun <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ball-x-pit-x-interview">told<em> Game File</em></a> this week. “Once you get it, there’s not much you can do to improve your play. So, it is very much a game about pretending that you’re getting better by getting better stats, actually.”</p>

 <p>Rarely has a developer so perfectly articulated my ambiguous and conflicted feelings about their game!</p> <p>Look, <em>Ball X Pit</em> is great. The smart mashup of <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-balatro-kill-the-brickman-poncle-roguelike-2000619132"><em>Breakout</em> and <em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> is way more than just a cash-in on one of Steam’s hottest genres. It’s part shoot ’em up, part buildcrafting roguelike, and part management sim. And it’s not just nice to look at and listen to while you’re watching the numbers go up. There are new levels to reach with unique hazards and tons of characters to unlock that subvert the core ball-throwing mechanic in interesting ways.</p>

 <p>But still, I have a hard time not feeling slightly tricked and manipulated as I play, even if after each break I eventually come back for more. It’s the same way I felt about <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and later <em>Balatro</em>, and most recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-silent-hill-jurassic-world-dispatch-2000638933"><em>Slots &amp; Daggers</em></a>. Sun said this is partly by design.</p>

 <p>“I kind of like the idea of having it start off as one thing and then slowly evolve into an idle game,” he told<em> Game File</em>. “Like, the more you play, the less you play.” He continued, “That’s something that one of my artists was talking about: He had this idea about how games were kind of turning into a thing where players just want to play less of the game. Like, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is all about not playing the game.”</p>

 <p>In other words, the more I play, the more I’m actually not playing, which makes me want to play even more. This is nothing completely new. You can sense the <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-video-game-loot-is-so-addictive-according-to-the-c-1846695147">dark DNA of <em>Diablo</em></a> in each of these recent RNG-driven skinner boxes. But they are getting so much more streamlined and optimized.</p>

 <p>Maybe that’s some small part of why Sun seems somewhat reluctant about <em>Ball X Pit</em>‘s wild success.</p> <p>It sold 400,000 copies in its first week. That number has almost doubled in the weeks since. “It just feels weird for so many people to like this game,” he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-07/how-ball-x-pit-became-a-hit-video-game?srnd=undefined">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a separate interview. “I think the response has been a bit too positive. I think, like, there are plenty of flaws…I think the good things are good enough that it makes people ignore the flaws.”</p> <p>Whatever those flaws are, they haven’t dented the roguelike’s 96-percent positive user rating on Steam. No wonder my inbox is flooded with new indie games pitching themselves as “<em>Vampire Survivors</em> meets X” or <em>“Balatro</em> crossed with Y.” Unfortunately, I don’t think most of them will be cleverly designed as <em>Ball X Pit</em>, let alone as successful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick seems pretty happy with this year’s <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</em> In a new interview, he said the relatively short and linear semi-open-world action game proves that a lot of players will buy games that are focused, not super bloated, and offer a good story. And boy howdy, as someone who loves a nice weekend single-player game, I’m very happy to hear that.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true#:~:text=The%20other%20big,the%20perfect%20result.%E2%80%9D">In a recent interview with T<em>he Game Business</em> newsletter</a>, Zelnick talked about some of the successes Take-Two has had over the past few months. It turns out <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em> isn’t selling as well as expected, which the CEO blames on PC issues and says he expects it to do well in the long term. On the flipside, <em>Mafia: The Old Country,</em> a different game published earlier this year by 2K (a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two), actually <em>beat</em> internal sales expectations. According to Zelnick, it proves that people want well-made, narrative-driven single-player games.</p>

 <p>“What we suspected was confirmed,” Zelnick told the outlet. “Which is just…if you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.”</p>  <h2>Remember when everything wasn’t a live-service thing?</h2> <p>Released in August and developed by Hangar 13,<em> The Old Country</em> is smaller than past <em>Mafia</em> titles, only takes about 11 hours to complete, has no online components, and launched at a reduced price of $50. It’s also the kind of game we don’t really get anymore from AAA publishers like 2K: <a href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions">a big-budget, solo-only, linear action game</a> that lacks a lot of replay value or in-game purchases. Back in the PS2 and even Xbox 360 eras of gaming, this was pretty standard stuff. Not so much anymore.</p>

 <p>However, as Zelnick points out, there is definitely a demand for these types of games. I think a lot of people don’t have the time to dedicate to the latest big online hit, nor can they invest 200 hours into some giant open-world RPG. But a 10- to 12-hour action-adventure game with some great cutscenes, good writing, and no bullshit? Yeah, that’s appealing to a lot of people, myself included.</p> <p>Hopefully<em>, Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s success can be used as a blueprint for Take-Two, and the publisher can greenlight similarly sized projects at its various studios. And we can play those games while we wait for Take-Two’s juggernaut, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6,</em> to finally release one day. Eventually</a>.</p>

Throughout </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, you’ll find Pokémon residing in and out of its designated Wild Zones, and while some of them just kinda spawn into the space, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has a handful of ‘mons that feel more intentional in their placement. Trubbish, the literal trash bag Pokémon, can be found in alleys and around other areas where trash is discarded. A lot of the time, when you see one of these smelly little dudes lounging around, nearby humans are complaining about how they smell bad and they want them gone. So when you do actually get around to catching one of these poison-type Pokémon, an adorable but sad interaction occurs.</span></p> <p><span>If you find a Trubbish hanging out around a bunch of garbage and lift a Poké Ball like you’re going to catch it, the little trash bag smiles and does a little dance, as if it’s excited that someone is finally picking it after spending most of its life being shooed away from the general public. It would almost make me want to catch one and add it to my team if it weren’t so ugly and smelly.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Trubbish lives a hard life in the city. There’s even a whole side quest in which a restaurant asks you to get rid of a group of the sentient garbage bags because their foul odor is bothering the customers. But they are simply little guys who want to be loved like any other Pokémon. It’s sad as hell that these stinky critters are so used to being mistreated that even the slightest hint that they might be accepted makes them dance a little jig.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Hopefully, there will be more of these cute, unscripted interactions in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a><span> DLC adds a plethora of new monsters to the game when it launches on December 10.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-holding-the-line-against-a-500-switch-2-unless-there-are-more-tariffs.1347184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2’s controversial price tag didn’t stop it from becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-nintendo-10-million-mario-kart-world-2000641025">the fastest-selling console at launch ever</a>. Will it stay $450 or break the $500 barrier due to tariffs and inflation? In what should come as some small relief, Nintendo recently signaled that fans don’t have to worry about a price hike in the near future.</p> <p>“We believe that we’ll be able to maintain the current level of profitability for hardware for the time being unless there are significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected events,” Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told investors <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf">in a recent Q&amp;A</a>. “While we are aware that the costs of various materials are rising, we also anticipate some areas where cost reduction may be achieved for Nintendo Switch 2 through ongoing mass production efforts.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “Therefore, currently we do not expect the recent rise in material costs to greatly impact profitability. We will continue our efforts to maintain the same level of profitability as we currently have.”</p> <p>Good news, right?</p> <p>While fans flooded Nintendo livestream chats with demands that the company lower its prices, $450 ended up being <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-preorder-mk9-1851755723">squarely in the middle</a> of what experts had predicted. It was higher than the aggressively low end of $400 and under the worst-case scenario of $500. Some analysts also suspected that the price tag included a cushion to absorb some of the blow from Trump’s tariffs on countries where the console is manufactured, like Vietnam.</p>

 <p>As a result, while the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and even the original Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">all received unprecedented price hikes</a> earlier this year, the Switch 2 has remained consistent at its launch price. The other bit of good news is that Nintendo actually manufactured enough stock to make sure just about everyone who wanted one could get one. That’s meant zero haggling with scalpers on reseller sites like eBay and Facebook Marketplace, a refreshing change from the early days of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S back during the pandemic.</p> <p>But I also wouldn’t expect the Switch 2 to come down in price until…well, probably ever. We never saw the original Switch get a price drop, and this one is selling even better. Nintendo has said it’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-donkey-kong-2000641323">happy to keep manufacturing that earlier console,</a> too, as long as it keeps selling, which it continues to do.</p>
