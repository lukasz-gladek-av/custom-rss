Not the jokers I’d pick, but maybe they’ll make more and sell them seperately in the future. I know I’d buy them. </p><p>Now, for the bad news. These cards can’t be a stocking stuffer or Christmas gift this year. While you can pre-order the deck starting today, they won’t start shipping out until March. I guess you could buy a deck, hide it, and give it to your <em>Balatro-</em>lovin’ friend or family member next Christmas, but why would you punish someone you love?</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Leading up to launch, fans were hoping developer BioWare would put the creation suite out ahead of the game itself so we would have time to mess around with it in advance, and jump right into the game itself on launch. BioWare didn’t do that, but the studio is finally releasing the character creator for free as part of today’s officially unofficial “Dragon Age Day” on December 4.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194028" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Umbran Witch Suplex" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="163" data-playlist="194028,193348,194066" data-current="194028"><div><p>The Week In Games: Umbran Witch Suplex</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19503.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The standalone app is available on all platforms, and any characters you create are transferable to the full version of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>as long as you buy the game on the same platform. So you can’t use the free character creator on PC and transfer your characters to console or vice versa. The free version has no time limit, so tweak to your heart’s content. However, also keep in mind that you can update your appearance any time during the game. Well, Rook’s, anyway. You can’t revise your Inquisitor’s appearance throughout, and you won’t see them until several hours in, so by the time you know something is wrong it’s too late to go back. So maybe spend a little extra time with them if that’s a concern.</p><p>Customizing Rook’s appearance is one thing, but you’ll also have to choose your class and faction, as well.
