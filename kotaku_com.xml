              <p>Can’t start your day without a warm (or cold) cup of joe first thing in the morning? You need a good coffee machine at home, because those instant options aren’t the most flavorful, and heading out to your local cafe in your pajamas isn’t very ideal. Yes, coffee machines can cost a pretty penny, but that’s what sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are for. Even though the event is over, there are still plenty of deals to be had across a wide range of categories, including kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/">One of our favorites? This 29% discount on the highly-rated Breville Barista Express espresso machine, which brings the price down to $500</a>. You’re saving a straightforward $200 on a machine that’s going to help you make delicious cappuccinos and lattes within minutes, and the discount applies to both Black Sesame and Brushed Stainless Steel options. Looking for something that makes a bold statement? Black looks absolutely stunning. Prefer sticking to the classics? You’re going to love the stainless steel version. There are no delivery charges to worry about either. Just add the item to your cart, checkout, and enjoy barista-level coffee from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Rich Flavors Every Time, Without Stepping Out of Your Home</h2>
<p>Breville Barista Express uses a four-key formula to give you the results you want, including precision puck, extraction pressure, extraction temperature, and microfoam bubbles. It is part of the Barista Series that offers all-in-one espresso machines with an integrated grinder that lets you choose between 16 precision grind settings. These convert beans into espresso within seconds, extracting all the goodness hidden in there.</p>
<p>The thermocoil heating system controls water pressure, while the steam wands turn milk into smooth microfoam with a silky texture for you to get creative with latte art. To extract all that rich flavor and aroma, the coffee machine starts with a low-pressure infusion and then ramps it up gradually. The result? A well-balanced, rich cup that feels straight out of your favorite coffee shop.</p>



<p>All the controls are right there on the machine, and they’re pretty easy to follow. You can pick a grind amount, a filter size, a program, and the number of cups you’re hoping to fill. Your purchase will also come with 2 free bags of specialty coffee, which makes it easy to get started without paying anything extra. Other accessories include a razor-dose trimming tool, a 54mm stainless steel portafilter, 1 &amp; 2 cup single and dual wall filter baskets, coffee scoop, integrated tamper, stainless steel milk jug, cleaning disc, tablets, brush tool, allen key, water filter, and a filter holder. There’s also a 1-year limited warranty included for some peace of mind, just in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a convenient way of making professional-level coffee at home, this deal offers a great chance to grab one of the best coffee machines out there for less. It may look intimidating at first, but getting started is straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a couple of tries to perfect your coffee recipe. Pair the machine with some syrups, and you can have an entire coffee menu of your own. Make some cool Spanish latte, try out pumpkin spice, or go for roasted hazelnut; the possibilities and combinations are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/"> Don’t miss out on this chance to save $200 on the Breville Barista Express espresso machine, but this appliance rarely sees any drops, despite being so high in demand all year-round.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-makes-a-zero-profit-move-as-airpods-pro-3-hits-an-all-time-low-close-to-pro-2-discount-pricing-2000648773</link>
            <guid>1368529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="290">Apple introduced the highly anticipated AirPods Pro 3 just a couple short months ago, and just in time for the holidays, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">these popular earbuds are already seeing a discount thanks to Cyber Monday.</a> The earbuds launched with a price tag of $249, but this week you can scoop them up for 12% off. That ends up saving you $29, with the price coming down to just $220. So if you’re searching for a standout gift or just treating yourself to an upgrade, now is the perfect opportunity to grab a pair.</p>
<p data-start="292" data-end="812">So, what’s new about the AirPods Pro 3? The AirPods Pro 3 now feature an improved real-time noise canceling, removing up to twice the noise as the previous generation was capable of.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="814" data-end="1252">The battery life has also been improved. You can now enjoy up to 10 hours of listening time (eight hours with active noise cancellation enabled) on a single charge—ideal for long flights or long days at the office. The charging case retains its MagSafe compatibility and now includes a built-in speaker, which helps you locate it using Apple’s “Find My” feature. If your case slips between couch cushions or gets lost in your bag, the speaker will ping, making it easier to track down.</p>
<p data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Apple has also upgraded the fit of the AirPods Pro 3. The updated design allows for better in-ear stability during physically demanding activities such as running, HIIT, yoga, and more. The earbuds now come with new foam-infused ear tips in five different sizes. This is includes a new XXS size to better fit ears of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Another welcome change is the switch from Lightning to USB-C for charging. This aligns the AirPods Pro 3 with Apple’s 2025 product lineup and simplifies the charging process for users with other USB-C devices. Of course, the case still supports Qi wireless charging, so if you already have wireless charging pads at home, you can continue using them without any issues.</p>


<h2 data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Smart Features</h2>
<p>The features of other Apple products seem to be leaking their way across product lines. Much like an Apple Watch,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/"> the AirPods Pro 3</a> are now capable of heart rate sensing. Track your heart rate and calories burned for up to 50 different workouts. You can access the data tracked via your iPhone.</p>
<p data-start="1619" data-end="1988">The AirPods Pro 3 now support live translation. With the help of Apple Intelligence, you can communicate with someone across languages — having your AirPods translate to your native tongue in real-time, right in your ear. Ever read <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>. We now have real-world babel fish.</p>
<p data-start="2499" data-end="2884">While the AirPods Pro 3 aren’t exactly a budget buy, they are the most refined version of Apple’s flagship earbuds to date. You get enhanced sound quality, noise cancellation, and thoughtful design improvements. If you’ve been considering a pair, now’s the time to take advantage of the discount before the holiday rush. Own them for just $220 for a limited time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Sells 15.6″ Portable Monitor for Peanuts, FHD Screen Works With Switch and Laptop]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-15-6-portable-monitor-for-peanuts-fhd-screen-works-with-switch-and-laptop-2000648886</link>
            <guid>1368520</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small screens on laptops or handheld consoles (like the Switch) are fine for most things but they can be hard to see when you’re trying to find enemies in competitive games or edit spreadsheets with small text that hurts your eyes. A portable monitor fixes this by giving you a full-sized screen wherever you need one.</p>
<p>The<em> Arzopa A1</em> has a <strong>15.6-inch Full HD screen and can connect to almost anything with USB-C or HDMI</strong> which makes it great for gaming, working or streaming. For Cyber Monday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">Amazon drops the price of this portable monitor from its usual $104 to $63</a> and this is the lowest price ever which it almost too cheap to pass up to buy a second screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>IPS Panel Quality in a Package That’s Easy to Take on Trips</h2>
<p>This monitor has a 15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920×1080 and the text is clear and the colors are bright which makes spreadsheets and games look sharp. The<strong> IPS technology lets you see the screen from 178 degrees both horizontally and vertically</strong> so the picture stays the same even when you look at it from the side or from above. This is important when you’re sharing the screen with someone next to you or when you have to put the monitor at an angle because of lack of desk space.</p>



<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> works well for regular gaming and work tasks, but competitive gamers might notice a difference when playing fast-paced shooters on 120Hz or 144Hz monitors. <strong>Response time is about 5ms</strong> which is fine for casual games, RPGs and strategy games where clear visuals are more important than quick reactions. The 16:9 aspect ratio works with most laptop screens and gaming consoles so there are no black bars when you mirror displays or make your workspace bigger.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in kickstand folds out from the metal back panel</strong> and locks into different positions which means you can use it on desks, tables or even your lap without needing a separate stand. This design saves space when you travel and gets rid of extra accessories you would have to pack. The m<strong>onitor is only 1.6 pounds and 0.35 inches thick at its thinnest point</strong> so it fits easily into laptop bags or backpacks with your other gear.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C ports</strong> that can handle both video and power from compatible laptops are part of the connectivity which means that everything can be connected with just one cable, so you don’t need a separate power adapter. The <strong>mini-HDMI port</strong> can take signals from gaming consoles, desktop computers, cameras, or any other device with an HDMI output. If your laptop can’t provide enough power, the monitor can get power from a separate USB-C power adapter or through USB-C from your laptop.</p>
<p>The package comes with the monitor,<strong> a USB-C to USB-C cable, a USB-C to USB-A cable, a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, and a case that protects the monitor</strong> and acts as a screen cover while it’s being moved. It only takes a few seconds to set up because all you have to do is plug in the right cable and the display turns on by itself.</p>
<p>If you buy this portable monitor for $63 instead of $104, you’ll get a price that beats most basic external displays while still keeping Full HD resolution and IPS quality. For less than the cost of budget monitors that don’t have portability features, you get a real portable second screen with a built-in stand, multiple ways to connect, and compatibility with a wide range of devices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-drops-the-new-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-to-an-all-time-low-losing-all-margin-to-rival-jbl-and-bose-2000648813</link>
            <guid>1368517</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday deals are rolling in. Most of these are Black Friday discounts being carried into the weekend, so if you missed grabbing something during the sale, there’s still a chance to bag it for less.</p>
<p>While several retailers are offering plenty of discounts, Amazon is being the most generous right now. It’s offering up to 50% off its own devices, taking hundreds off security cameras, smart displays, streaming sticks, Kindles, and more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade this holiday season should consider nabbing the latest Fire TV Soundbar Plus while it’s going at a 40% discount</a>. This brings the price down to just $150. You’re saving a massive $100 on an audio solution that’s going to make it easy to hear dialogues clearly, plus enjoy your favorite tunes to the fullest. Even better, both Prime and non-Prime members will enjoy free delivery on their purchase, which adds even more value to the offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Audio Modes</h2>
<p>Design-wise, it’s pretty similar to the older Fire TV soundbars. It sits nicely on your TV console without drawing too much attention to itself, and can even be mounted on a wall for a clean, tidy setup. But despite the compact frame, it does not compromise on the sound. Three full-range speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers push audio in all directions. Pair that with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and you’ll enjoy a 3D, room-filling experience that pulls you in, making you feel like you’re a part of whatever is playing on the screen. Sound mimics real life; the Battle of Pelennor Fields from The Lord of the Rings plays out as if it’s happening right in your living room. Watching a scary movie? Footsteps and whispers are going to feel like they’re coming from behind, making the whole thing even spookier.</p>
<p>The Dialogue Enhancer works overtime to keep the conversations sharp by actively pushing voices above background sounds, even with low volume. You won’t have to constantly rewind just to hear what was said. You can also choose between multiple audio modes that optimize the sound based on what’s playing. These include Movie, Music, Sports, and Night modes. The night mode for instance, delivers balanced audio that won’t wake the entire home up, while the music mode gives bass a boost. Speaking of music, you can even use the soundbar as a speaker by connecting it to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth and streaming your favorite tracks.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started couldn’t be simpler. Plug your soundbar’s HDMI cable into your TV’s eARC/ARC port, and power the TV on with your remote. The audio will instantly change from your TV to the soundbar; simple as that. As for the compatibility, it plays nicely with just about any smart TV, plus the screens connected to streaming media players.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">There’s a lot more to like about this soundbar, especially now that it’s going at a $100 discount.</a> This deal lets you grab it for just $150, which is basically nothing for all that it’s packed with. It’s an early Cyber Monday deal, but keeping past trends in mind, we’re expecting it to expire soon. If you’ve been after a reliable audio solution, today is the day to make the move. You’re also going to enjoy free delivery if you place your orders before Dec. 4.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Dual NVIDIA RTX 3050 Gaming Graphics Card Returns at an All-Time Low After Selling Out on Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-dual-nvidia-rtx-3050-gaming-graphics-card-returns-at-an-all-time-low-after-selling-out-on-black-friday-2000647705</link>
            <guid>1368505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC gamers and computer DIYers alike are going to love this Cyber Monday deal at Amazon after Black Friday — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">the ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 3050 is a gaming graphics card that’s capable of upgrading an older gaming rig or being the visual nerve center of a self-built one, and it’s just $160 after a 20% off deal</a>. That’s a great price for a major upgrade on an older computer, and definitely a more economical choice than buying an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>The RTX 3050 is compatible with PC towers, not laptops. It connects to the PC’s motherboard to drive the computer’s graphic performance. It’s an exceptional mid-range gaming graphics card with 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM, PCIe 4.0 support, HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a ports, and a compact dual-slot build that allows it to also fit into the more-slender desktop PCs. It’s power- and heat efficient so you don’t need the large tower or big cooling setup to prevent it from overheating.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Reliable HD Gaming</h2>
<p>Installation of the RTX 3050 could not be easier — open the tower, find the motherboard, and either add the card in an empty graphics slot or replace the existing one. Once up and running, your PC will be fully capable of 1080p gaming, which is great for shooters, indie games, and eSports games thanks to the high frame rate and stable performance. It’s not a 4K gaming machine, but it’s plenty of HD power for an exceptional price.</p>
<p>The HDMI 2.1 hookup and fast refresh rate give you the further option of hooking up your upgraded PC to a faster monitor or TV. And as a new card, the firmware updates and the driver support will be better. Since every piece of a tech setup has a finite life before it reaches obsolescence — the point where the manufacturer no longer provides updates or support, and games are no longer compatible — a brand-new graphics card will push that deadline further down the road, thus extending the lifespan of your entire PC for a small price.</p>



<h2>Upgrade or Build</h2>
<p>Swapping out a graphics card to upgrade and extend the life of a PC is rewarding, but building one either from scratch or from the bones of an old dead tower is&nbsp;<em>fun</em>. But the cost does add up when you’re shopping for all of the components — motherboard, internal storage, RAM, and five or six things you didn’t know you needed until you tried to boot up. An inexpensive graphics card is a key component of a DIY build or rebuild, and the performance you get from the GeForce RTX 3050 for its original $200 price earned it an average 4.6-star rating from Amazon reviewers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">Now with this Cyber Monday deal that drops 20% off the price, the RTX 3050 vastly overperforms on its new $160 price</a>. Hit Amazon now before this Cyber Monday gamer deal ends.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-goes-zero-profit-for-cyber-monday-ps5-owners-get-premium-vr-for-budget-headset-money-2000648879</link>
            <guid>1368502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is over but Cyber Monday keeps the excitement going by lowering prices even more on gaming hardware at Amazon. The <strong>PlayStation VR2</strong> is a next-level virtual reality headset that feels completely different from smartphone VR headsets and if you have a PS5 and want to get deeper into immersive gaming, this is the headset for you.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">this bundle is only $299, down from the usual $399 and it comes with Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>, so you can start playing a full AAA VR adventure as soon as you open it. This bundle is at its lowest price ever on Amazon for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED Screens and Eye Tracking</h2>
<p>The <strong>PSVR2 has two OLED panels that give each eye a resolution of 2000×2040</strong>&nbsp;which is 4K total resolution. This gets rid of the screen-door effect that older VR headsets had, where you could see individual pixels. The <strong>110-degree field of view</strong> gives you peripheral vision that is similar to real life, so virtual environments feel truly big instead of like you’re looking through binoculars. With <strong>HDR support</strong>, deep blacks and bright highlights stand out and gives images more depth. The 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate options make fast gameplay smooth which helps with motion sickness and makes head movements feel natural instead of laggy.</p>



<p>The <strong>PSVR2’s best feature is eye tracking</strong> which lets the headset see where you’re looking and use that information in many different ways. Foveated rendering uses the graphics processing power to focus on what you’re looking at directly and lower the detail in your peripheral vision, and it makes things run faster without you noticing any quality loss. Some games use eye tracking to help you aim in shooters, make eye contact with NPCs in story-driven games, or start events based on where your gaze stays.</p>
<p>When there are explosions, impacts, or weather effects like rain, <strong>haptic feedback vibrates through the headset itself</strong> and adds a physical element that regular VR doesn’t have. The <strong>adaptive triggers on the included Sense controllers push back against your finger pressure</strong> in a way that makes drawing a bowstring feel tense or pulling the trigger on a gun feel real. Inside-out tracking uses four cameras built into the headset to keep an eye on the controllers and your play area and you don’t need any sensors mounted around your room.</p>



<p><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em> shows off what PSVR2 can do with a VR adventure set in the Horizon universe: It has climbing mechanics that use hand-over-hand motion, archery that requires real aiming and drawing and beautiful views that show off the graphics quality. The game was made specifically for VR instead of being a port of a flat-screen game which means that every interaction uses the headset’s eye tracking and haptic features.</p>
<p>For $299 instead of $399, you can get the PSVR2 with Horizon Call of the Mountain which makes high-end VR available at a price that used to only get you entry-level standalone headsets. For $100 less, you get Sony’s best VR technology, including eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K OLED visuals – plus, you get a full AAA game that would cost $60 on its own.</p>

              <p>Handheld gaming consoles have come through in a big way this past decade. The Nintendo Switch paved the way for the other big players in the gaming space to rethink what it means to be able to game while on the go. We’ve since seen the advent of the Steam Deck—Valve’s PC gaming handheld—along with some other third parties throwing their hats in the race with the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/">PlayStation has its own take on the format with the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5. Amazon happens to have it discounted for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a> The 11% savings equates to the handheld system dropping from $200 to just $179 for a limited time. You end up saving $21.</p>
<p>On the surface, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player looks like if you hacked up a PS5 DualSense controller and stuck the pieces to the side of your Nintendo Switch. That’s not a bad thing. The PS5 controller is comfortable to use, and having the handheld mimic it almost exactly allows for a more seamless experience when playing games between your PlayStation 5 console and your PlayStation Portal Remote Player. The handheld is capable of playing games at up to 60fps, displaying in a resolution of 1080p. Choose between either the white version or the midnight black model.</p>

<p>Where the PlayStation Portal Remote Player differs from the other gaming handhelds is its not a standalone unit. The Portal doe not let you play games directly on the unit itself. the games you play are either streamed from the cloud or streamed from your home PlayStation 5 console. So in that sense, it’s more akin to the Wii U gamepad as opposed to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Remote Play let’s you play compatible games you have installed on your PS5 console, be they PlayStation 5 games or PlayStation 4 games. This makes the PlayStation Portal Remote Player a great accessory for families who share the TV room. Are you a dad, trying to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II: Remastered</em> before the new HBO season comes back? You can sit and enjoy the game on your PlayStation Portal Remote Player with some headphones while your kid enjoys Ms. Rachel on the TV.</p>



<h2>Better With PlayStation Plus</h2>
<p>With PlayStation Plus, you gain access to an expansive catalogue of digital games—a good chunk of which are Cloud Streaming compatible.</p>
<p>The Game Catalogue is filled with newly released titles that you will have access to play with a monthly subscription. It’s Netflix applied to video games. Dive into games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and&nbsp;<em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. You also gain access to the Classics Catalogue where you can explore all the PlayStation games of yesteryear. You can play through the entire original God of War trilogy before stepping into the two latest games that came with 2016’s soft-reboot of the series.</p>

              <p>Samsung’s 83-inch S85F TV proves that OLED screens have finally gotten big enough to turn your living room into a real home theater. This 2025 model packs 20 neural networks that upscale everything to stunning 4K clarity and the OLED panel delivers deep blacks and vivid colors that LCD technology can’t match. The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/">just slashed the price to $2,497 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the original $4,297 sticker</a>, which marks <strong>an all-time low for an 83-inch OLED with this level of AI processing power</strong>.</p>

<h2>AI Processing Works While You Watch</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen2 processor has 20 specialized neural networks</strong> that each work on a different part of image quality, such as sharpness, color accuracy, motion handling, and brightness optimization. These networks look at each frame in real time and find objects, faces, and scenes so they can make specific improvements instead of blanket processing that can make some content look too sharp or too bright.</p>
<p>When you stream a show that was made in 1080p or lower,<strong> the AI upscaling doesn’t just stretch the picture to fit the 4K panel</strong> but it also fills in missing details by guessing what should be there based on patterns it sees. This means that older movies and TV shows become clearer and more defined, so they can be watched on an 83-inch screen without looking pixelated or soft around the edges.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Vision AI goes even further by <strong>automatically changing settings based on the type of content you’re watching</strong>: Sports get better motion smoothing to keep fast camera pans clear, while movies get a different kind of treatment that keeps the cinematic feel with the right color grading and motion handling. You never have to go into settings menus or change picture modes by hand because the processor makes these changes automatically as scenes change in the same piece of content.</p>



<p>The<strong> OLED HDR feature makes contrast that LCD panels can’t match</strong> because each pixel makes its own light instead of using a backlight that bleeds into dark areas. When a scene goes from a bright outdoor shot to a dark interior shot, you can see true blacks in the shadows and highlights that stay bright without washing out the whole frame. This self-emissive technology lets you sit at wider angles without changing the color or lowering the contrast.</p>
<p>When you watch nature documentaries, cooking shows, or anything else where accurate color reproduction changes how you see the picture, Pantone validation makes sure that the colors match real-world references. Instead of looking too pink or orange like some TVs that value bright colors over accuracy, skin tones look natural in different lighting and ethnic groups. This validation process checks the display output against Pantone’s color standards.</p>



<p><em>Object Tracking Sound Lite</em> makes <strong>sounds that move across the screen to match where the action is happening</strong> in the frame: This makes the game feel more real, even if you’re using the built-in speakers instead of a surround sound system. The sound moves with the car as it drives from left to right instead of staying in the center channel and it helps your brain naturally connect visual and audio cues. <strong>Alexa integration lets you control the TV</strong>, look for content, and manage smart home devices without having to get up from your chair.</p>
<p>Right now, you can save $1,800 off the regular price of $2,497, and you get the <strong>newest model from 2025 with better AI processing</strong> that older models don’t have. This Cyber Monday deal is great for anyone who wants to improve their home theater and the huge screen, self-lit OLED pixels, and neural network upscaling work&nbsp; make streaming services, gaming, and regular TV watching feel like high-quality entertainment that is worth the money.</p>
