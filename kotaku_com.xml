Itch.io quietly updated its list of banned content over the weekend with the following section on adult games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks. We are unable to support the sale of any works containing these topics:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li><li>Underage or “barely legal” themes</li><li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li><li>Bestiality or animal-related</li><li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li><li>Sex trafficking implications</li><li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li><li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., “scat,” “vomit”)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Developers can appeal individual bans, but with thousands of listings removed and someone needing to actually play each individual title to adjudicate claims, that process seems all but unworkable in the short term. “It’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time,” Itchi.io writes on the site. “If an issue arises with your account that isn’t already covered by our policy, then we will contact you and share what options you may have.”<br></p><p>While Steam has also banned hundreds of games revolving around rape or incest in response to pressure from Visa, Mastercard, and other payment processors.

According to its creator, it includes the option for incestual relationships between characters but doesn’t not demand it. It remains available on Steam but was one of those games purged from Itch.io last week. </p><p>“This completely destroys me—so many games published with love on this platform, and now they won’t reach anyone new,” wrote<em> Love’s Heart</em> creator Capky Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a blog post</a></span> last week. “I don’t have an audience elsewhere; I depend on itch.io to grow.

This is the dangerous Ash Clan, who are led by Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, and who use fire as their main weapon.
