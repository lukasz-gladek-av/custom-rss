The offline mode is also now available, so current and future players will always have a chance to go back and experience the base game’s visually impressive but mechanically messy and repetitive main campaign.

In them, Batman and Superman show up to finish Braniac off and reveal that the Justice League members the player killed were actually just clones. Everyone except Wonder Woman seemingly, who ended up getting killed at the hands of the Superman clone. Batman’s pivotal death? Also a clone. It was all part of the caped crusader’s master plan, apparently. It sounds about as well put together as the live-service pitch for the underlying game. </p><p>The Suicide Squad members remove their bomb implants and leave the planet to explore outer space, while the remaining Justice League members travel to all of the universes Braniac ruined to set things right and “atone.” The whole thing last less than two minutes, and despite being entirely an exposition dump, still feels like it leaves a lot unexplained. It’s also hard to know how much ofthis was Rocksteady’s original plan for the story’s year-one conclusion, and how much of it was cobbled together last-minute as the studio pivots to new projects. </p><p>“That was the most disappointing ending I’ve seen,” wrote one commenter on YouTube. “Pissed off the entire fandom, sullied their legacy,  only for it to go the ‘none of it mattered’ route just for the sake live gaming and money,” wrote another. Many pointed out that Robin is also technically dead in the Arkhamverse now too. “I did kindaaaa hope that they would go out with bang but obv that didnt happen, just killed brainiac and im more confused then satisfied,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1i18yte/that_was_kinda_ass_ngl/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1i18yte/that_was_kinda_ass_ngl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a player on Reddit. Even some players on the game’s official Discord who loved <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s gameplay and have stuck with it for nearly a year were let down by the ending. </p><p>The bizarre clone twist caps of nearly 12 months of rough going for a big-budget blockbuster from one of the most acclaimed studios in games. Bad reviews and fan frustrations with the base campaign’s main story rolled into underwhelming post-launch content plans that offered very little in the way of fresh mission types or new story beats. The new playable characters rotated into each season, beginning with the Joker and ending with Deathstroke, also didn’t win players back. </p><p>By June, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893?_gl=1*zkd93a*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjk1MDQyOS45MS4xLjE3MzY5NTI4MDUuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893?_gl=1*zkd93a*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjk1MDQyOS45MS4xLjE3MzY5NTI4MDUuNjAuMC4w"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a></span> that Rocksteady had already pivoted to other projects, like a <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> director’s cut, and in recent months the studio has suffered two rounds of layoffs. Despite <em>Suicide Squad</em> bombing, however, publisher Warner Bros. hasn’t suggested <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warner-bros-free-to-play-suicide-squad-harry-potter-1851309669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warner-bros-free-to-play-suicide-squad-harry-potter-1851309669">it’s at all deterred by the sales disaster</a></span>, though it sounds like Rocksteady at least will go back to focusing on what it’s historically excelled at: immersive single-player action games. Where that leaves the <em>Batman: Arkham</em> universe remains to be seen. A VR spinoff, <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow </em>arrived just last year to decent reviews. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
