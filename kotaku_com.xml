              <p>The hit 2024 survival crafting sim <em>Palworld</em> is conspicuously absent from the Nintendo eShop amid an ongoing battle with Nintendo, which has <a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124">accused the game of violating its patents</a>. The same can’t be said for <em>Palland</em>, a cheap knock-off that Nintendo seemed to have no problem approving for sale on the Switch eShop earlier this summer.</p> <p>Glance at the store listing for <em>Palland</em> (via <em><a href="https://nintendosoup.com/palworld-ripoff-palland-launches-on-nintendo-switch/">NintendoSoup</a></em>) and you’ll instantly clock it as a <em>Palworld </em>clone. Like much of the knock-off slop that crowds digital storefronts, it’s a simplified version of an existing game that mimics the art style and marketing more than the actual gameplay. Published on July 31 by BoggySoft, the $10 game bills itself as a base-building survival sim in which you harvest resources and kill stuff. What it doesn’t mention is anything about collecting creatures that look strikingly similar to certain Pokémon.</p> <p>“<em>Palland</em> delivers a rich and immersive experience where base-building, combat, exploration, and evolution blend into one dynamic and strategic journey,” reads the description. Gameplay footage uploaded by various people on YouTube shows the reality: an avatar who looks straight out of<em> Palworld</em> running around boring fields fighting cute creatures with incredibly low-budget animations.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Palland - Nintendo Switch / Switch 2 Compatible gameplay release" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cgDinhbB9k?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>What <em>Palland</em> is missing that got <em>Palworld</em> in trouble are Pokémon mechanics like getting creatures to low-health, aiming not-Poké-Balls at them to capture them, and later being able to ride on their backs. Those are the gameplay loops Nintendo said <em>Palworld</em> maker Pocketpair violated its patents for, leading to a lawsuit filed last year. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-nintendo-pokemon-lawsuit-whats-next">As reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, Pocketpair has been implementing a series of tweaks beginning last November to each of these mechanics to address Nintendo’s legal complaints, although it remains for the court to decide if the updates go far enough.</p> <p>While Nintendo might not have a problem with <em>Palland</em> since its creatures aren’t obvious knock-offs of Pokémon and it isn’t selling tens of millions of copies, the proliferation of games like <em>Palland</em> is a clear problem for developers on storefronts like the eShop. In addition to lots of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">other generic AI slop</a>, it’s now common to see console storefronts quickly fill up with knockoffs of Steam games after they blow up in popularity on PC. PSN is already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1mgas2z/a_popular_game_on_steam_called_peak_just_recently/">chock full of <em>Peak</em> clones</a>.</p> <p>That was part of the irony of Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tencent-sony-lawsuit-knockoff-steam-art-2000616608">suing Tencent</a> over its obvious <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> ripoff. While the publisher is quick to deal with rival companies allegedly infringing on its IP, small studios and solo devs are left to scream into the customer service void to try and get cheap cash-grab clones of their work policed on the PlayStation Store. You’ve heard of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/schedule-1-drug-dealing-sim-steam-big-hit-400k-indie-1851773695">2025 Steam sensation <em>Schedule I</em></a>, but can I interest you in some <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015587"><em>Trippy Trader&nbsp;: Schedule &amp; Sell</em></a>? Unlike <em>Schedule I</em>, it’ll be available on PS4 later this month</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/taylor-swift-is-music%E2%80%99s-best-game-master.1268124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Last night, country-music-it-girl-turned-pop-culture-centerpiece </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-dark-souls-1851439461"><span>Taylor Swift</span></a><span> did something a little different. She announced a new album called </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, but not with the usual gravitas she’s become known for throughout her 20-year career. Rather than endless teases, easter eggs, or waiting until she was on stage accepting an award, Swift revealed her 12th studio album on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newheightshow/videos"><i><span>New Heights</span></i></a><span> podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs. It all happened very fast, with much of the pre-announcement teasing happening in the span of less than 24 hours. But despite its brevity, Swift’s rollout felt calculated and littered with the same cheeky nods that send fans into overdrive that she’s come to be known for. Even as a casual Swift listener, I can’t help but respect her love of the literal game.</span></p> <p><span>It all started on August 11 as Swift’s publicity team, Taylor Nation, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNN0isCNpBb/"><span>posted several photos</span></a><span> of the singer on her Eras Tour on social media. Notably, each picture shows her in an orange outfit, with orange eventually being revealed as the primary color for </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span>. Miss </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-2024-sabrina-carpenter-espresso-streams-1851714545/2"><span>“Espresso”</span></a><span> herself, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sabrina-carpenter-icon-skin-leak-festival-1851772197"><span>Sabrina Carpenter</span></a><span>, is also in one of these photos, sparking speculation that she might be featured on the album when it launches. The post has the caption, “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…’” referencing a line in Swift’s book documenting the Eras Tour. All of this made it clear that Swift was nearing an announcement, but the quickness with which it came was both surprising and a bit of a relief. Kelce’s show posted a teaser for the episode that would eventually feature Swift, which included her silhouette on the thumbnail, but Swift’s usual playful microcosm of marketing came from her own website, and included a countdown that ended at 12:12 a.m. this morning. You get it? 12? Because it’s her 12th album?</span></p>   <p><span>The actual </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>episode will go live on Wednesday at 7 p.m. Eastern, but the album is already up for pre-order, both as a standard CD and on orange vinyl or cassette. Fans haven’t seen the cover or heard a song, and they’re already showing up to buy the album. Right now, </span><i><span>New Heights</span></i><span> has posted a brief clip of Swift showing off the album, but its cover has been blurred out, presumably to get more eyes on the podcast when it goes up. Even when Swift is going the more straightforward route, she can’t help but make it a waiting game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with less than 24 hours between tease and announcement, Swifties are hard-wired to start the guessing games the second they get a whiff of a hint. Sometimes it sends them down a rabbit hole with a dead end, such as when they spent a year looking for clues about a coveted </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>re-recording of her 2017 album </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span>, only for the singer to reveal that she </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-reputation-taylors-version-not-releasing-1235351379/"><span>had barely done any work on it</span></a><span>, and now doesn’t really need to after she </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/31/nx-s1-5418406/taylor-swift-buys-back-master-recordings-now-she-controls-all-of-her-music"><span>bought back her masters</span></a><span> and could leave the </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>project behind. The fact that no re-recorded version was even imminent makes creative decisions like Swift changing up her outfit for the </span><i><span>Reputation </span></i><span>set of the Eras Tour </span><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a62658289/taylor-swift-new-reputation-bodysuit-eras-tour-photos/"><span>after months of wearing the same thing</span></a><span> feel like trolling meant to throw off the most detail-oriented fans looking for any hint that the album might be on the way.</span></p> <p><span>Swifties have been trained to view every creative decision, big and small, as a reference to what’s next. Not everything is a misdirect, and fans have felt vindicated when what seemed like small nods ended up being clues to major reveals. The music video for “Bejeweled,” for instance, has a scene in which Swift’s Cinderella-like character enters an elevator, and each of the buttons has a different color scheme, with each one seemingly corresponding to one of her albums, all of which have noted “main” colors. Fans noticed that the last button on the elevator had the same purple as her third album </span><i><span>Speak Now</span></i><span>, which seemed to hint that she would be re-recording that record next as part of the </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>project. Lo and behold, the remade album was released the following July.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Taylor Swift - Bejeweled (Official Music Video)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7QlX3yR2xs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of these nods are more subtle than Swift literally pointing at a representation of the next album to be re-recorded. When she announced her 11th album, </span><i><span>The Tortured Poets Department</span></i><span>, at the 2024 Grammys ceremony, she put up a “V sign” with her hand when she said that she’d been keeping the album a secret for two years. However, in retrospect, it’s clear this was a knowing nod to </span><i><span>TTPD</span></i><span>’s status as a double album, which was a closely kept secret until it was released that April and the second half was published on streaming platforms and digital stores two hours later.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Taylor Swift Announces 'Brand New Album' 'The Tortured Poet's Department'" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/REqdODABGXo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>To be a Swiftie is to spend every day looking and listening for clues like you’re exploring an elaborate, decades-old escape room, only to decide with each door you open that you’re content to go deeper into the vault, never actually escaping. She notoriously weaves her personal life into her music, crafting a story people are invested in on both a narrative level and a parasocial one. Each album is like a new chapter in an ongoing story, and even when albums like </span><i><span>Folklore </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Evermore</span></i><span> are presented as fictional concept albums, they mask reality, with fans theory-crafting what nuggets of truth might lie behind each song. Swift crafts lore and legacy like a dungeon master spinning a tale for a party waiting with bated breath for the next session. Even if you’re not a fan of her music, you have to respect the game design at the heart of her work.</span></p>

                  This gorgeous remake of a classic didn’t receive a Switch 2-specific version, but does it run better anyway?
                </p><div>
              
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch is home to a number of games in <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> franchise, such as the award-winning open-world adventures of <i>Breath of the Wild</i> and <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>, the inventive Zelda-starring <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i>, and quite a few classic titles via a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Last but not least, we even got a remake of a sometimes-underrated entry: <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i>.</p> <p>Though it sports an all-new chibi art style and some basic quality-of-life features, such as improved menu navigation and button mapping features, <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i> on Nintendo Switch maintains the integrity of the 1993 Game Boy to ensure that both new and returning fans can enjoy the fourth game in the series just as it’s always been.</p> <p>And with everything intact just as you’d expect, you can be certain that you’re getting a game with the same runtime as the original, too. But just how long is <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i> on Nintendo Switch? And does it run any better on Switch 2? Let’s get into it.</p>

 <h2>How does <i>Link’s Awakening </i>run on Switch 2?</h2> <p>Unlike <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>, and many other original Switch titles, <i>Link’s Awakening</i> doesn’t have a specific Switch 2 upgrade you can purchase. But that’s not to say the game didn’t receive any love when Nintendo’s new console dropped. On June 3, 2025, <i>Link’s Awakening</i> got a patch that optimizes the game’s visuals, upping the resolution and improving HDR support.</p> <p><i>Link’s Awakening</i> also ran into some troublesome framerate issues on the original Switch. Running on Switch 2, however, the issue has been dramatically improved, if not fixed entirely. So if you’re waiting on upgrading to a Switch 2 before diving into this remake, your patience will be rewarded with improved performance. Check out a direct comparison <a href="https://youtu.be/e2kBayO4bqY">here</a>:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Zelda: Link's Awakening - Switch/Switch 2 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2kBayO4bqY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>How long is <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i>?</h2> <p><b><i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i></b><b> will take the average player between 12-15 hours</b> to reach the credits. Much of this time will be spent solving puzzles, talking to NPCs, and tracking down useful items required to complete your journey. But that doesn’t include finding every heart piece and seashell, finishing every trading sequence, or engaging with other optional tasks.</p> <p>If you’re wanting to collect all of that stuff and see every bit of additional content, <b>you’ll be looking at closer to 20-25 hours of play time in </b><b><i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i></b>. That’s a whole hell of a lot of Hyrulian fun, but it’ll require some patience (or a nifty guide), as there are some well-hidden secrets to be found throughout this bright and colorful version of Hyrule.</p>

 <p>If you’re on the fence about this one, just remember that it’s a remake of a Game Boy game, for better and worse. It offers some memorable dungeons, a unique tale, and toy-like visuals that will appeal to newcomers and returning fans alike. But its fairly linear structure and occasionally frustrating old-school design philosophy may be a little polarizing, sticking out even more to those introduced to the franchise during the <i>Breath of the Wild</i> era.</p> <p>If <i>The</i> <i>Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </i>sounds up your alley, though, it’s available now on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
