While there was no footage to debut, the executive quietly let slip that a new <em>Forza </em>is coming next year as well as the “return of a classic” that’s been with Xbox from the beginning. It’s hard to imagine that’s anything other than the previously reported <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>remaster.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196915" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="158" data-playlist="196915,196917,197533" data-current="196915"><div><p>Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22479.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“As we think about bringing a new generation of players to these iconic franchises I’m excited to share that players will get to celebrate 25 years of Xbox with a new <em>Fable</em>, the next <em>Forza</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, and the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning,” Spencer said near the end of the livestream. </p><p>That tiny, innocuous-sounding snippet was full of news. The <em>Gears of War</em> prequel didn’t previously have a release window and the newest <em>Forza </em>hadn’t previously been mentioned at all (will it be <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> or something else?) But the detail most fans will be glomming onto is the hint at the original <em>Halo</em>’s return.</p><p>That game, previously reported by <em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren to be a remaster of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>in Unreal Engine 5, will presumably follow in the footsteps of the recent remaster of<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,&nbsp;</em>which Microsoft shadow-dropped last month. If that ends up being the case, the <em>Halo</em> remaster will likely be the original game running with overhauled graphics and some tweaked systems, though unlike <em>Oblivion</em>, there is already an HD<em> Master Chief Collection</em> players can use to access Bungie’s hit 2001 shooter. We’ll have to wait to learn more to see if <em>Combat Evolved</em> gets a more fundamental reworking to make it stand out on modern platforms. </p><p>Whatever it ends up being, it’s almost a guaranteed thing that a <em>Halo </em>remaster will be coming to PlayStation 5 as well, potentially serving as the perfect starting point to bring the iconic Xbox exclusive to Sony’s console for the first time ever. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763">And while that multiplatform push has left some fans wondering</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-fans-content-creators-ps5-ports-starfield-rumors-1851230962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-fans-content-creators-ps5-ports-starfield-rumors-1851230962">why they bothered buying an Xbox console at all this generation</a></span>, Spencer’s last-minute sound-bite suggests next year will be full of nostalgia for those who have been with the platform for decades.
