            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></i><span> is known for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-minigames-remake-trilogy-3-game-2000658234"><span>minigame glut</span></a><span>, but it did have at least </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-mini-games-best-worst-ranked-1851340606"><span>a few bangers</span></a><span> in the mix. One of those was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-queens-blood-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-1851312733"><span>Queen’s Blood</span></a><span>, a card game that you could play with various citizens throughout the world, and it even had its own extensive side story to follow. This was new for </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>–apparently Queen’s Blood hadn’t yet caught on in Midgar, where </span><i><span>Remake </span></i><span>takes place–and it sounds like Square Enix wants to expand upon it in the upcoming third game.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/"><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed Queen’s Blood will make a return in the as-of-yet-untitled third game, but it will be a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span>“Queen’s Blood is a very popular and beloved minigame, and I believe a lot of people are still wanting something like that,” Hamaguchi told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. “I want to expand on Queen’s Blood so we are enhancing it, and giving you a more powered-up version of it when you see that third installment… Queen’s Blood is still going to be available in the third installment. We just want to expand on it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>What could those enhancements entail? New cards, mechanics, or maybe the board will just be twice as big, allowing for more territory-claiming plays? We probably won’t find out for a while, but Queen’s Blood isn’t the only minigame in the third entry, as it will also signal the return of the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>’s snowboarding segment, which Hamaguchi says will be more than “just a simple snowboarding minigame.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000021618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000021618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000021618">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I’m afraid I can’t delve too much into the details, but we understand that it’s not going to be just a simple snowboarding minigame. We want to make sure that it’s incorporated into the story to have that sort of connection with the theming of it,” he said.</span></p>

 <p><span>The third </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>remake is probably still a ways away, but it does seem like the game is coming along and is in a playable state.</span></p> <p><span>“In terms of the third installment, I believe we are coming along very smoothly,” he said. “We have set a schedule for ourselves, and I believe we are tracking on time for the milestones we have set. So I’m really thankful for the development team and I have so much respect for them working on this project. I believe that at this point the game is playable, technically, but we are still trying to polish it so it is at a quality where we can deliver it to our players.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851"><span>on the Switch 2</span></a><span> and Xbox Series X/S, with </span><i><span>Rebirth </span></i><span>expected to launch on both systems later this year.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-starts-a-streaming-device-clearance-fire-tv-stick-4k-plus-newest-model-hits-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-2000662384</link>
            <guid>1414258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>No smart TV? No problem. If your screen is working fine otherwise, you don’t have to replace it to enjoy smart features. A Fire TV stick can do the job for considerably less, and you can now pick its latest model for under than $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/">Amazon is currently offering the newest Fire TV Stick 4K Plus at a 30% discount, bringing the price down to $35</a>. Use the code FTV4K25 at checkout, and you’ll save another $10, which drops the total to just $25. You’ll also get a one-month free trial to Xbox GamePass with your purchase, which sweetens the offer even more.</p>
<p>Those with an older Fire TV stick lying around can trade it in for 20% off this model, but you might not be able to combine the current discount with that.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy Setup</h2>
<p>This small, but mighty stick plugs directly into the HDMI input of your TV. Then, connect the USB cable to the Fire TV Stick and the power adapter. Plug the adapter into a wall outlet, and turn your TV on. You can now follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, even if it’s your first time using one.</p>
<p>Once it’s all set and running, you’ll be able to stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes from popular platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Max, and more. Most of these require a monthly fee, but if you’re looking to cut back on those, no sweat. It also gets you instant access to over 400,000 free movies and TV episodes from popular ad-supported streaming apps like Fire TV Channels, Prime Video, Tubi, and Pluto TV. Basically, you’ll never be out of stuff to watch. Maybe start the night with a good horror movie, and then switch to a lighthearted comedy show to wrap things up (and keep nightmares at bay)!</p>
<p>Smart search is made possible with Alexa, which lets you simply use your voice to find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. For instance, you can say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Jake Gyllenhaal movies”, or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and your command will be answered in seconds.</p>



<p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is made to help you maximize your TV’s potential. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support means you can stream content in vibrant 4K Ultra HD, plus enjoy immersive sound with Dolby Atmos audio. There’s WiFi 6 for smoother streaming, which also ensures less interference from other connected devices.</p>
<p>Gamers will appreciate that you can also game with Xbox Game Pass via cloud gaming through the stick. We’re talking playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Outer Worlds 2, Ninja Gaiden 4, and hundreds of other titles without a console. And since you also get a month of Xbox GamePass with your purchase, you can jump in at no extra cost.</p>
<p>This version of the stick comes with early access to Alexa+ as well, which is Amazon’s smartest AI assistant yet. The access is available through the end of 2026, and after that, it will be included with Prime. Again, it’s a nice way to try the new features without committing.</p>
<p>We’re not expecting this 50% discount to last long, so it’s best to grab it without wasting time. Just make sure you use the code FTV4K25 at checkout to maximize savings.</p>

              <p>It feels like a rare treat for a Nintendo Direct to take us by surprise, now that the events are routinely being pre-empted by leakers. This latest, just revealed by Nintendo to take place on January 25 at 9 a.m. ET (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-set-for-january-25"><em>Gematsu</em></a>), snuck up on me. It’s a shame it’s just for the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, rather than meeting our desperate need for Switch 2 game news, but at least it means we’ll get to see Shigeru Miyamoto being all delightfully excited.</p> <p>Yes, January 25&nbsp;<em>is</em> a Sunday, which is a weird choice for a Direct. All right-minded games and film journalists are in bed at 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, so expect some bleary-eyed coverage of the new footage and details being revealed ahead of the movie’s April 3 release.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us on Sunday, Jan 25, at 6am PT for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> featuring an exclusive look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p> <p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/gTC114mMLz">https://t.co/gTC114mMLz</a> <a href="https://t.co/4DOoFU1fFJ">pic.twitter.com/4DOoFU1fFJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2014700056855687256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nintendo says this will feature “an exclusive look at&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>,” but gives no more information than that. So far we’ve seen a&nbsp;<em>very</em> limited amount of the movie, mostly sticking to a single scene of Mario and Luigi’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-trailer-bowser-smug-jerk-2000643462">frustrating conversation</a> with a miniature Bowser in his teeny castle. Aside from the reveal of Rosalina, weirdly little has been shown of a movie that’s due out in just over two months.</p>  <p>The original 2023&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488">may not have been particularly good</a>, but it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-bros-movie-box-office-records-sonic-reviews-1850318954">wildly successful</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-miyamoto-negative-bad-reviews-1850380112">Miyamoto even claimed</a> the negative reviews helped the movie succeed. Nintendo and Illumination are presumably feeling very confident of a similar success for the sequel, which will hopefully make better use of the splendid&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> setting than first movie did of its Mushroom Kingdom hodgepodge.</p>

 <p>Following Sunday’s Direct, we can expect promotion for the animated movie to really ramp up, although presumably continuing to try to feature Chris Pratt’s dull-ass voice as little as possible.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 VR Modder Locks Out Subscribers After New DMCA: ‘People On The Web Are Thirsty For Blood’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-luke-ross-patreon-2000662571</link>
            <guid>1414222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The modder who goes by Luke Ross has made full VR mods for some of the biggest blockbuster games around. He’s now decided to take them all offline, at least for now. After reportedly trying and failing to get CD Projekt Red to pay him for a full-conversion VR mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, Ross was hit earlier this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">with a DMCA takedown notice</a> from the Polish RPG maker. The modder has now been hit with another DMCA from the publisher of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghostrunner-is-actually-the-fall-s-sharpest-cyberpunk-g-1845917183"><em>Ghostrunner</em></a>, and has decided to suspend his entire Patreon, where access to dozens of other VR mods is locked behind a subscriber paywall, for at least the next month.</p> <p>“In light of the above facts, I’m being forced to take immediate action. I’m making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims,” Ross wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">a reported email to subscribers last night</a> (via <em><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a></em>). “And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I’m making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time.”</p>

 <p>The dramatic move came after Ross reportedly feared losing access to the account entirely after a takedown notice from Ghostrunner publisher 505 Games. “No mention of any terms of service violation this time,” wrote the modder. “Again Patreon automatically complied. I don’t blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they ‘believe’ their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don’t like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process.”</p> <p>Ross’ frustration with the publishers who own the games he’s modding and the power dynamics of modern DMCA threats on the internet is clear throughout the email, but the modder also tries to address criticisms about him charging for the mods in the first place. Central to CDPR’s complaint against the <em>Cyberpunk 2077 VR</em> mod was that Ross was charging players to access it via a subscription. As with a similar VR mod for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the normally pro-mod game maker reiterated that it would be fine with Ross making the creations free and simply allowing users to voluntarily tip instead, as many other modders do.</p>

 <p>“People on the web are thirsty for blood because back in the <em>GTA V</em> and <em>RDR 2</em> era, an article came out stating that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead">I was raising $20,000 a month</a>. Is that ‘reasonable?'” Ross wrote. “Assuming that overall the work I poured into making my software support <em>Cyberpunk</em>, turning it into the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q02UCNXLJY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc">most immersive gaming experience’</a>&nbsp;some people had in their lives, amounted to a few months, say $50,000: is that ‘reasonable’ according to the arbitrary criteria of <em>Cyberpunk</em>‘s publisher? Something tells me it wouldn’t be considered reasonable, despite being a tiny fraction of the many millions they would have to invest for porting <em>CP2077</em> to VR themselves, and despite the fact that the cost was entirely financed by passionate gamers and none of it was incurred by CD Projekt Red.”</p>

 <p>Ross’ thankless crusade hasn’t won over the gaming masses quite yet. He accused users of trying to pirate the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod even after it was taken down in order <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">to “punish” him</a>&nbsp;for breaking CDPR’s terms of service. “Wouldn’t making his mod free and accepting optional donations make him bulletproof to all claims?” asked one commenter on the VR subreddit where Ross’ latest email was shared. “Guy wants so bad to make some nice cash out of this, and got so upset that he is not even considering alternative ‘business models,’ he just said fuck it.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-clearance-on-docking-stations-at-a-record-low-with-ugreens-7-in-1-usb-c-hub-2000662398</link>
            <guid>1414219</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station converts a USB-C connector on your computer or tablet into a multi-connection hub for additional monitors, storage devices, and accessories. Aluminum construction gives this docking station a slender profile that houses 7 connections, 2 HDMI video connections, 2 USB-A data connections, 2 USB-C data connections, and a dedicated input for powering the unit. In addition, you can connect monitors, storage devices, and a charger with a single, compact adapter, eliminating the need to manage multiple adapters/dongles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/"><span>Visit Amazon and purchase the UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station for only $26, down from the regular price of $37, for a 31% savings.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A docking station to collect all your important tech in one place</h2>
<p><span>With this dock, you can drive two external monitors at resolutions up to 4K (3840×2160) and refresh rates up to 60Hz via its two HDMI ports. You can duplicate your primary screen on the second monitor, or expand your desktop to an additional monitor, freeing up space on the original monitor for other applications.</span></p>
<p><span>The four 10 Gb/s data ports provide the space for connecting your most frequently used peripherals. This dock has two USB-A and two USB-C connectors that support connecting external solid-state drives (SSDs), flash drives, keyboards, mice, etc., at much faster speeds than USB 2.0 ports. As these connectors are designed primarily to transfer data, and not to charge your laptop or to output video, they enable you to move large files and back up your data to external storage devices more rapidly.</span></p>



<p><span>There is a dedicated USB-C Power Delivery port on this dock that lets you keep your laptop charged even when the dock is connected to it. It can accept up to 100W of power from a compatible USB-C charger and pass power to the host cable. So, a single connection to the dock can perform both charging and expansion functions. Only power is transferred through the PD port, allowing the other 10 Gb/s ports to be used for data transfer.</span></p>
<p><span>The aluminum housing of this dock is compact, yet sturdy enough to withstand normal usage without being bulky in your travel case. The small size of the dock, combined with a relatively short host cable, minimizes clutter and prevents adjacent ports on the side of your laptop from being obstructed by the dock. You can either permanently keep this dock on a desk or include it in a travel kit with a charger and HDMI cables. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/">At a sale price of $26, down from its original list price of $37</a>, the UGREEN 7-in-1 docking station is a great solution that provides two 4K-resolution HDMI outputs, high-speed data ports, and power-through charging via a single USB-C connector.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-mini-gaming-pc-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-drops-to-an-all-time-low-as-amazon-starts-offloading-a-top-rated-tiny-pc-2000662379</link>
            <guid>1414162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="336" data-end="594">If you’re in the market for desktop-level chops without the gargantuan footprint, the <span><span>KAMRUI Hyper H2 Mini Gaming PC</span></span> is currently living its best discounted life on Amazon&nbsp; — and it’s worth a long, hard look if you want serious oomph that won’t swallow your entire desk. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">Its resume is topped by an Amazon’s Choice designation, an average 4.6-star rating, and best of all, an all-time-low price of $510 after a 38% price drop.</a></p>
<p data-start="596" data-end="929">This pocket-sized powerhouse packs a 13th-gen Intel Core i7-13620H — that’s 10 cores and 16 threads that can crank at up to 4.9 GHz — straight into a tiny box that can take up a near-invisible residence behind your monitor with a VESA mount. It’s essentially a Mac Mini for the Windows crowd, except at a better price and with far more expansion options.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="596" data-end="929">Mini With Muscle</h2>
<p data-start="931" data-end="1258">The hand-sized chassis of the Kamrui Hyper H2 conceals a wealth of power under the hood, particularly when you consider the $510 price tag. You get 32 GB of RAM and a 1 TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD — plenty of breathing room for your game library, creative tools, and whatever else you need. And if that storage starts feeling cramped, there’s room to grow it even more — the RAM can go up to 64GB and the SSD as high as 4TB. (Try that with a Mac Mini.)</p>
<p data-start="1260" data-end="1576">The Hyper H2 expands its bona fides by driving up to three&nbsp;4K displays simultaneously (HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C with USB4 for 40 Gbps transfer speeds are among the Hyper H2’s many ports), making it downright mean for multi-monitor setups, streaming, or editing workflows that need space to breathe.</p>
<p data-start="1578" data-end="1821">The connections are totally up to date — Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 keep wireless peripherals and networking humming, while a 2.5 GbE LAN port gives you the option of a faster wired lane for big downloads or local server flexing.</p>


<h2 data-start="1578" data-end="1821">Time to Game (Up to a Point)</h2>
<p data-start="1823" data-end="2312">Kamrui refers to the Hyper H2 as a gaming PC, and that’s true — to a point. The reality check says it’s still got integrated graphics, so if you’re trying to play <em data-start="1911" data-end="1923">Elden Ring</em> at 4K max settings, you’ll be disappointed. But for midrange gaming titles, eSports classics, and virtually every productivity task you can toss its way, this little cube punches well above its weight and its price. Think <em>Fortnite-</em> and <em>Marvel Rivals-</em> style playability, plus easy cruising through creative workloads and everyday multitasking without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p data-start="2314" data-end="2571">In a world where gaming desks are already crowded with keyboards, mice, monitors, and that one mystery USB gadget you swear you bought for some reason that now escapes you, a desktop that <em data-start="2465" data-end="2481">shrinks itself</em> while still delivering decent performance is kind of a flex. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">Especially at this price now that it’s at its lowest point ever at Amazon — just $510 while this deal is still in place.</a></p>

Plus, it has IP68 water- and dust-resistance, a scratch-resistant screen, and a solid frame that protects against water and dust exposure and can withstand small drops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/">Click here to purchase the Google Pixel 9a Smartphone at $399, down from $499, which is a $100 discount and a 20% reduction.</a></p>

<h2>A versatile smartphone with plenty of AI-centric features</h2>
<p>Pixel Cameras are designed to take great photographs, and once you have taken a picture, you can use the camera’s A.I. to further refine the image if you want greater control. The rear wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle cameras enable users to capture large vistas and tight compositions, and features such as Add Me and Best Take allow users to salvage a group shot that includes individuals who may have blinked or were outside the frame.</p>
<p>Macro Focus lets you zoom in on items such as textures, plants, and very small objects, so their finer details become apparent. AI photo editing lets you remove distractions and adjust lighting to be consistent throughout the image, without exporting to a separate editor.</p>



<p>The Pixel 9a’s battery life is powered by Adaptive Battery and rated for more than 30 hours of use on a single charge. If needed, Extreme Battery Saver can extend battery life to approximately 100 hours by limiting the number of lower-priority apps running in the background while conserving power. Fast Wired Charging lets you quickly recharge the battery when you do not have access to a charger for an extended period, and Wireless Charging lets you place the phone on a compatible wireless pad rather than searching for a charging cable.</p>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a Smartphone offers numerous features, including durability, security, and long-term support. Its IP68 rating and reinforced design protect against dust and liquids, as well as damage from drops. Safety features enable the detection of potential theft, automatically lock your data, and assist in detecting a car accident and initiating emergency calls. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/">At a discounted price of $399, reduced from the original list price of $499, the Pixel 9a offers significant value in a small-footprint 6.3-inch frame.</a></p>
