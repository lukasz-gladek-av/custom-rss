              <p>EA’s shareholders are clearly keen on a buy-out, no matter where the money comes from. The sale, that would see the 43-year-old company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">become majority owned by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund</a> (PIF), could go ahead by the beginning of 2027 pending government approval, now that public investors have voted in favor of the deal. And government approval might not be <em>too</em> tricky, given Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner would also benefit from 1.1 percent of the deal.</p> <p>The full deal <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">will see EA become a private company</a>, 37 years after it originally went public, with ownership unevenly split between three groups. The vast majority—an enormous 93.4 percent—will be owned by the murderous regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman via Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. That will leave 5.5 percent going to Californian private equity firm Silver Lake, and 1.1 percent for Affinity Partners, Jared Kushner’s investment firm that is, well, primarily funded by Saudi Arabia. If completed, it would mean EA stockholders will receive an enormous $210 per share.</p>   <p>While this will make for a nice payday for shareholders (which obviously includes EA management), it will also <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">leave EA saddled with $20 billion in debt</a> from paying off the ludicrously inflated share price, putting its credit rating in the sewers, and it’s hard to see how the company can sustain that.&nbsp;Then, of course, there’s the very significant matter of the company being almost entirely owned by a state that <a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/saudi-arabia/">kills people for being gay or trans</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">murders</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/saudi-arabia-turki-al-jasser-executed">journalists</a>, and <a href="https://theweek.com/60339/things-women-cant-do-in-saudi-arabia">denies women many basic rights</a>. EA employees obviously have good reason to be fearful, no matter how much the PIF may exist to whitewash the country’s actions, and there’s no way of knowing how the ownership might affect everything from basic company policy to what’s included in games.</p>

 <p>Given the precarious state in which this deal would leave an impossibly indebted EA, and the likely exodus of both those let go in attempt to combat crippling costs and those who leave in disgust, it seems extremely unlikely EA could survive in any recognizable form. While games like&nbsp;<em>FC26&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> are huge successes, they’re also massive investments for smaller returns when compared to the mobile slop that makes up more than half of the games industry’s $200 billion value.</p>

 <p>The deal will certainly face lengthy scrutiny around the world, just as we saw with Microsoft’s $67 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard King, although it could have a far easier ride in the U.S. While <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ftc-xbox-activision-congress-appeal-blizzard-1850638519">the FTC fought hard against the Microsoft deal</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/08/supreme-court-trump-power-ftc-slaughter">all bets are off under Trump,</a> and Kushner’s involvement could certainly help grease the wheels.</p>

 <p>From the shareholders’ perspective, however, EA is a company that’s stalled and lacked for enough big hits in recent years, and hasn’t looked likely to turn things around for a long while. This is an opportunity to get out with a big profit, no matter the human cost, nor the company’s future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE (2025) Crash to All-Time Low on Amazon With This-Week Delivery, While AirPods Pro 3 Ship in 2026]]></title>

              <p>If you’ve been looking for a premium pair of earbuds that offer impressive sound and a long-lasting battery without blowing your budget, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/">The latest Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE are currently going for just $110 at Amazon, after the retailer took a massive 27% off their usual $150 price.</a> The offer applies to both the classic black and the stunning gray color options, but there’s a catch. The discount is only around for today. It ends at midnight, which means you don’t have a lot of time left to save. Additionally, you’re also getting a two-month free trial to Audible with your purchase, which adds even more value to the deal. We highly recommend placing your orders before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Distinct Listening Modes</h2>
<p>This stylish pair of earbuds features a sleek blade design with newly redesigned round eartips that keep the buds securely in place. The lightweight frame makes it easy to wear them for long; perfect for never-ending commutes and extensive workout sessions. Samsung has packed these with a bigger 11mm dynamic speaker with rich bass and powerful sound that brings all your favorite music to life. You will be able to enjoy all those energy-packed tracks during the day, plus calming theme songs at night, to the fullest.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; active noise canceling and transparency mode. The ANC mode blocks all external background distractions to deliver an immersive listening experience. It’s great for when you want to block the outside world for a bit, such as when in a coffee shop or in a packed subway. The transparency mode, on the other hand, lets external sounds in while still delivering solid audio. It’s designed to keep you aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Catching up with friends on the go and taking work meetings will be just as easy, thanks to the added microphone and enhanced background noise reduction. These come together to isolate your sound from all that chatter and laughter in the background, ensuring you come through clearly on the other end. Gemini support also makes it easy to communicate with the smart assistant throughout the day without pulling your phone out. Just say something like, “Hey Google, what’s the weather today?”, and you will have your answers within seconds.</p>



<p>Managing music and taking calls can be done right through the buds. A simple pinch lets you play audio, pause songs, and attend calls. Similarly, simply swiping the blade adjusts the volume. Another feature that deserves a mention is real-time translation, which converts spoken audio into your preferred language on the fly. Battery-wise, you’re looking at around 8.5 hours of listening with ANC off, and a total of 30 hours with the charging case. You can easily go a couple of days without worrying about plugging these in.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a great option for anyone looking to enjoy powerful sound, deep bass, stable battery life, and hands-free AI assistance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/">This deal brings the total down to $110, which is nothing considering all the features the pair comes packed with.</a> Additionally, you’re getting a two-month free trial to Audible, which gets you instant access to a wide range of audiobooks, podcasts, and Audible Originals.</p>
<p>Be sure to grab the discount sooner rather than later, as the deal is only going to be around for a few more hours.</p>
