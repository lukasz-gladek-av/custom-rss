              <p>MagicCon Atlanta just kicked off and with it, the roadmap for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> in 2026. It includes seven sets and more branded crossovers than you can shake a Black Lotus at. If you thought this year was overstuffed, just wait. From Lorwyn and <em>Star Trek</em> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-playstation-last-of-us-god-of-war-ellie-2000629350"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and Dwight from<em> The Office</em>, Wizards of the Coast is ready to take everything in your wallet, and your sanity, too.</p> <h2 id="lorwyn-eclipsed-january-2026">Lorwyn Eclipsed – January 23, 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629342"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629342">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s been 18 years since players visited Lorwyn, the idyllic land of whimsical creatures like elves and merfolk. Lorwyn Eclipsed is one of the most-anticipated authentic MTG sets in years, with old mechanics returning to the spotlight and players getting to go back to where Planeswalkers were first introduced. I can’t believe it’s been that long. I still remember drafting my first Jace Beleren in college.</p> <h2>Mystery Universes Beyond set – 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629355"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629355">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Wizards of the Coast teased a mystery set it’s not ready to fully reveal yet. More details are coming during New York Comicon in October where, as others have noted, there’s a <em>Magic</em> and Nickelodeon panel planned. Are we getting <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>? <em>Rugrats</em>? <em>Hey Arnold</em>? All of the above?!</p>

 <h2 id="secrets-of-strixhaven-april-2026">Secrets of Strixhaven – April 2026</h2>  <figure id="attachment_2000629341" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629341"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629341">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>School is back in session. Secrets of Strixhaven will take players back to the plane of&nbsp;Arcavios where colleges of sorcerers-in-training compete for bragging rights in the Mage Tower. It’s Wizards’ knock-off of <em>Harry Potter</em> and we’ll find more about what its next set has in store in early 2026.</p>

 <h2 id="marvel-super-heroes-june-2026">Marvel Super Heroes – June 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629344"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629344">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>If any of the sets can rival the dominance <em>Final Fantasy </em>had this past summer, it’s this one. It’ll draw from characters across the Marvel universe, meaning Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and more. There will also be all the villains to account for. I’d have preferred <em>just</em> an X-Men set, personally. There’s way too much material to speed through in one set. But here we are.</p>

 <h2 id="the-hobbit-august-2026">The Hobbit – August 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629346"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629346">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>A return to Tolkien’s world of hobbits, wizards, and dragons is on the way. The <em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>set was the first <em>MTG</em> Universes Beyond release to make a big splash. This set will be heading back to the prequel book and pulling from an earlier part of the Third Age. Will there be <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-lotr-mtg-tcg-one-ring-card-price-1850596616">another One Ring card</a>&nbsp;to rule them all this time around?</p>

 <h2 id="reality-fracture-october-2026">Reality Fracture – October 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629347"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629347">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Wizards has been setting up Reality Fracture as a big comic-book-style event that will reverberate across its multiverse. We have no idea what to expect really, but the company is teasing “a villain you’ll have to see to believe.” Is it the friends we made along the way?</p>

 <h2 id="star-trek-november-2026">Star Trek – November 2026</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629348"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629348">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-trek-tng-enterprise-price-release-date-2000624069">First Lego</a>, now <em>MTG</em>. I’m embarrassed about how much money I’m about to drop chasing a surge foil full alt art Jean-Luc Picard commander card. The set will feature characters and ships from across the entire franchise. I can’t wait to make a Borg deck.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x PlayStation<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Superdrop</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629365"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629365">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Secret Lair drops are always a mess and I’m guessing this one won’t be any different. Who’s ready to spend 45 minutes in an online queue only for Wizards to sell out and refuse to let you give it $100 at the end? The Kratos art looks incredible though.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x Jaws: Terror of Amity Island</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629366"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629366">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s the rest of the Secret Lair drop announcements, and somehow Jaws <em>isn’t </em>the weirdest one<em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Secret Lair x The Office: Dwight’s Destiny</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629369"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629369">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p><em>The Office</em> was a funny show and the world is never gonna let us forget it.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x Iron Maiden: Album Art</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629363"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629363">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>I defer to the Iron Maiden x <em>MTG</em> fans on this.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x Iron Maiden: Eddie Unchained</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629358" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629358"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629358">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>See above.</p> <h2>Secret Lair x Furby: Doo-ay Noo-lah</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629362"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629362">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Wut?</p>  <figure id="attachment_2000629361" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629361"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629361">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>???</p> <h2><em>Secret Lair x Furby: The OddBodies</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629359"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629359">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p>Absolutely not.</p>

               <p><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>has become the </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>of trading card games, and as annoying as I find the practice of constantly dumping different IPs together, even God’s strongest soldiers are not immune to propaganda. At MagicCon Atlanta, Wizards of the Coast and Sony announced that </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/26/first-in-depth-look-at-magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-x-playstation-collaboration-launching-this-october/"><span>PlayStation series are getting seven different Secret Lair drops</span></a><span> for various games, and folks, I want those</span><i><span> Last of Us </span></i><span>cards.</span></p> <p><span>On October 27, Wizards of the Coast will be selling seven PlayStation sets, with most of them covering different franchises in the console maker’s catalog. However, both </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>are getting two sets. The former will have a pair of cards for both the first game and its sequel, while the latter will cover both the original Greek storyline and the reboot’s Norse one. With the exception of the </span><i><span>Last of Us </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> sets, most of these drops just seem to feature one card with their respective games’ protagonists. The set will drop at 9 a.m. Pacific Time that Monday.</span></p> <p><span>The full line-up includes:</span></p> <ul> <li><i><span>The Last of Us Part I</span></i></li> <li><i><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></i></li> <li><i><span>Uncharted</span></i></li> <li><i><span>God of War: Greek</span></i></li> <li><i><span>God of War: Norse</span></i></li> <li><i><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></i></li> <li><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i></li> </ul> <p><span>Though it’s not surprising that Sony would want to spotlight its current stable of prestige action games, I’m bummed there’s not more classic PlayStation representation here. Give me Parappa the Rapper, you cowards. But that’s pretty par for the course these days with Sony. Even its upcoming concert series is leaning heavily into its new stuff.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I don’t play </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, but I did buy the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cards they put out earlier this year just to get the Shadow the Hedgehog one. He’s sitting pretty on my shelf, so I guess I’ll also buy the </span><i><span>Last of Us </span></i><span>ones next month, to keep him company. You know, as long as they don’t sell out before it’s my turn in the queue.</span></p>
