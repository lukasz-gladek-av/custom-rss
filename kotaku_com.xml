            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Megabonk</em>, a 3D reimagining of <em>Vampire Survivors </em>that became one of 2025’s surprise hits, has somewhat belatedly released its Halloween update just in time for the winter holidays. But hey, Christmas has always been spook-adjacent, right? There’s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>,&nbsp;<em>Krampus</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>…</p> <p>“yoo I’ve finally finished the update I was working on,” said solo developer Vedinad <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791474891212&amp;emgid=523110495538905880">in a post on Steam</a>. “Was originally going to be a small halloween update, but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than I initially planned.” He goes on to list the new content added in the Spooky Update:</p>

 <ul> <li>New Map</li> <li>New Character</li> <li>New Weapon</li> <li><wbr>New Items</li> <li><wbr>New Enemies and Bosses</li> <li><wbr>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li> </ul> <p><em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is an unabashed reinterpretation of Poncle’s <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, albeit with a few original twists of its own, not least that it’s now a 3D, third-person action game. It came out in September this year and absolutely exploded in popularity almost right away. And deservedly so! <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591">It’s a great game, even if most of its ideas aren’t entirely original</a>. It also came out a couple of months ahead of Poncle announcing its own reinterpretation of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> as a 3D version of itself</a>, although in that case it’s also being combined with a deckbuilding roguelite.</p>

 <p>Alongside the new elements listed above, the Spooky Update also comes with a bunch of bug fixes, some new “advanced” settings for very niche tweaks, and a host of balancing changes. There’s also access to the game’s console, with the intention of making the game more open to speedrunning. And even this update has since received an update, fixing a few issues the spookiness introduced.</p> <p>The game’s well worth checking out. A lot of people already have, to the degree that it was nominated in this year’s Best Debut Indie Game category at the Game Awards, before the pseudonymous developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">withdraw it from consideration on the basis that it’s not really his first game</a>. (Something <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">the category’s eventual winners</a> did&nbsp;<em>not</em> choose to do.)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-g-driving-force-shifter-drops-to-its-lowest-price-ever-compatible-with-racing-wheels-and-pedals-for-xbox-ps5-and-pc-2000653077</link>
            <guid>1383535</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Forza Horizon 5 making its way to the PS5 earlier this year, now’s the perfect time to jump in and enjoy one of the standout racing games of this generation. To elevate the experience even further, you’ll want the right gear—something that makes it feel like you’re in the driver’s seat. The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC is currently seeing a major price drop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/">Normally $60 on Amazon, it’s now discounted by 17%, bringing the cost down to just $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>As funny as it would be to use the Logitech G Driving Force Shifter alongside a standard controller, I’m afraid that’s not possible. This product is part of a larger kit. Logitech’s G Series racing setup is crafted for maximum realism with a driving wheel, pedals, and this optional shifter. Real race cars are manual, not automatic. So if you want to complete your driving simulation setup, you’ll need this last piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter is compatible with Logitech G29 and G290 Driving Force Racing Wheels in order to enhance your experience behind the wheel. The shifter plugs in via cable to the rear side of your Logitech driving wheel.</p>
<p>You get real, quality construction that has the weight and feel of an actually shifter you might find in your own vehicle. It’s made with a solid steel gear shaft. The knob and boot are covered in a high-quality hand-stitched leather, which makes it look and feel like the real deal. It’s also durable and can put off wear and tear for a long time.</p>
<p>The shifter can be securely mounted to your driving rig. The lever is designed to be grabbed and pulled around, so the whole unit needs to be able to hold it’s ground while you race. That’s why it has built-in clamps and bolt points. The clamps just twist on either side to screw into a secure fit, then you push down the knobs to lock it into place. Easy peasy.</p>



<h2>Ultimate Precision</h2>
<p>Using the six-speed shifter is fluid. You’re met with a satisfying, tactile click as you shift between each gear. You’ll be able to execute smooth, accurate gear transitions whether you’re speeding up down a straight away or coming out of a turn. Pull down to put your rig in reverse.</p>
<p>Aside from just enhancing your experience playing a racing game, a driving sim like this makes for a not so bad method of learning to be behind the wheel. Particularly if you’ve only ever driven automatic, this can provide a safe way to learn how to drive stick. If you travel a lot, especially in Europe, you’ll find that renting an automatic is far more expensive than renting manual. Plus, you’ll have a lot more options of vehicle choice with manual. It’s a good skill set to have.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-adds-a-17-3%e2%80%b3-laptop-to-holiday-deals-at-nearly-70-off-with-399-worth-of-free-accessories-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-windows-11-pro-2000653266</link>
            <guid>1383496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tech purchases tend to be expensive, but they don’t have to be – if you know where to look for the best deals. Our team scans the internet for the top discounts that are actually worth your money, and those for a reliable everyday laptop under $800; we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/">The 17-inch HP laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) can be yours for just $760 at Amazon, after the retailer took an unbelievable 67% off its usual $2,200 price.</a> It’s a straightforward discount, so you don’t need to worry about entering any complicated coupon codes or following twisted checkout steps to score it. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. The bundle comes with a free accessory kit worth almost $400, too, which sweetens the deal even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid Performance for Demanding Tasks</h2>
<p>Starting off with the freebies; you’re getting an external CD/DVD drive, a Redragon mouse, a clean cloth, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. All of this is useful, but we especially like how you’re getting an efficient OS installed and ready to go. Microsoft has packed the system with a bunch of productivity and security tools that are specifically made keeping remote workers and creatives in mind. Windows 11 typically comes with specific installation requirements, but having it pre-installed means you can skip that entire setup hassle and get started with using it right away.</p>
<p>As for the laptop itself, it’s got a nice, expansive 17.3-inch Full HD screen that delivers stunning clarity and vibrant colors consistently. The anti-glare panel reduces reflections for a more comfortable viewing experience in all lighting situations, whether you’re using the machine out there in the sun or in your room at night. There’s a built-in HD camera with a physical privacy shutter right at the top of the screen for better video calls, too.</p>



<p>Those who need to type long documents frequently will appreciate the ergonomic keyboard that features soft keys to reduce finger and wrist fatigue during long sessions. It’s even got a dedicated Microsoft Copilot key for instant AI-powered assistance 24/7. Battery life is another strong selling point, as it delivers up to 7 hours of usage on a single charge. That translates into going an entire workday without plugging it in. Even better, recharging doesn’t take forever either, as HP Fast Charge boosts your battery from 0% to 50% in just about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Power-wise, the laptop runs on an Intel Core i3-N305 8-Core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 3.8 GHz. There’s 32 RAM to keep things running smoothly, and it’s especially great for multitaskers who prefer juggling at least a few tasks at the same time. It keeps noticeable slowdowns at bay, even when things get intense. Storage is made easy with the 1TB SSD. It’s not only spacious, but also gets you fast boot/transfer times, helping you stay productive throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/">There’s a lot more to appreciate about this HP laptop, especially at its current price of $760.</a> For well under $1,000, you’re getting a machine that’s ideal for work professionals, creatives, students, and even casual users. It’s a limited-time discount that somehow managed to crawl through Black Friday, but it won’t be around forever. It’s best to snap it up as quick as you can, as we’re expecting the offer to expire soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Not Everyone Is Excited That Leon Is Back In Resident Evil Requiem]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-grace-playable-split-2000653406</link>
            <guid>1383448</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After weeks of rumors, speculation, and leaks, Capcom confirmed at last week’s Game Awards ceremony that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-leon-kennedy-is-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem-re9-game-awards-2000652755"><span>Leon Kennedy is returning in </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span> as a playable character. The older version of the Raccoon City cop will co-lead the upcoming survival horror game alongside new hero Grace Ashcroft when it launches on February 27. For some, this reveal was a moment of celebration, as Leon is a fan-favorite character who hasn’t been playable in a mainline game since 2012’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 6 </span></i><span>(though he’s playable in two of Capcom’s more recent remakes), but for others, the fact that Grace doesn’t have the spotlight to herself is a disappointment.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849"><i><span>Requiem</span></i></a><span>’s surprise announcement at Summer Game Fest, the game</span> <span>has been marketed as Grace’s story, one that would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-2-4-horror-scary-grace-2000630216"><span>lean into a more survival horror/puzzle-centric playstyle</span></a><span>. So imagine everyone’s surprise when Leon showed up with a small arsenal, his trademark cheesy one-liners, and much more action-focused gameplay. Capcom says that </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> will be a </span><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60614"><span>roughly 50/50 split</span></a><span> between the two characters, which sounds like a good way to keep the game from getting stale, at least. But some feel that </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>is leaning too heavily on its original cast of characters, and that the series</span> <span>could use some new blood.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After two games starring the deliberately nondescript Ethan Winters, and most of the games before that passing the protagonist ball back and forth between Leon, Jill Valentine, and the Redfield siblings, fans were excited about Grace and </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>putting the spotlight on a relative unknown. She has ties to previous games through her mother Alyssa Ashcroft, who appeared in the </span><i><span>Outbreak </span></i><span>games, but Grace is the first new </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>hero in a hot minute. So some fans are a little disappointed that she’ll be sharing the spotlight with one of the series’ biggest names.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I like Leon, I just hope Grace isn’t another damsel for him to rescue and can stand on her own as a strong well written character,” Nikolai508 wrote in the same thread.</span></p> <p><span>Some fans speculate that Capcom anticipated some fans would start ignoring Grace once their favorite rookie cop, who has officially undergone </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ctqo8z/what_is_twink_death/"><span>twink death</span></a><span>, would be a co-protagonist, and that’s why they didn’t lead with him in the early trailers and marketing. Even now that the cat’s out of the bag, the company has been referring to the presence of the two characters as representing </span><a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1999317087034950074?s=20"><span>“two generations”</span></a><span> of survival horror coming together. Perhaps </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>will be a story of Leon “passing the torch” to a new hero, with future </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>games focusing on new characters moving forward. If so, maybe Grace will take on a solo leading role in a hypothetical </span><i><span>Resident Evil 10</span></i><span>, or at least work alongside someone who hasn’t been in these games for 30 years. Hopefully, that means Leon gets a cushy retirement plan rather than meeting a grimmer outcome that might take him off the board for future games.</span></p> <p><span>While some folks are doubtful about the decision, others are just happy to see Leon back and for </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>to seemingly be scratching the itch for both an action-oriented </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>and a more tense, horror-driven one. I understand the initial disappointment some are feeling, but I’m open to </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>being an origin story that allows </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>to explore new characters without being burdened by the past. We’ll see how it all plays out on February 27.</span></p>

              <p>One of the huge joys of&nbsp;<em>Saturday Night Live</em> over the last 50 years has been the extraordinary level of craft that goes into every episode. The sketches might often suck, but the sets, costumes and make-up will be incredible, despite the long-experienced crew often having less than 24 hours notice of what needs to be prepared. It’s been a stunning achievement for five decades, which makes this week’s episode’s extensive use of AI slop an extraordinary letdown.</p> <p>From the opening moment of the Josh O’Connor-hosted episode, it looked like AI art was being used in place of the usually superb creations of the long-running show’s incredible prop and design team. A storybook with a poem loosely in the style of <em>The Night Before Christmas</em>, leading up to a cold-open with Trump giving interviews on Air Force One, was illustrated with artwork that looked incredibly likely to be AI-generated. While not egregiously bad, little details appear to give the game away, like the suddenly broken path in a picture of a snowy village:</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653400"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653400">© NBC / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And this girl’s frighteningly thin leg and then entirely missing second foot:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000653401" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653401"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653401">© NBC / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Plus it all just has that&nbsp;<em>look</em>, that sheen that rings hollow. As soon as it appeared on screen it looked off to me, and I remember thinking how disappointing it is to see a real artist denied the chance to draw something lovely for the show.</p>

 <p>Things became more egregious during Weekend Update, where the usually amusingly poor Photoshops and stock images that appear over Colin Jost and Michael Che’s shoulders were replaced with extremely suss slop. A gag about a horse on a plane received this image that—in fairness—looks like the usual amusingly slapdash Photoshopping, until you look a bit closer at details like the foreheads of the people in the rows behind. And then what might be an attempt to remove the horse’s genitals, but it’s damned weird.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653402">© NBC / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>More obvious was the image of a woman on O2 at a slot machine, seen at the top of this post. The hose doesn’t actually touch the O2 canister, the slot machine is weirdly shaped, and the lights and buttons are all irregular shapes.</p> <p>Alongside these, there was an almost certainly AI-generated image of a man taking off an Elsa costume, and the most horrifically poor rotating head of Kristi Noem in a joke based on&nbsp;<em>The Exorcist</em>. It all gave the usually fun segment of <em>SNL</em> a grim edge.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653408"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653408">© NBC / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>People on social media were quickly to call out the apparent AI, disappointed that a program known for its creativity would sink to smothering itself in AI slop. It presumably makes sense when a show is put together from start to finish in six days, with cold-opens and Weekend Update usually written in the final 24 hours before live broadcast, to try to find ways to speed up production, but cutting corners and replacing creative work with this kind of dross isn’t it.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">A lot of reasons why SNL using AI for stuff like this sucks, but my main gripe is just that it’s less funny! The intentionally kind of janky photoshops are part of the joke and beat the weird smooth AI aesthetic. <a href="https://t.co/ZBBoXQSgUS">pic.twitter.com/ZBBoXQSgUS</a></p> <p>— Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/2000212581206655450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was more of a shame given that this was, overall, a decent episode of the hit-and-miss show. Lily Allen was a great musical guest, and appeared in a fun and silly sketch spoofing her own on-the-nose lyrics, Bowen Yang <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1sTpOSv8XU">reprised one of his creepiest characters</a>, and this sketch of the most sensitive bachelorette strippers was the funniest of the night:</p>

  <p>Plus Jane Wickline did another of her adorable Weekend Update songs, this time about the greatest threat to the survival of humanity:</p>  <p>Yeah, most of the show’s sketches are overlong duds, and sure,&nbsp;<em>you</em> stopped watching years ago, but&nbsp;<em>SNL</em> remains a crucial fixture in comedy, still creating viral sketches and beginning the careers of many of the best comedians. It also boasts one of the most talented behind-the-scenes crews in television, and to see their talents eschewed for AI slop is devastating. <em>SNL</em>, don’t do that; be better.</p>

              <p>Gaming laptops, especially the muscular options from high-end brands, don’t come in cheap. Most models with solid graphics, a powerful processor, and massive memory sit well over $2,000, but that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6391/">Right now, you can grab the 16-inch ASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop at a 31% discount, which drops its price to $1,800.</a> It’s still a bit of an investment, but one that’s going to be worth it. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, and you also get a pair of headphones with a gaming mouse for free with your purchase. Amazon is offering it as a limited-time deal, though. We recommend placing your orders sooner rather than later to avoid last-minute disappointments.</p>
