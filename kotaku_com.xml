It was a bit like <em>Borderlands</em> through the lens of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, with third-person combat that revolved around gear drops and magic powers. It had the whiff of a live-service grind which repelled some players at launch and left others feeling like its endgame was a bit light on repayable content, but it offered a decent multiplayer story campaign elevated by some of the most fun I’ve had with third-person shooting in a long time. </p><p>It was the type of AA-going-on-AAA franchise that deserved a second shot to see how it could grow and where the developers might take the formula next, especially if it was free of having to disguise itself as a live-service shooter to convince a publisher to greenlight it in the heyday of <em>Destiny 2</em>. It’s unclear if there’s still an outside chance <em>Outriders 2</em> could eventually see the light of day under a new publisher, but that seems unlikely. Square Enix is currently in the midst of a three-year plan to double down on its biggest franchises and pull back from riskier outside bets.

The only thing that could make the Bramble Blast sighting even better is if <em>DKC2</em>'s other brambly stages, Bramble Scramble and Screech’s Sprint, have secret homages tucked away in the game as well.</p><p>The <em>DKC2</em> levels were magical but also got progressively more punishing, with extended sections where players have to navigate between hazardous brush by hanging onto the parrot Squawks, whose fluttering can feel imprecise and hard to control. It was sort of like a precursor to <em>Flappy Bird</em>, though with mixes of enemies and barrels thrown in, and a soundtrack that helped players keep their sanity no matter how many times they died. The original <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>had nothing like it, and it turns out that none of the subsequent <em>Donkey Kong</em> games would either, though the song did appear in <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>. </p><p>While the “Stickerbush Symphony”/Bramble Blast mashup carried over to <em>Donkey Kong Land 2 </em>on Game Boy and <em>Donkey Kong Country 2</em>'s<em>&nbsp;</em>GBA port, the Bramble motifs didn’t return in <em>Donkey Kong 64 </em>or the character’s subsequent 2D spin-off, <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>. That game’s follow-up, <em>Tropical Freeze</em>, did have a remix of “Stickerbrush Symphony” and a level called Bramble Scramble, but the two elements were separated from each other. The song appeared in the beginning of the level  Twilight Terror instead, with a jazz version buried in the end credits. Now they’re back together, and the new cover sounds great.</p><p>“Not to bash the <em>Brawl </em>and <em>Tropical Freeze </em>versions, but it’s nice we are finally getting a remix of the song that sounds like the original,” wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1lp2xla/the_bramble_scramble_inspired_challenge_level_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1lp2xla/the_bramble_scramble_inspired_challenge_level_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan on Reddit</a></span>. “<em>Tropical Freeze</em>’s biggest miss,” wrote another. “Had a bramble level, had Stickerbush Symphony, didn’t put the thing in the thing.” At long last, <em>Bananza</em> does. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-stickerbush-symphony-bramble-blast-1851785457]]></content:encoded>
