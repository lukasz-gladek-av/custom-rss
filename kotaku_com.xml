You can play the main character as a righteous hero or a complete asshole, and toil away on any number of side gigs along the way. <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s follow-through on its immersive fantasy is especially evident in an ending you can only get after a life of too much crime.</p><p>It was shared online shortly after the game’s launch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1887179860814274905&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1887179860814274905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by YouTuber NikTek</a></span> (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/think-twice-before-causing-too-much-trouble-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-because-henry-can-and-will-get-executed-and-theres-a-heartbreaking-cutscene-for-it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/think-twice-before-causing-too-much-trouble-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-because-henry-can-and-will-get-executed-and-theres-a-heartbreaking-cutscene-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></span>). “If you commit multiple crimes in <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance II</em>, you will get a full execution cutscene,” they wrote. “This is impressive!” And to be clear, you have to commit A LOT of crimes; otherwise you’ll just get placed in the stockade for a bit or get the normal game over screen for “losing Lord von Bergow’s trust.”</p><p>Go on a full-blown rampage, though, and your only options will be to try and fight your way out or wait for your execution to be scheduled. The whole scene takes roughly two minutes and shows protagonist Henry being dramatically marched up to the middle of the town square and hanged. It’s an unusually cinematic scene for what most games would treat as just a “playing the game wrong” fail condition. </p><p>Not <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>. “Game over,” the last screen of the ending reads. “You have been executed for your crimes.” Of course, if <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> was <em>really</em> not messing around, it would delete the player’s save file after that happened. Even games that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-delete-save-data/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-delete-save-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make you delete data</a></span> as part of their true ending haven’t gone that far.

Players will have a chance to explore a randomized world map across a day and night cycle as a<em> Fortnite</em>-like circle slowly closes in on them. </p><p>It’s honestly a bonkers premise for a FromSoftware game, but early impressions of the beta test build paint a glowing picture of the <em>Dark Souls</em> studio’s  experimental genre mashup. “<em>Nightreign </em>provides a delectable hit of <em>Elden Ring</em> in a repeatable microcosm,” Ed Nightingale <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes for <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>. “It’s got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I’m itching to replay.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522325/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-network-test&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522325/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-network-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em>’s previewer</a></span> came away similarly impressed. “In many ways it would feel more like a frantic, PvE battle royale than it would the original <em>Elden Ring</em>,” writes Austen Goslin. “What’s even more surprising is just how well all of these elements mix together into a package that feels both true to the Soulslike genre, and totally new at the same time.” He says it’s less the open invitation to new fans that <em>Elden Ring</em> was than a love letter to existing <em>Souls </em>devotees. </p><p>Unlike the 2022 GOTY hit, <em>Nightreig</em>n features faster-paced combat and  streamlined progression during each run. Leveling up happens more quickly, Sites of Grace heal you automatically as you run by, and there’s no fall damage this time around. Relics, meanwhile, provide extra stat bonuses that last in-between runs, so not all of your progress is reset each time. Combined with eight character classes, there’s potentially a lot of room to develop custom strategies and replay through the same content over and over like a classic arcade game. </p><p>I’ll have a better sense of that for myself after playing this weekend’s beta test. I was already looking forward to it and now I’m extra stoked. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
