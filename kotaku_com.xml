But there’s still a ton we don’t know about the sequel to the beloved PlayStation 2 cult hit, including its official title. That’s starting to change now, however, as director Hideki Kamiya and the rest of the team in charge of development open up about the highly anticipated project. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196578" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with <em>IGN</em></a></span>, Kamiya and others laid out what fans of the 2006 game can expect from this follow-up two decades later. The original <em>Okami</em> let players control the goddess of the sun, Amaterasu, in the form of a white wolf with magical ink abilities who sets out to free a vibrant, painterly countryside from demonic curses. It was inspired by <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> but looked and played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sorry-i-dont-like-okami-1821329522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sorry-i-dont-like-okami-1821329522">unlike anything else at the time</a></span>.</p><p>Despite critical acclaim and a 2010 successor for the DS called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/okamiden-an-unintended-tribute-to-a-wounded-nation-5784009&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/okamiden-an-unintended-tribute-to-a-wounded-nation-5784009"><em>Okamiden</em></a></span>, Capcom eventually abandoned the franchise, seemingly due to poor sales. So why return to the beautiful world of <em>Okami</em> all these years later, especially when big publishers appear more focused than ever on blockbuster games that sell millions of copies? We learned the answer to “why now?” and some other important questions in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-okami-2-from-our-exclusive-interview-with-its-creators&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-okami-2-from-our-exclusive-interview-with-its-creators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em>’s profile</a></span> of the upcoming game:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Capcom wanted to bring <em>Okami</em> back but was waiting until Kamiya was available again (he worked at Platinum Games until 2023)</li><li>The team is using the RE Engine that all major Capcom games have been adopting in order to realize “Kamiya-san’s artistic dreams for this project”</li><li>The sequel will be a direct continuation of the first game’s story, which Kamiya said he always felt was left unfinished (that’s Amaterasu in the reveal teaser)</li><li>Despite being announced last December, the<em> Okami </em>sequel has only just begun development</li><li>In talking about updating the control scheme of the original game, Kamiya said he wants “people of all ages to be able to enjoy it,” even if they aren’t hardcore gamers</li><li><em>Okami</em> has sold better than many people think: across ports and the HD remaster, the sales are currently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/salesdata.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/salesdata.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at 4.6 million</a></span></li><li> Kamiya isn’t the only veteran of the original game working on it.  Kiyohiko Sakata heads up Capcom partner studio Heart Machine Games, which handled the HD port</li></ul><p>Kamiya and the rest of those involved in <em>Okami 2</em> didn’t go into much more detail beyond that, either because they’re waiting to reveal it later or, since it’s still so early in development, they don’t actually know themselves. It remains unclear just how big of a budget and launch the game will have, but one thing Capcom has proven in recent years is that even smaller releases, at least relative to a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> or <em>Resident Evil 7</em>, can still deliver something exceptionally special. </p><p>That’s how I felt about 2024's <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, a gorgeous action strategy game with a streamlined focus on its core mechanics. While some may have a desire for<em> Okami </em>to now be realized in a sprawling open world full of characters to meet and secrets to discover, akin to how <em>Zelda</em> has evolved in recent years, I’d love to see the sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-game-pass-capcom-1851606852&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-game-pass-capcom-1851606852">stay more focused and not become too burdened</a></span> with modern AAA expectations and bloat. It might also be the only way we see <em>Okami 2</em> come out a few years from now, rather than being made to wait over half a decade for a sequel many of us have already been dreaming of across multiple console generations. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of course Zelnick couldn’t talk specifically about <em>GTA 6</em>'s online multiplayer—which has yet to be revealed by Rockstar—but he did cite an old NBA game as example of how Take-Two has a track record of supporting games that people are still playing. </p><p>“I’m going to speak theoretically only because I’m not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn’t been made. But generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles,” said Zelnick. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As an example, we launched<em> NBA 2K Online</em> in China, I think originally in 2012 if I’m not mistaken. And then we launched<em> NBA 2K Online 2</em> in China in 2017. If I’m not mistaken. We did not sunset <em>Online</em>. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they’re alive and we have this massive audience.</p></blockquote><p>Zelnick continued, “So we’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p><p>While the Take-Two boss didn’t outright say “<em>GTA Online</em> will keep getting updates after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span> launches,” it’s pretty clear what he’s suggesting here. If <em>GTA Online</em> has a large enough audience still playing, the game will likely get more updates. I do wonder how Rockstar North—the main studio behind <em>GTA</em>—would balance that with supporting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span><em> </em>and any online modes it might include. Would Rockstar tap other parts of the company to support <em>GTA Online</em>, or maybe even an outside studio to take over maintaining and updating the aging crime MMO? <em>GTA Online </em>still makes a lot of money, and Take-Two ain’t going to walk away from hundreds of millions of dollars. </p><p>As for <em>GTA 6</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">earlier this month Zelnick seemed very confident</a></span> that the next title in the series will launch in fall 2025, telling <em>IGN</em>: “Look, there’s always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like ‘absolutely,’ you jinx things. So we feel really good about it.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
