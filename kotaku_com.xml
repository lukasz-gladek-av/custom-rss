              <p>It’s rare that a tech deal approaches perfection as closely as this one that’s just popped up at Amazon. That might sound hyperbolic, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">but how else would you describe this all-time low price on the Crucial X10 4TB SSD,</a> which is one of the most complete portable drives in terms of physical size (tiny and lightweight), memory (huge), and speed (blazing)?</p>
<p>Amazon’s dropped the price on this all-star portable hard drive by 39% to an unprecedented $240. The Crucial X10’s appeal is multiplied when you take into account that it’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, Linux, and gaming consoles. Need more? It’s also IP65 dust and water resistant, and probably most importantly of all considering it’s modest size, the Crucial X10 is also drop-resistant up to nearly 10 feet.</p>

<h2>Something for Everyone</h2>
<p>When a portable SSD has nearly universal compatibility to go along with all of its many outstanding features, it also gains nearly universal appeal. Creative professionals like photo and video shooters and editors love the massive 4TB capacity, but they might love the truly outstanding 2,100MB/s read and 2,000MB/s write speeds that blast through even the biggest files in no time flat. The size and speed also make it a perfect source of extra storage for gaming consoles, and anyone just looking for a big, fast, reliable drive that will keep everything backed up and won’t take over their desk space will be thrilled by the Crucial X10.</p>
<p>Who else is this drive designed for? Students, for sure, since it’s big enough to keep all of those important files backed up and safe while also taking up next to no backpack space. Families with thousands of irreplaceable digital photos and home videos can fit all of them in the generous 4TB capacity of the Crucial X10 to keep them safe. The better question is, who isn’t the Crucial X10 designed for?</p>



<h2>Deal Become Steal</h2>
<p>While you’re more than welcome to keep the Crucial X10 on your desk fulltime, or keep it in a drawer to pull out for regular backups, it’s practically begging to be taken on the go. It’s <em>really</em> small — 2.55 inches wide by 1.96 long by 0.39 thick, and a truly ridiculous 1.13&nbsp;<em>ounces</em> — not pounds. It’s literally pocket-sized, or an ideal addition to a camera bag.</p>
<p>The 4TB version of the Crucial X10 portable drive — it’s also available in 1TB, 2TB, 6TB, and 8TB versions — normally sells for $396, and to be honest, that’s a very fair price for a compact, fast, reliable portable hard drive that’s also tough enough to take a good-sized drop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">This 39% off deal at Amazon is the biggest one ever for this highly rated drive, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $240.</a></p>
