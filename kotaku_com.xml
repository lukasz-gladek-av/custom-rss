That film flopped in its first weeks at the box office while receiving negative reviews from critics and fans. The latest take on the classic 1937 <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em> was also plagued by endless controversy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">including ugly dwarves</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx29x6569x2o#:~:text=The%20controversies%20started%20much%20earlier,2022%2C%20about%20the%20original%20film.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx29x6569x2o#:~:text=The%20controversies%20started%20much%20earlier,2022%2C%20about%20the%20original%20film." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online chuds being mad about casting choices</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-snow-white-controversy-timeline.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-snow-white-controversy-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues involving the main stars and their views on Israel and Palestine</a></span>.</p><p>While some of Disney’s live-action remakes have proved very successful, like <em>Lion King </em>and <em>Aladdin</em>, the studio has suffered a number of middling flops and low earners, like<em> The Little Mermaid</em> and <em>Pete’s Dragon</em>.

There is also the currently-in-production remake of <em>Moana </em>starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, which could prove a big hit in theaters in 2026.

That’s nice. But it doesn’t answer the question.
