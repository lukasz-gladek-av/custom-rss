              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> season five’s finale episode, which is also the series finale, will go live on Netflix on New Year’s Eve. To celebrate that, Lego and Netflix have teamed up with the series creators to create a $300 set that I’m not sure really hits the mark. And I’m a big <em>Stranger Things</em> fan and Lego sicko.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-creel-house-lego-set">Lego and Netflix revealed a new elaborate <em>Stranger Things</em>-themed set</a> that is based on the <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Creel_House">Creel House first seen in season four</a>. This is the place where a young Henry Creel lived and where some horrific shit went down. It also ended up being the home base for season four’s big bad monster man, Vecna. And while that does mean the Creel House is a very important piece of Stranger Things lore, I’m not excited to spend $300 on what mostly looks like a Lego haunted house set.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/stranger-things-the-creel-house-11370">The Creel House Lego set contains 2,593 pieces and 13 minifigs</a>: Eleven, Will, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Steve, Nancy, Robin, Jonathan, Max, Holly, Mr. Whatsit, and Vecna himself. It also includes two vehicle builds. As you might expect, it contains a lot of Easter eggs referencing moments from every season of the popular Netflix series. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit about this set is that it can be split in a way that reveals the “interdimensional horror” below, with Lego and Netflix calling it the “first-ever transforming LEGO house.”</p>

 <p>“We grew up obsessed with the LEGO brand, so seeing <i>Stranger Things</i> rebuilt in bricks is honestly surreal,” explained <em>Stranger Things</em> creators Ross and Matt Duffer. “With the show heading into its final chapter — and hitting the 10-year mark — bringing the Creel House to life this way feels like the perfect celebration of the world and the fans who made all of this possible.”</p>

 <p>Personally, I’d have been much more interested in a Lego diorama recreating Hawkins or a few smaller sets depicting iconic locations and moments from the show that connect into a nice display piece. Something that feels instantly recognizable as <em>Stranger Things.</em> But at least for $300, the house looks detailed, splits apart, and contains a ton of figs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658">I’ll be spending dumb amounts of money on a different big Lego set based on a popular show soon, so I’ll be passing on this house set</a>.</p> <p>The Creel House set will be available to buy on New Year’s Day, about 24 hours after the finale airs. Makes me wonder if there are some interesting spoilers hidden in the set. <em>Stranger Things</em> <em>Vol. 1</em> is out now on Netflix. <em>Vol 2.</em> arrives on December 25. And the finale airs on New Year’s Eve.</p>
