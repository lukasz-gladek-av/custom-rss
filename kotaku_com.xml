              <p>Most people need a laptop that covers the basics reliably: smooth web browsing, comfortable document editing, video calls that don’t freeze and enough screen space to actually see what you’re working on. This HP laptop checks every box on that list and delivers a spacious 17.3-inch FHD display, an Intel i3-N305 8-core processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a generous 1TB SSD. Right now, t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4710/">his machine is down to $639 on Amazon, slashed from its typical $2,199 price</a>. This all-time low didn’t even show up during Prime Day last week.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4710/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel i3-N305 processor has a surprising amount of muscle to deliver for an i3 chip. With the ability to run 8 cores and 8 threads and turbo speeds that can hit as high as 3.8GHz, this processor can handle office workflows, multimedia, and multitasking situations that would slow older budget notebooks to a crawl. Those 8 cores enable you to have dozens of browser tabs and video conferencing programs running, edit docs, and stream music and still never have a slowdown. By delivering responsive speeds to heavy duty programs like photo editing or analyzing a spreadsheet, this notebook has the capacity to do much more than simple web browsing and email.</p>
<h2>A Display that makes Everything Easier to View</h2>
<p>That 17.3-inch diagonal display transforms your computer experience in ways you may not anticipate until you’ve experienced it. Additional screen real estate translates to less scrolling to documents, effortless use of windows side-by-side and real productivity boosts working in spreadsheets or graphics applications. FHD resolution of 1920×1080 maintains text sharp and images clear and IPS panel technologies deliver true colors over extremely wide viewing angles.</p>
<p>Anti-glare coating <strong>minimizes eye strain when you’ll be sitting for long periods</strong> which is essential when you’ll be looking at the display for hours on end. Narrow bezel design makes maximum use of the screen real estate without making the laptop too large and innovative lift-hinge design raises the keyboard when you open the lid to form a steeper and more upright typing angle that minimizes wrist strain.</p>



<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM has enough headroom to handle current computing needs: This memory capacity allows you to have several applications running smoothly, jump between applications quickly without loading times, and hold dozens of web pages without slow downs. The 1TB PCIe NVMe solid-state drive provides incredibly fast boot times, normally propelling you from power button to desktop in less than 10 seconds. File transfers occur virtually right away, and programs launch the moment their icons are clicked. Storage capacity also allows you to have your complete digital library stored right on the laptop without having to constantly manage it or rely on external storage units.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life can go as long as 8 hours</strong> due to the use of HP Fast Charge technology and it allows you to work throughout a day of meetings or travels and not have to search for outlets. HP True Vision HD camera provides clear video resolution even when you are in a low-light environment which eradicates the universal headache of having grainy, dark video calls while working in darkened rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro comes standard with the built-in Copilot AI assistant</strong>&nbsp;which can be accessed via a specialized keyboard key. This AI aide can provide answers to questions, summarize documents, create text, and automate many other tasks, all without having to leave your workstation. A full-size keyboard, complete with a numeric keypad that every person working with numbers or performing data entry will love, comes included as well.</p>
<p>With that $639 purchase price, you’re receiving a laptop that normally costs over three times as much.</p>

              <p>If there’s one Lego license that consistently flies off the shelves, it’s Star Wars. These sets rarely see significant discounts, which makes today’s deal even more remarkable. The Lego <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4704/">Star Wars Grogu with hover pram building set has dropped to $69 on Amazon, down from its usual $99 price tag</a>. This is the first time this incredibly popular set (boasting an<strong> impressive 4.9 out of 5 stars</strong>) has hit such a record low price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4704/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This <strong>1,048-piece building set</strong> brings everybody’s beloved Force-sensitive foundling to life in breathtaking detail. Over <strong>7.5 inches tall when standing in his hover pram</strong>, it’s not just another fast-assembly figure. Thoughtful engineering allows you to interact with the model long after you’ve finished building it and it captures Grogu’s undeniable charm. With a <strong>dial-controlled arm mechanism</strong>, you have complete control over Grogu’s gestures to recreate those iconic moments when he reaches out to touch whatever comes his attention or attempts to use his powers. His <strong>head smoothly turns to freeze various expressions</strong>, and his characteristic oversized ears can be set to demonstrate curiosity, sleepiness, or wakefulness.</p>
<h2>Why This Set Provides the Magic of The Mandalorian</h2>
<p>The <strong>hover pram itself is a 7-inch long and 6-inch wide base</strong> that doubles as a display piece. It’s the flexibility of having a choice in how you display this build that makes it so interesting. You can display Grogu safely nestled inside his safety pod just as Din Djarin carries him when out adventuring or standing him upright outside for a more dynamic display.</p>



<p>Lego didn’t hold back on the accessories that transformed Grogu into a cultural icon. Three key items that epitomize his personality are included in the set: <strong>a brick-built Sorgan frog</strong> (don’t you recall his snacking ways from Season 1?), <strong>the shifter knob from the Razor Crest</strong> that became a meme immediately, and <strong>a cookie</strong> that he can hold in his miniature hands.</p>



<p>The advanced level of this 1,048-piece set makes it <strong>ideal for builders aged 10 and up</strong> but adult collectors will relish the building process as much. The piece count assures hours of uninterrupted building time which makes it an ideal weekend project or a relaxing evening activity. While other, simpler sets may have you racing to get to the final stages, you’ll have time to smell the Lego, as it were, as you assemble the mechanical components that give Grogu’s movement life.</p>
<p>With the $30 savings, it comes to a price that is difficult to pass up, particularly since those Star Wars sets tend to hold their value or gain it over time.</p>
