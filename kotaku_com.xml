              <p>Apple just announced its M5 chip a few weeks ago but this <strong>MacBook Pro with M4 Pro remains an incredibly powerful machine</strong> that handles almost all professional workflows with ease. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5787/">record low pricing at $1,749 on Amazon for the 24GB/512GB model, down from $1,999</a>, makes it more compelling than most MacBooks currently available.</p>
<p>The model sits as the <strong>#1 best-seller among MacBook Pros on Amazon</strong> and the reason becomes clear when you consider the specs at this price point. Apple never runs discounts directly on its website or in its retail stores, so hitting up retailers like Amazon during Black Friday is the only way to score legitimate discounts on current-generation MacBooks.</p>

<h2>Desktop-Class Performance</h2>
<p>The 12-core CPU splits down into <strong>eight performance cores and four efficiency cores</strong> and makes quick work of everything from video editing to the compilation of software. The architecture executes the resource-intensive tasks much faster compared to the previous M3 Pro, drawing less power in the process, which puts more runtime on your battery when doing intensive work. Real-world performance reveals stutter-free 4K video timeline scrubbing, instant photo filter application across hundreds of images, and code compilation that completes before you finish your coffee.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-core GPU</strong> provides graphics performance that’s competitive with discrete graphics in much pricier Windows laptops. You can edit multi-layer 8K video projects, work with intricate 3D models, or run demanding creative apps like Cinema 4D without thermal throttling. Gaming performance is above expectations for a Mac, with AAA titles running at high settings and maintaining smooth frame rates. A u<strong>nified memory architecture sees the GPU tapping into the same 24GB pool as the CPU</strong>&nbsp;which diminishes bottlenecks normally associated with traditional discrete graphics arrangements.</p>



<p>The 24GB of unified memory handles professional workloads that choke systems with less RAM. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple creative applications at the same time, and switch between projects without any hint of slowdowns. The unified architecture means this 24GB functions more efficiently than traditional RAM since both CPU and GPU access it directly.</p>
<p>The display on the <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR is capable of 1000 nits of sustained brightness and peaks at 1600 nits for HDR content</strong>. Mini-LED backlighting enables true blacks with excellent contrast that makes on-screen content pop. Color accuracy meets professional levels right out of the box, thanks to P3 wide color gamut coverage that will satisfy even photographers and video editors. The <strong>screen refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> courtesy of <em>ProMotion</em> makes scrolling feel butter-smooth and helps alleviate eye strain during extended work sessions.</p>



<p>That’s also <strong>18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of actual work</strong> mixing web browsing, document editing, and creative applications. You can work through a full day without hunting for outlets, and that transforms the way you approach mobile productivity. The <em>MagSafe</em> charging connection means that accidental cable yanks won’t send your laptop flying, and you still have both Thunderbolt ports free for peripherals.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration brings <strong>AI features right to the operating system</strong>, from advanced text editing suggestions all the way to picture generation tools within native apps. All of these AI-related tasks are processed locally by the M4 Pro’s Neural Engine for data privacy and speed. These features keep evolving through new software updates, adding value during the life of the laptop.</p>
<p>You’re getting here a professional-grade laptop with M4 Pro performance for $250 less than Apple’s direct pricing, at $1,749. Similar Windows laptops are $2,500 or more and lack the efficiency and battery life that Apple Silicon delivers.</p>

              <p>The PS5 launched in 2022 and maintained strict pricing for years, with Sony rarely offering any meaningful discounts even during major shopping events. This marks the first year the console sees genuine Black Friday price cuts, and these deals appear exclusively on Amazon. The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/"> PS5 Slim with disc drive drops to $449 from $549</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5802/">Digital Edition hits $399 instead of $499</a>. Both represent <strong>all-time low pricing for 2025</strong>&nbsp;and stock moves fast given the pent-up demand from years of limited availability and no discounts.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5802/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See PS5 Slim Digital Edition at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Disc Drive vs. Digital Edition</h2>
<p>The $449 <strong>disc drive version plays physical game discs and 4K Blu-ray movies and gives you flexibility in how you buy games</strong>: You can purchase used games, borrow from friends, sell titles you’ve finished, or take advantage of retail sales that often beat digital pricing. The physical media option preserves your ability to own games rather than licensing them digitally, which matters when publishers remove titles from digital stores. The 4K Blu-ray player adds value if you collect physical movies or want the best possible video quality without compression artifacts from streaming.</p>
<p>The $399 Digital Edition drops the disc drive altogether and saves <strong>you a cool $50 and making the console slightly lighter and more symmetrical in design</strong>. You download all games and content from the PlayStation Store, which means no disc swapping and instant access to your library. Digital purchases go on sale regularly through PlayStation Store promotions, and you can game share with one other person through console sharing settings. The <strong>trade-off is in losing resale valu</strong>e and being locked into whatever pricing Sony sets digitally.</p>



<p><strong>Both versions pack the same internal hardware for identical gaming performance</strong>. A custom AMD GPU based on the RDNA 2 architecture handles ray tracing, 4K resolution at up to 120fps in supported games, and variable refresh rate for smoother visuals. An 8-core Zen 2 CPU will process game logic and AI calculations with plenty of headroom for demanding titles, while 16GB GDDR6 of unified memory ensures smooth performance without bottlenecks between CPU and GPU operations.</p>
<p>The bespoke 825GB SSD fundamentally changes how games load and operate. Load times often fall from minutes to mere seconds, while some games offer near-instant fast travel. For the first time, developers can stream assets in real time rather than rely on loading corridors or elevator rides to mask transfers of data on high-speed storage. This storage architecture is the single biggest generational leap the PS5 offers over PS4 and transforms how games feel to play.</p>
<p><strong>The DualSense controller included offers haptic feedback</strong> which replaces the rumble feature of old with precise, intricate vibrations that simulate everything from textures to feelings. Adaptive triggers will create resistance that changes depending on what’s happening in-game, from the tension of drawing a bow to the recoil of different weapons. These features add immersion that previous controllers couldn’t achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Backward compatibility with PS4 games</strong> means your existing library carries forward, with many titles receiving performance boosts on PS5 hardware. Games run at higher frame rates, load faster, and sometimes receive resolution upgrades without requiring separate purchases. The PS Plus collection includes access to a curated selection of PS4 classics at no additional cost beyond the subscription.</p>
<p>At $449 for the disc version and $399 for digital, these are the best PS5 pricing we have seen this year. The disc model saves you $100 while keeping physical media flexibility, while the digital edition drops down to impulse-purchase territory for anyone holding out. These Black Friday prices on Amazon finally get the PS5 into a place where it’s accessible without the markup or bundles that dominated availability for years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-mini-4k-goes-cheaper-than-budget-no-name-drones-amazon-shows-all-time-low-to-clear-out-stock-2000646105</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-mini-4k-goes-cheaper-than-budget-no-name-drones-amazon-shows-all-time-low-to-clear-out-stock.1360684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most drone photography involves FAA registration, learning about Remote ID requirements and other regulatory hurdles before ever taking to the skies. However, the <strong>DJI Mini 4K weighs less than 249 grams</strong> which means it falls beneath the threshold requiring registration for recreational flights here in the United States (this is why it’s also among the most popular ones). You can purchase this drone, charge the battery and be flying in a matter of minutes-no paperwork or waiting periods required. The good news is,Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/"> just dropped this to $239 for Black Friday, down from the usual $299</a>, which marks the lowest price this model has ever hit.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4K Quality Without the Registration Hassle</h2>
<p>The <strong>footage from the 4K Ultra HD camera</strong> appears professional straight out of the drone. It features a resolution of 3840 x 2160 that retains sharpness whether you fly over landscape views, shoot action sequences, or close-up captures of subjects. The <strong>3-axis gimbal mechanically stabilizes the camera</strong>, and compensates in real time for movements of the drone and turbulence of wind. This stabilization translates to smooth footage even when the drone shifts position-a quality that lacks in amateur videos taken by drones.</p>
<p>It operates well under a variety of illumination conditions, ranging from <strong>bright midday sun to golden hour sunsets and even low-light evening scenes</strong>. You are able to shoot sunrise footage without the blown-out highlights that cheaper cameras display, and sunset shots retain color saturation without losing shadow detail. Night shooting is also better than expected for a drone in this price range, although you will want to keep the shutter speeds reasonable to avoid excessive noise.</p>



<p>The<strong> 10km video transmission</strong> range gives you serious operational distance without losing signal. You can fly the drone far enough to explore large areas, follow moving subjects over extended distances, or capture sweeping panoramic shots. The impressive thing about the video transmission system is that it maintains quality across this range, so you see what the camera sees in real time without lag or pixelation. This range far exceeds what budget drones offer and matches what you’d find in models costing twice as much.</p>
<p>Wind resistance up to Level 5 conditions means the <strong>drone stays stable in 38kph winds</strong>. The brushless motors provide consistent power that maintains accurate positioning of the drone even when gusts hit. This capability is important if one flies over coastal areas, mountains, or any other place where the wind might suddenly change. It also <strong>enables takeoffs at altitudes of 4,000 meters or higher</strong>&nbsp;which is useful for mountain photography or high-elevation adventures.</p>



<p>The <strong>31-minute flight time</strong> from a single battery gives you enough airtime to set up shots, experiment with angles, and capture the footage you want without constantly landing to swap batteries. You can shoot thoroughly around a location or film an entire sequence uninterrupted.</p>
<p>GPS R<em>eturn to Home</em> automatically activates in cases of a low battery or if the connection drops. It flies back to its takeoff point and lands itself, hence avoiding crashes or lost equipment. It enables beginners who might lose their orientation or misjudge the battery levels to be at ease. <strong>One-touch takeoff and landing</strong> simplify operations, freeing you to work on capturing shots rather than managing controls.</p>
<p>QuickShots modes automatically handle complicated camera movements with pre-programmed flight patterns. Helix circles your subject while ascending, Dronie pulls back and up for reveal shots, <strong>Rocket shoots straight up, Circle orbits around a point, and Boomerang</strong> creates looping paths. These automated modes produce professional-looking results without requiring piloting skills or manual camera control. You choose the mode, select the subject, and the drone performs the shot.</p>
<p>You’re getting here a 4K drone with proper stabilization, extended range, and intelligent features for under $239-what most 1080p budget models cost. Its weight of under 249 grams eliminates requirements to register it, thereby removing barriers that stop people from trying drone photography. <strong>Besides its beginner-friendly controls and automatic safety features,</strong> this very much makes 4K quality accessible to anyone interested in aerial photography.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-shows-hidden-price-on-ps-vr2-bundle-sony-blocks-public-display-of-black-friday-deal-2000646100</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-shows-%E2%80%9Chidden-price%E2%80%9D-on-ps-vr2-bundle-sony-blocks-public-display-of-black-friday-deal.1360654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon shows a <em>“hidden price”</em> on the PS VR2 bundle, rather than the standard retail price because Sony’s contracts with retailers limit how certain deals can be advertised. But the real <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">list price is $299, down from the usual $399, which makes this Black Friday deal an all-time low</a> for the <strong>headset bundled with Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>. This pricing has propelled the bundle to <strong>#1 best-seller</strong> status in its category, and if you already own a PS5, this is the perfect entry point into serious VR gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Eye Tracking and Sense Technology Redefine VR Immersion</h2>
<p>Because the eye-tracking system monitors where you look in real time, it allows games to <strong>render details precisely where your gaze focuses</strong>. That advantage brought about foveated rendering, a technique whereby PS VR2 delivers sharper visuals in the direct line of sight while doing less processing on peripheral areas. Characters in games can respond to eye contact. This enables <strong>a lot more natural interaction</strong> that simply wasn’t possible with previous systems.</p>
<p><strong>Headset feedback</strong> adds another sensory layer through subtle vibrations that sync with in-game actions. You feel the rush of air as something flies by your head or the impact when objects collide near you. The 3D audio creates a complete sound environment where you can pinpoint exactly where sounds originate, whether that’s footsteps behind you or wind coming from a specific direction.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K HDR visuals boast 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye</strong>, and drastically reduces the screen door effect that plagued earlier VR headsets. Text comes out crisp and readable, distant objects retain detail, and overall image quality approaches what you would get from a high-end monitor. The HDR capability means brighter highlights and deeper blacks give scenes more depth and realism.</p>
<p>The <strong>110-degree FOV offers wide peripheral vision</strong> that aids in keeping the feeling of immersion intact since more of your visual space is filled. You don’t feel like you’re looking through binoculars, which was one of the complaints of headsets with narrower FOV. These lenses also reduce distortion at the edges to keep the image clear across the full field of view.</p>



<p>The Sense controllers introduce haptic feedback similar to the DualSense gamepad, allowing you to feel textures and impacts through your hands. Adaptive triggers create resistance that changes based on what you’re doing, whether that’s drawing a bow or squeezing a trigger. Finger touch detection tracks where your fingers rest on the controller without requiring you to press buttons, enabling more natural hand gestures and interactions. These controllers are a significant upgrade from previous VR input methods that have relied on simple button presses.</p>
<p>It comes with <strong>Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>, a game that shows what PS VR2 can do: it was built for this hardware, taking advantage of eye tracking, haptic feedback, and visuals. You climb mountains with natural hand movements, manipulate the environment with gesture controls, and experience the Horizon universe in a completely new way. The bundle gives you immediate access to premium VR content without needing to buy games separately.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting Sony’s latest VR technology bundled with a full game for $100 less than the standard price. Eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K HDR visuals put this headset above most competitors that cost significantly more. This is the most accessible pricing the PS VR2 has received, and including Horizon Call of the Mountain adds immediate value.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-pixel-10-pro-goes-cheaper-than-last-years-9-pro-amazon-crushes-google-on-black-friday-deals-2000646123</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-pixel-10-pro-goes-cheaper-than-last-year%E2%80%99s-9-pro-amazon-crushes-google-on-black-friday-deals.1360600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google announced the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro only weeks ago, but Amazon has already chopped prices significantly for Black Friday. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Pixel 10 Pro 128GB slides to $749 from its debut price of $999</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/">more affordable Pixel 10 (128BG) reaches $599 from $799</a>. Those are record-low prices and puts some serious pressure on competitors, particularly Apple’s suddenly less competitive iPhone 17 lineup. The Pixel 10 Pro brings true flagship specs with Google’s <strong>computational photography advantages and Gemini AI integration</strong> at a price that beats its premium competitors by hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gemini AI Assistant Changes Daily Smartphone Use</h2>
<p>The<strong> integrated Gemini AI assistant</strong> can do a lot more than simple voice-based requests to perform complex tasks across apps and contexts. You can ask it to summarize long email threads, write messages in your personal style, or provide information in depth by looking at pictures through the camera. For sensitive tasks, the AI processes requests locally on the <strong>Tensor G5 chip</strong> to maintain your data private while delivering fast responses. It feels far more organic than bolt-on AI features since it’s integrated into the core Android experience.</p>
<p>It learns your patterns and proactively provides information relevant to you without explicit commands. It suggests responses to messages based on context, reminds you about tasks mentioned in emails, and provides traffic updates for your regular routes at the right times. The AI automatically handles photo organization, creating event- and people-centric albums while making search phenomenally accurate with natural language queries.</p>



<p>The <strong>triple rear camera array features a combination of a 50MP main sensor, 48MP ultra-wide, and 48MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom</strong>. In typical Google style, computational photography processes several frames for each single shot, combining them to suppress noise, increase dynamic range, and capture finer detail than is visible in a single exposure. <strong>Night Sight mode delivers great photos</strong> in near darkness without flash, while retaining natural colors and revealing detail that’s completely invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>The <em>Super Res Zoom</em> extends beyond the 5x optical range through computational techniques that <strong>maintain image quality up to 30x digital zoom</strong>. Real-world results show surprisingly sharp details at 10-15x zoom levels that typically look pixelated on competing phones. Video recording reaches 4K at 60fps with advanced stabilization that smooths out walking motion and sudden movements. The <strong>Magic Eraser feature removes unwanted objects from photos</strong> convincingly and uses AI to fill in backgrounds naturally.</p>



<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Super Actua display leverages excellent brightness of as high as 2000 nits</strong>&nbsp;and it’s even readable in direct sunlight where other phones wash out. An adaptive 120Hz refresh rate dynamically changes based on the content: high refresh for scrolling and gaming, lower for static content, to save battery. Color accuracy and contrast are as good as standalone monitors, deep blacks thanks to the <strong>OLED panel</strong>&nbsp;and vibrant colors that do not look oversaturated.</p>
<p>The Tensor G5 chip handles everyday tasks smoothly while excelling at AI workloads that other processors struggle with. Apps launch quickly, multitasking stays responsive, and gaming performance matches what you’d expect from a flagship device. Efficiency from this chip combines with the <strong>5,060mAh battery to deliver genuine all-day usage</strong>&nbsp;with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. <strong>Fast charging reaches 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> and wireless charging offers convenient overnight top-ups.</p>
<p>For $749, you’re getting a flagship for $250 less than its launch price, hundreds below what Apple and Samsung charge for comparable specs. The Pixel 10 Pro matches or slightly outperforms the camera capabilities of an iPhone 17 Pro for thousands of dollars less, and the Gemini AI integration offers capabilities the competition can’t.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-dualsense-now-selling-it-cheaper-than-no-name-controllers-2000646090</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it launched, the Playstation <em>DualSense</em> changed the way controllers felt in your hand and it remains the <strong>best way to experience PS5 games with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong>. Generic controllers will get the job done but they miss out on the immersive details that make modern games feel alive. The great news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5777/">Amazon just dropped the DualSense to $54 for Black Friday down from its usual $74 price</a>, with every color option seeing the same discount. That’s an all-time low, since these controllers never see any discount throughout the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5777/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Haptic Feedback Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The haptic feedback system replaces traditional rumble with <strong>precise vibrations that simulate different textures and actions</strong>. You feel the difference between walking on metal, grass, or sand through subtle vibrations that match the surface. When you pull a bowstring in a game, the adaptive triggers create actual resistance that increases as you draw back. This L2 and R2 trigger tension changes dynamically based on what you’re doing, whether that’s pressing a gas pedal, pulling a trigger, or drawing a weapon.</p>
<p>These <strong>features work across hundreds of PS5 titles now</strong>, and developers continue to find innovative ways to utilize them. Racing games can make you feel the road surface and brake pressure. Shooters give each weapon a distinct trigger feel. Even menu navigation gets enhanced with subtle haptic clicks that confirm your selections. The technology doesn’t just add novelty; it provides actual feedback that improves your control and connection to the game.</p>



<p>The <strong>onboard microphone lets you chat without needing a headset</strong>&nbsp;which is great for quick online sessions. The mic quality handles voice chat clearly enough for team coordination, though serious streamers will want a dedicated microphone. You can plug any headset directly into the 3.5mm jack when you need better audio or more privacy. The <em>Create</em> button replaces the old <em>Share</em> button and gives you quick access to screenshots, video clips, and broadcast features without interrupting gameplay.</p>
<p>The speaker built into the controller adds another audio layer in supported games: You hear environmental sounds, character voices, and sound effects emanating from the controller itself, which creates a much more three-dimensional audio experience. Some games use it for subtle details like radio chatter or reloading sounds. Others make it central to the experience, with sounds moving between your TV and controller based on where they originate in the game world.</p>



<p>The design retains the classic Playstation layout while <strong>refining the ergonomics and improving the analog sticks</strong>. The grips fit comfortably into medium to large hands, and the textured surface prevents slipping during intense gaming sessions. The analog sticks offer better precision compared to the previous generation, with improved resistance and dead zones that make aiming feel way more responsive. <strong>Battery life runs about 12 hours on a full charge</strong>&nbsp;which gets you through multiple gaming sessions before needing to plug in.</p>
<p>The <strong>addition of USB Type-C charging</strong> means faster power delivery along with a reversible cable that plugs in either way. Placing the port at the top of the controller gives easy access while playing. <strong>Bluetooth</strong> connectivity extends functionality to play with PS5 consoles, Windows PCs, and Mac computers, all from one controller. PC gaming support has significantly expanded, as more titles now have haptic feedback and adaptive triggers support on Windows. This cross-platform compatibility makes the DualSense useful beyond just your Playstation console.</p>
<p>The midnight black color option provides you with a stealthy alternative to the standard white and shows less wear over time. <strong>Other colors like cosmic red, starlight blue, and galactic purple all hit the same $54 price point</strong> during this sale – you can pick up multiple controllers in different colors and still manage to spend less than buying two at their regular price.</p>
<p>You’re getting here Sony’s flagship controller, complete with its advanced features, for less than the price of many third-party options at $54. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers alone are worth this price, but you also get multi-device support, built-in audio options, and refined ergonomics. That’s genuine value since these controllers almost never drop below $60, and the Black Friday pricing makes it the right time to buy a backup or upgrade from older controllers.</p>
