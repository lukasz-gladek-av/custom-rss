              <p>Developers at two of Meta’s virtual reality game development studios are posting online that massive layoffs have happened and that the studios might be shutting down completely.</p> <p>On January 13, multiple developers from Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru Games posted online that they had been laid off from the studios. Many of the affected staff have suggested that both studios, and others owned by the company formerly known as Facebook, might be completely shutting down. Meta has not confirmed this. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to the company for more information about the future of the VR studios and the publicly confirmed layoffs.</p> <p>“Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru. It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs/">posted senior-level designer Ray West on LinkedIn on Tuesday.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p><span>“I’ve just been laid off. It appears the entire Twisted Pixel </span>games studio has been shut down.<span> Sanzaru Games, </span>too,” <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">posted another developer on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, I was part of the layoffs today at Meta, and will be seeking a new role,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kathrynyu.com">said Twisted Pixel VR gameplay designer Kathryn Yu on Bluesky</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-horizon-worlds-teams-2026-1">This follows reporting on Monday</a> that Meta was looking to pivot away from VR and the metaverse to AI and augmented reality tech after that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/29/meta-earnings-report">part of the company lost $4 billion.</a> Meta is reportedly looking to cut 10 to 15 percent of Reality Labs, its VR sector, which includes 15,000 employees as well as numerous game studios like Sanzaru. These teams were developing exclusive Meta Quest games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514">like last year’s <em>Deadpool VR</em></a>, which was developed by Twisted Pixel.</p>

 <p>Sanzaru was acquired by Meta in 2020 following the release of<em> Asgard’s Wrath</em>, a popular and critically acclaimed RPG, in 2019. It developed a sequel that launched as a free pack-in game with the launch of the Quest 3 in December 2023. Twisted Pixel previously worked on games like <em>Splosion Man</em> and <em>Lococycle</em> before being bought by Meta in 2021 to work on VR titles.</p>

              <p><span>Staff redundancies are anticipated at Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment, Ubisoft has announced. 55 employees are expected to lose their jobs, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted"><span>according to a statement sent to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Massive, acquired back in 2008, is the studio behind </span><i><span>The Division 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement, Ubisoft explained, “This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements, and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect in line with local regulations,” Ubisoft said.</span></p> <h2>Ubisoft’s slow, painful transformation</h2> <p><span>The news comes months after the French publisher began a new cost-cutting restructuring plan. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>Back in October 2025</span></a><span>, it asked developers at Massive to lay themselves off voluntarily.</span></p>

 <p><span>The publisher’s redundancy scheme came after a new deal with Tencent, in which the conglomerate invested over $1 billion in a smaller subsidiary, Vantage Studios. The new studio will focus on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Siege</span></i><span> franchises.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> notes that despite the new layoffs, updates for </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division 2</span></i><span> will continue, as will development for </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> and the survival extraction mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>News of job cuts at Ubisoft is not new. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752"><span>Last week, Ubisoft closed its Halifax office after it unionized.</span></a><span> The shuttering of the mobile game developer resulted in the loss of 71 jobs. The publisher claimed that the closure was not due to unionization.</span></p>
