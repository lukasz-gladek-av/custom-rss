            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Folks, if I know one thing in this world, it’s the lived experience of being a short king. My 5’3” ass has always seen the world from a lower standing than my peers, and it’s rare for me to come across heroes in media who see the world from that same point of view. Wolverine, the X-Man who has pointy metal claws in his knuckles, is one of the few short kings I have to cling to in popular culture, but a lot of people don’t realize that he’s supposed to be a little guy. In the comics, he’s my height exactly, but so many people know him from the movies where he’s played by 6’2” actor Hugh Jackman. </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </span></i><span>makes a joke about this when, through the magic of filmmaking, Deadpool meets a “comic-accurate” version of Logan who needs a booster seat to sit at the bar. Now, however, Wolfie is getting his own game, and there’s no reason that casting a particular actor has to define the character’s stature. So has Insomniac stayed true to his short king status? Fans can’t seem to agree.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628728" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628728"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628728">© Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Strictly eyeballing it, Logan looks like he’s definitely of short stature in the trailer that premiered during the State of Play showcase yesterday. Some fans note that </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayWolverine/comments/1nppa0b/looks_like_they_actually_made_him_height_accurate/"><span>he definitely appears significantly shorter</span></a><span> than the enemies he’s slicing and dicing, but some don’t think that’s quite enough.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">my gripe is, why is Logan so tall? He should be short and wide <a href="https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9">https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9</a></p> <p>— ✦ JYDAWN ✦ (@_jydawn) <a href="https://twitter.com/_jydawn/status/1971009918087119247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Sorry, I just took some mild psychic damage at reading someone say that Logan being short would make him a “twink,” and I need people to stop trying to use words they don’t understand. This is an annoying case of both tall people and straight people bastardizing my culture. Anyway, the weird part of the conversation is that people actually somehow think that a short Wolverine would be inherently weird or comical. The Hugh Jackman bit in </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </span></i><span>was a joke because it showed that Jackman himself would look ridiculous if he were made a foot shorter with minimal changes to his proportions, but a 5’3” man can absolutely fuck up some mutant-hunting baddy as well as a man who towers over him.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We need to banish the idea of 5'2 Logan from existence at this point. People were seriously saying this sized Deadpool Wolverine should be the MCU one. I get it, it's from the comic, but sometimes comic things need to die <a href="https://t.co/90umBvRLYO">https://t.co/90umBvRLYO</a> <a href="https://t.co/X0AwbiohBA">pic.twitter.com/X0AwbiohBA</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1971197931387785534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wolverine being 5’2 is legit the worst piece of character lore of all time ngl</p> <p>— Matt b (@hipppyjump) <a href="https://twitter.com/hipppyjump/status/1971068452585800134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Some of this sentiment is rooted in the fact that many people view shorter men as “less manly” or some such weird, toxic shit, which makes me very glad I opted out of all of that when I became interested in video games as a kid and men in adulthood. When people say that Wolverine should be a hulking beast of a tall guy, it’s usually because it conforms to some idealized image of what a man should look like. But that’s boring, and if that’s your problem, you should grow the fuck up. Wolverine is short in </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">Marvel Rivals</a>,</span></i><span> and it rules, actually.</span></p>   <p><span>But is Logan a proper short king in </span><i><span>Wolverine</span></i><span>? That we probably won’t know for sure until the game is out and people can rip the models from the files and properly measure him. Insomniac made a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/insomniacleaks/comments/18s4pmr/character_scale/"><span>character scale reference sheet</span></a><span> that was part </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188"><span>of a leak in 2023</span></a><span>, which shows Logan is noticeably shorter than Mystique, Omega Red, and Sabretooth. So it doesn’t look like the studio is trying to size him up </span><i><span>too</span></i><span> much.&nbsp; Even so, Insomniac seems </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grantpdesign.bsky.social/post/3lzmjn7pdrs2g"><span>aware that not everyone thinks he’s short enough</span></a><span>. But shrinking a character model would have a massive ripple effect on nearly every animation in the game, so I’d be very surprised if Insomniac made a real change this far into development. Maybe as a secret unlockable mode down the line, but for now, the height debate will rage on until </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><span>launches on PS5 in 2026.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/saros-sci-fi-trailer-returnal-housemarque-ps5-state-of-play-2000628274"><i><span>Saros</span></i></a><span>, the next action game from </span><i><span>Returnal </span></i><span>developers Housemarque, was one of the tentpole games during yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span>. The game stars </span><i><span>iZombie </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Fall of the House of Usher </span></i><span>actor Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj, a soldier investigating a foreign planet full of vicious aliens who will kill him over and over again. Kohli has starred in a few video games, including </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005"><i><span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-gods-review-musical-songs-grace-laura-bailey-1850747942"><i><span>Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical</span></i></a><span>, but this is easily his biggest game role yet, and the dude seems stoked to be there.</span></p> <p><span>In a post on Bluesky, Kohli laid out how video games have always been part of his hopes and dreams. As a kid, he wanted to make video games. He used to work in a game store, and one of his first acting gigs was in a commercial for </span><i><span>LittleBigPlanet </span></i><span>on Vita. So really, it’s all been leading up to this point.</span></p>    <blockquote><p><span>I know it’s cliche to say “this is a dream come true” but in the case of </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>, it really is. My first hobby/love was gaming. Before I left primary school, we were asked in assembly to tell the school what we wanted to do for a career. I played a VHS of video game trailers and said I wanted to make video games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One of my first jobs was working as a sales assistant at Gamestation (the UK equivalent of GameStop). One of my earliest paid acting gigs was a commercial for Little Big Planet on the PS Vita – I thought I finally made it. My next gig after starring in </span><i><span>iZOMBiE</span></i><span> was playing Fahz in </span><i><span>Gears 5</span></i><span>, I didn’t think anything could top that… until I was approached by Housemarque to play the lead in </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s been a long journey to get here, each moment along the way was special and the final destination isn’t just a career highlight, it’s one of the best moments of my life. Thank you HouseMarque with trusting me with your character, I hope Arjun is everything you asked for. And for the players, see you on March 20th.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>That’s sweet. I was a big fan of Kohli’s performance in </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>Fall of the House of Usher</span></i><span>, so I’m interested to see what he brings to the role of Arjun when </span><i><span>Saros </span></i><span>comes to PlayStation 5 on March 20. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-remastered-trailer-ugly-bad-comparison-ps5-pc-mods-nightdive-2000628799</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just because a remaster of an old game has improved textures, better lighting, runs at a higher resolution, and features fancy new effects doesn’t mean it’s better. I mean, <em>technically</em> it is, but the end result can often look very ugly and wrong. And sadly, this is the case with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258#:~:text=One%20of%20the,on%20February%205.">recently announced <em>Deus Ex Remastered.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Yesterday, during Sony’s short and so-so State of Play, we got our first look at a newly announced remaster of the classic immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musks-favorite-game-is-getting-remastered-25-years-later-2000628283">This new version of Elon Musk’s favorite video game</a> is being marketed as a remaster, with higher resolution textures and fancier lighting. And yes, technically, what is seen in the trailer is “better” than the original release. These are higher-resolution textures with more detail. Models are more detailed and complicated, too. What’s here is better in the sense that it is all stuff that couldn’t have been done 25 years ago in 2000. And yet many online, myself included, aren’t impressed with <em>Deus Ex Remastered’</em>s “improved” visuals. In fact, I think the new game looks really terrible.</p> <p>You would think that replacing the old textures from 2000 with new and higher-resolution textures would make<em> Deus Ex</em> look great. The problem with this new remastered port isn’t that the textures are bad, but that they are being slapped on a very old game. The models, levels, and other parts of<em> Deus Ex</em> were designed 25 years ago, with the tech limitations of the period in mind. The original devs and artists worked within those limits to create art that offered just enough detail and let your mind fill in the gaps.</p>

  <p>Covering the game in new, sharp textures that don’t seem to take into consideration the art design and intentions behind the visuals of the OG <em>Deus Ex</em> leads to an odd juxtaposition. You have the old game running under this new skin that feels out of place. Add in new lighting that changes the mood and appearance of the characters and world even more, and you end up with this odd plastic-y look that we’ve also seen in other similar remasters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-trilogys-san-andreas-now-feels-depressing-without-i-1848047292?_gl=1*242l6h*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMS4xNzMxNDQ1MjEwLjYwLjAuMA..">like the infamous <em>GTA Trilogy</em> bundle</a>. It’s also the same look I spotted in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-review-pc-lara-croft-1851250080">remastered<em> Tomb Raider</em> games,</a> which were also developed by Aspyr, the same team that’s behind <em>Deus Ex Remastered.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Reactions to the <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> trailer have been nearly universally negative. People have criticized the plastic-like sheen on everything, the way the game now seems filled with <em>Doom 3</em>-like stencil shadows, and the overall vibes of this new remaster being off. One highly upvoted comment on YouTube said: “Upgraded visuals from 2000 to 2005.” In direct comparisons between the two, it’s hard not to see the remastered <em>Deus Ex</em> as anything but an ugly mess.</p>   <p>It seems like the remastered version of <em>Deus Ex</em> will be the worst way to replay the original game, especially considering the fact that for decades, fans have created incredible mods that improve the game in smart ways without altering its overall look and vibes too much.</p>

 <p>And that’s the most annoying thing to me about this remastered version of <em>Deus Ex.</em> There are ways to remaster and modernize old games and make them look great. <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-star-wars-game-dark-forces-fps-remaster-ps5-xbox-1851294048">Nightdive Studios has done some fantastic work</a> bringing back classic titles, like <em>Dark Forces</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-thing-remastered-2002-ps2-xbox-pc-sequel-4k-120-ps5-1851524769"><em>The Thing,</em></a> without making these games look horrible. I think the key is that Nightdive is very careful with the new art it adds to its projects. They tend to create remasters that perhaps aren’t as “fancy” as some others but which almost always look like you remember the games looking back in the day, despite them very much not appearing that way back in the ’90s. Nightdive also tends to let you turn off many or most of the new visual features, too, which is always an appreciated option.</p> <p>So you can definitely remaster a classic game in a faithful way. It can be done. Sadly, for <em>Deus Ex,</em> it seems that it won’t be so lucky with this remaster, and instead, we are left with an overly shiny and visually jarring port of <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985">one of the best PC games of all time</a>. Ah well, at least it’s easy as heck to play and mod on PC in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ananta-anime-gta-spider-man-rip-off-clone-trailer-2000628763</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-anime-gta-clone-is-ditching-gacha-but-not-being-shy-about-ripping-off-spider-man.1309011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s the saying, “good artists copy, great ones steal.” And then there’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-mugen-ananta-anime-rpg-open-world-gta-trailer-1851714840">whatever <em>Ananta</em> is doing</a>. The upcoming open-world RPG from NetEase developer Naked Rain is going viral again thanks to new footage from Tokyo Game Show 2025. While it might look like the latest round of <em>Genshin Impact</em>-inspired <a href="https://kotaku.com/zenless-zone-zero-hoyoverse-rpg-project-mugen-anime-1850772023">mobile anime slop</a>, the developer has confirmed it won’t be relying on exploitative gambling mechanics to earn its keep. It will, however, be ripping off <em>Spider-Man</em> in every way it can.</p> <p>First, let’s start with the new trailer. Released earlier this week, it shows seven minutes of gameplay depicting all the ways you can explore, fight, and hang out in <em>Ananta’s</em> urban playground, and in the process it practically ends up serving as a greatest-hits highlight reel of all the past games the upcoming mobile release is clearly pulling from, including not just<em> Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em> but also<em> Watch Dogs</em>, <em>Sifu</em>, and more. There’s fluid martial arts brawls and smartphone hacking games. And of course, there’s the web-slinging people have been gawking at since the game was first announced.</p>  <p>It looks neat, and it’s impressive this is a game designed for mobile devices and not high-end consoles. Naked Rain is promising multi-level exploration from the ground-level streets to city rooftops, as well as interiors you can explore at different elevations. There are vehicles you can get in and drive, weapons you can pick up off the ground, from guns to golf clubs, and NPCs who will supposedly react to whatever chaos you’re causing while out exploring. “Every choice ripples through the life of the city,” the developers write. We’ll see.</p>

 <p>For some players, this is a win-win-win. Steal one game mechanic and you’re a thief. But take a bunch from all different games, pour them into a blender, see what comes out, and you might be a genius, or at least someone with the potential to make NetEase a lot of money. For others, however, <em>Ananta</em> is a bit too “shameless” when it comes to ripping off the competition. It’s not just that you can web-swing around town like Spider-Man, it’s that you can also use Venom-like powers to smash bad guys with attacks that look straight out of<em> Spider-Man 2</em>. Some of its chase scenes, meanwhile, seem lifted right out of an <em>Uncharted </em>game.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This Ananta game has no shame 😅<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Uncharted4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Uncharted4</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaughtyDog?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NaughtyDog</a> <a href="https://t.co/ly53Bi6Ebi">pic.twitter.com/ly53Bi6Ebi</a></p> <p>— King J 🤴🏿 (@JMaine518) <a href="https://twitter.com/JMaine518/status/1971228406328250840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marvel's Spider-Man 2: The Anime… I mean, ANANTA looks absolutely incredible!

One other big thing going for it is that, unlike a lot of games in this space, <em>Ananta</em> won’t be hawking pay-to-win character loot boxes&nbsp;in order to make money. Naked Rain confirmed <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53241">to <em>Famitsu</em></a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gta-style-open-world-anime-game-ananta-will-not-have-a-character-gacha-system-netease-confirms/"><em>Automaton</em></a>) that rather than these kinds of <a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-whales-hoyoverse-gacha-gambling-spending-1849734889">gacha mechanics</a>, the game’s monetization will instead rely on cosmetics and other customizable features ranging from outfits and cars to the player’s house.</p> <p>It’s not the only post-<em>Genshin Impact</em> mobile RPG to be shifting away from gacha mechanics. The makers of<em> Duet Night Abyss,</em> which arrives on mobile next month, announced they too <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/a-gacha-rpg-is-cutting-all-the-gacha-garbage-so-it-can-just-be-a-better-game-were-completely-removing-all-character-and-weapon-banners/">would be ditching</a> the hero loot box grind and getting rid of star ratings for equipment to limit pay-to-win mechanics. It’s also doing away with stamina limits, another popular way of nickel-and-diming players on mobile. “In the last test,” DecaBear says, “[testers] said our gameplay<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->which is built around fast-paced grinding<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->kept getting blocked by stamina limits,” producer DecaBear said. “And that felt pretty bad.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We still have a few other holidays to get through before the big ones at the end of the year, but you can get excited for them now with this LEGO Star Wars advent calendar. Truly, I can’t thing of a better brand to be making advent calendars for the holidays. Small, surprise LEGO builds are the perfect little toy and activity to be greeted with each day while counting down to Christmas. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4308/">This Star Wars one is normally priced at $45, but for a limited time you can scoop it up for 16% off</a>. That brings the price down to just $38, saving you a cool $7.</p>
<p>This LEGO Star Wars advent calendar is new for 2025 and will transform December into 24 days of fun for any Star Wars fan six years old and up. The set includes a very specific choice of iconic characters across the franchise. You won’t find Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, or Prince Leia here. You won’t even find Rey, Finn, the Mandalorian, or Grogu. Instead you get Babu Frik and a bunch of droids. C-3PO is there of course but you also get droids like R7-A7, BD-72, a scrap battle droid, and a super battle droid. BB-8 is adorably dressed up like a snowman and there is a Jawa that comes with a holiday sweater.</p>

<p>There are even more droids that buildable like a Pit Droid, Gonk Droid, Buzz Droid, holiday versions of a Medical Droid and a Mouse Droid, B2EMO, Treadwell Droid, and a Probe Droid. Merry Droidmas everybody.</p>
<p>You also get elements of Babu Frik’s workshop which can be connected together by the time they’re all opened.</p>



<h2>Let Star Wars Make Your Holiday Special</h2>
<p>Maybe sometime along the way of this 24-day countdown with you new LEGO advent calendar, you make some time to checkout the infamous <em>Star Wars Holiday Special</em> of which most involved wish it to go away. The CBS made-for-television broadcast is set after <em>A New Hope</em> but before the yet-to-be-released&nbsp;<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>. It follows everyone’s favorite Wookie Chewbacca alongside Han Solo venturing to return to Chewie’s home planet of Kashyyyk to celebrate “Life Day.” After its first airing it had never been broadcast again nor re-released in any official capacity. It’s not good and is the right choice to make this LEGO advent calendar have nothing to do with it.</p>
