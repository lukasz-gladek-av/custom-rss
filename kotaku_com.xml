Without spoiling anything, I was stunned at the ingenuity on display as I dove to some of its deeper, late-game layers. There are tons of different material types that make up the world, and there are set rules to how they all interact with each other. A simple example is how throwing ice onto lava creates a hardened rock platform, but the chemistry and interplay between different elements gets more complex as you progress, and learning these relationships and using your knowledge of them to solve increasingly smart puzzles is supremely gratifying. — <strong>Logan Plant</strong> </p></blockquote><h2 id="h220"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Donkey Kong Bananza offers a new start for Donkey Kong that is distinct from the Donkey Kong Country games. The focus on destructability captures what makes DK different from other platforming characters—his titanic strength—and giving him a cute sidekick grants the game unexpected emotional depth. As part of the launch line-up for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo’s signature substantial single-player adventures. But more importantly, it’s an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo’s best recent work. —<strong> Steve Watts</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h221"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> To properly encapsulate how I feel about Donkey Kong Bananza, you almost have to start at the finish. No spoilers here, obviously, but I have to say that I think this game has one of the finest finales of any Nintendo game ever. There’s a delightful build-up of adrenaline as story beats and experimental mechanical evolutions are gleefully layered atop each other. It’s difficult to not have a great big smile on your face as the game hurtles towards its finish. It’s pretty masterfully done. — <strong>Alex Donaldson</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h222"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The only fumble in these later stages is the overpowered nature of the Bananzas themselves. These animal transformations imbue DK with speed, flight, strength and more, and when contained in the challenges or levels built for them they sing. You are reminded of Mario’s Odyssey possessions and how perfectly realised each of those physical sensations was. But taken out of that context – when returning to earlier stages to mop up collectibles, for example – they become instant win buttons, dulling the ingenuity of Nintendo’s platforming designs. —<strong> Matthew Castle</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h223"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Washington Post</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Bananza” is the first Donkey Kong game developed internally by Nintendo in more than two decades, now staffed by the team that created the award-winning 2017 Switch title “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/10/30/mario-odyssey-is-a-reminder-of-how-fun-video-games-can-be/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/10/30/mario-odyssey-is-a-reminder-of-how-fun-video-games-can-be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario Odyssey</a></span>.” This game adopts Mario’s trademark powers of transformation. Instead of wearing different superpowered hats, Kong can transform into different animal “bananza” forms that allow him to fly (ostrich), punch through steel (ape) and sprint through thin ice weightlessly (zebra). While these powers run on a limited meter, a few sections allow extended use of them. The game soars when it demands usage of every single form, becoming a symphony of mechanics and player response. —<strong> Gene Park</strong><br>﻿</p></blockquote><h2 id="h224"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/donkey-kong-bananza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/donkey-kong-bananza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inverse</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>One moment in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> felt like a revelation – like seeing the image of the Mona Lisa for the first time. I’d simply punched my way straight down a mountain and landed on a Banandium Gem. Sprawled behind me was a lengthy platforming puzzle. My wanton destruction had let me punch my way out of doing an entire puzzle, and now the possibilities seemed endless. —<strong> Hayes Madsen</strong><br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h225"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/donkey-kong-bananza-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/donkey-kong-bananza-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Smashing things is fun, and Donkey Kong Bananza understands that fact better than any other video game I’ve ever played. Forget about “See that mountain? You can go there.” Now it’s “See that mountain? You can obliterate it.” Bananza’s destruction isn’t just a flashy gimmick for the Minecraft generation, it’s one of the best inventions Nintendo has had in years. — Dustin Bailey</p></blockquote><h2 id="h226"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Bananza</em> is a dad game the same way <em>The Last of Us</em> is a dad game. Same world-trekking adventure with a big strong dude protecting a powerful little girl. But where <em>TLOU</em> makes you have big sad feelings about all the people the game forces you to kill, <em>Bananza</em> presents you with a slight alternative — what if you could use your powers to fuck shit up and <em>not</em> be a dick about it? DK smiles often. People are happy to see him. That friendly rock I mentioned earlier? When you punch him or any NPC, it turns into a high five. All that destruction is welcome because it’s helping restore the world.  — Ash Parrish</p></blockquote><h2 id="h227"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRX0Ep7gacQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRX0Ep7gacQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Image quality in handheld is a lot better than what we see in docked mode. But performance is where things get perhaps a little more interesting. So, in the direct for Donkey Kong, we spotted a ton of slowdown. And unfortunately, that has not been fully eliminated, but it is a little bit better than I had hoped. It’s just that the way it manifests is somewhat unusual. You see, most of the time, the drops are not sustained. Rather, they occur only during very specific animations, such as when picking up a banana or on certain camera cuts. It’s a bit distracting, but it doesn’t impede on gameplay that often, which is good. I say that often because there are situations where it can drop pretty hard and stay there, like this boss fight where the frame rate dips down to 30 FPS and sticks there for most of the fight. Something made worse by the somewhat choppy looking destruction effects. —<strong> John Linneman</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h228"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>By the time the credits rolled, the transformations felt like one of numerous ideas introduced in Donkey Kong Bananza that it never truly capitalizes upon. At one point, progression seemingly expands with a branching path, only for it never to be used again. Similarly, other unique ideas are introduced and then never meaningfully fleshed out. Like most of Donkey Kong Bananza, then, if you start digging beneath the surface, you find flaws in its construct. But combined, its foundations form an adventure that’s genuinely greater than the sum of its parts. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t thoroughly enjoy the moment-to-moment of its campaign, even when I kept noticing the parts of its design that could’ve been executed better. —<strong> Andy Robinson</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h229"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/donkey-kong-bananza-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/donkey-kong-bananza-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> It’s worth going back to that Astro Bot comparison, by way of Super Mario Odyssey. In the very last level of Astro Bot, the game throws a new power-up at you.

When you get fresh ideas in the later stages of Donkey Kong Bananza, you feel more like ‘oh we should have had this earlier, that would have made everything better’.  —<strong> Stacey Hanley</strong><br></p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-reviews-metacritic-roundup-switch-2-1851786384]]></content:encoded>

But it’s now been announced that this August, subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online will get access to a limited-time demo.</p><p>I remember  feeling pretty emotional during the livestream that Nintendo had chosen to use a disability-forward concept to highlight one of the Switch 2's very few new features. Then, at the same time, concerned that this game might not be more than a gimmick, an in-house experiment to see if the company could sell the Joy-Con 2's mouse-like abilities to itself. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Wheelchair basketball makes so much sense as a gaming concept, given how much easier it is to offer tangible controls for wheels rather than feet. Even putting aside the mouse controls, <em>Drag x Drive</em> looked like something akin to <em>Rocket League</em>, with those tech-future vibes in a <em>Battle Bots</em>-like arena, and that seemed really promising. It’s odd that it’s when factoring those controls back in that the concerns this might be a game to support a feature, rather than the other way around, kick in.</p><p>Come August 9 and 10, we’ll definitely have a much better idea of what’s on offer—well, if we have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription we will. The multiplayer game is going to have a “Global Jam demo event,” which will offer a “sneak peak” of what will be on offer. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-will-soon-be-playable-in-a-limited-time-demo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-will-soon-be-playable-in-a-limited-time-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span> reports that the demos will be available in sessions, running 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. ET on Saturday, while Sunday has two slots, 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. to midnight. That crazy early start on Saturday is likely to make things a little more amenable to UK players, where it falls from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p><p>The three-a-side competitive game plays as a simplified version of wheelchair basketball, with hoops thrown by a Joy Con gesture, although pretty much nothing else is known at this point about the specifics, game modes, tournaments, and so on. The full game is out August 14, so just a few days after the free demo event. It’s set to be priced at $20, and will only be available as a download from the Switch 2's eStore. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-drag-x-drive-basketball-free-demo-1851786377]]></content:encoded>
