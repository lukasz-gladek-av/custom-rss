              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</em></a> is more mature than your average Nintendo-published first-party game. So players were expecting some violence, sci-fi monsters, and guns. What they might not have been expecting was for so many of the puzzle game’s doors to look like, umm, well…</p> <p>As with past <em>Metroid</em> games from Nintendo, a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021"><em>Prime 4</em>‘</a>s presentation is inspired by H.R. Giger’s designs from the classic sci-fi movie <em>Alien</em>. This is especially evident in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s first large level, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657">Volt Forge</a>, which contains a lot of Giger-esque architecture and environmental details. But other parts of <em>Prime 4</em>, like the famous artist, seem inspired by other parts of human anatomy, like vaginas. What I’m trying to say is there are a lot of doors in this game that might make your more prudish grandparents uncomfortable.</p>    <p>“Lotta vaginas in this game,” bluntly, but accurately, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanmoher.com/post/3m7733nyj4k2a">declared critic Aidan Moher on Bluesky</a>. And he’s right! In the early portions of <em>Prime 4</em>‘s campaign, you’ll encounter a few different doors that seem inspired by vulvas.&nbsp; Fans online are now sharing screenshots of doors that look very vaginal online.&nbsp; Some are large, and some are small. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyvagina/comments/1pe7opb/the_doors_in_metroid_prime_4/">One of these doors</a> even popped up on a subreddit dedicated to highlighting objects and locations that look a bit like vaginas.</p>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is all the discourse on Metroid Prime 4 about Miles and not how all the doors are extremely vaginal?

              <p>Netflix’s co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, doesn’t believe that the streaming giant is a negative force in the film industry. Instead, the soon-to-be owner of Warner Bros.&nbsp; believes Netflix is more of a savior.</p> <p>Netflix announced its <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">$82 billion bid to gobble up Warner Bros</a>., the legendary film and media company, earlier today. If it clears regulatory hurdles, the deal will position the supreme ruler of streaming services as a God Emperor of a massive TV and film catalog, as well as the properties belonging to Warner Bros. Games, which include the Lego games, as well as DC adaptations like the <i>Arkham </i>series of <i>Batman</i> games, and the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games.</p> <p>During an interview with <i>Time </i>magazine editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-movie-theaters-outdated-1236376565/">earlier this year</a>, Sarandos was asked point-blank: “Have you destroyed Hollywood?”</p> <p>“No,” Sarandos replied, “we’re saving Hollywood.”</p> <p>The CEO then casted doubt on the role of movie theaters moving forward. Though the streaming giant will need to premiere some films in theaters to be considered for certain awards, Sarandos doesn’t see the theater experience as something accessible for most folks. He said:</p>

 <blockquote><p>If you’re [fortunate enough to live in] Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a bit of an odd statement considering that cars exist. Still, Sarandos sees the industry’s reliance on theaters as an arbitrary limitation he’s happy to dispense with, much to the displeasure of Hollywood veterans <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-academy-awards-mean-nothing-to-me-if-they-dont-mean-theatrical-avatar-director-james-cameron-says-netflix-films-should-not-qualify-for-the-oscars-because-theyre-not-in-theaters">like <em>Avatar</em> creator James Cameron</a>.</p>

 <p>The industry remains concerned over the impact Netflix is likely to have should its purchase of Warner Bros. go through. <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">According to <i>A Shot</i></a>, the Director’s Guild of America, led by director Christopher Nolan, is going to meet with the streaming company to address “major concerns.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Directors Guild of America, led by president Christopher Nolan, plans to meet with Netflix to address major concerns regarding the streamer’s acquisition of Warner Bros. <a href="https://t.co/EcwdZ0A0Qz">pic.twitter.com/EcwdZ0A0Qz</a></p> <p>— A Shot (@ashotmagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashotmagazine/status/1996978975311364261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Theaters have been in a bit of a bind ever since the global pandemic made it hard to convince people to leave their homes to go see a movie. Should Netflix’s Warner Bros. acquisition go through, it’s all the more likely that even fewer movies may hit the literal big screen.</p> <p>And with that, let’s <a href="https://youtu.be/wKiIroiCvZ0">reflect on some wise words</a> about experiencing movies from one of the all-time greats.</p>

              <p><span>Marvel Studios has just announced it’s bringing the 2019 MCU finale </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> back to theaters next year.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“<i>Avengers: Endgame</i> — Back in theaters, September 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1997018384719020370">Marvel Studios announced on X</a> on Friday. It’s accompanied by a short video that begins with a black screen before Anthon</span><span>y Mackie’s iconic “on your left” line plays, revealing the <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> logo to what is presumably a recording of a theater audience’s hoots and hollers. “Avengers, assemble,” Chris Evans’ Captain America says, accompanied by more screaming. </span></p> <p><span>We have reached the stage in pop culture where we are nostalgic for something that happened six years ago.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Avengers: Endgame — Back in theaters, September 2026. <a href="https://t.co/PRmW9pEAxm">pic.twitter.com/PRmW9pEAxm</a></p> <p>— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1997018384719020370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>(Hilariously, an account called the Official Chicken Little Movie Account posted the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Endgame</em> as a reply to the announcement.)</p>

 <p><span>Maybe this is a sign of how badly the COVID pandemic damaged our cultural psyche, but it’s more likely Marvel is trying to bring back some goodwill ahead of the release of </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span> next December. </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span>, part of the </span><i><span>Avengers</span></i><span> series that first kicked off in 2012, is also considered a part of the “Multiverse Saga,” which plays on the franchise’s recent focus on time travel and alternate realities (we’ve seen it play out in films like </span><i><span>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home</span></i><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Thanks to the multiverse’s rule-bending logic, </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span> will star Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron Man in the first four </span><i><span>Avengers</span></i><span> films, but returns this time as Doctor Doom. It will also feature a massive, frankly absurd ensemble cast drawn in part from more than two decades of comic book movies. The roster is split into what appears to be teams, if this post claiming to showcase a video of a recent Disney Italia presentation is to be believed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disney Italia presented 'AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY' at a conference in Sorrento</p> <p>(via <a href="https://t.co/My30rheaoK">https://t.co/My30rheaoK</a>)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/avengersdoomsday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#avengersdoomsday</a> <a href="https://t.co/mRwzyOYM9z">pic.twitter.com/mRwzyOYM9z</a></p> <p>— Nerd Al Quadrato (@nerdalquadrato) <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdalquadrato/status/1995901455585227173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The “teams” include actors from the original MCU flicks (Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki), the aughts </span><i><span>X-Men</span></i><span> movies (Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Rebecca Romijn as Mystique), the </span><i><span>Fantastic Four</span></i><span> reboot (Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm), and the </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span> crew AKA </span><i><span>The New Avengers</span></i><span> (Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova).</span></p>

 <p><span>If </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span> sticks to its December 2026 release date, it’ll hit theaters more than seven years after </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span>. Normally, you could argue Marvel is worried fans will have forgotten what’s going on, but nearly every movie released since 2019 has somehow tied into the larger MCU picture. Plus, </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span> was the </span><i><span>end</span></i><span> of many core Avengers’ stories, while <em>Doomsday</em> seems to be picking up threads from a menagerie of Marvel films.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The cynic in me thinks this is an attempt to recreate the magic that took place when </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span> released all those years ago, and bad people recording in the movie theater with their phones gave us </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAIzLj3mYTw"><span>real-time audience reactions</span></a><span> to the return of the Thanos-snapped heroes and Captain America wielding Thor’s hammer. (If you consider that a spoiler, you must have been trapped in ice for the last half-decade.) The screams, the cheers, the exclamations of surprise—aside from the most recent </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span> flick bringing back Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to stand alongside Tom Holland in Spidey suits, Marvel hasn’t gotten a crowd pop like that since.</span></p> <p><span>There have been some serious stinkers since </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span>, including </span><i><span>Eternals</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Captain America: Brave New World, </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Maybe Marvel hopes we’ll all step into a time machine and transport us back to a pre-COVID era when superhero movies could still stir something in our hearts. Nostalgia, remember, is a helluva drug.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s How To Fix Metroid Prime 4‘s Silliest Control Decision]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021</link>
            <guid>1374907</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> out now on Switch and Switch 2, is a game that, as I continue to play it, is winning me over more. But one part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Prime 4</em></a> annoyed me so much that I had to finally go into the settings, dig through some menus, and bypass a warning screen to fix it. I’m talking about the default jump button for the Morph Ball which is, inexplicably, different from the regular jump button.</p> <p>Look, I understand that this isn’t new to<em> Prime 4</em>. It was like this in <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em>,</a> too, and <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/960329-metroid-prime-trilogy/58099153">the Wii version of <em>Prime 2</em></a>. So for some folks, this might be second nature and not weird at all. But I haven’t played much <em>Metroid Prime </em>beyond the remaster of the first game, so when I discovered that jumping in Morph Ball mode used the X button instead of B, which is how you jump when controlling Samus on foot, I was perturbed.</p>

 <h2>How to change the jump controls in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></h2> <p>I tried to play using the default controls for a bit, hoping I’d get used to it, but no luck. Thankfully, Nintendo and Retro Studios let you customize <em>Prime 4</em>‘s controls. The problem is that to do so, you have to dig through a few menus and alarm bells. It’s odd. But here’s how to change the Morph Ball jump button in<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:</em></p> <ol> <li> <blockquote><p>Pause the game and open up the settings menu.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Scroll down to the control scheme subsection and hit A.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now hit ZR to bring up the Morph Ball controls.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Select “Spring Ball” and hit A.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now highlight the B button slot and confirm the swap.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>If your B button slot contains question marks (???) you need to do another step</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>The game will ask you if you want to go into advanced mode. Hit Ok.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now you can swap the&nbsp;??? (which is later revealed to be the Spin Ball ability) and fix this silly control choice.</p></blockquote> </li> </ol> <p>This should work the same on Switch or Switch 2. Since making this change, I’ve had a lot more fun jumping around as the Morph Ball. I’m not sure why Nintendo buried this option in some menus and behind a warning, but I’m thankful they included the ability to remap controls at all. Not every developer does that, and it can be very annoying. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go hop around as a ball in <em>Metroid Prime 4.&nbsp;</em></p>
