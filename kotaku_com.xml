The device, which costs $200, works like a charm and is quietly one of the best things Sony has made in some time. However, the Portal’s one big flaw was that, for some reason, it couldn’t stream games from the cloud. You had to own a PS5 and, when using the Portal, your PS5 would turn on and play your game remotely. It meant that the PS Portal was more an accessory than a console. But that changes today. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 19, PlayStation released the latest update</a></span> for the PS Portal and while it adds some nice quality-of-life upgrades regarding sound settings, the real news is that starting today, players can play a selection of PS5 games via the cloud and without a console. In theory, you can now play PS5 games while out and about, assuming you have a wifi connection. </p><p>Sony says that over 120 PS5 games included in the PS Plus Game Catalog can be streamed on PS Portal after today’s update. The games include <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, Ghost of Tsushima, </em>and <em>Dave the Diver.</em></p><h2 id="h37603"><a id=""></a> How to stream cloud games on your PS Portal</h2><p>To start streaming PS5 games on your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-hacked-psp-gta-liberty-city-google-1851270852&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-hacked-psp-gta-liberty-city-google-1851270852">PS Portal</a></span> without a console, you’ll need an active PS Plus Premium subscription, and then you’ll have to download the update and follow these steps:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Open “Quick Menu” and access “Settings” on your PS Portal.</li><li>Select the “Cloud Streaming (Beta)” button</li><li>Switch the Cloud Streaming (Beta) toggle on (this will be off by default).</li></ol></blockquote><p>At the moment, Sony is calling this a beta test, and not all features, like the capture button and party chat, will be supported in these streaming games on Portal.

Everybody brings their own special personal connection to the game.”</p><p>One of the big questions was why the<em> Minecraft </em>movie is live-action with tons of VFX instead of just being completely CGI-animated as fans may have expected a movie based on the hit survival crafting game to be. A fan-made trailer that was basically a shot-for-shot remake of the official one, only in <em>Minecraft</em> itself, seemed designed to provoke this question and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Alumio_/status/1832765840925880633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832765840925880633%7Ctwgr%5Ecbd372b14163693df74e0e787bdb42aa4565b322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fdivisive-minecraft-movie-trailer-remade-in-animated-style-and-fans-love-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Alumio_/status/1832765840925880633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832765840925880633%7Ctwgr%5Ecbd372b14163693df74e0e787bdb42aa4565b322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fdivisive-minecraft-movie-trailer-remade-in-animated-style-and-fans-love-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly went viral</a></span>. </p><p> “I mean, that was one of the things [fans were saying in response to the trailer]: ‘Why is it live action? Why isn’t it animated?’ I think a lot of people were expecting that, and just the fact that there was live action and directly real-life characters and physical sets didn’t feel right with them, because in their imagination, they’ve been playing it for a very long time,” Olafsson told <em>IGN</em>. “And they’ve kind of projected and seen a bunch of content obviously that’s been made both by us, the community, we’ve made a story mode. We made animated content before, and there’s a lot of it out there.”</p><p> Olafsson explained that one of the reasons to do a live-action adaptation was precisely because it was different and hadn’t already been done before. It was also something that had been put in motion long ago. Warner Bros. began working with <em>Minecraft</em> maker Mojang to produce a movie as far back as 2014, and the current version set to release in 2025 is the result of a long and messy process, with the project changing creative hands several times. </p><p> “This movie’s been in development for a very, very long time,” Olafsson said. “A lot of the people who will see it were not born when the first contracts and the first discussions were had, and there was always going to be live action.” </p><p>According to Hess, there were also a lot of things, like Momoa using the crafting table, that just didn’t come across right in the rapidly edited context of the initial trailer. The duo seem confident that the way those gameplay elements are communicated and fleshed out in the movie itself will make a lot more sense to long-time fans. </p><p>Apparently, early test audiences agree. The pair say early screenings of the <em>Minecraft </em>movie, even without completed VFX, have garnered positive feedback, unlike that first trailer. “People are like, ‘This is nothing like the trailer. This movie is awesome,’” Olafsson said. The movie is set to release on April 4 of next year. A second trailer, released today, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319">looks a lot better</a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

More people are happy about that—people love those daggone <em>Equalizers</em>.”</p><p>Yes, we do love those daggone <em>Equalizer</em> films. That’s why each of the three films in the franchise has averaged a hefty $190 million at the box office. Typically, when actors of Washington’s esteemed pedigree do these wildly successful but artistically unchallenging films, it’s to fund projects they actually want to make. Do you think Robert Downey Jr. spent a decade inside a red fake robot suit in hopes of winning an Oscar? Washington subscribed to this same thinking, until he realized the impact of films like <em>The Equalizer</em>.</p><p>“I’ll sometimes say to myself, ‘One’s for me, one’s for them.’ So, for example, <em>Othello</em>: We’re doing it on Broadway and then a movie. That’s for me. But I’ve come to realize that the <em>Equalizer</em> films are for me, too, because they’re for the people,” he explains. “They want me to go get the bad guys. ‘We can’t get them, so you go get them.’ And I say, ‘Okay, I’ll get them! Just wait right there. I’ll be right back!’”</p><p>Is it irrational to have such an emotional attachment to a movie character that you yearn for them to fight bad guys who don’t exist? Sure, somewhat. Is that attachment the core reason why putting moving images on screens is a multi-million dollar business in America? Absolutely! And Denzel understands that.</p><p>This revelation from Washington all but ensures that he’ll be a leading man in an action film in his 70s. It’s not unheard of. Heck, Charles Bronson was 72 years old and still playing a similar vigilante in another long-standing action film franchise when he starred in <em>Death Wish V: The Face of Death</em>. Antoine Fuqua, director of every <em>Equalizer</em> film, even said in 2023 that he’s tossed around the idea of using <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/movies/the-equalizer-3-director-denzel-washington-de-aging-for-origin-story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/movies/the-equalizer-3-director-denzel-washington-de-aging-for-origin-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de-aging technology</a></span> on Washington for an <em>Equalizer</em> origin story.</p><p>If these are possibly some of the final action films for Washington, who said he will scale back his output significantly, they should do anything and everything to make sure one of the greatest actors of all time goes out looking like a badass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Gerard Butler is reprising his role as Hiccup’s father but the rest of the cast is completely new, including Mason Thames (<em>The Black Phone</em>) as Hiccup and Nico Parker as fellow village kid Astrid. The remake’s first teaser shows Hiccup refusing to wage war on dragons as his father demands, and his pivotal first meeting with Toothless. </p><p>Toothless, the main draw of the movie, looks excellent. Imagine taking the creature from the original 2010 movie and giving him an Unreal Engine 5 makeover, just without all the uncanny valley stuff. The rest of the movie looks less spectacular, with dense fog and heavy special effects begging the question of why, exactly, you should make a live-action version of a cartoon about epic battles and fantastical creatures in a mythical land untouched by time. </p><p>Profit motive, for one, and a creatively bankrupt Hollywood for another. Even Butler basically just looks like someone cosplaying the CGI version of the character instead of giving audiences something genuinely new and different. Maybe as we get closer to the remake’s release, what Universal shows will get more convincing. At the very least, kids will love another reason to watch Toothless be cute and ferocious in equal measures all over again. </p><p>The live-action <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> is out on June 13, 2025. In the meantime, the original version—an all-time classic—is streaming on Max, Hulu, and other platforms. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you hired her, she could help out during matches by throwing ice grenades at enemies, but she would often spam them, annoying and hindering even the players she was supposed to be assisting. So Epic has now stepped in and taken away the digital rapper’s ice bombs. Weird world we live in, huh? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194440" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Fortnite Totally Nailed Attack on Titan's Thrilling Movement" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="160" data-playlist="194440,196395,197298" data-current="194440"><div><p>Fortnite Totally Nailed Attack on Titan's Thrilling Movement</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194440/194440_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194440/194440_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194440/194440_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194440/194440_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19886.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Ice Spice is the latest rapper to be added to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-playlists-1851683252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-playlists-1851683252"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span><em>’s </em>throwback Chapter 2 Remix season, which ends later this month. Eminem and Snoop Dogg were previously added this month and like Ice Spice, if you found them on the island during a match and defeated them in combat, you could hire them to be your bodyguard/co-op buddy. However, players quickly discovered that Ice Spice loves spamming her chiller grenades—which explode and encase your feet in blocks of ice—the moment an enemy player is nearby, leading to a lot of frustration. </p><p>You can find clips online of the digital rapper freezing people who she is, in theory, supposed to be helping. </p><p>When her ice bombs hit, they freeze your feet and greatly increase your speed, but make it harder to control your direction. Sometimes this is useful, like when you are chasing someone down or trying to escape.</p><p>But other times, when you are trying to hide or stay elevated on a ledge during a fight, it’s very unhelpful. Ice Spice didn’t give a shit, however, and would toss ice bombs with reckless abandon as seen in the clips above. This has led to players not hiring her, and complaining online about all the ice bomb spam. </p><p>On November 18, after a few days of Ice Spice trolling people with dozens of chiller grenades, Epic announced that it was stepping in and taking away her icy explosives.</p><p>“Time to defrost! Due to a gameplay issue affecting Ice Spice’s Chiller Grenade usage, we have disabled them while we work on a fix,” posted Epic Games on Twitter. </p><p>So it’s now safe to recruit Ice Spice in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-peely-leatherface-skins-halloween-leaks-1851680623&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-peely-leatherface-skins-halloween-leaks-1851680623"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span>.
