This is the kind of stuff you expect to see in a <em>GTA </em>game. But what it also contains is something we’ve never really seen before in a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> sequel: a couple cuddling and having a real relationship. And that’s  the part of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-screenshots-vice-city-map-jason-lucia-1851779375&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-screenshots-vice-city-map-jason-lucia-1851779375"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span><em> </em>that surprised me the most. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,196299,197556" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Released on May 6 with no warning, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-new-trailer-rockstar-1851779300&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-new-trailer-rockstar-1851779300"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s second trailer</a></span> arrived <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-first-trailer-2-a-year-later-1851714995&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-first-trailer-2-a-year-later-1851714995">over a year after its first</a></span> and featured a lot more of Jason and Lucia, the two main characters in this upcoming Rockstar open-world sequel set in Vice City and its surrounding state of Leonida. We already knew that this new sequel would feature the couple in a big way, but that trailer seems to suggest that Rockstar is aiming to make them a believable, relatable, and dare I say, cute couple. </p><p>One moment that really stuck out to me in the trailer as something we’ve never really seen in a <em>GTA </em>game before happens at the very end. Jason is laying on the couch half asleep and watching TV. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?t=136&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?t=136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucia enters the living room, tosses her keys on the table and collapses onto Jason to cuddle with him</a></span>. It’s the kind of moment that most people in loving relationships have experienced. Your significant other gets back from a big trip, a hard day at work, or some other grueling experience and lands directly next to or on top of you for some comfort and love. It’s a cute and genuine moment. And it’s in the middle of a <em>GTA </em>trailer! Strange. </p><p>This is a franchise that has mostly treated relationships as jokes. Think back to how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/F7jad1GGH6Q?t=37&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/F7jad1GGH6Q?t=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CJ and Catalina are portrayed in <em>GTA San Andreas</em></a></span><em>.</em> She’s a lunatic and frequently called horrible names. Similarly, in <em>GTA V </em>Michael’s relationship with his wife is shown to be a mostly toxic and hostile experience that only gets better at the end due to violence. There’s also the bit in<em> GTA V</em> where Trevor kidnaps an old woman and they fall in love. And the earlier <em>GTA </em>games, like <em>Vice City</em>, mostly treated relationships as silly punchlines about how women are annoying and controlling. In <em>GTA 3</em>, after saving the woman he apparently “loves,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/dtmXd0iaL5o?t=455&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/dtmXd0iaL5o?t=455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude shoots her offscreen for talking too much</a></span>! Yikes. The closest<em> GTA</em> has ever gotten to a real relationship is Nico and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_McReary&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_McReary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate in <em>GTA IV</em></a></span>. But that’s barely part of the game, and if you choose the wrong option she gets gunned down by the end. </p><p>However, in the trailer for <em>GTA 6,</em> we see Jason and Lucia being a real couple. They seem genuinely enthralled with each other. The moment where Jason picks Lucia up out of prison and they smile warmly for a second is so unlike anything in <em>GTA </em>before. And throughout the trailer we see them snuggling, getting intimate, holding each other, kissing, dancing together, and even at one point holding hands. In a series that has featured so much violence and sex, it’s surreal to see two people in love and holding hands. </p><figure id="" data-id="afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-recommend-id="image://afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-recommend-id="image://afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now the real question is: will Rockstar be able to pull off a full 30-70 hour game featuring a relatable and caring relationship? I don’t know. We are truly in uncharted waters for this franchise right now. But I hope they nail it. I think if Jason and Lucia’s relationship is the core of<em> GTA 6</em>'s story, it could help it not only stand out from past <em>GTA </em>games, but it could signal that Rockstar has grown up a bit.</p><p>Sure, it will still put in silly joke products and background signs that make me roll my eyes. But if, at the front and center of this massive AAA video game, there’s a realistic and well-done take on a real relationship between two people, that would be a wild accomplishment that I didn’t expect from a franchise famous for letting you kill sex workers to get your money back. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
