            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musks-favorite-game-is-getting-remastered-25-years-later-2000628283"><em>Deus Ex Remastered</em></a> from Aspyr was set to launch in February of next year. It’s now been indefinitely delayed following a flood of complaints that the new version of the classic PC game looked ugly.</p> <p>During <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258#:~:text=One%20of%20the,on%20February%205.">Sony’s State of Play event in September</a>, Aspyr revealed <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>, an “improved” and “better” looking version of the original, a beloved sci-fi immersive sim developed by Ion Storm and released in 2000. Almost immediately, the reaction online turned negative. <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-remastered-trailer-ugly-bad-comparison-ps5-pc-mods-nightdive-2000628799">People, myself included, weren’t happy about all the textures being replaced</a> with newer, higher-resolution assets. These didn’t mesh well with the old models and geometry that was still left in the game, creating a bizarre effect where it looked even worse than the chunky but charming visuals of the original game.</p> <p>Now, the remaster has been delayed, likely in an attempt to improve how it looks. On December 11, Aspyr announced that it wouldn’t move ahead with releasing <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> in early 2026, <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?">posting on X</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of <em>Deus Ex Remastered. </em>We’ve listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players,<em> Deus Ex Remastered</em> will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026.</p></blockquote> <p>Asypry didn’t provide a new release date or window. The studio behind other remasters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">like 2024’s </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">Star Wars Bounty Hunter</a>,</em> confirmed all pre-orders would be refunded, which seems to imply the delay won’t be a short one.&nbsp; Aspyr says it looks “forward to sharing more updates” with fans “when the time comes.”</p> <p>Based on how many people didn’t like the trailer and were disappointed with <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>‘s visuals, I think very few people are going to be upset about this delay. Hopefully, when/if <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> sees the light of day again, it looks more like the original and less like a bad fan-created Unreal demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards enters its 12th year</a>, it’s worth looking back on some of the highs and lows from TGAs past. Out of the ashes of the Spike VGAs, creator and host Geoff Keighley created an annual gaming staple that highlights some of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243">biggest and best games for millions watching from home</a>. It honors creators and brands, seeking to elevate the craft and art of games while also leaving room for giant walking razor blade sponsorships. Here are 17 of the best and worst Game Awards moments going back to 2014.</p> <h2>“Fuck The Oscars!” – The Game Awards 2017</h2>  <p>Any list of iconic or famous Game Awards moments must legally include what is arguably the show’s most well-known clip: That time <em>Split Ficition</em> and<em> It Takes Two</em> director Josef Fares took control of the show for a few minutes and yelled “Fuck the Oscars!” in front of a visibly confused Geoff. Great stuff. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2><em>Ark 2</em> starring Vin Diesel is announced – The Game Awards 2020</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/vin-diesel-is-fighting-dinosaurs-in-ark-2-1845856293">It was funny when Wildcard Studios announced an <em>Ark</em> sequel</a> despite many fans at the time feeling the original game needed more updates. It was even funnier when Vin Diesel appeared in the trailer. And it’s really, really funny that five years later, the game appears to be vaporware and has yet to launch. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/almost-5-years-since-its-reveal-ark-2-devs-admit-the-survival-sequel-was-put-on-hold-a-couple-of-years-ago-but-theyre-hopeful-it-could-release-in-early-access-within-the-next-2-years/">But it might finally see the light of day in 2027.</a> – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>The leaders of the three console companies share a stage – The Game Awards 2018</h2>  <p>The Game Awards foreshadowed the end of the console wars when Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aimé, Xbox’s Phil Spencer, and PlayStation’s Shawn Layden took the stage together at the 2018 ceremony to look beyond old marketing rivalries, exclusivity deals, and platform competition and praise gaming as a medium that transcends studio borders and corporate branding. Two of them are now retired and only Spencer remains at his post, currently overseeing the implementation of a similar philosophy as Microsoft goes multiplatform. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>DrDisrespect wins the Trending Gamer award – The Game Awards 2017</h2>  <p>Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm was crowned the biggest gamer of 2017 back when the Game Awards and the traditional gaming industry was still much more intertwined with the growing creator economy on YouTube and Twitch. Little did we all know that this was the same year in which Beahm would later <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">admit to having had</a> “casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate” with a female minor. He was later banned from Twitch over it, even though the full incident wouldn’t come to light until 2024. Presciently, the Game Awards never did another Trending Gamer prize again. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Ken &amp; Roberta Williams win the first Industry Icons Award – The Game Awards 2014</h2>  <p>The very first Game Awards in 2014 was an overly long and very boring show. But even I had to smile when Ken and Roberta Williams, two very important video game pioneers, were given the Industry Icon award. This show should have tons of these kinds of moments; alas, these segments that truly celebrate creators and games are still far too rare. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Ninja showing up – The Game Awards 2018</h2>  <p>In an attempt to professionalize the category, the Game Awards shifted from 2017’s Trending Gamer to “Content Creator of the Year.” While Richard “Ninja” Blevins would go on to win it in 2018, he also just appeared during the show at the height of his electric-blue-haired popularity for a bit with a Muppet that may have been one of the least funny bits to ever appear during the show’s decade-plus run. Ninja may have had the charisma of a plastic “forkknife” but the writers did him no favors here. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Flute Guy – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p>Live concerts have always been a staple of the Game Awards, but they’ve gotten much better with the move away from <em>Rock Band</em>-like cameos and toward orchestral arrangements of actual video game music. No one embodies that more than Venezuelan flautist Pedro Eustache, who became a viral sensation for his passionate and expressive performances across a variety of different instruments at the 2022 show, especially during the <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> segment. He’s so good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sb27LA2n8w">they keep bringing him back</a>. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2><em>Rock Band VR</em> announcement trailer – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>I’m not sure why <em>Rock Band VR</em> was even created or why it was given such a lengthy spotlight at the Game Awards. And perhaps the worst part is that if you watched the show live or were there in person, you had to look at Palmer Luckey’s feet. The VR wunderkind is now a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/tech-ceo-shares-how-he-early-supporter-trump-running-president-before-his-2016-campaign">right-wing</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/palmer-luckey-ai-powered-autonomous-weapons-future-of-warfare-60-minutes-transcript/">AI weapons dealer</a>, and it makes this already hard-to-watch segment even more unbearable. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Waldorf and Statler dunk on the event – The Game Awards 2024</h2>  <p>Yes, it’s a bit odd how often Geoff invites Muppets to the Game Awards. But whatever, I don’t care because it means Statler and Waldorf got to occasionally appear and make fun of the show, Geoff, and everything else. It was wonderful. Truly inspired. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Schick Hyrdobot takes it to the next level – The Game Awards 2016</h2>  <p>The early days of the Game Awards are filled with some truly bizarre sponsorship moments and deals. Geoff needed help funding this thing and seemed willing to take any deal he was offered. That is likely how we ended up with Schick Hyrdobot, a horrific razor-robot-man hybrid that appeared periodically throughout the&nbsp; 2016 event. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Fans boo Konami – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>Number one Keighley best friend Hideo Kojima was not allowed to attend the 2015 show. In an uncharacteristically candid segment, Geoff outlined that Konami’s lawyers were specifically prohibiting the <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em> director from attending despite the game being nominated. “It’s unfathomable to me,” the host said. As the audience booed the publisher, the show commemorated the absence with a special performance of “Quiet Steam” from the game. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Cutting the GOTY speech short – The Game Awards 2023</h2>  <p>Larian Studios took home the top prize for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>at the 2023 show but director Swen Vincke only had 60 seconds to speedrun through the team’s acceptance speech. Things were made even worse by a “<a href="https://twitter.com/javierabegazo/status/1732975428237934964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732975428237934964%7Ctwgr%5Ef68fd0afd04e064cfcb2ee0dbe53a48fa90d90b0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fbaldur-s-gate-3-game-awards-2023-goty-speech-1851099039">wrap it up</a>” sign that happened to flash right when he was mentioning the colleagues that had been lost along the way during development. Fortunately, the studio head shared <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-game-awards-2023-goty-speech-1851099039">his full speech online</a> after the show, and went on to have one of the best monologues at the following year’s show, in which he predicted <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-awards-goty-larian-1851780699">potentially sweeping this year’s awards</a>. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2>Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aime remembers Iwata – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>As mentioned already, it’s rare that the Game Awards takes a moment to truly slow down and let someone be human. That makes this moment in 2015 when Geoff and then-Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé eulogized and honored the recently passed Satuoru Iwata, all the more special. Geoff literally says that for the next few minutes he’s putting away the trailers, the awards, and the marketing, and seems truly affected by Iwata’s death. Turns out you don’t need big flashy trailers to create a memorable moment. Just some heart. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel end the show awkwardly – The Game Awards 2019</h2>  <p>I think the 2019 Game Awards have the worst and strangest ending in the show’s history. It starts with Michelle Rodriguez revealing the last game of the show, a crappy <em>Fast and Furious</em> game that looked terrible, and evolves into an awkward back-and-forth between her and Vin Diesel about the next <em>F&amp;F</em> movie and video games. It’s rough stuff. Worse, the two were then involved in <a href="https://youtu.be/UOmdhofNzDM">handing out the final award of the night to the Game of the Year winner.</a> Yikes! – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Christopher Judge wins and gives a nine-minute speech – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p>There’s no <em>God of War</em> reboot without Christopher Judge, and the <em>Stargate</em> veteran went on to win “Best Performance” for <em>Ragnarök</em> in 2022. He gave what must be the longest speech in Game Awards history. It was personal, emotional, and so drawn out that Keighley spent the next few years rushing winners off the stage after 30 seconds to stop the show from going too late into the night. But he earned it after punctuating the 2018 show with the best three words anyone spoke onstage that night: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxgaD_0LboI">Read it, boy</a>.” – Ethan Gach</p> <h2>Bill Clinton kid crashes the stage – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-bill-clinton-infowars-blizzcon-troll-1849877331">Small-time online troll</a> Matan Even snuck on stage at the end of the 2022 ceremony when <em>Elden Ring</em> was crowned Game of the Year. It was confusing and absurd. “I want to nominate this award to my reformed Orthodox Rabbi Bill Clinton,” he said after speeches from the actual developers. The incident’s legacy as the most “this thing is happening live” moment in TGA history was only trumped by just how dumb it turned out to be. Keighley has tightened security in the years since. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2><em>Alan Wake 2</em> dance – The Game Awards 2023</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-ii-2-herald-of-darkness-music-video-musical-1851024833">Recreating the best moment from </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-ii-2-herald-of-darkness-music-video-musical-1851024833">Alan Wake 2</a>,</em> one of the best games of 2023, live on stage was such a brilliant and fun idea that I almost believe Geoff wasn’t involved in that meeting. However this came about, I don’t care, because the end result is <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-alan-wake-2-herald-of-darkness-1851085691">arguably the most joyful moment in the history of the Game Awards</a>. More of this and honoring creators, and less random celebrities and bad jokes, please! – Zack Zwiezen</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/time-person-of-the-year-ai-musk-altman-kalshi-bet-lost-millions-angry-2000652622</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Time Magazine</em> revealed its Person of the Year for 2025. It wasn’t one person, but many different people who are all at the helm of pushing AI technology. This has caused some prediction market gamblers who had bet on AI itself earning the distinction to start yelling a lot online. It’s very funny, but also a horrible glimpse at our bet-on-everything future.</p> <p>On December 11, <a href="https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/"><em>Time Magazine</em> revealed its annual Person of the Year cover</a>. The long-running magazine, whose readership at this point is made up mostly of bored people in waiting rooms, revealed that there wasn’t just one person of the year in 2025, but seven different individuals. <em>Time Magazine</em> refers to these people as the “Architects of AI,” and they include names like Elon Musk, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, and OpenAI boss Sam Altman. Normally, I’d think about who <em>Time</em> picked as the Person of the Year for about 10 seconds and then move on with my life. But this time, who they picked, and the <a href="https://time.com/7339703/ai-architects-person-of-the-year-2025/">use of two different covers,</a> have caused chaos among people who love to bet on everything.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2025 was the year when artificial intelligence’s full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back.</p> <p>For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the… <a href="https://t.co/mEIKRiZfLo">pic.twitter.com/mEIKRiZfLo</a></p> <p>— TIME (@TIME) <a href="https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1999097617633189955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On the prediction market website Kalshi, <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxtime/times-person-of-the-year/kxtime-25">nearly $20 million worth of betting</a> happened over who would be <em>Time</em>‘s Person of the Year. One popular option that many bet on was AI. So when Kalshi called the bet and listed the specific people the magazine had named as the “Architects of AI” as the winners, but not AI itself, a lot of people were angry. They believed that AI was also the winner as it was named directly. Making things more confusing, <em>Time Magazine</em> ran two covers for the Person of the Year issue this year, one featuring the architects, with the other featuring “AI” in massive letters, though the words “The Architects of AI” are still present in the cover’s corner. Still, this cover is more evidence, according to those who bet on AI, that it, too, should be considered a winning outcome in one of the site’s biggest bets of the year.</p>

 <p>“ITS THE ARCHITECTS OF AI THISNIS LITTERALY THE BET FUCK KALSHI,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/9914a9da-54dc-4447-b104-825713e9dff4">posted one angry gambler</a> who bet on AI and lost. “This is actually so freaking stupid,” said <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/0deb1354-478d-4bca-8538-c6e4ce282413">another user</a>.</p> <p>“This pretty clearly should’ve resolved to yes,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/601174f7-f82e-484a-8955-e3e68fd75032">said another upset AI better</a>. “If you bought AI, reach out to Kalshi support because ‘AI’ is literally on the cover and in the title, ‘Architects of AI.’ They’re not going to change anything unless they hear from people.”</p>

 <p>“The cover literally says ‘AI” right on the front. This is insane,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/151a0fb2-e8ef-4964-96ed-5627f7cf1820">said another upset gambler.</a> “fr bro we got screwed,” replied someone else.</p> <p>While I am definitely laughing at how many people lost money betting on <em>Time</em>‘s Person of the Year, I’m also aware that this is our future. This bet-on-everything shit is growing quickly. Sites like Kalshi and Polymarket are letting people gamble on literally anything. And this is just the start. <a href="https://kotaku.com/finance-bro-thinks-it-would-be-cool-to-turn-your-entire-life-into-the-stock-market-2000650201">The CEO of Kalshi recently explained</a> that he wants to “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference of opinion.” In other words, every part of our humanity<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->what we love, believe in, cherish, hope for, fear, etc.<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->in the near future will be something to bet on. That’s only going to make it easier for the <a href="https://pausebeforeyouplay.org/2025/06/online-gambling-is-likely-on-the-rise-at-a-high-school-near-you/">growing number of young people addicted to online gambling</a> to lose even more money. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/volodymyr-zelensky-suit-polymarket-rebellion/">And the arbiters of how these bets are settled and who wins will be tech bros</a>.</p> <p>Good luck, everyone. I place our odds of making it through the AI-powered online gambling future ahead of us pretty low. I’m not taking that bet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-budget-wireless-headphones-just-got-even-cheaper-with-a-nearly-50-priced-like-no-brand-wired-earbuds-2000652308</link>
            <guid>1379911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The market is overflowing with headphones, but does that mean every other option out there is worth your money? Not at all. Those on a budget looking to grab a solid pair – we come bearing good news.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">Amazon just slashed the Sony WH-CH520 wireless headphones by 46%, bringing the price down to just $38</a>. You’re saving $32 on a pair that not only gets you premium, high-quality sound but also offers an incredible battery life. All color options are discounted, so there’s plenty to choose from. Prefer your audio gear minimal? Go for the stunning blue version. Those who want their headphones to have a bit of a personality can consider the pink or yellow options! The retailer is also throwing in a two-month trial to Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Custom Sound Experience</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too crazy going on looks-wise, which is a good thing. The lightweight build features an adjustable headband, paired with swivel earcups that slip on and off gently. The ear pads are soft, plus they come with an additional head cushion and silent joints, making it easy to wear these headphones for an extended period of time. You’ll be able to survive those never-ending commutes, plus boring tasks that otherwise feel unbearable.</p>
<p>Everyone has different sound preferences, and this pair takes care of that. It pushes high-quality, rich audio, but you can further customize the listening experience by tailoring it according to your taste using the EQ Custom feature on the Sony Headphones Connect app. The platform lets you pick from a wide range of presets to match the quality of the sound to what’s playing. Go for a deeper bass for energy-filled tracks, and tone it down when something a bit calmer plays. DSEE support makes it easy to enhance the quality of compressed music files just as well. There’s even a built-in microphone for easy hands-free calling on the go, without having to pull your phone out; great for catching up with friends while travelling, and hopping onto work meetings while sitting in a cafe.</p>



<p>Pairing these Bluetooth headphones with up to two devices at the same time is made possible with Multipoint connection. For instance, if you have them connected to your phone and laptop, you can stream music on the former and quickly switch to the latter when it’s time for a Zoom session. Those losing track of their essentials often will appreciate how you can check the last known location of the headphones in Google’s Find My Device app on your smartphone.</p>
<p>Battery life is significantly better than most other options in this range. You’re looking at around 50 hours of continuous listening on a single charge. That’s more than enough to get through at least a few days without worrying about running out. Running low but don’t have the time to juice them up fully? No sweat. A quick 3-minute top-up gets you an additional 90 minutes of playback!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">There’s a lot more to like about these headphones, especially now at their current price.</a> These offer exceptional battery life and impressive sound, plus let you customize your listening experience according to your preferences. All six colors are discounted, so you can pick the one that fits your aesthetics the best.</p>
