            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="476">If you’ve ever wanted a device that’s easier to handle than a full-sized tablet but still larger and more capable than your phone, the iPad Mini fits perfectly into that sweet spot. It’s designed for people who want portability without giving up power or versatility. Whether you’re a creative professional, a student, or someone who just enjoys relaxing on the couch while scrolling for hours on end, the iPad Mini delivers a balanced experience that works in almost any situation.</p>
<p data-start="478" data-end="806">Right now, the 2024 Apple iPad Mini is even more appealing thanks to a solid discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/">The 128GB device is currently available at 20% off, which means you save $100 off the original $499 price</a>. That brings the cost down to just $399, making it one of the best times to grab Apple’s most compact tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="808" data-end="841">Big Power in a Compact Design</h2>
<p data-start="843" data-end="1253">The iPad Mini features an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display that packs all the quality you expect from an iPad into a smaller, more comfortable form factor. It’s light enough to hold with one hand, making it ideal for reading, browsing, or sketching on the go. The display itself is sharp, vibrant, and designed with ultra-low reflectivity, so it remains easy to see even in bright lighting or outdoor conditions.</p>
<p data-start="1255" data-end="1689">Under the hood, the iPad Mini is powered by Apple’s A17 Pro chip. This processor delivers solid speed and efficiency, allowing the device to handle demanding tasks without slowing down. From multitasking to creative work, everything feels smooth and responsive. Apps launch quickly, transitions are fluid, and performance stays consistent whether you’re editing photos, watching videos, or bouncing back and forth between multiple apps.</p>
<p data-start="1691" data-end="2121">On the front, you’ll find a 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage. This feature is especially useful for video calls on FaceTime, Zoom, or other conferencing apps, as it automatically keeps you centered in the frame—even if you move around or someone else joins you in view. On the back, the 12MP camera supports 4K video recording and makes scanning documents quick and easy.</p>


<p data-start="2123" data-end="2436">Thanks to the A17 chip, the iPad Mini also offers fast Wi-Fi connectivity and smooth performance for everyday tasks like taking notes, marking up documents, editing photos or videos, and even gaming. With iPadOS, you can boost productivity further by running two apps side by side using split-screen multitasking. It runs a number of apps such as Microsoft 365 and Adobe Photoshop, as well as graphics-heavy games, without any issues.</p>
<p data-start="2438" data-end="2949">Optional accessories like the Apple Pencil Pro and Smart Folio (sold separately) enhance the experience even more. The Apple Pencil Pro allowing you to write, draw, or edit with precision, while the Smart Folio protects the screen and doubles as a stand for hands-free viewing.</p>
<p data-start="2951" data-end="3376" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">To top it all off, the iPad Mini is available in four stylish colors—purple, starlight, space gray, and pink. You can also choose between 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage, along with Wi-Fi-only or Wi-Fi + Cellular models. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/">With Wi-Fi-only versions discounted by $100, this sale makes it possible to pick up the latest iPad Mini for as little as $399,</a> making it an excellent value for a powerful, ultra-portable tablet.</p>

              <p>Got yourself some lofty fitness goals as we enter the new year? It’s common to set a news years resolution that involves getting into better shape, but it can be hard to maintain these new routines past the first couple months of the year. The best way to stick to a fitness regimen is by collecting data. Seriously. Getting yourself a good GPS watch can provide you with the health insights and personal coaching that can keep you motivated to hit the gym all year long.</p>
<p>Right now, the Google Pixel Watch 4 is available for a solid discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">The 41mm model (LTE) usually sits at about $450, but Amazon has it marked down to $350 for a short window.</a> That works out to a 22% price cut, putting an extra $100 back in your pocket. Additionally, you can grab the 45mm option also for $100 off, bringing it from $500 to just $400.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="413" data-end="654">The Pixel Watch 4 has a sleek, refined design with the functionality you’d expect from a daily wearable.&nbsp;As a fitness companion, the Google smartwatch functions like a personal coach. It suggests running workouts tailored to your goals, training history, and daily readiness. These customized plans help runners monitor their progress, making it easier to tackle longer distances and improve times. You can even create your own workouts, including warm-ups, cooldowns, and pace targets. Plus, saved runs let you track improvements and set new personal records.</p>
<p data-start="1113" data-end="1316">Beyond fitness, the watch tracks various health metrics like daily readiness scores, cardio load, and the FitBit Morning Brief, which offers insights into your recovery and helps you plan your day ahead. The Pixel Watch 4 also offers useful features like offline Google Maps, the ability to pay with Google Wallet, and seamless integration with other Pixel devices and smart home gadgets like a Google Nest hub.</p>


<h2 data-start="1527" data-end="1562"><strong data-start="1527" data-end="1562">What’s New in the Pixel Watch 4</strong></h2>
<p data-start="1564" data-end="1837">While the changes from the Pixel Watch 3 are subtle, there are some notable upgrades. The most noticeable difference is the curved display. While the Pixel Watch 3 did have curved glass, the screen beneath the glass on the Watch 4 is also curved, giving it a more distinct look.</p>
<p data-start="1839" data-end="1977">Battery life has also improved. The Pixel Watch 4 lasts up to 30 hours with the always-on display or up to 48 hours in Battery Saver mode.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Goes All-In on AirTag Clearance, No Need for Budget Trackers as This 4-Pack Deal Hits All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-all-in-on-airtag-clearance-no-need-for-budget-trackers-as-this-4-pack-deal-hits-all-time-low-2000656018</link>
            <guid>1394260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Find My app is an incredibly useful tool for keeping track of your belongings, and it’s something I’ve personally relied on more times than I’d like to admit. From the time I accidentally left my iPhone at a restaurant to when I forgot my MacBook under a coffee shop table, this app has been a lifesaver. Even when my Apple Watch fell into a river—I didn’t manage to find that one—but the app did confirm the watch was somewhere in that river (I should really keep better care of my stuff). It’s clear that the Find My app is an essential tool for keeping track of your Apple devices. And, if you’ve ever wondered if you could track more than just your iPhone or other Apple products, there’s good news—AirTags are here to help!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>AirTags are tiny, quarter-sized discs that can be attached to almost anything you own, making them just as easy to track as your iPhone or iPad. Whether it’s your keys, wallet, or even a gaming console like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, you can use these clever little gadgets to keep tabs on all your things. One of the most practical uses is for travel. If you’ve ever had your luggage go missing at the airport, placing an AirTag in your checked bags could save you days of stress and confusion.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about picking up some AirTags, Amazon currently has a great deal.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> Normally priced at $99 for a four-pack (which breaks down to about $25 per tag), they’re currently on sale for just $65.</a> This discount of 34% saves you $35, making each AirTag cost just about $16. It’s a pretty solid deal if you want to make sure your most important items are always within reach.</p>
<h2>Couldn’t Be Easier</h2>
<p>Setting up the AirTags is incredibly simple. All you need to do is tap one to your iPhone or iPad, and it will instantly pair with your device. Once connected, the AirTag will appear in the Find My app alongside your Apple devices. From there, you can give each AirTag a specific name to keep track of exactly what it’s attached to—like naming the one in your purse “Purse” or the one on your keys “Keys.” This way, you’ll always know what’s what.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself searching for a lost item around the house and know it’s somewhere nearby, the Find My app lets you trigger the AirTag to play a sound. The AirTag has a built-in speaker that makes it easy to find your lost items, whether they’re buried under a pile of clutter or hidden between the cushions of your couch. It’s a simple but effective way to save time and frustration when you’re on the hunt for your stuff.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ethan Gach’s Top 10 Games Of 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/best-games-2025-silksong-final-fantasy-tactics-9-kings-2000655728</link>
            <guid>1394107</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The thing that surprises me most about these personal GOTY lists, which I’ve been doing most years since I started working at <em>Kotaku</em> (including in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2023-zelda-cyberpunk-baldur-s-gate-3-a-1851130971">delivery room for my third child</a>), is just how little I remember them after they go up. I could guess what was on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gach-s-top-10-games-of-2020-1845962135">2020 list</a>, or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gachs-top-10-games-of-2018-1831323132">2018 one</a>, or my very first one from 2016, but I would probably get half of them wrong.</p> <p>The dirty little secret about these lists, at least for me, is how fluid and ephemeral they are. What was in my top 10 shifted throughout the year and that variance didn’t stop once the list was published. I lock in my choice but always harbor doubts, not just about the games themselves but most of all about my own ambivalent feelings toward them. Those change, evolve, and usually just get more complicated over time.</p>

 <p>Each of those lists would probably be different if I compiled them today. But that’s sort of the point. They are snapshots of what I thought I felt at the time. Maybe they help, even if only slightly, to clarify someone else’s feelings about one of their favorite games of the year. Or, even better, turn them onto something they hadn’t already tried. I know, though, that mostly we all just skim the lists to see how much they overlap with our own, and what we think that says about our own tastes and the other person’s. So if you haven’t already skipped ahead, here are my top games of 2025 in alphabetical order:</p>

 <h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656028"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656028">Sad Socket</figcaption></figure> <p>A beautifully elegant mash-up of minimalist tower defense strategy and roguelike deckbuilding, <em>9 Kings</em> is still in Early Access and already pretty much everything I want it to be. The introduction of a quest mode late in the year basically added an entire second game. Nothing brought me more joy this year than snuggling up on the couch and watching my brain-dead synergies scale in unexpectedly deadly ways.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655381"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655381">Embark Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is the first modern game to get me to break my “no mic with randos” rule. But <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ real trick is just how rewarding it makes playing the multiplayer extraction format as a solo outsider. It does a wonderful job of blending immersive PVE encounters with unpredictable PVP run-ins in a way that adds to the richness of the sci-fi world rather than making it feel like a series of incentive-driven hamster wheels. Solid gunplay, great atmosphere, rewarding progression.</p>

 <h2><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000017750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000017750"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000017750">Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, a tight-knit sci-fi TTRPG, feels practically sprawling compared to the first game. That scope can occasionally get unwieldy or see the game run into pacing issues, but the fusion of dice-roll skill checks and light resource management with branching dialogue and player choice yields an unforgettably grim but evocative voyage through cosmic backwaters on the decline. Never have the stakes been so high for even the most trivial tasks. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> reminded me that letting go is often hard but necessary, and that knowing it isn’t the same thing as actually doing it.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002350"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002350">Image: Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p>Everyone’s favorite French-infused, Unreal Engine 5 reskin of <em>Final Fantasy X</em> is as good as they say. I’m not on board with all of the game’s narrative choices, and I’m less impressed by the apparent novelty of a good JRPG in the year 2025 than some, but<em> Clair Obscur</em> is rock solid in so many departments and sets a new gold-standard for (non-tactical) turn-based combat. The writing and performances are especially superb, and none of it would amount to a hill of beans without the (mostly) excellent soundtrack.</p>

 <h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000896">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If we judged games by merely by the sum of the joy or boredom they produced moment-to-moment, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> would not rank very highly. But games are more than just graphs of the emotions they produce across dozens of hours of playtime.<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is an ambitiously chaotic action platforming collectathon that feels incredibly novel for the first five to eight hours, loses all steam and inventiveness in the second and third acts, and then comes roaring back with one of the best closers of any modern Nintendo game. Could <em>Bananza</em> have been more? Probably. Was it enough? Definitely.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001602">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Nightreign</em> is an excellent action-RPG but a top-notch multiplayer game. It uses the superficial trappings of a <em>Fortnite</em>-like battle royale to completely reinvent open-world exploration, problem solving, and the classic FromSoftware boss fight. It’s less like being thrust into an i-frame boot camp than embarking on a road trip where you know the car will lose a tire, run out of gas, and stall out in the worst possible place, but persevere and the place where you break down in the middle of the night will soon begin to feel like the home you never knew you missed.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The best RPG job system to ever do it, combined with an A-tier story and S-tier music, yields an all-time classic that never fails to prove why so many people are still obsessed with it, whether you give it one hour or 20. The remaster is overly cautious with improvements and stingy with new content, but it avoids the cardinal sin of trying and failing to improve on what was already a masterpiece.</p>

 <h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628704"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628704">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>Last month I went to an Italian restaurant and ordered their Spicy Crab Vodka. The first bite was surprisingly delicious. Every bite after that was equally delicious. The fact that every bite from beginning to end effectively tasted the same did not diminish the dish’s overall effect, or how much I still think about it. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> feels a bit like that. What it lacks in variety or novelty, it more than makes up for with quality, craftmanship, and the confidence to know exactly what it is and be the best version of that. It’s impressively huge and uncompromisingly slick, backed up by great writing and some incredible performances.</p> <h2><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of great 2D action games this year. None of them, in scope, precision, and ambition, ultimately held a candle to <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. It incorporates some of the tried-and-true elements of Metroidvanias and Soulslikes but transforms them into a unique, intimate, at times frustratingly galling journey that asks a lot of you but is generous with its rewards. It’s not perfect, but the flaws it does have only come into focus because of everything else it nails. On my deathbed a snow globe will slip from my hands and crash onto the floor as I mutter the name “Bell Beast.”</p>

 <h2><em>Split Fiction</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000005179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005179">Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s never a good sign when I want to start off an entry with some sort of acknowledgement of a game’s biggest weakness, but maybe it’s a testament to just how insanely smartly designed <em>Split Fiction</em> is that its trite premise and often grating banter did not substantially detract from the whole experience. <em>Split Fiction</em> is so effortlessly good at what it does, it makes it easy to overlook just how infrequent it is to get such a tightly paced, well-balanced action-adventure, particularly one that keeps finding ingenious ways to one-up itself all the way through to the very end.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/these-are-the-guys-who-brought-gta-v-s-thug-trio-to-lif-1333412658">Actor Ned Luke,</a> who portrays Michael De Santa in <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and <em>GTA Online,</em> has been swatted a lot. In fact, he gets swatted so often that in a recent clip going viral online, it appears that he and one of the officers checking on the call know each other by name after so many run-ins.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2651379727?tt_content=full_vod_button&amp;tt_medium=clips_watch_page&amp;t=0h37m32s">during a <em>GTA Online</em> livestream with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> voice actor Rob Wiethoff</a>, Ned Luke was swatted by someone. While Luke played the game live on Twitch, two police officers were invited into his house by someone. One of the officers then yelled out to Luke, “You’re being swatted again!” as he entered the room. Here’s the clip from the December 23 stream as shared by YouTube channel IceBladeNinja.</p>  <div> <p>Swatting is the act of calling the police on someone who is streaming in the hopes that law enforcement will arrest or disrupt the content creator. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting#Injuries_or_deaths_due_to_swatting">It’s a dangerous thing to do</a> in a country like the United States, which has armed officers ready to open fire.</p> <p>This most recent swatting incident for Luke happened about <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nedluke/clip/BloodyEnergeticVanillaHoneyBadger-tg-qEFmBN165JTKk">30 minutes into the stream</a>. After a short and friendly chat with law enforcement, Luke continued broadcasting on Twitch for another hour and a half. Based on publicly posted information from the actor, this appears to be at least the eighth time since late 2023 that the 67-year-old has been swatted while streaming online. That might explain why the police officers in the clip above seem so chill, and one of them appears to be on a first-name basis with the actor.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-michael-actor-ned-luke-swatted-while-playing-on-thanksgiving-stream">In November 2023, on Thanksgiving,</a> Luke was swatted. He posted about the incident online, <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1728128625734742489">claiming it was the sixth time</a> it had happened to him due to his private details, like his address, being leaked online in the past. <a href="https://gamevro.com/ned-luke-gta-5-voice-actor-swatted-again-livestream/">On December 29, 2023</a>, Luke was once again swatted, this time with police officers calling him and asking the actor to step outside. ‘</p> <p>Hopefully Luke won’t have to put up with frequent swatting in the future. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSv1RJVkezG/">On December 27, the actor posted on Instagram</a> that at least one person involved with swatting him was now facing federal charges and would be in court in January of 2026 over their alleged swatting activity. “Fuck around and find out,” said Luke on Instagram. “Many more names discovered and provided.”</p> </div>

              <p>Valve has revealed the official list of best-selling games on Steam for 2025. They include everything you’d expect, plus a few surprises. <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> ended up beating out <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and others for a spot in the top dozen, despite being recently labeled as one of the worst PC ports of the year by <em>Digital Foundry</em>.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025">full list of the top 24 best-selling new Steam games,</a> broken up into two sections. The games within the sections are in no particular order. First, the top 12:</p> <ul> <li><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></li> <li><em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em></li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 26 </em></li> <li><em>Borderlands 4 </em></li> <li><em>Schedule I </em></li> <li><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></li> <li><em>Civilization VII </em></li> <li><em>Battlefield 6 </em></li> <li><em>Dune Awakening </em></li> <li><em>Arc Raiders </em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em></li> </ul> <p>And numbers 13-24:</p> <ul> <li><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em></li> <li><em>Dispatch </em></li> <li><em>Dying Light: The Beast </em></li> <li><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana </em></li> <li><em>Europa Universalis V </em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em></li> <li><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></li> <li><em>Split Fiction </em></li> <li><em>Inzoi </em></li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em></li> <li><em>Stellar Blade </em></li> <li><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></li> </ul> <p>The list includes the big blockbusters, but also more hardcore historical strategy games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em></a> and <em>Europa Universalis V</em>. I was surprised to see <em>Civilization 7</em> in the top 12 despite its launch woes and fan discontent around some of the new features and the content-light end game. But then again, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> secured a top spot as well despite miserable user ratings as fans await still much-needed optimization patches.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s action-RPG also made <em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s list of the worst PC ports of 2025. The technical analysts there still seem flummoxed by how badly the game runs, even after its latest Title 4 Update, and even as the publisher’s upcoming work like <em>Pragmata</em> and <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> appears to be doing just fine on the platform. “Definitely one of the poorest games I’ve reviewed in a long time from a technical performance perspective,” Alex Battaglia said during the outlet’s <a href="https://youtu.be/s3_0yhXDKTs">annual look back video</a>.</p>

 <p>Capcom has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579">bigger performance improvements in 2026</a>, but even those will be spread out across a couple of months. It’ll be the one-year anniversary of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ launch and PC players will still be waiting to see if the game will finally be passable on that platform or if it’ll continue to run with framerate hitching and texture pop-in, among other issues.</p>
