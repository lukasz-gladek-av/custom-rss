HBO’s approach to <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s story has stripped away a lot of the mystery and tension present in the game, but I do want to give some props to the team behind the show for faithfully recreating one of the best moments in Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic drama, even if it showed up much earlier than fans were probably expecting.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Future Days,” the first episode of season two, takes place almost entirely in the Jackson settlement that Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) have been living in for the past five years. The two have found places in the community of survivors protected from the infected horde, though Ellie is clearly jaded toward the notion of working with others for a larger purpose. To her, all these town walls do is keep her from reaching her true potential as someone who can fight against the infected, and she cares little for most of the civilians in this town. The one person she does seem to care about is Dina, played by Isabela Merced in the show. The two girls are best friends, and it’s clear that Ellie harbors some feelings for Dina, and every now and then, she gets a sense that it might not be one-sided.</p><p>Years of romantic tension between the two bubbles over at a dance in Jackson. Ellie is a wallflower, while Dina is the life of the party, dancing to Crooked Still’s “Little Sadie” and putting on a show. Then things start to slow down as the folk group’s melancholy, religious ballad “Ecstasy” begins to play. Dina drags a hesitant Ellie to the dance floor, and they begin to slow dance.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting to see this scene recreated in the show this early, as this moment originally appears as a flashback in the final hours of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. But before the game launched in 2020, the dance was one of the first scenes we ever saw, being featured at an E3 presentation way back in 2018. Even before I met Dina when I finally played the game two years later, I was already captivated by her effect on Ellie. This was an older version of the girl we’d met in the original game, and it was clear that everything she’d been through had left her more world-weary, perhaps aging her as much as the passage of time itself. Dina, meanwhile, was downright chipper, comparatively. She is playful where Ellie is always on guard, and she brings out those sparks of passion and excitement in Ellie that seemed to have been drained from her.</p><p>This moment on the dance floor is one of the best snapshots of the two’s dynamic, and I was frankly terrified that it would fall victim to the show’s inferior writing style. As I’ve laid out in my review of season two and recap of the first episode, I can’t stand the show’s tendency to overexplain and justify every action and thought these characters have. It gets downright painful for me to watch in some episodes, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the show kept this exchange almost exactly as it was in the PlayStation 4 game.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Ellie: Every guy in this room is staring at you right now.</p><p>Dina: Maybe they’re staring at you.</p><p>Ellie: They’re not.</p><p>Dina: Maybe they’re jealous of you?</p><p>Ellie: No reason to be. I’m not a threat.</p><p>Dina: Oh, Ellie. I think they should be terrified of you.</p></blockquote><p>Then Dina kisses Ellie in the middle of the dance floor. Sure, I might not like the way the show’s actors deliver these lines as much I love the way they’re said in the game, but even so, the back and forth does such an excellent job of illustrating Ellie’s beaten-down self-esteem. She doesn’t think Dina could ever view her this way, even though they are leaving no room for Jesus as they sway back and forth together. Dina, meanwhile, tells Ellie that she is so much more than she realizes, even though she doesn’t see it. If words aren’t enough to convince her, maybe actions will be.</p><p>Ellie will chalk the flirtation and the kiss up to drunken shenanigans on Dina’s part for a bit, further showing how deep her insecurity goes; even when she’s liplocked with a girl, she still doesn’t believe she can have this. But, then, Ellie has had nearly everything she’s ever wanted taken from her, so why would she believe this situation with Dina could be any different? How she handles that is a thread we’ll unravel as the season (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">or multiple seasons, rather</a></span>) continues, but at this moment, she gets what she wants, and she can start to believe that someone in this town sees her as something more than the angry girl who lives with Joel.</p><figure id="" data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The moment is cut short, however, as the town bigot Seth (Robert John Burke) interrupts the moment of ecstasy with judgemental scolding and a slur for good measure. Joel intervenes and shoves him to the ground, which leads Ellie to lash out in embarrassment. The two clearly have some baggage to unpack, but that’s a conversation for another episode.</p><p>Most of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season just made me appreciate the original game all the more for its stellar performances and understated writing. The dance scene had a similar effect, but it was also a nice break from all the overexplaining and monologuing that plague the show. Sometimes, the script you started with is perfect and doesn’t need any additional notes. Though they are few and far between, I’m glad that <em>The Last of Us </em>has at least a few moments where it recognizes that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The protagonist is facing the camera and glancing to the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>is nothing if not a power fantasy. Fighting thousands of grunts at once is fun in and of itself, but soaking up loads of skill points and experience points to unlock consistently stronger abilities makes the game hard to put down. That said, while <em>Origins </em>isn’t necessarily complex, its leveling system is idiosyncratic enough that I had to use the word idiosyncratic to describe it. This was always how I imagined I’d use my English degree.</p><p>To be clear, <strong><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>doesn’t necessitate any kind of level grinding to succeed</strong>. Even on the “Hero” hard mode, I didn’t feel like I ever lacked for power in most battles (especially since it’s easy to lower the difficulty if you encounter a battle that’s giving you trouble). Having said that, leveling up and becoming stronger is a core part of the <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>experience. Trust me, you’re going to need that power if you aim for 100% completion. So to help you on your journey as the Guardian of Peace, here are five tips that will help you accrue strength as fast as possible. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3489b67d886d08b9bf825955655b4ed7" data-recommend-id="image://3489b67d886d08b9bf825955655b4ed7" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the equipment screen from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist has wheel weapons equipped" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>The fundamental rule of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>’ leveling system is that your weapon types—not your protagonist—gains experience</strong>. The more you level up all your available weapon types, the more stat increases and skill boards you’ll unlock. </p><p>Weapons <em>can </em>still earn a modicum of passive experience if you don’t use them. However, to best maximize your power, <strong>you should use your weapons as evenly as you can</strong>. You’ll inevitably feel more comfortable with some weapon types over others, so I recommend saving your best weapons for major story battles while you use the armaments you’re least confident with during side missions or less eventful stages. Weapons require exponentially more experience points to level up as they grow in rank, so don’t let your growth plateau just because you only want to use swords. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8758eedd641c4a0c2d79ba3c0e4fbbac" data-recommend-id="image://8758eedd641c4a0c2d79ba3c0e4fbbac" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the map screen in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Like, of course you’ll get stronger if you complete optional missions, welcome to virtually every video game ever made. That said, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>doesn’t always make its side objectives obvious—and you’ll want to complete <em>all </em>of them if you’re looking for total completion and a shiny platinum trophy. Even bond events can lead to optional challenges you can complete for an infusion of skill points, and most of these are easy to accomplish in the background while you play the main story.</p><p>To make sure you don’t miss anything, I recommend opening up your map screen after major story battles to see if anything new has popped up. Also make sure to keep checking back at the inn to see if you’ve gotten more mail, since that can lead to more optional content as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55ae1cc107e16daad02c516314291ab6" data-recommend-id="image://55ae1cc107e16daad02c516314291ab6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Sure, just gunning for the immediate objectives to complete a mission will get you to victory faster. However, if you take the time to make a dent in a dense mob of small fry, you’ll rack up rewards way faster.</p><p>With that in mind, if you do decide to grind via skirmishes, <strong>aim for battles that involve a large force</strong> to optimize your KO count. Battle Arts that inflict wide area-of-effect damage around you will help out a lot here, especially if you can use attacks that inflict huge damage on enemy commanders while you simultaneously clear the field. You don’t necessarily need to go wild on every pack of commander-less enemies you see on the battlefield. However, at least making a quick dent on packs of foes as you see them will net you a modest chunk of EXP.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a0ae0787e6600784ad472b4feea24fc" data-recommend-id="image://2a0ae0787e6600784ad472b4feea24fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist is entering an enemy base as rain falls down on him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you progress into the later stages of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, you’ll eventually find accessories that boost your rewards from battle at the cost of taking 100% increased damage. These are the <strong>Amulet of Fortune</strong>, <strong>Amulet of Means</strong>, and the <strong>Amulet of Merit</strong>. On the surface, these items can be very helpful. After all, who would say no to bonus money, skill points, and/or weapon drops?</p><p>However, <strong>the amulets are so risky to use that I only recommend using them if you’re playing missions you know you can easily steamroll</strong>. That increased damage adds up more than you might expect, and if you need to retry missions or retreat to chase down meat buns, you’re not really speeding up your gains. And that’s without considering that every accessory slot used on an amulet is an accessory slot that <em>isn’t </em>used to improve your battle prowess.</p><p>Similarly, <strong>the training weapons which increase your proficiency gains are also kind of a trap</strong>. The logic is the same as above; even if you’re dying for the increased experience points, training weapons are so much weaker than your other available armaments that the benefits are kind of negated. After all, if using the weapons makes every enemy take longer to defeat, is it really speeding up your grind? You do need to purchase all of them if you’re gunning for 100% completion, and they can be useful if you’re replaying super easy missions, so they’re not a waste to purchase. However, if you’re in this boat, you’d be better off if you…  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60654b150c5dbdb7cf281abc34f77e77" data-recommend-id="image://60654b150c5dbdb7cf281abc34f77e77" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Video games should be fun, first and foremost. Gaming the settings to maximize your gains should be a secondary objective.</p><p>Having said that, once you’re in a level grind mindset (because you want to get stronger or you’re progressing through postgame), the difficulty settings become an invaluable tool for your progression. Hero mode—the standard hard mode— awards a small amount of extra rewards if you select it, so it’s a no-brainer to select if you can handle a little extra intensity. I found most of the game to be perfectly surmountable with the difficulty turned up on a first playthrough, albeit with some exceptions (my first time in Chibi was <em>not </em>fun).</p><p>Once you’re in postgame, however, your priorities will change. <strong>Ultimate Warrior is the postgame-exclusive difficulty option, and it dishes out substantially greater rewards per battle than even Hero mode with a slew of amulets and training weapons equipped</strong>. It is a huge jump in level requirement, so you might not be able to jump into it right away after one playthrough. However, once you feel you can comfortably handle it (It starts getting pretty feasible after level 60), Ultimate Warrior is easily the best way to increase your power. You’ll need to play through the story multiple times to get all the endings anyway, so don’t sweat it too much if you can’t quite handle the optional challenges that Ultimate Warrior unlocks.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you want to take things easy, there’s nothing wrong with tuning the difficulty down to the easy Historian difficulty to blast through certain challenges. Sure, you sacrifice certain rewards. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-how-to-beat-lu-bu-chapter-2-1851765372&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-how-to-beat-lu-bu-chapter-2-1851765372">if you’ve already mastered fighting Lu Bu</a></span>, you’ll be forgiven for wanting to just bypass him on subsequent playthroughs!</p><hr><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
