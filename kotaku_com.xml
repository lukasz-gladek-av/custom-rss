The first toggle you’ll see is for Smart Steering. Those who played the previous entry likely remember what this means. Anyone who’s jumping into the <em>Mario Kart</em> series for the first time or in a long while is out of luck, since there isn’t any explanation as to what this does.</p><p><strong>Smart Steering is an assistant feature that’s meant to keep you from driving off the edge of a course.</strong> You’ll find yourself being tugged back along the track whenever you get too close to an edge or wall. Visually, it’s represented by a small antenna on the back of your kart that lights up when the feature is activated.</p><figure id="" data-id="ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-recommend-id="image://ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-recommend-id="image://ad8fb29dab13132f2b916460b32076e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Settings/Controller menu, highlighting the Smart Steering option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Newer and younger players alike are sure to enjoy Smart Steering’s assistance. However, <strong>enabling this does come with caveats. The obvious setback is that you’ll be unable to perform up to the second level of your mini-turbo</strong>. Not having access to the third and strongest drift boost is a huge detriment when playing online or even in 150cc. Just as challenging is that Smart Steering’s corrections can ruin some of your drifts and make it difficult to take off-road shortcuts. I’ve also experienced a bit of awkwardness when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648">trying to Rail Ride</a></span>. As helpful as this feature is, you might enjoy playing without it once you’ve become more familiar with <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><h2 id="h53540"><a id=""></a>What is Auto-Accelerate?</h2><p>Directly underneath the Smart Steering option is Auto-Accelerate. This one might be easier to guess, but it’s still pretty vague without a proper definition. <strong>Auto-Accelerate is an assistant feature that constantly keeps the Accelerate input triggered.</strong> Considering that you’re likely pressing down on the A button 99% of the time anyway, this probably sounds like a dream for accessibility reasons or even if you find your thumb getting sore.</p><p>I’d argue this feature is much more of a convenience option that you could use for as long as you play. That being said, it’s not without some problems. <strong>Continuously accelerating means you can’t brake as effectively or go in reverse</strong>. These are minor issues that can be mitigated with experience over time, but they’re still worth taking into account.</p><p>The best part with either of these features is that they can be toggled with a quick visit to the Options menu. Go ahead and experiment whenever you want to make adjustments to your driving ability!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has since been sold for a “best offer,” so the final price is unclear, but according to the third-party tool 130point it may have been closer to $40,000.

Well, the launch frenzy has made Final Fantasy one of the hardest sets to actually participate in as a fan, just as its popularity hits new heights. Play booster boxes are sold out most places, and the collector’s boosters are pretty much only available from resellers at this point for extreme markups. </p><p>Even big box stores <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-x-secret-lair-mtg-sold-out-ebay-reprint-1851784230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-x-secret-lair-mtg-sold-out-ebay-reprint-1851784230">are turning to scalping</a></span>.

While reprints are expected as soon as July, and should continue for a while given the<em> Final Fantasy</em> expansion is part of MTG’s standard set of cards (and thus legal in all tournament play), the difficulty of not only finding cards at the moment, but actually being able to afford them, has been a bit of a buzzkill. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But while this tutorial-focused title should’ve probably just been included with the Nintendo Switch 2, it may still be worth buying for certain folks who will benefit from learning more about their new system. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Whether you’re a long-time gamer or new to the hobby, you’re probably curious about how long <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> will take to beat and whether it’s even worth that price tag. Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="h54556"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, and is it worth buying?</h2><p>Alright, let’s get real for a second. Much of <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> is just reading and following prompts or engaging in simplistic mini-games, so it’s more of an interactive exhibit than a game you “beat.” But if your goal is to check off plenty of tutorial segments and get some of the medals in the mini-games, <strong>you’ll be able to squeeze a few hours of fun out of this strange little game</strong>.</p><p>For the $10 price tag, <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> provides a pretty solid look at all of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features. There’s a whole lot of useful stuff you can learn here, and it’s delivered in a bright and colorful package that certainly feels very “Nintendo” in design. But at the end of the day, it’s a glorified tutorial, meaning that its worth will be largely determined by whether you feel like you need help learning how everything works.</p><p>With this in mind, gaming enthusiasts who likely knew how every feature works on the Switch 2 before they even got their hands on one aren’t likely to benefit greatly from the information in <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>—though it’s worth noting that some of the mini-games can be fun. Younger or less experienced players may enjoy learning how to make the most of their new hardware, especially things like Joy-Con functionality and attachment, or even general safety.</p><p>We don’t want kids trying to eat the Joy-Cons, after all. They taste terrible anyway. Or so I hear. I wouldn’t know, of course. Can we move on?</p><p>Anyway, the bottom line is that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would have made a great pack-in title, but it still may be worth the $10 for particular demographics. So, just make your decision based on your gaming experience and whether you enjoy quirky mini-games. As for me, I think I’ll be ripping some <em>Mario Kart World</em> instead.</p><p>If <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> sounds like a worthwhile purchase for you, it’s available now exclusively for, well, Nintendo Switch 2. It’s literally in the name. Don’t be weird.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Others, such as those who genuinely don’t care about the tale, will complete it in much less time.</p><p><strong>I have a few buddies who rented a server for the Advanced Access release, and they finished the main portion of the game in under 30 hours by rushing</strong>. But that means playing the game with no exploration, no additional ruins or combat encounters, just mainlining the story. Why?

The new Everdark Sovereign version, however, takes the encounter to 11 the entire time. </p><p>He almost never stops moving, constantly shooting out lightning blasts and ground AOE bursts. At one point he summons a giant whirlwind storm, and players have to use jumping pads to hop over top if they don’t want to immediately get downed.
