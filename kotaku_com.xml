              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678">Superhero workplace comedy game <em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit this year, already selling over a million copies since launching in October. And the fandom around the game is ravenous, with many players deeply invested in the narrative-driven adventure game’s romances. This caught the devs off guard, and might lead to some cut sex scenes returning in some form.</p> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">In a new interview with <em>Inverse</em>,</a>&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em> writer Pierre Shorette talked about how the game came together over the last few years and was asked about fans going wild over the few relationship and romance options in the superhero game developed by some former Telltale folks.</p>  <p>“I don’t know that I anticipated it to be as ravenous as it’s been,” said Shorette of the fan reaction. “It’s probably why we didn’t plan for more romance options, because we didn’t know it was going to be such a meaningful part of the experience for folks.” Shorette explained that he often defaults to romantic comedy when writing and has tried to resist this tendency, but romance was never an intentional focus of <em>Dispatch.</em> Rather, it was just one of the many parts of the game. Still, seeing the fans react to the romance and sex that exist in the game has Shorette wondering if they made a mistake.</p> <p>“We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn’t have,” Shorette told the outlet. “Maybe folks will get to see those one day.”</p> <p>“There isn’t anyone on the development team that wouldn’t have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way. We’re still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it’s doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often, with these games, is branching too.”</p> <p>Regardless, <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-dialogue-options-chair-episode-3-golem-choice-2000640791"><em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit, with fans begging the devs for another season. And that might just happen. But for now, Shorette and the team at Ad Hoc Studios are just happy people like <em>Dispatch</em> so much.&nbsp; All eight episodes of <em>Dispatch</em> are out now on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/16-cool-details-about-valve%E2%80%99s-new-steam-console-controller-and-vr-headset.1351885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">Valve announced not one, not two, but three new pieces of video game hardware</a>: The console-like Steam Machine, the Steam Frame VR headset, and the Steam Controller. All of this stuff launches sometime in 2026 (<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">price unknown</a>) and works together, alongside the Steam Deck, to create what is shaping up to be an impressive Steam ecosystem that rivals anything from Xbox, PlayStation, Apple, or Nintendo.</p>

 <p>But announcing three pieces of gaming hardware in one day means there are a lot of information and interviews floating around. So I’ve read through all of it, as well as all of Valve’s own posts, to narrow down 16 interesting, cool, important, and fun details about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is bringing back Xbox 360-like faceplates</h2> <p>Valve’s new Steam console features a removable faceplate that reminds me a lot of the Xbox 360 faceplates from back in the day. Sadly, the company doesn’t sound committed to selling different plates, but they will be sharing all the files needed to 3D print your own. So I expect a lot of third-party plates will be available after launch. Oh, and Valve, you should totally sell this e-ink plate, please!</p>   <h2>Valve wants every game running at 4K60 on Steam Machine</h2> <p>“Our benchmark has always been that it should have enough performance to play every game on Steam at 4K60 when you do some sort of upscaling like FSR,” Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/steam-machine-specs-availability/">told<em> PC Gamer.</em></a> That’s a pretty big promise and likely will mean some newer, Unreal Engine 5 games will need to have their settings lowered a lot. But games from a few years ago, indie titles, and other similar titles should run like a dream on the device.</p>

 <h2>You can easily expand Steam Machine’s storage and even change the RAM</h2> <p>Valve has designed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">Steam Machine</a> to let you add more SSD storage easily if you so desire. You can also slap in a fast, high-performance SD Card to add more storage. And for those willing to open the console up a bit more, you can even replace the RAM, though Valve says this will be tricky and likely not something most people do.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is reportedly very, very quiet</h2> <p>According to <em>PC Gamer</em>, the Steam Machine is very quiet. Even while playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and standing close to the Steam console, it barely made any noise.</p> <h2>It’s also just a computer, if you want</h2> <p>Similar to the Steam Deck, Valve has designed the Steam Machine to be usable as a computer. Hook it up to a monitor, connect a mouse and keyboard, and you have a beefy little Linux-powered desktop PC that can run Steam and other software easily.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643621"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643621">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can wirelessly connect four Steam Controllers to the Steam Machine</h2> <p>Want to play a game with your pals on the Steam Machine? Well, good news: It supports four Steam Controllers at once without needing any extra dongles. Nifty stuff!</p> <h2>Steam Machine can run Windows, if you like that kind of thing</h2> <p>If you’re someone who prefers gaming on Windows, you can swap out SteamOS for Windows 11 and run that operating system instead. I wouldn’t recommend doing this, but hey, I’m not your dad.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine will be available in every country where the Steam Deck is sold</h2> <p>If you can legally buy a Steam Deck where you live now, you’ll be able to buy a Steam Machine, Frame, and Controller when they launch globally in 2026. Here’s the list of countries where the Steam Deck is currently for sale:</p> <ul id="658bd5bd-5531-4e7a-8de2-8daaef2adc91"> <li>USA</li> <li>Canada</li> <li>UK</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>France</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>Japan</li> <li>South Korea</li> <li>Taiwan</li> <li>Hong Kong</li> </ul> <h2>The Steam Deck, Controller, and Frame VR headset all work together</h2> <p>Valve is making a big deal about how all of these new Steam devices work together and connect in various ways. So you can, for example, stream a newer game from your Steam Machine to your Steam Deck. Or play a Steam Deck favorite of yours natively on the Steam Frame headset while using the Steam Controller completely wirelessly. And of course, all your Steam games and progress hop around seamlessly between every device.</p>

 <h2>Steam Controller’s thumbsticks sound very fancy</h2> <p>The Steam Controller includes <a href="https://tmrjoystick.com/">Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) thumbsticks,</a> which are even better, more reliable, and more precise than Hall Effect sticks.&nbsp;“They’re super responsive, meaning that we’re able to lower the default dead zone by more than half. And super reliable. They’ll keep drift at bay much, much, much longer. These things are super great,” Steve Cardinali, an engineer at Valve, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/steam-controller-specs-availability-hands-on/">told <em>PC Gamer.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>The Steam Controller fully supports gyro aiming</h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/how-gyro-support-was-added-into-the-new-steam-controller-is-a-typical-valve-story/">Here’s a fun story:</a> The Steam Controller features full gyroscopic control because one person at Valve is way into gyro aiming and moved his desk into the same place the device was being designed to help get the feature in the gamepad. All you fans of gyro aiming should thank that person if you get the chance.</p> <h2>Steam Frame is basically a Steam Deck on your face</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000643622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643622">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While they don’t run on the same hardware, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe">Steam Frame VR headset</a> runs the same OS as the Steam Deck and should feel familiar to anyone who has played Valve’s portable PC. And because it’s a standalone device that runs SteamOS natively, all your Steam Deck games can be played on it in a big virtual theater.</p>

 <h2>The new VR headset is built for streaming, so no more wires</h2> <p>While you can plug a Steam Frame into a computer, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/hands-on-steam-frame-impressions/">Valve has designed the device to be totally wireless</a>. It uses a dedicated 6 GHz connection via an included USB dongle to make sure your game is streamed perfectly to the headset. Those who have tried it out say it’s flawless, and the lack of cables is freeing in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>All Steam Deck Verified games will instantly be Steam Machine Verified</h2> <p>Valve is expanding its Verified program with the launch of all this new hardware. So now games can be Steam Deck, Steam Machine, and/or Steam Frame Verified. And because the Steam Machine is so much more powerful than the Steam Deck and supports a controller experience, Valve is automatically marking all Steam Deck Verified games as Steam Machine Verified. That means this device will launch in 2026 with a shit-ton of games that should, in theory, just play without issue on it.</p> <h2>You can stream games from the Steam Machine to the Steam Deck</h2> <p>While someone is watching TV, you can use the Steam Machine to play a newer, more taxing game on your Steam Deck wirelessly via streaming. It’s like the Wii U is back, but actually good.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-was-so-close-to-being-something-special.1351837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A funny thing happens when you stir up enough trouble in the tiny, open-world portions of <i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i>. If you indulge in showing off your uber vampiric parkour abilities and wield your other powers too openly, the music intensifies and sirens, followed by the sound of a helicopter, surround you as you, hopefully, are trying to hide. At first, it instills a sense of urgency, a panic. You have to find somewhere in the not-so-sprawling map of Seattle to hide away. The need to run, to disappear into the shadows, it’s kind of fun.</p>

 <p>The thing is, there are no police cars with sirens blazing. Stop and look: There are no helicopters. You’ll reach a game over screen if you continue to violate the vampiric code of silence known as the Masquerade, but aside from cops on the streets opening fire on you (who are hardly a threat given that you’re literally a 400-year-old vampire), so much of the sense of danger around you is nothing more than a shallow facade. It makes an otherwise beautiful slice of Seattle in snowy winter feel completely hollow.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643612" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643612"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643612">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Equally deflating, there are no lasting consequences for feeding on humans, killing them quietly, or indulging in your violent vampiric side.</p> <p>In the tabletop roleplaying game on which <i>Bloodlines 2</i> is based, players whose characters are vampires have to balance the bestial nature of vampirism with their efforts to hang onto what’s left of their humanity. It’s a core game mechanic, with a “humanity” meter that can grow or shrink depending on your actions. But it’s also fodder for the central themes of <i>VtM</i>, which many come to the game for: at what point are you no longer human? How and when have you fully given into the monster inside you that hungers, eternally so?</p>

 <p>There’s no hunger meter in <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, at least not one that reflects the concerns you have in the tabletop roleplaying game where your actions have an impact on the world around you as well as yourself. In <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, you’ll need to feed on humans if you’ve used too many powers in combat, but never does the game require you to concern yourself with the ethics of how you satiate that hunger.</p>

 <p>And sure, those vampiric powers can be a lot of fun. You can zip around enemies, snap their necks, telepathically pick up their guns to fire back at your enemies, toy with their minds by instilling fear or a sense of self-destruction, or even summon blades of blood to shoot at your foes. That part can be very cool.</p>

 <p>But the fun of that loop is fleeting at best and you’re left with nothing but a hollow diorama set in the world of <i>VtM</i>’s rich lore.</p> <p>That’s why it’s even more disappointing that, despite that fake feeling of the world around you, despite a game loop that tires quickly, there’s so much that <i>Bloodlines 2</i> does well that it feels like an undead variant of a better game that somehow withered away in its developmental slumber.</p>

 <h2>The soul of something vibrant trapped in a lifeless husk</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000643609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643609"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643609">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s sort of poetic that <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s protagonist, Phyre, is a 400-year-old vampire only recently awoken from a deep sleep, unsure of the reality they now live in. <i>Bloodlines 2</i> itself had a rough previous life, and it seems equally unsure of itself. The original <i>Bloodlines</i>, released in a shoddy state in 2004, required the work of countless modders and <i>VtM</i> enthusiasts to mold it into something acceptable. It remains a wonky game to this day.</p>

 <p>The sequel, as you may know, saw its first developer, Hardsuit Labs, dismissed from the project. The remains were picked up by <i>Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</i> developer The Chinese Room, as they used assets created by HSL and crafted an entirely new story set in a very small slice of Seattle.</p> <p>As we speak, those old assets and build materials from HSL’s work on the game have leaked out, and are leading many to speculate that something better was lost.</p>    <p>The speculation is fun, no doubt, but I think it also distracts from talking about the actual product that exists, what it fails to achieve and what it manages to do well. And going by the writing in <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, it’s clear that this could’ve been an excellent video game.</p>

 <p>There’s a lot to say about the story and writing of <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, how well it handles <i>VtM</i>’s themes and lore, how the Johnny-Silverhand-of-a-situation that Phyre and the co-protagonist who lives in their head find themselves in sparks great dialogue (and excellent voice performances) and narrative direction. But I often find myself thinking about a particular NPC named Patience, a Toreador clan vampire who I consider a brilliant take on the obsessed artist archetype.</p> <p>Patience is almost always found in the backroom of a pawn shop which is owned by another fascinating character, Niko Anelov. In most <i>VtM</i> media, Toreadors are portrayed as upper-class divas, obsessed with themselves and their objects of desire. There’s literally a mechanic for this in the TTRPG: a Toreador can become fixated on what they find beautiful to the point where their monstrous nature enables them to do horrible things in pursuit of having that beauty.</p>

 <p>It’s common enough that those beautiful objects are “high art,” or things that many would regard as conventionally beautiful or sexually attractive. Patience, as a Toreador, is very obsessed in a similar way, but it’s trash that calls to them, the trash left behind at a pawn shop specifically. They wish to collect it and work with it as a kind of found media, seeing beauty in the act of something left behind, forgotten, misplaced, discarded. On one hand, it’s refreshing to see a character like this. On the other, Patience could be viewed as an egotistical hipster scrounging up garbage to masquerade as art, not quite unlike the stuffy elite Toreadors holed up in art galleries and opera houses. Who are they really? I love that riddle about them.</p> <p>I tend to prefer Malkavian clan types myself, but this Toreador? One conversation with them sees Phyre ruminating over whether Patience’s art is about “mortality” or “individualism.” It’s the kind of moment I love in a good tabletop game of <i>VtM</i>. Yes, there’s the gory lore and the sex and the thrill of being powerful, but stopping to ask a vampire artist if their work, which they will continue to toil away with for eternity, is a statement of their own individuality or a commentary on the nature of death? That’s what I’m here for. Those are the deep, endless riddles that I love cracking open with the sharp object that is the vampire as metaphor.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000643608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643608"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643608">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But alas, Patience, my beautiful trash Toreador, will just stand around in the world, lifeless, unless I talk to them. And the quest they give me? It’s just to collect some items which, while they’re connected to the story, feel like a Ubisoft-ified collect-a-thon. I’ve gathered all the items they requested, but these knickknacks don’t appear in their studio, or on their work. It was all just a checkmark on the game’s map.</p>

 <p>Lifeless, hollow, I leave Patience to do their work of…standing there, as I return to the equally lifeless sirens and helicopters of Seattle. The world will blare sirens at you that don’t exist, and Patience will speak of a vibrant, countercultural artistic practice you rarely see outside of what exists in a permanent, rigid state in their studio.</p> <p>I’ve yet to cross the finish line on <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s story. I feel compelled to do so because the characters are excellent, and the way it’s using the lore of <i>Vampire: The Masquerade </i>and the thematic nature of the vampire has potential. But the execution, that’s the stake through the heart.</p>
