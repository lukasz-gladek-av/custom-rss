              <p>The Nintendo Switch is home to a number of games in <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> franchise, such as the award-winning open-world adventures of <i>Breath of the Wild</i> and <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>, the inventive Zelda-starring <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i>, and quite a few classic titles via a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Last but not least, we even got a remake of a sometimes-underrated entry: <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i>.</p> <p>Though it sports an all-new chibi art style and some basic quality-of-life features, such as improved menu navigation and button mapping features, <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i> on Nintendo Switch maintains the integrity of the 1993 Game Boy to ensure that both new and returning fans can enjoy the fourth game in the series just as it’s always been.</p> <p>And with everything intact just as you’d expect, you can be certain that you’re getting a game with the same runtime as the original, too. But just how long is <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i> on Nintendo Switch? And does it run any better on Switch 2? Let’s get into it.</p>

 <h2>How does <i>Link’s Awakening </i>run on Switch 2?</h2> <p>Unlike <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>, and many other original Switch titles, <i>Link’s Awakening</i> doesn’t have a specific Switch 2 upgrade you can purchase. But that’s not to say the game didn’t receive any love when Nintendo’s new console dropped. On June 3, 2025, <i>Link’s Awakening</i> got a patch that optimizes the game’s visuals, upping the resolution and improving HDR support.</p> <p><i>Link’s Awakening</i> also ran into some troublesome framerate issues on the original Switch. Running on Switch 2, however, the issue has been dramatically improved, if not fixed entirely. So if you’re waiting on upgrading to a Switch 2 before diving into this remake, your patience will be rewarded with improved performance. Check out a direct comparison <a href="https://youtu.be/e2kBayO4bqY">here</a>:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Zelda: Link's Awakening - Switch/Switch 2 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2kBayO4bqY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>How long is <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i>?</h2> <p><b><i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i></b><b> will take the average player between 12-15 hours</b> to reach the credits. Much of this time will be spent solving puzzles, talking to NPCs, and tracking down useful items required to complete your journey. But that doesn’t include finding every heart piece and seashell, finishing every trading sequence, or engaging with other optional tasks.</p>

 <p>If you’re wanting to collect all of that stuff and see every bit of additional content, <b>you’ll be looking at closer to 20-25 hours of play time in </b><b><i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i></b>. That’s a whole hell of a lot of Hyrulian fun, but it’ll require some patience (or a nifty guide), as there are some well-hidden secrets to be found throughout this bright and colorful version of Hyrule.</p> <p>If you’re on the fence about this one, just remember that it’s a remake of a Game Boy game, for better and worse. It offers some memorable dungeons, a unique tale, and toy-like visuals that will appeal to newcomers and returning fans alike. But its fairly linear structure and occasionally frustrating old-school design philosophy may be a little polarizing, sticking out even more to those introduced to the franchise during the <i>Breath of the Wild</i> era.</p> <p>If <i>The</i> <i>Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </i>sounds up your alley, though, it’s available now on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p>An incident at a Burbank Chuck E. Cheese on August 7 is a useful PSA for what not to do at the kids arcade chain. An adult woman snuck into the Snow Day game meant for very small children and got her arm stuck in one of the holes. I guess she didn’t want the game to end. How many firefighters does it take to get a an arm out of the Snow Day game <a href="https://kotaku.com/chuck-e-cheese-subscription-fun-pass-tickets-price-1851620006">at Chuck E. Cheese</a>? At least six, it seems.</p> <p>It was around 3:30 p.m. last Thursday when the unidentified woman became trapped inside the large plastic arcade game, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/woman-stuck-in-chuck-e-cheese-game-burbank/3761451/">NBC Los Angeles reported</a>. The Snow Day game revolves around putting plastic balls into a central hole. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53xiyTvBrWc">A suction tube then pulls them up</a> and spits them back out the top of the machine. The higher the score, the more tickets you get for prizes. At no point do you need to stick your hand inside the hole, let alone your whole arm.</p> <p>You might be thinking, wow, that sounds like a really boring game. And you’d be right! It was created to fill “an under-served age gap in our industry,” i.e. to be something even a two-year-old could have fun doing.</p>   <p>The local fire department was called and apparently dispatched at least six people to the Chuck E. Cheese to witness the third-degree shame first-hand. Video from the scene showed one person seemingly trying to take the machine apart while several others stood around and contemplated the “place where a kid can be a kid.”</p> <p>“We prioritize children’s safety above all and have verified that the game poses no risk to our young guests,” a Chuck E. Cheese spokesperson said following the incident. The design prevents children’s arms from reaching the area in question. There was no injury to the young adult or any children, and the family continued to enjoy an evening of fun with the family.”</p>

              <p>Later this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers</em> 2</a>—previously a PS5- and PC-only PlayStation-published sci-fi shooter—arrives on Xbox with crossplay support. And a new trailer teases the possibility that some Orbital Drop Shock Troopers from <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> might appear as backup.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">Back in July</a>, Arrowhead and PlayStation Studios announced that their super-successful live-service shooter <em>Helldivers 2</em> would arrive on Xbox on August 26. The co-op shooter leaping to the PS5’s main rival is yet more evidence that the console wars are over. Plus, it means a bunch of Xbox-only players get a chance to enjoy one of the best co-op games released in years. Now, just about two weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-ps5-sony-playstation-decision-ceo-discord-2000616377"><em>Helldivers 2</em> crashes onto Xbox Series X/S consoles,</a> Xbox and Sony have teamed up (which is a little weird to say) to tease some <em>Halo</em> content coming to <em>Helldivers 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On August 12, a new trailer for <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox dropped and it shows off a bunch gameplay, featuring the kinds of loud explosions and mayhem you’d expect. But at the very end of all that is a quiet, jazzy tease that seems to heavily imply<em> Halo 3: ODST</em> soldiers are inbound. I’ve set up the trailer below to start right at the teaser:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Helldivers 2 - Bring the Boom | Out August 26" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE?start=70&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Ohhh, how I’ve missed the rain-soaked streets of <em>Halo 3: ODST a</em>nd its chill jazz music soundtrack. What a game. And a perfect fit for <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Both Helldivers and ODST soldiers land onto battlefields via drop pods to fight intergalactic threats. <em>Helldivers 2</em> has been very careful with its IP crossovers, but <em>ODST</em> makes sense and visually won’t feel too out of place. The real question is how fans will get their hands on some ODST armor, and also, will it feature some smooth jazz music? We’ll likely find out more before <em>Helldivers 2</em> launches on Xbox Series X/S on August 26.</p>

              <p>Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene changed the entire course of gaming in 2017 with the release of&nbsp;<em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>, now known nonsensically as <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>. (<em>Plunkbat&nbsp;</em>forever.) Without it–for good or ill–we may not have <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the most successful games ever.&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em> isn’t doing too badly itself, with more than half a million people playing at least once every day. Now, Greene is hoping to revitalize the survival genre with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-2-prologue-brendan-greene-playerunknown-metaverse-1851765648"><em>Prologue</em></a>, developed over the last four years and today revealing a surprise free open beta.</p> <p>Reminiscent of games from the survival sim heyday, <em>Prologue&nbsp;</em>drops its players in a woodland cabin and challenges them to find their way to a weather station, randomly placed on the sprawling 8-by-8km map. Along the way, you’ll be bombarded by weather extremes and hungry wildlife, while needing to keep yourself fed, watered and warm. Which, while certainly a familiar premise if you played <em>The Long Dark</em> or&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, is aiming for a different emphasis.&nbsp;<em>Prologue</em> appears to be aiming for the extremes of isolation, a sense of agoraphobic loneliness in its procedurally generated maps.</p> <p>Plus, of course, this comes with the pedigree. Greene may have moved on from&nbsp;<em>PUGB</em>, hence the title now only containing his nickname’s initials, but PlayerUnknown Productions comes with a lot of expectation. And then a lot of confusing rhetoric about “metaverses” and the like. But if you want to find out exactly what the game’s about, well, you can right now! For free!</p> <p>Available on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27">Epic</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Prologue: Go Wayback!&nbsp;</em>playtest lets you download and play the game ahead of its Early Access launch intended for later this year. To get it on Steam, head to the store page (the “go wayback” title, which hopefully isn’t permanent, at least makes it possible to search for) and then click on the “Request Access” button beneath the demo link. You’ll instantly get in, and will find the game available to install at the top of your Steam library. I’m downloading it as I type.</p>
