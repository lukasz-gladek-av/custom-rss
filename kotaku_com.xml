              <p>The long wait for <a href="https://kotaku.com/replaced-release-date-cyberpunk-pixel-art-batman-arkham-2000620061"><em>Replaced</em> was almost over</a>, until now. The beautiful pixel art action platformer’s March launch has been pushed back by the developers following feedback on a recent Steam demo. “The response to our Steam demo has been the ultimate fuel for us,” Sad Cat Studios wrote on Wednesday.</p> <p>“As a small team working on our very first title, we’ve poured everything we have into this project,” reads the <a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/2024122392310591889">studio’s announcement</a>. “While the game is technically finished, reaching this final stretch has shown us that we need just a few more weeks to ensure the experience is exactly what you deserve. We want the version of <em>Replaced</em> you play on day one to be polished, stable, and true to the vision we’ve shared with you. Instead of March 12, the Game Pass release will now arrive on April 14.</p>

  <p><em>Replaced</em> began development back in 2018, was revealed at E3 2021, and promised for a 2022 launch. Lofty ambitions and things like the Russia-Ukrainian War torpedoed those plans. After waiting an extra four years, what’s one more month?</p> <p>The action-adventure’s Steam demo has gotten generally positive feedback. The 2.5D art, cinematics, and mood have all been praised. The combat, however, might leave something to be desired. According to some demo reactions at least,<em> Replaced</em>‘s mechanics might be a bit repetitive and undercooked compared to its visual aesthetic. If accurate, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise for a game like this.</p>

 <p>But sometimes style and vibes are enough. I hope that’s the case with <em>Replaced</em>.</p>

              <p>As the Trump administration continues to ramp up ICE raids across the country, the Department of Homeland Security is increasingly trying to subpoena personal information on anonymous internet users who are trying to protest the agency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/dhs-anti-ice-social-media.html">according to <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p> <p>It reports that Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta have received hundreds of administrative subpoenas from the Department of Homeland Security in recent months. The goal is to get information on the identities of people behind accounts found to be tracking ICE agent movements or criticizing the group as it carries out its operations, during which officers have <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/ice-deaths-shootings-2026/">killed at least two people so far in 2026</a>.</p>

 <p><em>The New York Times</em> claims that Google, Meta, and Reddit have complied with “some” of the requests. It’s unclear if Discord has done the same.</p> <p>The gaming platform has frequently been subpoenaed by publishers looking for details on users sharing confidential information or pirating games. One of those was <em>Arc Raiders</em> distributor Nexon. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271854/discord-nexon-dmca-subpoena-copyright-piracy">Discord argued in legal filings back in 2024</a> that user privacy was legally protected by the constitution. Complying with the order, the company wrote, could violate its users’ “decisions to remain anonymous, an aspect of their freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.”</p>

 <p>Reddit, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1qd6qir/ice_trackers/">has been flooded</a> with people sharing information about ICE movements and facilities in their communities as people are disappeared off the streets. While agents remain masked and their identities kept hidden, ICE has been using <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-is-using-a-new-facial-recognition-app-to-identify-people-leaked-emails-show/">facial scanning technology</a> and other surveillance tools to <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/13/ice-using-private-data-to-intimidate-observers-and-activists-advocates-say">doxx people they don’t like in real time</a>.</p>
