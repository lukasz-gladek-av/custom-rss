              <p>Workstation upgrades aren’t cheap. If your desk is in need of a refresh, but you don’t want to shell out big bucks, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/">Right now, the 24-inch Lenovo all-in-one desktop computer is down to just $400 at Amazon, after a whopping $199 discount</a>. This bundle comes with everything you need to get started right away, including a pre-installed copy of Windows 11 Home, a wired keyboard, and a wired mouse. However, as you’d expect, the offer is only available for a short time. It’s best to snap it up sooner rather than later, if you want to avoid paying the full $599 price.</p>

<h2>Ideal for Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a stunning 23.8-inch, spacious Full HD display that pushes 1920 x 1080 resolution. You’ll enjoy crisp, vibrant picture quality for all types of content, whether you’re streaming your favorite show or creating an important work presentation. Plus, the anti-glare coating keeps the screen easy on the eyes, which is great for long work sessions or never-ending meetings. Speaking of video calls, you’ll find a high-quality 720p HD camera right above the screen. This camera is paired with Mono microphones that isolate your voice from the background noise and deliver it clearly on the other end.</p>
<p>Performance is impressive for day-to-day use. The system runs on a modest Intel N100 processor that features four cores and four threads with a max Turbo frequency of 3.40 GHz. It’s not a powerhouse, but it’s still perfectly capable of supporting your everyday needs – like office work, streaming, browsing, checking emails, handling light creative projects – without slowing down. There’s an 8GB DDR4 RAM to keep things running smoothly as you work and play. Again, it’s not massive, so you won’t exactly be able to multitask comfortably. But as long as you’re not trying to work on a bunch of resource-heavy tasks at once, you will enjoy minimal lag and decent performance.</p>



<p>Storage is taken care of by a roomy 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, which is plenty for important work files, media content, research documents, and even some games. Note that the system is not expandable, so you won’t be able to increase the capacity as your needs grow, but you can always add external storage solutions to manage space better.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include Intel Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. On the wired side, you’re covered with an array of ports, including two USB-A (Hi-Speed USB / USB 2.0), two USB-A (USB 10Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 2), one HDMI-out 1.4b, one Ethernet (RJ-45), and one headphone or microphone combo jack (3.5mm) – that’s all you need to create a fuller, more productive setup. Getting the wired keyboard and wired mouse in the bundle means you’ve already got all you need to get started with work and entertainment right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/">The bundle now costs $400, after Amazon took 33% off its usual price.</a> Just note that we’re not expecting the offer to last long. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation without spending a ton, now is your chance to pick a solid, highly-rated option for less. Delivery is free, too, so $400 is all you’ve got to pay today.</p>
