              <p>New information has surfaced in the federal investigation into the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk that includes a potentially <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251">unexpected link to <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. Bullets left behind near the crime scene had markings on them, according to information shared at a news conference on Friday morning by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, one of which included symbols that line up with a military Stratagem from last year‚Äôs hit sci-fi extraction game.</p> <p>Investigators said Discord messages from the suspected shooter led them to believe he had engraved the writings on bullets he used to kill Kirk at a Utah Valley University event earlier this week. A bolt-action rifle with a scope was recovered from a wooded area near the school on Thursday, with unfired bullets containing engravings on the casings.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö®Spencer Cox confirms writings on bullet casings and says they included "hey, fascist" and "if you read this, you are gay LMAO." <a href="https://t.co/9gow1IhynD">pic.twitter.com/9gow1IhynD</a></p> <p>‚Äî Off The Press (@OffThePress1) <a href="https://twitter.com/OffThePress1/status/1966506342039900267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>One of the casings reportedly had the words ‚ÄúHey fascists! Catch!‚Äù on it alongside an up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrows.</p> <p>While that last part might seem meaningless to most people, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players immediately understood it to be a reference to the <a title="Eagle 500kg Bomb" href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb">Eagle 500kg Bomb</a> stratagem which requires players to input those button presses on their keyboard or their controller‚Äôs d-pad in order to call down a giant payload that explodes moments later.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚áß‚á®‚á©‚á©‚á© (Up, Right, Down, Down, Down) is an orbital stratagem code from the game Helldivers II.

The multiplayer shooter has players step into the shoes of space marines as they battle alien threats across the galaxy as a parody of sci-fi fascism in the vein of <em>Starship Troopers</em>.</p> <p><em>Helldivers 2</em> came to Xbox Series X/S just last month and has continued to be one of the most played games on PC and console in part due to constantly-evolving in-game storytelling and a robust social community of dedicated players. Players team up, go down to random planet surfaces, complete mini-objective while dodging waves of hostile aliens, and repeatedly die in often absurd ways thanks to the game‚Äôs complex ragdoll physics.</p> <div> <p>Players have been flooding the game‚Äôs Discord today following the press conference sharing their shock and disgust, as well as debating whether Arrowhead Game Studios should make a statement addressing the situation. Robinson‚Äôs name has already been banned from the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord servers so that any attempt to mention the suspected shooter by name is automatically filtered out.</p> <p> <h2>‚ÄúWeird day to be a Helldivers mod‚Äù</h2> </p> </div> <p>On the game‚Äôs subreddits, which include over 1.5 million members, fans have been trying to process the news. ‚ÄúNot for nothing, but it‚Äôs gonna be weird to have one of these tattoos,‚Äù one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1nf5sxh/damn_not_for_nothing_but_its_gonna_be_weird_to/">wrote in a thread</a> referencing a past photo shared by someone over a year ago with a tattoo of the same Eagle 500kg Bomb stratagem reportedly referenced on Robinson‚Äôs bullets. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let some delusional person take what‚Äôs ours,‚Äù wrote another.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúCommunity is necessary because of events like this,‚Äù wrote one of the subreddit‚Äôs moderators. ‚ÄúIf we as people spent more time learning about each other and overcoming our differences instead of bickering we might actually achieve equity and not just equality.&nbsp;As Helldivers it‚Äôs our responsibility to keep those we love and are sworn to protect safe from outside evils.&nbsp; Sometimes those evils exist within our own society.‚Äù</p> <p>Politicians have long tried to link gun violence with video games, including President Donald Trump. Earlier this week, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said his department was looking into any potential links between gaming and increases in school shootings. The U.S. suffers from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/school-shooting-us-versus-world-trnd">exponentially more school shootings</a> than other countries, despite having the same number of video games.</p> <p><em><strong>Updated, 9/12/2025 12:53 p.m. ET:</strong> Added more reactions from</em> Helldivers 2 <em>players.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <p>We all know that storage is a hot commodity. Whether it‚Äôs managing to have enough space on your phone to record new videos and photos or having enough room on your PC or gaming console to download an upcoming title, there never seems to be enough room. That‚Äôs why when stuff like SSDs, external storage, or MicroSDs go on sale, you pick them up.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4089/"> Right now, the Samsung EVO Select series of memory cards are on sale, going for as much as 26% off.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has a handful of options at various capacities all on sale at the moment. The 128GB, normally $17, is several bucks off down to $13. The 256GB option is down from $26 to just $20. The 512GB MicroSD has been cut from $44 to $35 and the full 1TB option has dropped from $87 to just $75.</p>

<h2>Give Your Switch Room to Breathe</h2>
<p>For gamers, you can put this in your Nintendo Switch to manage both save data and the storage of the digital games themselves. The launch Nintendo Switch only comes with a measly 32GB. Now thankfully most Nintendo games aren‚Äôt too big by comparison to Xbox, PlayStation, and third-party AAA titles. Some of those shoot into the triple digits of gigs. One of Nintendo‚Äôs largest games,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, is only 18.2GB. But still, that‚Äôs more than half your console‚Äôs storage.</p>
<p>Pop in the 1TB Samsung EVO Select for just $75 and you won‚Äôt ever have to worry about game storage on your Switch again.</p>



<p>Important to note: These MicroSD cards are not compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires MicroSD Express cards which are faster at reading and writing data. Inserting one of the Samsung EVO Select MicroSD cards into a Nintendo Switch 2 console will not allow you to save or load neither your save data nor any digital games. It is still compatible with the original Nintendo Switch console along with the Nintendo Switch Lite and Nintendo Switch OLED.</p>
<p>The Samsung EVO Select MicroSDs have a read and write speed of up to 160MB/s. While not enough for the Switch 2, Nintendo only recommends speeds of up to 90 MB/s on its predecessor anyway so this will have no problem with the OG Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4089/">While the price is still down, you can at least quadruple your Nintendo Switch‚Äôs storage for as low as $13.</a> That‚Äôs a hell of a deal. Make sure to download&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> once you‚Äôve installed that sucker into your SD card slot.</p>
