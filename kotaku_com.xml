              <p>Last year, a trailer leaked for a cancelled multiplayer<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-pc-port-august-2022-ps4-ps5-steam-sony-plays-1849011465"><em> Spider-Man</em> game</a> that was being developed by Insomniac. It seemed cool. So cool in fact, that it seems to have inspired folks to try and use mods to make online web-swinging with friends a reality. And one such mod is now out, and it looks great.</p> <p>On August 26, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/marvels-spider-man-co-op-multiplayer-mod-pc/">as spotted by <em>ComicBook</em></a>, a new PC-only mod has been released online that allows people to play Marvel’s <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> with up to six other players. The mod was developed by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hbgda">modder hbgda and is available to those who subscribe to the creator’s Patreon</a>. You can see what the mod looks like in action below, courtesy of a video shared by popular creator Kami on TikTok and Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spider-Man Remastered just got a working multiplayer mod on PC and it's amazing.</p> <p>Probably the closest thing we're going to get to The Great Web. <a href="https://t.co/6FeT3JEBbz">pic.twitter.com/6FeT3JEBbz</a></p> <p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1960452836887568680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/VqjYrZ2WvCM"> There are also multiple YouTube videos of the multiplayer <em>Spider-Man</em> mod in action</a>, and it looks surprisingly stable for something as ambitious and wild as this. Sure, it’s not perfect, but considering<em> Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> on PC was never designed to support multiplayer, let alone seven people running and swinging around the map at the same time, the fact that this mod is not only playable but looks extremely polished is incredibly impressive.</p>

 <p>Watching footage of hbgda’s mod in action has me hankering to install <em>Spider-Man</em> on my PC and try this out. It also makes me sad that we never got Insomniac’s online multiplayer Spider-Man game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-the-great-web-online-co-op-game-trailer-1851329786">It was reportedly going to be called <em>Spider-Man: The Great Web</em></a> and would have involved hopping between dimensions alongside your friends. Sadly, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-22/playstation-employees-at-insomniac-studio-fear-identity-theft-after-massive-hack">according to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a>, the game was canceled long before the trailer for it leaked in 2024 in the wake of the December 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/insomniac-hack-wolverine-ps5-spider-man-3-venom-sony-1851120403">Insomniac data breach.</a></p> <p>While it’s very possible the game wouldn’t have had much staying power, which is a problem for a live-service video game, I would have loved to have been able to invite my pals to swing around NYC with me and cause some chaos. At the very least, I hope we see Insomniac add a multiplayer mode to a future Spider-Man game. Doesn’t have to be something elaborate, just something that looks like this mod, but which is playable on PS5, too.</p> <p>For now, if you want to swing around New York City as Spider-Man with some other Spider-People, your only option is to download this mod and set it up on your PC.</p>
