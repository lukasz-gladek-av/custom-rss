This is worse than having PowerPoint presentation about the DLC.”</p><p>The backlash was so swift and negative that the makers of the original game, Studio Wildcard, went on social media to distance themselves from the debacle. “<em>Ark: Aquatica</em> is being developed by @SnailGamesUSA Colorado, please follow them for more updates,” the team wrote on X yesterday. “Studio Wildcard remains entirely dedicated to the production of <em>Ark: Survival Ascended </em>&amp; <em>Ark 2</em>, and we’re excited to bring <em>Ark: Lost Colony </em>to you later this year!”</p><p>For anyone who’s been out of <em>Ark</em>’s survival crafting, dino-hunting orbit for a few years now, the sequel was revealed back at the 2020 Game Awards with a look at Vin Diesel and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-video-games-2023-release-delay-final-fantasy-ark-2-1849911227/slides/3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-video-games-2023-release-delay-final-fantasy-ark-2-1849911227/slides/3">has barely been heard from since</a></span>. <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em>, meanwhile, is a current-gen remake of the original game in Unreal Engine 5.
