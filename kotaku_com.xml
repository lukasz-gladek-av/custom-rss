              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i></a> <span>got a </span><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world"><span>major patch last night</span></a><span>, and most of the changes in the update are what you’d expect. There are some bug fixes, track tweaks, and some smaller stuff, like making specific items respawn faster. But on top of all this good stuff, Nintendo also did one of the most obnoxious, Nintendo-ass things it could have possibly done by making its audio settings a toggle, rather than a slider for players to adjust to their liking.</span></p> <p><span>As demonstrated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kzxcellent.live/post/3m72cm4q6zk2t">this clip</a>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-online-three-lap-2000628126"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> new update adds a “Music Volume” option in the racer’s settings that lets you adjust how loud the music is while you’re driving around and throwing blue shells at each other. However, the only options you have in this setting are “Normal” and “Loud.” You can’t tweak these presets at all, and most people who adjust the music volume in video games aren’t making it </span><i><span>louder</span></i><span>; they’re usually trying to balance it so they can hear audio cues, voice acting, or whatever they’re trying to hone in on.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650068">© Nintendo / @kzxcellent.live on Bluesky / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Audio options can be helpful for a lot of reasons, but they are, at their core, an accessibility accommodation, and Nintendo has a history of weird oversights like this. </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>famously locked its audio settings behind </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hi-tech_Earbuds"><span>an in-game item</span></a><span> you couldn’t get until you were hours into the game. Adding music volume settings and making it a toggle that only gets louder, rather than quieter, sounds like someone at Nintendo heard someone asking for audio options, then didn’t bother to ask why or what they should do. It’s annoying, but it’s also incredibly funny because it feels like Nintendo is so insistent that it isn’t going along with the rest of the industry that it won’t even look at other games or companies as a reference for how to handle basic quality-of-life settings.</span></p> <p><span>The full patch notes are as follows:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>General</strong></p> <ul> <li>Added “Custom Items”

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-strikes-google-hard-now-selling-fitbit-charge-6-at-all-time-low-after-cyber-monday-2000650049</link>
            <guid>1371505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon extended its Cyber Week deals into December with continued discounts on major brands including Fitbit, which Google acquired to strengthen its wearables lineup. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/">Fitbit Charge 6 fitness tracker dropped to $99 on Amazon, matching the Cyber Monday price and slashing $60 off the regular $159 tag</a> and this all-time low makes the Charge 6 accessible for anyone who wants detailed health tracking.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Accuracy</h2>
<p>The Fitbit Charge 6<strong> sends your heart rate in real time to exercise machines</strong> that can use Bluetooth which means that treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes can show your actual heart rate instead of using their often-unreliable handlebar sensors. This connection is important for interval training or heart rate zone workouts where you need exact feedback to keep up the right level of intensity. Fitbit changed the heart rate sensor array on the Charge 6 to <strong>make it more accurate during high-intensity movements</strong>. This was done in response to complaints that previous models lost tracking during vigorous exercise.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in GPS records your pace, distance, and elevation data</strong> while you run, walk, or ride your bike outside. You don’t need to bring your phone with you; the data will sync with the Fitbit app once you’re back in Bluetooth range. You can leave your phone behind while you work out and still get all the information about your route for later analysis. The GPS receiver locks onto satellites quickly, unlike older fitness trackers that sometimes took a few minutes to get a signal.</p>



<p>When you start directions on your phone, <strong>Google Maps integration shows turn-by-turn directions right on the Charge 6’s screen</strong>. This puts navigation prompts on your wrist so you can see them without taking out your phone. With Google Wallet support, you can tap to pay at checkout terminals with cards stored in your Google account. This means you don’t have to carry your wallet around when you run quick errands or go get coffee. When you play music through the app on your phone, music controls show up on the tracker’s display. This lets you control playback without having to touch your device while you work out.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep trackin</strong>g keeps track of how long you spend in light, deep, and REM sleep stages during the night. This gives you more information about the quality of your sleep than just the total hours you slept. The Sleep Score algorithm takes into account how long you slept, how restful it was, and how well it restored you to create a single number that tells you how well you actually slept. Morning readiness scores look at your recent activity, sleep, and heart rate variability to suggest whether you should work hard or take it easy during your workout today. Stress management tools check your heart rate variability and start guided breathing sessions when the tracker sees that your stress levels are too high.</p>



<p>The <strong>six-month Premium membership that comes with it</strong> gives you access to advanced analytics, guided programs, and detailed health metrics that help you see patterns in your data. Premium gives you daily readiness scores, advanced sleep analysis, and workout suggestions that are tailored to your fitness level and recent activity. You can keep using core tracking features after the trial period ends without paying for Premium, but you won’t be able to access the extra insights and guided content.</p>
<p>Depending on how often you use GPS and other power-hungry features,<strong> the battery can last up to seven days between charges</strong>. This is a huge improvement over smartwatches that need to be charged every night. When you don’t have much time, quick charging adds a full day of battery in just 12 minutes. Fitbit i<strong>ncludes both small and large bands in the box</strong>&nbsp;so the tracker can fit wrists that are 5.5 to 8.1 inches around without the need to buy extra bands.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is now in the entry-level fitness tracker price range at $99, but it has features that are usually only found on devices that cost $150 or more. The $60 discount and six months of Premium included make this a great deal because Premium costs $10 a month on its own.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-compatible-samsung-microsdxc-black-friday-deal-2000650000</link>
            <guid>1371457</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There is nothing more annoying, frustrating, and heartbreaking than having to delete your old titles just to make room for new ones. We’ve all been in those situations, but there’s a simple way out. Investing in a microSD card can give your storage the boost it needs, and we just spotted a solid option going for a lot less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">The 512GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card, which is made for Nintendo Switch, is currently going at a 25% discount.</a> This brings its price down to just $75, saving you a nice $15. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to since its release, but the offer is only around for a short time. Grab it while it’s still live, because once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Capacity, Better Speeds</h2>
<p>Starting off with the storage; the 512GB capacity is more than enough to house all your favorite titles and other downloadable content (DLCs) that you can’t squeeze into the internal storage of your console. It’s not as massive as 1TB, sure, but unless you’re looking to store massive libraries, it’s going to be sufficient. Sequential read speeds of up to 800 MB/s make it easy to access games and get back into action (literally) up to four times faster than most other options in the same range. These speeds translate into quicker load times and much faster updates.</p>
<p>Installation couldn’t be simpler. Just turn your Nintendo Switch off, locate the kickstand on the back, and open it. Look for the dedicated slot and gently insert the card into it. Once it clicks into place, turn your console on and follow any on-screen instructions that pop up. It should be up and running within minutes!</p>



<p>The card plays nicely with Nintendo Switch 2, plus microSD UHS-I devices like computers, tablets, cameras, and select handheld consoles. It’s built to last you for years to come, thanks to its 6 layers of protection. It is waterproof (capable of withstanding up to 72 hours in seawater), temperature-proof with operating temperatures of -13 degrees Fahrenheit to 185 degrees Fahrenheit, X-Ray proof, magnetic-proof, plus drop-proof up to 16.4 feet. Even with all this, Samsung offers a limited warranty of 3 years that covers you if anything goes wrong. The card features a dynamic thermal guard that keeps it cool even during those intense sessions that demand a lot of power. To unlock its full performance, it’s best to use it with the Samsung Magician Software. It lets you verify the product’s authenticity, plus keep an eye on your drive’s health to ensure optimal performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a reliable, easy-to-use storage solution, this 512GB Samsung microSD card is an excellent option to consider, especially at this lowest price.</a> It gets you the storage you need, plus faster transfer speeds and exceptional compatibility. If 512GB is more than you need, there’s a 256GB version going for $55, but it’s not discounted. Getting your orders in now will also help you save on the delivery charges, whether you are a Prime member or not. Just be sure to act fast, as drops this massive don’t stick around forever. It’s one of the remaining Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, and we’re expecting it to wrap within a few hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>There’s a great 1st anniversary party happening for <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em>, and new players and longtime franchise fans are all invited. Two huge new events, three powerful new dolls—as anniversary celebrations go, this is a big one.</span></p>
<p><span>The fireworks begin on Nov. 27 with a massive overhaul of the Crew Deck, the launch of the <em>Deep Oblivion</em> and <em>Intertwined Assault</em> events, and the debut of new dolls Leva and Lenna. <em>Deep Oblivion</em> is a two-part event, with part 2 dropping on Dec. 18 along with Robella, the third new doll. There are also huge player rewards to be found, including more than 130 pulls and over 13,000 Collapse Pieces. Needless to say, this is an event <em>GFL2</em> fans will not want to miss, and a golden opportunity for new fans to step up and experience this global phenomenon.</span></p>

<h2>Inside the New Crew Deck</h2>
<p><span>The Elmo’s Crew Deck has been upgraded, and the brand-new gameplay is now live. In this updated space, Commanders will find not only fully realized 3D versions of the collectible cabinet and armory, but also a variety of new interactive story moments between Commanders and T-Dolls.</span></p>
<p><span>When the update goes live, Commanders will immediately find Makiatto’s exclusive story <em>Time Capsule: Pulse-Racing Night</em> in their inbox. If you already own Makiatto’s Embroidered Bamboo Blooming Shadows outfit, you can jump right into this free story. Klukai also gets in on the special features, with a Cerulean Breaker outfit (pictured above) that comes with a new Body Maintenance Technician item.</span></p>
<p><span>With more stories, outfits, and furniture for Commanders to invest in, the Crew Deck gets a little more homey and personalized with each addition. And with a brand-new holography function, players can actually embody select Dolls inside the Crew Dec, starting with Klukai, but with more to follow.</span></p>
<p><span>The Crew Deck is a completely new space, no longer just a menu, but an interactive showcase. Among the other anniversary-celebration innovations debuting on Nov. 27:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>3D Ornament Cabinet &amp; Armory</span></li>

<p><span>Commanders who participate in the full season of events are in for a serious haul, including over 130 free pulls, over 13,000 Collapse Pieces, 2 free outfits, and a massive array of other upgrade materials, tokens, and Crew Deck bonuses. When the Crew Deck Date Reward arrives on Nov. 27, that’s stacked with </span><span>35 Outfit Access Permissions, </span><span>10 Access Permissions, an Elmo Model Ornament, 300 Collapse Pieces, and multiple other growth materials.</span></p>
<p><span>Other goodies include a free Dragon Chef outfit for Qiuhua available in the Glory Store, and an automatic unlocking of Springfield’s Enjoy the Fragrance. There are more Access Permissions available by completing daily missions, through mail rewards, furniture exchange, gift packs, and the seasonal Battle Pass.</span></p>
<h2>Don’t Miss the Live-Action Trailer</h2>
<p><span>Even with all of these updates, new Dolls, and massive rewards, another exciting part of the <em>GFL2</em> 1st anniversary celebration is a live-action trailer featuring the legendary 404 Squad. The video showcases the characters’ relaxed daily life on the Crew Deck, while also featuring intense combat action.You’ll see the 404 Squad engage in desert firefights and blackout industrial battles, with Humvees, Gatling guns, and a heavily armed helicopter aiding their cause.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2000646758" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646758"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646758">© Sunborn Games</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Even before this giant anniversary party, it’s easy to see how <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> has become such a worldwide success. Whether you’re a <em>GFL2</em> veteran or you’re just hearing all the rave reviews now and want to see what it’s all about, it’s an awesome experience on PC, or mobile on both Android and iOS devices. Commanders, join in and celebrate the anniversary!</span></p>

              <p data-start="96" data-end="911">Making progress in any sport really comes down to knowing your numbers. If you want to improve, you need a solid idea of what you’re working toward and a convenient way to keep an eye on it. Whether you’re just getting into running and hitting your favorite trails, jumping in open water for triathlon training, or biking some hills, a reliable GPS watch can make all the difference. It helps you stay motivated, stay on track, and avoid losing steam. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6183/">Conveniently, Samsung’s newly released 2025 version of its smartwatch—the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic—is still on sale post Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>. This watch normally goes for $500, but right now you can grab it for 20% off, bringing it down to $400. You end up saving yourself a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="96" data-end="911">Now this is the Classic model of the Watch 8. What’s different about it? First up, it’s much bigger. The standard models come in either 40mm or 44mm. This watch face measures across at 46mm. But more noticeable that that, the watch has a metal casing. The new lug system allows for easy band detachment and replacement. So when you’re not working out, this watch maintains a professional work you could even pair nicely with a suit. Then when it’s time to hit the pavement in your running attire, swap out the band for a silicone one, easily.</p>

<h2 data-start="913" data-end="946">A Fitness Coach on Your Wrist</h2>
<p data-start="948" data-end="1552">The Galaxy Watch 8 runs on Samsung’s Galaxy AI platform, which helps it deliver smarter health and fitness tracking. Whenever you head out for a ride, run, hike, or any sort of outdoor workout, the watch can keep tabs on how you’re performing in real time and compare it to your past sessions. Throughout the day, it can nudge you with personalized wellness suggestions to help you steadily move toward your fitness and health goals. The improved heart-rate tracking is also a big upgrade. It filters out the noise from natural body motion, giving you a more accurate reading than previous Samsung watches.</p>
<p data-start="1554" data-end="1991">Your sleep gets just as much attention. The Watch 8 tracks your patterns closely enough to flag possible signs of sleep apnea and gives you a much clearer look at how well you’re actually resting each night. When you wake up, you get a quick snapshot of your energy level and readiness for the day. It combines details like your sleep score, steps, heart-rate behavior, and more to give you a realistic picture of where your body stands.</p>


<p data-start="1993" data-end="2450">Of course, it’s not just about fitness. The Galaxy Watch 8 works great as a full-blown smartwatch for everyday life. You can read and respond to messages straight from your wrist without fishing your phone out of your pocket. And if it’s paired with your phone, the watch becomes a remote camera controller—perfect for group shots or selfies at a distance. You can change settings, hit the timer, and take the picture all from the watch.</p>
<p data-start="2485" data-end="2997">The new Watch 8 can hit up to 3,000 nits, while the Watch 7 maxes out at 2,000 nits. That extra brightness makes a big difference when you’re checking stats under direct sunlight. Both models are still tough enough for all-weather training, whether you’re out in the cold, the rain, or the heat.</p>
<p data-start="3279" data-end="3522"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6183/">The Galaxy Watch 8 is also designed from the ground up to work with Gemini, the AI assistant built by Samsung and Google</a>. You can use it to check your schedule, reply to texts, set reminders, and handle a bunch of everyday tasks with ease.</p>
