              <p><span>Razer, the company best known for its RGB-infused keyboards, cat-ear headsets, and over-priced gaming chairs, has just revealed that its “AI gaming copilot” Project Ava will be used in its latest invention: an AI anime waifu that sits on your desk, named “Kira.” She’ll be powered by Elon Musk’s Grok.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The 2026 Consumer Electronics Show kicked off in Las Vegas this week and, unsurprisingly, AI-powered tech is everywhere. Razer announced its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach"><span>AI gaming assistant, Project Ava,</span></a><span> at last year’s show, alongside a prerecorded video of the copilot program suggesting tips to help a player navigate a boss fight in </span><i><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Razer’s Project Ava has now returned in physical form. The newly unveiled “AI Desk Companion” version comes equipped with a built-in webcam (which Razer states is for its “human-like vision” and “full contextual awareness”), a series of customizable RGB LEDs, a USB-C port, and, most notably, a “swappable” 5.5-inch-tall 3D holographic avatar.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Razer Holographic AI Voice Assistant Kira (Project Ava) CES 2026 Demo <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Razer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Razer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2026?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2026</a> <a href="https://t.co/ah54Us7QMJ">pic.twitter.com/ah54Us7QMJ</a></p> <p>— Shacknews (@shacknews) <a href="https://twitter.com/shacknews/status/2008539048328171561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the press release, Project Ava’s holographic companion currently comes in five varieties. These include the default, amorphous green blob Ava, the aforementioned cat-ear wearing anime waifu Kira, and a buff “gaming wingman” called Zane. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The other two holograms are actually 3D recreations of real people: the South Korean eSports legend Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok and the J-Pop idol Saori “Sao” Araki, the latter of whom exploded in popularity last year following her viral “Office Lady” meme.</span></p>

 <p><span>As detailed in a report by </span><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sony-razer-project-ava-ai-gameplay"><i><span>Inverse</span></i></a><span>, the physical version of Project Ava will be powered by xAI’s Grok, which recently </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrn054nxe7o"><span>started posting CSAM online</span></a><span>. If you’re curious how it will perform as Grok races </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><span>to seed social media with deepfake porn</span></a><span>, several outlets, including </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/razer-made-its-ai-gaming-assistant-into-a-waifu-hologram-2000705679"><span>both </span><i><span>Gizmodo</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>, were less than complimentary about its implementation.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>Gizmodo’s </span></i><span>James Pero stated that his experience with Project Ava was “as wonky as chatting with any other AI chatbot out there,” and </span><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i><span> Antonio G. Di Benedetto noted that the anime AI assistant Kira “kept incessantly filling gaps in communication with annoying chatter.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’re still keen to get your hands on one of these regardless, </span><a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava"><span>the FAQ</span></a><span> on Razer’s Project Ava website states that it’s “expected to be available in the second half of 2026” and that folks in the United States can already reserve one of the units by putting down a $20 deposit. The company still hasn’t revealed how much the full Grok-powered holograms will cost.</span></p>

              <p>Christmas might be over, but that won’t stop retailers and digital stores from offering up deals themed around wintertime. Case in point: GOG’s big new Winter Classics Promo, which features over 1,000 heavily discounted old PC games.</p> <p>Kicking off on January 6, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20260106-winter-classics-promo?order=desc:trending">the new GOG Winter Classics Promo</a> sees the storefront dedicated to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">selling and preserving games</a>, offering up some of its older titles for up to 95 percent off. The sale runs from now until January 20, and given the weather, it is a good time to curl up with some classic PC games under a warm blanket and have a cozy night. As always, games bought on GOG don’t feature any DRM or the need to download a launcher or digital app. You just buy it, download it, install it, and play it.</p> <p>So here are some of the highlights from this massive GOG sale.</p> <ul> <li><em>Theme Hospital – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 3 GOTY Edition – $7 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout New Vegas – $10 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 4: GOTY Edition – $16 ($40)</em></li> <li><em>Dungeon Keeper GOLD – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Dungeon Keeper 2 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Roller Coaster Tycoon – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 – $5 (10)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 2000 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 3000 – $5 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 4 – $5 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Thief Gold – $1.80 ($7)</em></li> <li><em>Thief 2 – $1.80 ($7)</em></li> <li><em>Thief 3 – $1.80 ($9)</em></li> <li><em>Medal of Honor War Chest – $5 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Ultima Underworld 1-2 – $3 ($6)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Jade Empire – $4 ($15)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Syberia – $1.30 ($13)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Ultima 1-3 – $3 ($6)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Ultima 4-6 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Far Cry – $3 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Far Cry 2 – $3 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Spore Collection – $30 ($15)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Torchlight 2 – $4 ($20)</em></li> </ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752</link>
            <guid>1399618</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax, the Nova Scotia-based mobile team in Ubisoft’s stable of studios, announced that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"><span>it was unionizing back in December</span></a><span>. Ubisoft swears up and down that what came next was decided before 61 of its 71 employees joined the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada, and if that’s actually the case, Ubisoft sure stepped on a massive rake by shutting down the studio just weeks after organizing members made the union official.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/"><i><span>Gamesindustry.biz</span></i></a><span>, Ubisoft said the call came not from a cruel union-busting effort, but as part of years-long cost-cutting initiative on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> company’s part.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” the statement reads. “As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if this is the case, the optics are bad. Ubisoft has been undergoing a lot of reorganization in the past few years, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>layoffs at subsidiaries like </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws </span></i><span>developer Massive</span></a><span> and top level personnel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542"><span>leaving the company</span></a><span> as it continues to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161"><span>drastically reduce its workforce</span></a><span> after Tencent bailed it out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796"><span>to the tune of $1.25 billion</span></a><span>. So yeah, it might not be union busting, but the whole thing still deserves your “boos” and tomatoes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax had developed two free-to-play games based on some of Ubisoft’s biggest properties:</span><i><span> Rainbow Six Mobile </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</span></i><span>. It’s unclear how this will affect </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Mobile</span></i><span>, which was set for a global release on February 23. </span></p>

              <p>Oh great gaming gods, hear our prayer: Please may 2026 prove to be the year in which the AI bubble bursts. Amen. A rather splendid sign of at least one big-name tech company backing away from the bullshit claims comes from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/dells-ces-2026-chat-was-the-most-pleasingly-un-ai-briefing-ive-had-in-maybe-5-years/">a <em>PC Gamer</em> interview</a> with Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, who outright stated that consumers just don’t care about AI, and aren’t drawn in by its addition to products.</p> <p>“What we’ve learned over the course of this year,” says Terwilliger to&nbsp;<em>PCG</em>‘s Dave James, “especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI. In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”</p>

 <p>This is not to say that Dell is backing away from AI as a feature within its tech (baby steps), but rather is just avoiding mentioning the topic during its latest raft of announcements during CES 2026. James reports that the Dell presentation from vice chairman Jeff Clarke only mentioned the near-meaningless two letters once, and in a pejorative fashion, saying “we have this un-met promise of AI.” Instead, the speech focused on new laptops and desktop computers, the challenges of tariffs, and some shiny new monitors. You know, like hardware manufacturers used to do.</p>

 <p>So when Dave James spoke to Dell’s Kevin Terwilliger, he brought up how conspicuous the topic was in its absence, given the tedious ubiquity of the subject for the last few years. “One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Terwilliger told <em>PCG</em>. “So a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”</p>

 <p>What strikes me most about this is not the lack of being AI-forward, but the willingness to call out that it was dumb to have been so in 2025. While he adds that “we’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device,” the change in emphasis feels very significant.</p>

 <p>The reality is, “AI” as a term means so many different things in so many different circumstances that it’s useless. For decades, in gaming, it was the term used to describe the programmed behavior of NPCs, until it was clumsily repurposed by companies like OpenAI, Google, and X to instead be shorthand for “generative-AI” like LLMs, the plagiarism machines that are fed all the content of the internet and then regurgitate it in slightly different, significantly less accurate forms. But when computer manufacturers use it, it’s something else all over again, software that “learns” based on experience, allowing for high-speed adjustments to ideally improve performance. In that sense, it’s somewhat more like the algorithms being used in scientific research to dramatically speed up fields like medical research, also usually just called “AI.”</p>

 <p>So hurrah to Dell for being bold enough to back away from the bullshit. May it be the first of very many, as we start to see “AI” exposed as the grift it truly has become, and hopefully a new emphasis on celebrating creativity and originality, whether it’s aided by AI-driven GPUs or not.</p>
