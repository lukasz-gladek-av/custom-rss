              <p>When’s the last time you flexed on somebody about a laptop deal? We’re guessing — maybe even hoping — the answer is “never,” but if you’re so inclined, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4191/">Amazon limited-time deal on a fully tricked-out Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen is a golden opportunity, because it’s being sold at a savings of over $2,000</a>. The bottom-line $900 price is a 70% drop from the list price of $2,999.</p>
<p>When we say “fully tricked out,” we’re being quite literal. It’s stuffed with max memory (64GB), max storage (2TB), and Microsoft’s best OS (Windows 11 Pro), which includes the elite-level Copilot AI assistant. Pretty much every bell and every whistle is included here, with a $400 accessories bundle thrown in for good measure.</p>

<h2>Not a Retread</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for the “used” or “refurbished” or “dent and scratch special” tag on this Dell Inspiron 15, you’re not going to find one. It’s a brand-new 2024 model that’s fully up to date in every way possible. It’s not&nbsp;<em>the</em> lightest laptop around, but at just 3.66 pounds, it’s hardly a lumbering dinosaur. And the Intel Core i5 processor is competitive, with speeds up to 4.66GHz.</p>
<p>This Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop is an obvious productivity superstar, with that processor and memory and storage combining with Realtek Wi-Fi 6 to power through remote work and as many work tasks as you can throw at it. Copilot AI will work wonders here as well when you need a hand with an Excel spreadsheet or you’re just not finding the right words for your email to the boss. It also has a 720p HD camera with a built-in privacy shutter, and MaxxAudio Pro stereo speakers for your Zoom calls and video conferencing.</p>



<h2>Time to Play</h2>
<p>All that speed and power and those hot speakers can also make this Dell Inspiron 15 a great gaming and streaming laptop when you’re off hours. The 15.6-inch display is full HD, with 1.4 million pixels and anti-glare coating to bring your games and shows to life, and if you cap off your work day with a long gaming grind or binge-watching your favorite new streaming show, the battery is up to the task, and Dell’s ExpressCharge tech lets you power it all the way back up to 80% in just 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Nobody will question your deal-scoring bona fides when you tell them the insane deal you got on this Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop. But you’ll want to tell them anyway: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4191/">This $900 deal is a 70% drop from the original price of $2,999, and that’s not including the $400 accessory bundle that you’re getting for free.</a></p>

              <p>LEGO is easily one of the most beloved sets of collectibles. Just about from kids to adults love them. They make for great toys, gifts, or collectors items. But really what it’s all about is the build. Loading up the latest episode of your favorite podcast or the next chapter of an audiobook your working through while you sit at a table on down on the carpet, putting pieces together one by one. You watch your progress unfold in front of you as your mind wanders and you forget about the stressors in your life. You get lost in it. And then when you’re done, you have a cool replica of the likely the most famous spaceship in cinema history.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">On that note, you can get the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set for 20% off in honor of Bricktember.</a> Yes, we’re pretending that’s a real month. For a limited time, the price of this Star Wars LEGO set has come down from $85 to just $68. You’ll be saving a good $17.</p>

<h2>Build Nostalgia</h2>
<p>This LEGO Millennium Falcon is built to be display (but I won’t tell any one if you pretend to fly it around your bedroom while making the noises). When displayed, it sits at a dynamic angle like it’s taking a tight turn. The model measures in at just over five inches tall, about nine and a half inches long, and then seven and a half inches deep. It’s a great fit for any moderately-sized shelf.</p>
<p>The 921-piece set of the renowned Corellian freighter starship first seen piloted by smuggler Han Solo and his loyal companion Chewbacca has every part of the ship inside and out in great detail. Well, decent detail. To keep everything to size, the characters are all depicted with just two or three small round pieced stacked on top of each other. LEGO even decided to represent that weird holographic chess game Han and Chewie play in George Lucas’ original trilogy.</p>



<p>LEGO and Star Wars collaborated on this set in honor of the 25th anniversary of LEGO Star Wars. Back in 1999, as a way to promote the new prequel trilogy’s first film&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em>, LEGO released its first Star Wars sets. Among them were an X-Wing fighter, a Landspeeder, and even minifigures of Luke Skywalker and Ben Kenobi.</p>
<p>And now here we are a little over 25 years later, LEGO and Star Wars are just has over thousand sets together — but we’re only here to talk about one set.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/"> Get this LEGO Millennium Falcon for 20% off for a limited time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has revealed new sprays coming to the game that some fans online have been </span><a href="https://x.com/dewenjoyer/status/1968131210951241935"><span>speculating are AI-generated</span></a><span>. These </span><a href="https://x.com/ougidraws/status/1968070064403579098"><span>sprays feature new character</span></a><span> Wuyang playing competitive </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>at his computer, and Venture and Juno posing back-to-back. Both sprays reference the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-champions-series-owcs-owl-esports-dreamhack-1851189732"><span>Overwatch Esports</span></a><span> organization, with its logo included on the heroes’ clothes and computer. After they were revealed, some fans started </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@inklionart/video/7551148691952864543"><span>accusing Blizzard of using generative AI in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> to create these sprays, as well as </span><a href="https://x.com/ougidraws/status/1968109749507072419"><span>explaining which details about the sprays</span></a><span> they felt gave them away as the product of AI. Well, we asked Blizzard if this is the case, and the company says that both sprays were made by a human artist.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch is ABSOLUTELY using AI, LOOK AT THE EYES <a href="https://t.co/Wsl7Q95qSN">pic.twitter.com/Wsl7Q95qSN</a></p> <p>— Juno 🍐 COMMISSIONS OPEN (2/2) (@DewEnjoyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/DewEnjoyer/status/1968131210951241935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The sprays referenced are artist-made,” a Blizzard spokesperson said in a statement to </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>When these accusations started flying around social media in places like X and TikTok, some </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>haters </span><span>were more than willing to jump on the bandwagon, but several others argued that calling things out as AI art based on small nitpicks is only detrimental to the cause of protesting AI slop in favor of supporting artists, because you might be mistaken, distort others’ perception of what is and isn’t AI-generated, and then the artists whose work is mischaracterized as AI are left with that controversy on their public record. Though yes, AI art is a plague on this planet and we should absolutely speak out against companies using it instead of hiring real artists, firing the accusation from the hip ultimately risks throwing the very artists you claim to be advocating for under the bus. Now, a Blizzard artist or maybe a contractor has seen people assume their work isn’t their own, that it isn’t even the work of a human being, and is instead the product of an algorithm scraping other artists’ portfolios.</span></p> <p><span>I sympathize with the fear that your favorite thing might become lost to the slop machine. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>is one of my favorite games, and I play it just about every day, largely because I love the work Blizzard’s creative team has put into bringing these characters to life. But vigilance shouldn’t turn these conversations into witch hunts where the artists whose work we want to support takes collateral damage. </span></p>
