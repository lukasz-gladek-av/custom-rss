I find the sport boring to watch. I’ve never liked any soccer video games. I outright hated EA’s <em>FIFA </em>series any time I was forced to play it for a few minutes. I didn’t even love<em> Rocket League.</em> And yet, I stayed up until 2 a.m. over the weekend playing a soccer game. And I did it again the next night. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rematch-does-it-have-crossplay-launch-no-xbox-ps5-pc-1851784595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rematch-does-it-have-crossplay-launch-no-xbox-ps5-pc-1851784595">That’s because <em>Rematch</em>, out now,</a></span> is unlike any other soccer game I’ve played or seen. It captures the best parts of the sport while excising the junk. The result is amazing. </p><p>Most modern soccer games are played from a high-up perspective, and you’re asked to control the entire team all at once. In these games, you aren’t really <em>playing </em>soccer, but instead controlling a match from afar like a weird soccer god. For fans of the sport, like my brother, this can be fun enough. But <em>Rematch</em>, out now on Xbox, PS5, and PC, is very, very different. In <em>Rematch</em>, you control one player throughout the whole match. The camera is located directly behind you, and every other player on the pitch (I Googled that) is controlled by another player.</p><p>Those changes alone are enough to make <em>Rematch</em> stand out from <em>FIFA</em> and similar soccer games. (No, I won’t call it football.) But that alone is not why I keep playing the colorful and stylized <em>Rematch</em>. No, what has me hooked is how it plays. </p><p>Moving, sliding, shooting, blocking, and passing in <em>Rematch</em> feel wonderful. Everything is snappy and responsive. When my brother charges up the middle and I’m being attacked by two players, I can effortlessly hit one button to slip the ball behind me, maneuver past the defenders, and pass it to my bro without even looking. Other times, a long pass will be hurled to me and I can run up to it and bicycle kick it into the goal, adding a bit of bend to the shot before it goes in. </p><p>All of this feels great, and once you’ve learned the controls, it’s a blast. Thankfully, the opening tutorial gives you just enough of the basics that you’ll be set to hold your own online. As you play more, you’ll learn more ways to combine the controls and techniques you were taught into more complicated and impressive moves. For example, you can flick the ball over your head and kick it in midair, aiming not to score but to bounce it off the wall above the goal, hopefully throwing off the goalie in the process and setting up a teammate to finish the shot.</p><p>Oh, right, the wall around the field. I forgot to mention that. See, the soccer in <em>Rematch </em>isn’t normal soccer. There are no yellow or red cards. No penalties. Instead, the game of soccer has been distilled down into its simplest form. Two goals, a pitch, a few players, and the ability for goalies to touch the ball with their hands. That’s it. And around you is a giant clear wall that stops balls from flying out of bounds. (This wall also changes during the match via fancy AR-tech to display wild settings, like being in space or in a jungle.) You can use this wall to bounce passes off at weird angles, too. </p><figure id="" data-id="0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-recommend-id="image://0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-recommend-id="image://0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When playing <em>Rematch</em>, I almost felt like a kid playing basketball on a small court in the park with my friends. We didn’t follow most of the rules. No, instead we just played a pure form of basketball that was focused on being fun and exicting, letting us do wild shit and make really dumb mistakes. <em>Rematch</em> recaptures that feeling of playing a sport in its purest, simplest form. And it’s exhilarating.</p><p><em>Rematch </em>is also filled with smart, tiny design choices that keep matches flowing. If a team goes up four goals, the game ends due to a mercy rule. No dragged-out matches against much better teams. There are four options to communicate, and if you spam any of them, like saying “Thanks” or “Sorry” too much, you’ll be blocked from using them for a bit. Anyone can be the goalie, just drop back to the goal and if you’re alone, you become the goalie, giving you increased stamina and the ability to catch and hold the ball. Don’t want to be the goalie, walk away. Simple as that.</p><p>There are no stats to manage, perks to unlock, cards to earn, or anything like that. There’s a basic battle pass system, but it’s just cosmetics like new shirts and socks. The rest of the game is lean and focused. If <em>Rematch’s </em>developers set out to make a soccer game that is badass, super fast, and very fun, that is also easy to pick up play, while having a ton of depth for those who are willing to sink dozens of hours into it, well, job well done. <em>Rematch</em> is the best soccer game I’ve ever played. And it’s one of the best games of 2025 so far. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rematch-game-ps5-xbox-game-pass-review-soccer-crossplay-1851784959]]></content:encoded>

Obviously, the fact that I or others can’t play video games comfortably is very far down on the list of problems caused by global warming. But it is still annoying, and talking to others who are experiencing this heat, it’s clear I’m not alone.<br></p><p>I live in Kansas, where we have luckily been able to avoid some of the higher temperatures seen in places like Seattle, NYC, and the UK.

More graphically impressive games on my PC cause extra heat to build up in my tiny home office. Consoles also spit out a shocking amount of hot air when you play games that push the hardware. The Xbox Series X, in particular, is very effective at expelling burning hot air at a rapid rate. This is very good for the console, of course. But it also means that I have a mini-jet engine cooking me alive. At least it’s quiet while I melt.<br></p><p>I spoke to some friends who are experiencing similar issues. Some of them are avoiding certain games on specific platforms right now because it’s too damn hot, and because running your AC all day is expensive and bad for the environment. I personally try to limit how often I run our apartment’s AC system, and if I can save some money and electricity by skipping some sessions of <em>Marvel Rivals,</em> that seems like a good trade-off.</p><p>And sure, as those folks on that once-popular show often said, “Winter is coming.” Well, first fall, <em>then </em>winter. The point is: Cooler and colder days are not too far away. But as these extreme shifts in weather and climate become more common and more extreme every year, I expect the summer months to become an even worse time to use electronics that produce tons of heat. </p><p>Of course, as things get worse, being able to play games comfortably will probably become one of my lower priorities behind things like finding water, staying cool, and fighting off roving bandits hunting down any resources they can find. Still, I’ll miss playing video games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462]]></content:encoded>

And so far, Nintendo seems unable or unwilling to legally challenge these reverse-engineered ports. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196626" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fan-made-mario-kart-64-pc-port-released-with-track-editor-and-ultrawide-support/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fan-made-mario-kart-64-pc-port-released-with-track-editor-and-ultrawide-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 20, as recently spotted by <em>VGC</em>,</a></span> a group of fan modders and devs known as Harbour Masters released a free PC port of <em>Mario Kart 64.</em> This in’t the N64 game being emulated on a PC, something people have been doing for a long time. Instead, this is a native port of <em>Mario Kart 64 </em>built for modern computers. You’ll need a ROM of the classic N64 kart racer to play this PC version of the game, one which you should, of course, obtain legally via your own backups. </p><p>Anyway, once you have that legal copy of a<em> Mario Kart 64 </em>ROM and have set up this new native PC port, you can play this beloved racing game in 4K at 120 FPS with full widescreen support using any controller of your choice. </p><p>Not only does this PC port support higher framerates and improved visuals, but you can also change how aggressive the AI racers are and even create custom tracks to share online. It’s truly amazing to see this classic N64 game running so well on a giant widescreen monitor. It’s a thing of beauty to watch in motion. </p><h2 id="h38274"><a id=""></a>Are PC ports of N64 games legal, and how do they work?</h2><p>So, how did Harbour Masters pull this off?

All you need to do is plug in the game’s ROM, which provides all the copyrighted assets like music and artwork, and the team’s PC version of<em> Mario Kart 64</em>'s code can run the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-64-has-been-ported-to-the-pc-1843249300?_gl=1*r96pgm*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA2OTUzNDUkbzQ1OSRnMSR0MTc1MDY5OTk0MCRqNDMkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-64-has-been-ported-to-the-pc-1843249300?_gl=1*r96pgm*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA2OTUzNDUkbzQ1OSRnMSR0MTc1MDY5OTk0MCRqNDMkbDAkaDA.">We saw something similar happen in 2020 with <em>Super Mario 64</em></a></span>.</p><p>You might be wondering if this is legal. Well, I’m not a lawyer, but in <em>theory</em>, these sorts of reverse-engineered ports of old games should be able to avoid Nintendo’s lawyers.

Considering how litigious Nintendo can be, the fact that these ports remain up is a sign that the company can’t do anything. Technically, they aren’t sharing any copyrighted Nintendo code or assets, so the company shouldn’t be able to sue them into oblivion. </p><p>Whatever happens to Harbour Masters and the other modders doing great work out there, I’m happy that people are making these games easily playable on modern hardware with wonderful quality-of-life features. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244?_gl=1*ffbg7y*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3MDA0MDIkbzE0MyRnMCR0MTc1MDcwMDQwNSRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244?_gl=1*ffbg7y*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3MDA0MDIkbzE0MyRnMCR0MTc1MDcwMDQwNSRqNTckbDAkaDA.">This is a great way to preserve these classic games without needing to rely on emulation or keep old consoles alive for decades</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-64-pc-port-native-emulation-legal-nintendo-1851784946]]></content:encoded>
