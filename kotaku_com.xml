              <p>Lenovo would never dare slash 74% off one of its premium laptops on its official website: That kind of discount would damage brand perception and upset customers who paid full price last month. But Amazon operates differently, quietly listing this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with Intel Core i7-13620H, 40GB RAM, and 1TB SSD for $799, down from $2,999</a>. This <strong>isn’t refurbished or open-box merchandise</strong>, it’s brand new and it hits an all-time low that makes high-performance computing accessible to people who’ve been priced out of serious laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel Core i7-13620H is a significant leap in processing power with its <strong>10-core architecture split between six performance cores and four efficiency cores</strong>. The performance cores handle heavy tasks like video editing, 3D rendering and complex spreadsheets by running <strong>at speeds up to 4.9GHz</strong> when you need maximum power.</p>
<h2>Memory and Storage Designed for Hard Work</h2>
<p>The <strong>40GB DDR5 RAM configuration is where this laptop separates itself from budget machines</strong> that struggle with basic multitasking. DDR5 represents the latest memory standard with faster data transfer rates and improved power efficiency compared to DDR4. With 40GB available, you can run virtual machines for software testing, keep Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro open simultaneously, work with massive Excel files containing thousands of rows or maintain fifty browser tabs without the system grinding to a halt.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides storage</strong> that’s fast enough to be thought of as instantaneous. Boot times are under seconds, programs launch instantly when you click on them, and large files transfer in a snap. PCIe NVMe technology reads and writes your files several times faster than older SATA SSDs so your laptop feels fast with every command you give it.</p>
<p><strong>15.3-inch WUXGA display with 1920×1200 resolution</strong> gives you extra vertical room compared to 1920×1080 standard displays. The extra 120 pixels of height makes it easier to handle docs, spreadsheets, or source code as you are able to see more content without having to scroll down. The IPS display shows you accurate colors with stable viewing angles that never diminish when tilting your monitor, while 300 nits of brightness ensures that you are always able to see the screen with clarity even under well-lit office space.</p>



<p>Connectivity is comprehensive with <strong>two USB-A ports for older devices, one USB-C jack that supports USB Power Delivery 3.0</strong> for chargin<strong>g purposes as well as DisplayPort 1.2 for external monitor support, HDMI 1.4 output for presentations and extra monitors,</strong> a headphone jack, and an SD card reader for fast transfer of photos from digital cameras.</p>
<p>At $799, this laptop beats mid-range offerings while offering specs that rival machines in the $2,000 to $2,500 range. Lenovo is not going to be trumpeting this discount publicly without jeopardizing brand position, but Amazon’s subtle listing makes it possible for anyone frustrated with paying top-of-the-line prices for high-performance computing to take advantage of it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-25000mah-laptop-power-bank-with-triple-100w-usb-c-is-now-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000637801</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-25000mah-laptop-power-bank-with-triple-100w-usb-c-is-now-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon.1330963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of battery during a long flight, a full day of meetings or a cross-country train ride turns your expensive laptop into a glorified paperweight. Power outlets at airports and coffee shops are either occupied or nonexistent and watching your battery percentage drop below 10% creates anxiety when you’re in the middle of important work. The Anker 25,000mAh laptop power bank solves this problem by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">carrying enough juice to fully charge a MacBook Pro multiple times, and it’s now available for $91, down from $134</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This power bank is unique in that it’s<strong> designed with laptops and high-power devices specifically in mind</strong> which is not usually possible with portable chargers. The <strong>25,000mAh capacity is equivalent to about 90 watt-hours of onboard energy storage</strong>, which means you can top off a standard 13-inch MacBook Air 1.5 times, a MacBook Pro 14-inch a single time fully or sustain an iPad Pro through several workdays’ worth of usage. <strong>With phones, you can expect six to eight complete charges</strong> on an iPhone 17 or Samsung Galaxy.</p>
<h2>Comparable Power Output as your Laptop Charger</h2>
<p><strong>Every one of its three USB-C ports can output up to 100W of power</strong>&nbsp;which is what most laptop chargers are capable of outputting. It makes a difference because lower-watt power banks may advertise that they can charge laptops but output power so slowly that your Battery still drains as you work. With 100W to output per port, you can fast-charge a MacBook Pro while charging a tablet and phone at top speed at the same time. <strong>Maximum output is 165W when both ports are engaged</strong>, outputting power smartly across devices that are connected.</p>



<p>The<strong> twin built-in cables</strong> eradicate portable charging’s most annoying aspect: remembering to pack the appropriate cables. One USB-C cable stretches up 2.3 feet, allowing you flexibility to keep the power bank in your bag while your laptop is on a tray table or desk top. This retractable cable is good for over 20,000 retractions so you are not working with a mechanism that fails after several months’ usage. The second USB-C cable is 0.98 feet long and serves as a carry strap as well.</p>
<p>Having four devices you can power at once changes your travel and remote-working adventures. The two onboard USB-C ports accommodate your laptop and your tablet, with <strong>another USB-C and another USB-A</strong> accommodating phones, wireless headphones, e-readers, portable gaming handhelds, or any other USB-powered devices you might want to power on your travels. In effect, you are carrying your own mobile charging depot that keeps your entire tech universe juiced up for the whole day.</p>



<p>The 100W ultra-fast recharging can therefore mean that the power bank itself is never a bottleneck. Insert it in a 100W charger and it’s up to 30% capacity in 22 minutes – quick enough to top up on a lunch break or flight layover. <strong>Recharge to 100% is 90 minutes</strong> with a suitable charger compared to lower-grade power banks which require five to six hours to fully recharge.</p>
<p>Anker made this power bank <strong>travel-friendly with airline rules in mind, holding it to 90Wh capacity, only slightly below 100Wh of capacity that most airlines place on carry-on batteries</strong>. It can be taken on planes without special permission which makes it truly practical for vacations as well as business travel.</p>
<p>At $91, this power bank costs less than many basic 10,000mAh models that can’t even charge a laptop properly. You’re getting triple the capacity, actual laptop-grade power output, built-in cables that eliminate the packing hassle, and the ability to charge multiple devices at full speed.</p>

              <p>As someone who adores the fall, spooky vibes, and Halloween, when I played<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival,</em> I fell instantly in love with it. This free online Halloween-themed mini-MMO features pumpkin carving, spooky places to explore, and much more. And it’s available to play now on PC and Mac. But don’t wait too long, as the servers shut off shortly after Halloween.</p> <p>Developed by Adam “adamgryu” Robinson-Yu, the creator behind cozy indie game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700">A Short Hike</a>, <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver">Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</a></em> has become an annual tradition. Each year, in the middle of October,<a href="https://x.com/adamgryu/status/1978913908543951324?"> adamgryu reopens <em>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> for a few weeks</a> and players flood in, filling the spooky streets and hills of the game with jack-o-lanterns as far as the eye can see. And each year, the indie developer has expanded the online pumpkin-carving MMO with new places to explore. This year, players can watch public domain horror films in the newly opened theater. There’s also a haunted hay ride, a creepy mansion to explore, a corn maze, and many secrets to discover either alone or alongside other players, who appear as cute ghosts.</p>

  <p>I simply adore<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival.</em> So often, when Halloween rolls around, devs and publishers release scary horror games. And while I enjoy those, I often wish we got more games that let you experience the immaculate vibes of a cool night during October. A night with carved pumpkins dotting the landscape and campy Halloween decorations everywhere you look. And <em>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> nails those vibes perfectly.</p>

 <p>Even better, the jack-o-lanterns you see in the game were carved and placed by real people using the MMO’s fantastic, intuitive, and flexible pumpkin carving tool. Pick a pumpkin, spin it around, and start carving into it. You can also scrape spots of the pumpkin away, giving you more options for shading and decoration. Some people do simple faces or funny jokes, and others create elaborate pieces of art. All of these pumpkins can be liked, and once a day, you can award a medal to your favorite.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637793" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637793"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637793">©<span><span>adamgryu / Kotaku</span></span></figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve spent the past few days logging into<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> for half an hour or so to see all the new carved pumpkins, give my favorites a like, and then just chill in the cozy-creepy vibes of the festival and the surrounding city and hills. If you love Halloween or have small kids who enjoy spooky stuff, <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver">I highly recommend downloading<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> ASAP</a>. If you want, you can even pay to download the game and unlock exclusive cosmetic items. Either way, Halloween fans are in for a treat.</p>
