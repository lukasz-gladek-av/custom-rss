              <p>Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to <em>The Sims 4</em>? Why is <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em> objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at <em>Kotaku</em> experiment with reviving our <a href="https://kotaku.com/culture/morning-checkpoint">old Morning Checkpoint roundup series</a> that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first <em>Call of Duty</em> developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go!</p> <h2><em>The Sims 5</em> wouldn’t be ‘player friendly’</h2> <p>That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">told <em>Variety</em></a> when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. “What I wouldn’t want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that you’ve purchased over the years,” she said. “We put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on <em>The Sims 4</em>, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.” What fans are getting is a <em>Sims</em> movie <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-ea-1851355482">with help from <em>Barbie</em>‘s Margot Robbie</a>. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p> <h2>One sequel we are getting is <em>Darksiders 4</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Darksiders 4 - Announce Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_Wx2qlbdOM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> testers win second Microsoft gaming union contract</h2> <p>Quality assurance devs at <em>Call of Duty</em> support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-to-1847362030">amid the 2021 workplace fallout,</a> but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at <em>Updater</em> <a href="https://shannonliao.substack.com/p/3-years-later-they-won?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">now reports</a> that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao.</p>

 <h2>Global warming will make it harder to play Switch 2 outside</h2> <p>Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/heat-records-broken-japan-heatwave-climate-change-5275641">continuing to blaze through temperature records</a>. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651">posted</a>. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5–35°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-climate-change-temperature-handheld-1849168252">back in 2022</a>. Everything is <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462">going great</a>, folks.</p> <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors</em> is getting a super, secret remaster</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS 25th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qlDkMLMoSg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the <em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlDkMLMoSg">celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-beginner-tips-upgrade-skirmish-1851744251"><em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em></a>, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> <em>3</em>, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games?</p> <h2>Fight censorship, get free games</h2> <p>Over 1 million people claimed the <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/">FreedomToBuy bundle</a> from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1951999439024869715">the storefront reports</a>. It included <em>Postal 2</em>, <em>Agon</em>y, <em>Fetish Locator Week One</em>, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">due to payment processors</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> isn’t getting delayed</h2> <p>The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/">near the end of August</a>. A November release date is feeling more and more likely.</p> <h2>Happy 40th Birthday Rare</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614509"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614509">8bitdo</figcaption></figure> <p>Someone on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/1mh6aho/new_wireless_8bitdo_xbox_controller_leaked_on/">found a leaked Amazon listing</a> for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">the 40th anniversary</a> of Rare, the studio best known for<em> Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, among other iconic classics. It’s $90 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ?tag=kotaku01-20">looks very nice</a>.

              <p><span>After 10 years, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-marquet-third-campaign-asian-cultures-col-1848500055"><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>‘s</span></a><span> fourth campaign will be the webseries’ first without </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-cassidy-critical-role-matthew-mercer-twitch-1850538440"><span>Matthew Mercer</span></a><span> serving as game master. The actual play show (and, now, multimedia franchise) began in 2015, and since then Mercer has led all three campaigns, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-subscription-beacon-twitch-youtube-1851469461"><span>which you can listen to</span></a><span> on the group’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@criticalrole/podcasts"><span>YouTube channel</span></a><span>. Campaign IV, however, will be led by Brennan Lee Mulligan, a frequent collaborator with the group and the dungeon master of another actual play series called </span><i><span>Dimension 20</span></i><span>. Mulligan’s years of experience and familiarity with </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>make him one of the most well-suited candidates to take the reins of a new campaign. Fans erupted into thunderous applause when Mulligan was brought on stage during the group’s Indianapolis live show over the weekend, but this is still a big change, and the </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>community has feelings on the matter.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Critical Role Direct: Campaign 4 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mEuwZbNde2s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Mulligan was broadly welcomed with open arms, but many </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span> fans noted they were sad to see Mercer step down from the GM role, even if he will be a part of the campaign as a player. Fans were also taken aback by the announcement that Campaign IV will take place in a new setting, rather than returning to Exandria, the setting in which the first three campaigns took place. While diehards are mourning a fantasy setting they’ve been invested in for a decade along with Mercer’s shift out of the GM’s chair, this likely will make Campaign IV a better entry point for newcomers, as they won’t have to catch up on years of lore to jump in and watch.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'll watch, continue subscribing, etc. But would be lying if I didn't say it breaks my heart that Matt isn't GM'ing and some of the core cast isn't returning.</p> <p>If anyone could succeed Matt it's Brennan, but man.</p> <p>— Jolly Roger (@JollyRogX) <a href="https://twitter.com/JollyRogX/status/1951835783054360659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know I’m in the minority, but I’m not excited about the “new world.” Was really looking forward to how things would unfold on Exandria given how the last campaign ended.</p> <p>— Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1951851585316720645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don’t know how I feel about this… Excited for a new story and world tho.

              <p>In one of GameStop’s many scrambles to stay alive beyond its memestock status, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-gme-pokemon-card-trade-ins-psa-charizard-1851470574">the stores began buying graded <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards last year</a>. Now the company has found a way to sell them back to you, but in a wildly bad mystery box deal.</p> <p>GameStop’s attempt to behave like your local TCG store could only ever have been a bizarre corporate pastiche of the concept. When you go to your local independent card shop and trade in your pulls, they’ll usually give you a fair price that still leaves decent room for the store to resell them at a profit. When GameStop started doing it, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-trade-in-gamestop-youtube-leonhart-1851489326">without providing the staff with the necessary training and expertise</a>, and naturally saw them paying woefully low prices, and of course without any of the individual stores having any independence over how it was carried out. The result of all that is now far more clear: for the last three months, GameStop has been selling graded cards back to customers in the form of mystery boxes, with the second phases of this initiative just launched. And wow, they’re not worth it.</p> <p>Three months ago, the incredibly popular Pokémon YouTuber PokeRev <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGiE5hz7zI">opened the first wave of these mystery boxes</a>, called GameStop Power Packs. At that point, these $60 boxes contained three “random” booster packs plus one PSA-graded card, at a grade of 8 or higher. The boxes showed an image of a Lost Origin Giratina V alt-art in a grade 10, which <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-lost-origin/giratina-v-186?q=giratina+v+186">today would cost you over $1,600</a>. That’d sure be nice to find. But just like the infamously terrible Walmart equivalent MJ Holding mystery boxes which do the same daft trick of putting extraordinarily rare packs on their boxes, that’s not what you’re likely to discover inside.</p>

 <p>To be fair to GameStop, their presentation is at least a little nicer–Walmart’s mystery boxes are flimsy cardboard with the various items rattling loose inside. GameStop’s go the other way, with so much of the cost clearly going into the sturdy box, folding lid, and bespoke foam inset. But yeah, the chances of finding $60-worth of goodies inside seems incredibly slim.</p> <p>This second wave of Power Packs has maintained the $60 price, but now only have two booster packs instead of three! Those packs, as revealed in PokeRev’s latest video on the boxes, seem to be two of Surging Sparks, 151, or Journey Together. That’s about $10 to $15 worth. The graded cards then seem to come in around $15 to $30, meaning most boxes will get you contents worth from half to two-thirds of what you paid. Which…sucks! $60 for $30 of cards.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gamestop's New Power Packs are Kinda Weird" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/irST4sbj3Yg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>There is, of course, the chance that the packs could contain a valuable card, but it’s not high, and no better than just buying the packs themselves for their actual price. The one positive I can find is that at least the PSA-graded cards aren’t just bulk. From watching plenty of those MJ Holding boxes getting opened that contain graded cards, those will very often feature a grade 7 generic card from a recent set, worth far, far less than it would have cost to grade it in the first place. Instead, what’s shown for GameStop’s seem to be at least some classic cards from the early 00s, both Japanese and English, even if they themselves aren’t worth more than small change.</p> <p>We don’t know if these PSA cards are solely sourced from what’s been sold to GameStop stores over the last year, or if the company is buying them in bulk from other suppliers, but a combination of the two would make most sense. Either way, given the stores will have paid far less than they’re worth when they’re traded in, and are then being sold back in boxes that the majority of the time charge twice as much as the contents are worth, it’s clearly a very profitable venture for the company. But it’s definitely not one worth spending your money on. You’re far better off visiting your local independent store, or buying graded cards from trusted online marketplaces, so you can be sure you’re spending your money on the card you really want.</p>

              <p>Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">quietly raised the price</a> of almost every piece of gaming hardware and accessory it sells over the weekend, with the Switch 2 itself being one of the few exceptions. <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1951281524642386119">Some experts</a> believe it’s only a matter of time before the <em>Mario Kart World</em> machine gets more expensive too, thanks to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">ongoing tariffs</a>, but for now here’s the full list of all of Nintendo’s latest price hikes on 8-year-old consoles and more that went into effect starting August 3.</p> <h2>Consoles</h2> <ul> <li>Switch Lite: $230 (was $200)</li> <li>Switch Standard: $340 (was $300)</li> <li>Switch OLED: $400 (was $350)</li> </ul> <h2>Controllers</h2> <ul> <li>NES Switch Online: $70 (was $60)</li> <li>SNES Switch Online: $30 (was $35</li> <li>Genesis Switch Online: $55 (was $50)</li> <li>N64 Switch Online: $55 (was $50)</li> <li>GameCube Switch Online: $70 (was $65)</li> <li>Switch 1 Joy-Con: $90 (was $80)</li> <li>Switch 1 Pro: $80 (was $70)</li> <li>Switch 2 Joy-Con: $95 (was $90)</li> <li>Switch 2 Pro: $90 (was $85)</li> </ul> <h2>Other accessories</h2> <ul> <li>Amiibo: $20 (was $16)</li> <li>Switch 2 Dock: $125 (was $120)</li> </ul> <p>The Switch 2 has escaped the latest round of price increases for now and still sits at $450. If anything, the latest move should help spur more people to upgrade now that the older consoles are closer in price and the Switch 2 is only likely to go up in price rather than down as was common in previous console generations. The impact of <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">President Trump’s trade war tariffs</a> on accessories, however, is particularly rough. Controllers tend to break more quickly than the consoles themselves (especially if you have small kids). This is already the second price hike the Switch 2 Joy-Con and controller have received this year. Both are now more expensive than even the Switch 2’s priciest games. I’ll be taking extra special care of mine.</p>
