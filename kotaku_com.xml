              <p>McDonald’s released its new holiday meal, and there’s some good (and tasty) news for fans of the fast-food chain’s French fries. Thanks to the Grinch, McShaker fries are finally going to be available in the United States</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/the-grinch-meal-coming-to-mcdonalds.html">McDonald’s new limited-time-only Grinch Meal became available around the country</a>. The Christmas-themed meal, which comes with a pair of limited-time festive holiday socks, is packaged in special bags featuring the Grinch and contains a medium drink, 10 McNuggets or a Big Mac, and some Dill Pickle “Grinch Salt” McShaker Fries. It’s that last item that has some fast-food lovers excited.</p> <p><a href="https://mcdonalds.fandom.com/wiki/Shake_Shake_Fries">McShaker Fries appear to be a US version of Shake Shake Fries,</a> a concept that has been around for many, many years in places like Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan. The fries have also popped up for limited runs in Canada, the United Kingdom, as well as India. Shake Shake Fries come packaged with a seasoning packet and a bag. You dump the fries and seasoning into the bag, close the top, and, well, as the name implies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Hj_6TvmsEwI">shake it a few times</a> to cover the fries in tasty dust. The concept has never made its way to the United States until now.</p>

 <p>Early reactions to the Grinch’s dill pickle McShaker Fries are pretty positive, with people hoping McDonald’s keeps the concept around past Christmas and maybe even expands on it with some of the flavors found in other parts of the world. Personally, I’m not a pickle guy at all, so these fries sound awful, but I’m excited to see Shake Shake Fries brought over to the US, even if it is part of a Grinch-themed bundle.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as you are already here and reading about limited-time fast-food meals, <a href="https://news.bk.com/blog-posts/burger-king-r-invites-guests-to-dive-into-a-sea-of-flavor-with-all-new-spongebob-tm-movie-menu">Burger King announced a new <em>SpongeBob</em> movie menu</a>. This menu includes a slice of pie and a real Krabby Patty. It also comes in some delightful-looking SpongeBob-themed packaging that will no doubt be sold for $50 or more on eBay by the end of this week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Might Be A Good Excuse To Upgrade To Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-comparison-graphics-2000650153</link>
            <guid>1371907</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever worn glasses, then you know this feeling well: Pop on your lenses and, bam, the world is in HD. That’s not a bad way to describe the difference between <i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> running on the original Switch vs. the new Switch 2.</p> <p>Having shipped on both consoles, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> is a <i>prime</i> opportunity to get a sense of the clear technical differences between Nintendo’s newest console and its last-gen hardware. Sure, we know the Switch 2 is powerful, flexing its GPU muscles with <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> and some <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">excellent ports of demanding open-world Ubisoft games</a>. But <i>Metroid</i> is a first-party exclusive, so it’s a great opportunity to see the differences when <i>just</i> Nintendo’s hardware is the target.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">Ubisoft’s Becoming The King Of Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p>The result? The Switch 2 damn sure renders a pretty picture for our gal Samus’ latest adventure. That said, the OG Switch, while it has a softer image, still looks and runs well enough. The load times though…yeesh. <a href="https://youtu.be/mMc1oik78Vc">This comparison video</a> from ElAnalistaDeBits shows the differences in motion:</p>

  <h2>Switch 2 has a crisper image, and performance mode looks slick</h2> <p>Switch 2 on both quality and performance modes shows a clear advantage when it comes to a higher resolution and clearer images. The performance mode is a touch softer, but you’re trading a bit of fidelity for 120 frames per second. And if you don’t think a framerate that high is worth it, as a former skeptic of anything higher than 60 FPS being worthwhile, I must tell you that you’re wrong.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650159"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650159">© Screenshot: Nintendo / ElAnalistaDeBits / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Switch 1 ain’t nothin’ to sneeze at…but you’re gonna wanna grab a coffee while it loads</h2> <p>If you’re like me and all you have laying around is an original Switch, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> doesn’t look too terrible. And it runs at 60 FPS, which is swell. But perhaps the worst part of running the game on a classic Switch is you’ll be waiting a long time for it to load. The comparison video above shows a loading sequence that only takes the Switch 2 a mere 24 seconds, while the OG console loads in at over a minute and four seconds. Reminds me of playing <i>The Witcher 3</i> on PS4 (still had a great time! But man did I do a lotta waiting).</p>

 <h2>If you’re looking for an excuse to upgrade, <i>Metroid</i> might just be it</h2> <p>Sometimes ya gotta make due with the hardware you have. But if you’ve got some cash burning a hole in your pocket and you’re ready to step into Nintendo’s next generation, and you love <i>Metroid</i>, it seems like the Switch 2 version might make the upgrade worth it. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond"><i>Nintendo Life</i> puts it in their review of <i>Beyond</i></a>, once you see the “next-gen” version in motion, it’s hard to go back:</p> <blockquote><p>Playing this on Switch 1 when docked feels fine enough, but that crispness, that pop, that ludicrously intricate, high-contrast detail, it’s just a bit fuzzy and pixelly by comparison. I personally feel it’s almost the direct antithesis to <i>Pokémon Legends Z-A</i>, which actually felt as though the art style was more cohesive on the weaker platform. Textures have taken an understandable hit, and models that are further away can look quite smeary, but overall the game still looks good. I just can’t help but compare it unfavourably to Switch 2.</p></blockquote> <p>Again, given that the original console runs the game at 60 frames per second, I’d wager the experience of playing the game will still feel good enough, even if it’s a little soft compared to what the latest hardware can deliver. But what are upgrades for if we’re not getting prettier pixels? If you do snag&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em> for the OG Switch and end up acquiring a Switch 2 down the line, you can also upgrade the Switch 1 version to the prettier Switch 2 version for an extra 10 bucks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wd-5tb-my-passport-falls-to-0-02-per-gb-as-amazon-goes-no-margin-on-storage-deals-post-cyber-monday-2000649736</link>
            <guid>1371853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve been banging the drum for deals on reliable, large-capacity portable HDDs for a long time now. Honestly, going without one is really like doing a high-wire act without a net, because having only the one copy of your most sensitive and essential files that lives on your laptop or desktop leaves you one mishap away from losing them forever.</p>
<p>Cyber Week’s one of the best opportunities to get protection for your irreplaceable data, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">one of the best deals still on the board is this one at Amazon on the 5TB version of the WD My Passport external hard drive, which is just $121</a>. That’s a 16% drop from the regular $145, and it’s a stellar price for an external drive with this sort of capacity and reliability from a trusted brand like Western Digital — in fact, it’s the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch portable hard drive. Be sure to click the black model of this palm-sized drive — inexplicably, the blue and red ones are still running at full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ransomware Protection</h2>
<p>External HDDs tend to be fairly static devices, aside from shrinking in physical size and growing in capacity. Beyond that, the features have remained mostly the same. Except now, WD has added software to the My Passport HDD that includes robust protection against the ever-growing and constantly evolving threat of ransomware.</p>
<p>A virus or malware can get into not only your laptop or desktop but also into its peripheral devices, including your portable hard drive. Once there it can install ransomware, which locks you out of your files until you pay a ransom to the hacker. The Acronis True Image for Western Digital software preloaded on the My Passport HDD not only helps you schedule automatic backups, it helps protect your entire system from ransomware, and also allows you to password-protect and give your files 256-bit AES encryption.</p>



<h2>Smaller and Faster</h2>
<p>The WD My Passport HDD comes preformatted for Windows, but can easily be reformatted for use with Macs without losing any of its protective features. WD’s given it a slimming-down from its previous models too – this streamlined version of the My Passport is just 3.21 by 4.33 inches, and exceedingly slim, so you can fit up to 5TB of your most essential files in your pocket to take with you anywhere, and its footprint at your desktop or work station is virtually nil.</p>
<p>It connects via USB-A 3.0, but it’s also compatible with USB-A 2.0 devices, and the 5Gbps data transfer speed allows you to move files to or from your PC or Mac laptop or desktop computers quickly and easily. It can be set up for automatic backups, and is also drag-and-drop ready from the time you connect it.</p>
<p>Those digital photos and videos on your computer need protection in the form of a large-capacity, fast, ultra-reliable backup drive that fits in your pocket and comes with advanced protection. So do your financial records and other sensitive personal information. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">The WD My Passport 5TB portable external hard drive — the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch drive — checks all those boxes, and it’s a great Cyber Week find at just $121 at Amazon.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-flygon-evolution-2000650137</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I waited over a decade for Raichu to get a Mega Evolution, so I sympathize with anyone who has a beloved Pokémon they’re hoping might get one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> upcoming </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. Now that my favorite electric rat has not just one, but </span><i><span>two </span></i><span>Mega Evolutions, the title for “most oppressed Pokémon fan waiting for a Mega Evolution” now goes to the Flygon stans, and they’re really going through it.</span></p> <p><span>Flygon was first introduced in </span><i><span>Pokémon Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>, and the dragon/ground-type beast has been a fan favorite ever since. It’s easy to see why. The insectoid dragon oozes cool while also being kinda cute in that uniquely </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> kind of way. He is very </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJk3wrvL6To"><span>“friend-shaped”</span></a><span> and also a powerhouse in battle, giving him all the makings of a generation of fans’ favorite critter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Flygon was famously one of the Pokémon originally slated to get a Mega Evolution in the 3DS era when the mechanic was introduced, only for the idea to later get </span><a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2015/04/mega-flygon-excluded-from-xyoras-because-of-artists-block"><span>scrapped because Game Freak couldn’t nail down the design</span></a><span>. With </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>bringing back Mega Evolution and introducing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>new forms for old monsters</span></a><span>, Flygon fans have been crossing all their fingers hoping that the long-lost Mega might finally make its grand debut.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But every time Game Freak announces a new Mega Evolution that isn’t for Flygon, the light continues to dwindle from their eyes.</span></p>     <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Flygon vendo Lucario ganhar a segunda mega: <a href="https://t.co/I6Emz5f7hw">pic.twitter.com/I6Emz5f7hw</a></p> <p>— Vida de Treinador (@VidaDeTreinador) <a href="https://twitter.com/VidaDeTreinador/status/1995871382920724580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Mega flygon está oficialmente MORTO<br>Não vai ter nem na DLC <a href="https://t.co/ENLLqkB9km">pic.twitter.com/ENLLqkB9km</a></p> <p>— rayquaza, pokemon até namorar #Chronoverso (@azarco91) <a href="https://twitter.com/azarco91/status/1977865459157356882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>What makes this even more painful is that there was a brief flicker of hope in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>first trailer for the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, which showed a portal filled with Mega Stones, one of which appeared to have Flygon’s color scheme, but thus far, no Mega has materialized in the DLC’s promotion.</span></p>   <p><span>Unfortunately, with each new reveal seemingly confirming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670"><span>previous leaks</span></a><span> that don’t include Mega Flygon, it seems like the dream is well and truly dead. Unless Game Freak brings back Mega Evolutions in another decade? Maybe the third time will be the charm. I don’t know if Flygon fans can handle another big setback</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toshiba 50″ Smart Fire TV Goes Into Clearance Mode at 51% Off, Amazon’s Deeper Post–Black Friday Discount Move]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/toshiba-50-smart-fire-tv-51-off-clearance-black-friday-2000649749</link>
            <guid>1371805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to blow your budget; if you know where to look. The biggest shopping events of the year – aka Cyber Monday and Black Friday – are officially behind us, but not all deals have expired. We’re still spotting plenty of great discounts across a range of categories, so whether you missed grabbing a new TV or a tech gadget, there’s still a chance to save.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/">Right now, Amazon is offering an unbelievable 51% discount on the 50-inch Toshiba Class C350 Series LED 4K smart Fire TV</a>. It typically sits at $350, but this discount brings its price down to just $170. The offer is open to all shoppers, meaning both Prime and non-Prime members can snap it up. Even better, there are no delivery charges to worry about, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too. There’s a catch, though. The discount is selling out fast, so there’s not a lot of time left to save. Lingering deals such as this one are hardly around for a couple of days before getting back to their original price. If you’ve been looking to bag a smart screen for less, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Visuals</h2>
<p>The 50-inch size isn’t massive, but also not too small. It’s ideal for bedrooms, smaller living areas, and anyone who is not a fan of screens taking up an entire wall. Toshiba packs it with its revolutionary REGZA Engine ZR, which uses precise analyzing technology. The Super Contrast Booster maximizes the depth of picture color, keeping it as accurate as possible. This is paired with the brand’s exceptional AI upscaling technology, which, instead of replicating every pixel, detects the colors of neighboring pixels. It then considers the detailed texture of the real sight to decide a color for each pixel. Translation? You’ll enjoy every moment on the screen with the clarity of 4K quality.</p>
<p>Blur is actively reduced during fast-paced sequences with Ultimate Motion. There’s also a Game mode, which supports a whole bunch of gaming features, such as ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), and eARC. Combine this mode with Ultimate Motion, and you’ll be able to play your favorite titles in a much smoother manner; great for those upcoming holiday game nights. Visuals are only part of the experience, though. Sound matters just as much, and for that, the TV supports Dolby Atmos for a realistic, room-filling audio. You won’t just get to see your favorite scenes coming to life; you’ll experience them in a realistic way.</p>



<p>Fire TV support brings all your favorite content and streaming platforms to a single place, so you’re never going to be out of stuff to watch. Think Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney, Peacock, and more. Most of these require subscriptions, but if you’re not a fan of that, you can always access plenty of free, ad-supported platforms through it just as well.</p>
<p><span>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to grab a brand new display without shelling out big bucks, now is a good time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/">This deal takes a whopping $180 off its retail price, bringing it down to a much more affordable range.</a> Just make sure to grab yours fast, as discounts such as this one don’t last too long.</span></p>
