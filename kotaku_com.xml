              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s</a>&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>DLC was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708">contentious announcement</a> when Game Freak and Nintendo confirmed its existence before the RPG launched last month, but whether you’re thrilled about paying an extra $30 on top of the base game or not, the expansion is coming and it’s actually launching pretty soon. Game Freak announced today that <em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on December 10, and it released a ton of new footage alongside it showing some returning characters, new Mega Evolutions, and what looks like a pretty sizable post-game story.</p>  <p>As we knew from the original announcement,&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>will include Hoopa, the dimension-jumping legendary Pokémon, opening rifts to what looks like a different version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431">Lumiose City</a> that includes new wild Pokémon. We see a few monsters not native to the Kalos city, including Chimecho, Baxcalibur, and Corviknight in the trailer, the latter two of which are getting new Mega Evolutions as part of the expansion. The DLC also includes some new and returning characters, including <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>gym leader Korrina, who is referenced in the main game but never shown.</p>

 <p>Apparently Pokémon will be able to exceed level 100 in this alternate dimension, so if you’re going to play the expansion, make sure you’ve got a maxed out team ready to take on whatever challenges await. That said, it does look like one of the new characters, Ansha, will be able to help upgrade your team, so you won’t be completely washed if you’re using some weaker ‘mons.</p>  <p>While the full expansion is a month away, if you log in to&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>now, you can take part in a new, free side quest that will add the legendary Pokémon Diancie to your party, and comes with its Mega Evolution stone. You’ll just need to use the online Mystery Gift function to claim the stone, then complete the quest alongside Emma, Lumiose’s Naruto-running detective.</p>
