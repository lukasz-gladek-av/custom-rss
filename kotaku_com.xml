But what there <em>isn’t</em> is a new <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210">we’d like to hear someone explain why not</a></span>. It’s outrageous. The 1960s TV show has games. The first of Cruise’s movies, 1996's <em>Mission: Impossible,</em> has a game. (No Tom Cruise likeness <em>in </em>the game, though.) Why aren’t I playing the <em>Just Cause-</em>like game<em>&nbsp;</em>based on the franchise right now? I demand answers. But in the meantime, let’s look back at all the games that <em>do</em> exist, and wonder quietly to ourselves if that was actually a good idea.</p></div><div><p>The very first <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game, albeit an unofficial one, came out in 1979. And no, that’s not a typo. Scott Adams (no, thank god, not the <em>Dilbert</em> one) and Irene Adams made a series of text adventures after being inspired by Scott’s colleagues who created the seminal <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em> in 1976. Widely considered to be a joint founders of the entire genre, the Adamses made a series of text adventure games (what you kids now call Interactive Fiction) for the TRS-80 in the late ‘70s, one of which was originally called <em>Mission Impossible </em>(without the distinctive colon that’s officially in the title of the TV shows and movies)<em>.</em></p><p>Things were a bit of a wild west back then, given that there wasn’t really a vast home gaming industry. The game featured a spy called Phelps after the main character of the original show, who begins sat in front of a tape recorder containing a message that begins much like those on the show often did. “Good morning Mr. Phelps. Your Mission (should you decide to accept it) is to prevent this automated nuclear reactor from being destroyed by a saboteur’s TIME BOMB!” Perhaps it’s not surprising that the owners of the TV show  threatened legal action.</p><p>This led to all manner of names ending up attached to the game, the most common being <em>Secret Mission</em>, which was added to the already-printed boxes via a cheaply produced gold sticker. It’s something of a joy that one of the first ever popular text adventures should be such a brazen rip-off.</p></div><div><p>Tempting as it is to include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ivHFP3dJAkM?si=g7NEpA5WDt7Zu3Bf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ivHFP3dJAkM?si=g7NEpA5WDt7Zu3Bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the fantastic <em>Impossible Mission</em> platform/puzzle games</a></span> of the 1980s in this list, they don’t really count, though they <em>do </em>still feature the greatest somersaults in gaming history. So instead we jump forward to 1990, when the Nintendo Entertainment System was blessed with a game based on the short-lived 1988 reboot of the TV series. </p><p>This time we have an officially licensed game, developed by Konami, that was released just in time to mark the TV version’s cancellation after just 35 episodes. (The original 60s/70s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> ran for 171 episodes, with Leonard Nimoy appearing in 49 of them.) The IMF team is tasked with rescuing Jane Badler’s character, Shannon Reed, along with “Dr. O,” an IMF scientist, all through the magic of top-down 1990 action.</p><p>You could switch between three characters, Max Harte, Grant Collier and Nicholas Black, each with their own skills as they charged through Venice, Switzerland, and all those good Eurozone adventure locations. </p></div><div><p>It’s a year later, and there’s a second licensed game from the franchise! But this time, it’s a graphic adventure! This time <em>published</em> by Konami but developed by Distinctive Software, makers of many a TV/movie tie-in game, this was very much an attempt to muscle in on Sierra’s territory, complete with a near lift of Sierra’s distinctive row of interaction options across the top of the screen.</p><p>It was then made more complicated by playing in real-time, with four characters to control at once as you tracked down terrorists, bugged phones and infiltrated enemy HQs. Only Jim Phelps appears to have made it over from the TV shows, however, with new characters to chose from, including the extraordinarily spelt “Rodger.”</p><p>What’s so surprising about this game is that I’d simply never heard of it, despite being 14 years old at the time of its release and playing every graphic adventure I could get my hands on. However, its midi rendition of the theme tune really should have made it an all-time classic. </p></div><div><p>Slipping subtly past Micro Games of America’s 1996 dedicated handheld game based on the series, we next find the spies appearing in video games in 1998, with the Tom Cruise era of <em>Mission: Impossible </em>now underway. And it’s on N64 (and a year later, PlayStation). Sometimes known as <em>Mission: Impossible - Expect the Impossible</em>, this console game was intended to be a tie-in with the first of the Cruise-led movies. Except, keen chronologers will note, 1998 was two years after 1996.</p><p>This was originally supposed to be created by Ocean, a studio famous for its movie-based games. Think <em>RoboCop</em>, <em>Platoon</em>, <em>Total Recall</em>, and <em>Lethal Weapon</em>, all improbably realized as side-scrolling action games. That wasn’t the plan this time, however—ambitions were far higher. <em>Mission: Impossible </em>was an attempt to create something in the style of Rare’s <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, and, well, it wasn’t going great.</p><p>After three years in development, and the slow realization that the N64 wasn’t powerful enough for their plans, Ocean was bought by Infogrames in 1997, and a whole new team was assigned to the project. Apparently at that time, the game was running <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/03/18/men-on-a-mission&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/03/18/men-on-a-mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at four frames per second</a></span>. Things were made harder by Viacom, owners of the film rights, refusing to let the game feature too much gun-based violence, and Tom Cruise refusing to allow his face to be in games The new team wound up crunching for months.</p><p>Yet, despite all this, it went on to sell over a million copies, even though its reviews weren’t exactly great. A late ‘90s <em>IGN</em> went as low as a 6.6, which was about as a low a score as the site back then would give. </p></div><div><p>It was four long years between Brian de Palma’s original Tom Cruise movie and John Woo’s somewhat unlikely follow-up. So it was that as late as 1999, the Game Boy Color’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game was still based on that first film. But this time it was as all movie-based games should be: an isometric action game. </p><p>Incredibly, this belated tie-in was the work of developer Rebellion, who that same year brought us the landmark <em>Alien Versus Predator</em> on PC, and are now best known for an infinite number of <em>Sniper Elite</em> games (as well as this year’s <em>Atomfall</em>). There were all sorts of ambitious ideas, including an entirely game-irrelevant Agent Action Kit that let you use your GBC as a calculator, address book, and a notebook that could print stuff out on your Game Boy Printer. Sadly, none of these were part of the game itself, which was deeply mediocre.</p></div><div><p><em>Mission: Impossible - Operation Surma</em> came out in 2003 on PS2, alongside a very different and much worse version on Game Boy Advance. It seems unfair to put them into the same slide, given they’re made by entirely different developers.</p><p>By this point, Infogrames had begun wearing the ill-fitting skin of the long-dead Atari, and like so many games of the era, had two lots of developers make two versions of a game with the same name. For the GBA, it was M4 Ltd, a small UK developer that seemingly only made GBA games based on existing licenses. So alongside <em>Antz World Sportz</em> and <em>Mary-Kate and Ashley: Winner’s Circle</em>, they also created the handheld incarnation of the movie tie-in.</p><p>Set between the events of <em>Mission: Impossibles 2 </em>and <em>III</em>, <em>Operation Surma </em>finds our espionaging heroes trying to stop the evil Surma group from releasing a virus called ICEWORM which can disable any type of security system. As you’d expect, you go all over the world in your efforts, although on the GBA version you do this in painfully static 2D, rather than in the PS2 version’s 3D action. </p><p>This version got an absolute kicking by the press, with <em>Cheat Code Central</em> stating, “I would have had more fun gluing spray-painted macaroni to my ass than playing <em>Mission Impossible: Operation Surma</em> on the GBA.”</p></div><div><p>OK, so this version was far better received, although not exactly widely loved. It was, as you can tell from the video, an <em>entirely</em> different game from the GBA incarnation. (As I say, this was common, but didn’t always end badly. The <em>Tony Hawk</em> GBA games, for instance, were masterpieces.)</p><p>A third-person action game, it was packed with missions, spy tech, and a big cast of characters. And, rather importantly, it was attempting not to recreate the plot of one of the movies, but rather to bridge the time between the second and third films in the franchise.</p><p>Developed by Texan team Paradigm Entertainment, who were best known for the N64's <em>Pilotwings 64</em>,  it was a perfect example of that most damned gaming territories: fine. It was fine. As 7/10 as a game can be. It tried to do loads, it had excellent ambitions, but it all just fell a little flat without ever being bad.</p><p>Yet, as Zack laments, it also marked the last console-based attempt to make a <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game. Why? Perhaps enough average-to-bad games had convinced Atari that the license wasn’t proving likely to get results? Or perhaps people were just fed up with Tom Cruise for being such a bloody spoilsport, and not letting his face or voice appear in any of the games. (Incidentally, Ving Rhames and John Polson showed up to voice their characters in <em>Operation Surma</em>!)</p></div><div><p>That’s right, we get near to the end of our round-up of every <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game ever with 2006's <em>Mission: Impossible III</em>, the mobile-only tie-in for the 2006 J.J. Abrams threequel. </p><p>Created by Gameloft, who have also brought us <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> and <em>Sexy Poker: Top Models</em> (alongside the <em>Asphalt </em>franchise and a billion other mobile IPs), this game was only ever released for phones, as were numerous other licensed Gameloft games of the era.</p><p>Was it any good? I don’t know! It was released for mobile only in 2006! The game’s in portrait. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-iii/review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-iii/review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pocket Gamer </em>liked it at the time</a></span>, though, and while Carolyn here on staff hasn’t played it, she’s heard good things about a number of Gameloft’s mobile-only efforts of the era.</p></div><div><p>I don’t think anyone’s ever even heard of this web-only game from developers Funtactix, and having watched the video above, I think that may be for the best.</p></div><div><p>Glu Mobile’s 2015 tie-in <em>Rogue Nation </em>looks like a visually impressive gallery shooter, at least<em>. </em>In his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation/review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation/review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief review of the game for <em>Pocket Gamer</em></a></span>, Ric Cowley says all that probably needs to be said about it: “If you stick with it, there’s a perfectly average game in here. But it’s so repetitive that you’ll have seen everything it has to offer in ten minutes.” </p><p>It’s now been over 20 years since there was a proper <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game for console or PC, despite the movies being such a massive deal. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210">Zack correctly laments</a></span>, this is a series ripe for a fantastic video game. It’s somehow never received one. Perhaps making that hypothetical, great <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game is the most impossible mission of all.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After weeks of tragically ensnaring some of the puzzle adventure’s biggest fans, a new patch fixes the issue alongside implementing a nerf for an infinite item exploit. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197541" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Civilization VII’s Latest Update Finally Feels Like The Game Fans Were Promised" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="147" data-playlist="197541,196447,195410" data-current="197541"><div><p>Civilization VII’s Latest Update Finally Feels Like The Game Fans Were Promised</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197541/197541_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197541/197541_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197541/197541_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23067.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“This issue was caused by a duplication of save data causing new save information to time out and not be saved,” the game’s developer, Tonda Ros, posted on Steam. “This problem has now been addressed and players should have no issues progressing and saving the game past the point where the bug was initially encountered.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-metacritic-game-pass-ps-plus-switch-1851775306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-metacritic-game-pass-ps-plus-switch-1851775306"><em>Blue Prince</em> is about exploring a mansion</a></span> where, at the start of each new day, you choose which room comes next from a growing deck of cards as you seek to discover a missing 46th room. Solving puzzles and uncovering clues in this roguelite structure eventually gives way to some big mysteries and lots of backstory, with some players spending over a hundred hours navigating the deepest layers of its esoteric labyrinth. </p><p>But on PS5, some of those players were hitting a save bug long before their time in the mansion felt complete. The<em> Blue Prince</em> subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/search/?q=corrupted+&amp;cId=3a7cd65a-1fe3-4ca5-8a39-a17677129df0&amp;iId=3f927640-8144-48f4-8ec2-64824e8ff3fd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/search/?q=corrupted+&amp;cId=3a7cd65a-1fe3-4ca5-8a39-a17677129df0&amp;iId=3f927640-8144-48f4-8ec2-64824e8ff3fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is littered</a></span> with horror stories of people who fell down the rabbit hole only to see all of their progress erased.  Most players were hit somewhere between day 90 and 150.</p><p>“I play this wonder of a game on PS5, and after 117 days, I had the horror of discovering my save is locked on day 117, I keep playing for hours and saving but when I leave the game, I am back to that day 117,” one <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1k4dif6/75_hours_i_think_my_save_is_dead/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1k4dif6/75_hours_i_think_my_save_is_dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “I have finally reached the true ps5 endgame,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1knbpk6/i_have_finally_reached_the_true_ps5_endgame_save/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1knbpk6/i_have_finally_reached_the_true_ps5_endgame_save/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another. “Save file bug.”</p><p>The good news is that those save files should now work, assuming players didn’t restart or delete them. “We have worked tirelessly with Sony to avoid any save files being lost once the game patches,” Ros wrote. “However, content that was not saved during the Rollback Issue has unfortunately been lost. Players should be able to return to Mount Holly at the point where they encountered the bug.”</p><p>It’s still a major bummer for everyone who was affected, especially since <em>Blue Prince</em> is not the best game for returning to weeks later after you’ve entered a completely different headspace. Today’s patch makes a fair number of other changes as well, most of which are redacted for spoiler reasons. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1ksu5e6/psa_the_new_patch_fixes_the_2_most_know_exploits/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BluePrince/comments/1ksu5e6/psa_the_new_patch_fixes_the_2_most_know_exploits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two things players have also noticed</a></span>, however, are fixes to the  Guest Bedroom exploit which players could use to load up on items, and to the Nurse Station buff players were manipulating to gain extra steps. It turns out even <em>Blue Prince</em> isn’t immune to busted builds getting nerfed. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
