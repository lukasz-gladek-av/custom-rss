              <p><em>Horses </em>is an upcoming narrative-driven horror game you’ve probably never heard of set to launch next month on the Epic Games Store, Humble Store, GOG, and Itch.io. But you won’t be able to find the creepy indie title on Steam, and the Italian studio behind <em>Horses</em> claims it doesn’t know why Valve is blocking the game from its PC storefront.</p> <p>On November 25, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/santaragione/">indie studio Santa Ragione</a> published a trailer for Horses that revealed the game’s December 2 release date. However, it also sports an interesting badge at the end claiming the game has been banned from Steam. <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html">At the same time the trailer went live, the studio updated its website</a> to include a lengthy FAQ about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6ht5yj3ss23"><em>Horses</em> being banned from Steam</a>. It claims Valve has provided little clarity on what’s going on and that the whole situation could result in developer Santa Ragione, which made <a href="https://kotaku.com/2022-goty-underrated-hidden-gems-best-games-1849936105">2023’s excellent <em>Saturnalia</em></a>, shutting down entirely.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">Speaking with <em>IGN</em></a>, co-founder Pietro Righi Riva explained that in 2023, the studio submitted a request for a Steam Coming Soon page for <em>Horses</em>. However, Valve told the company to submit a playable build. “We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steam’s request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before,” Riva said. According to the studio, this is when Valve rejected <em>Horses</em> from being sold on Steam.</p>

  <p>But Santa Ragione was not told why <em>Horses</em> had been banned from Steam. The company’s FAQ claims Steam told the studio that <em>Horses</em> had been barred from the storefront because it found that it featured “<i>themes, imagery, or descriptions that [Steam] won’t distribute.”</i> The message also included a line that Valve won’t distribute games that contain content depicting “sexual conduct involving a minor” regardless of intention or if it is done in a “subtle way that could be defined as a ‘grey area.'”</p>

 <p>The studio called this explanation “deliberately vague and unfounded” and claimed that <em>Horses</em> does not contain any content that would fall into this so-called “grey area.” However, it did admit that initially a scenario in the game did involve a young kid riding on the shoulders of a naked woman in a mask, as horses in the game are depicted as naked people, but that scene has since been changed to remove the child.</p>

 <p>“Steam’s decision came without detailed feedback, and the ban notice did not cite any specific scenes or elements,” Riva told <em>IGN</em>. “For months, we repeatedly asked what triggered the ban and received no answer. We also offered, unsuccessfully, to change any content deemed unfit, especially since the game was still early in development at the time of submission.”</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted Valve, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>According to Santa Ragione, this ban has nothing to do with the ongoing and recent issues involving alleged pornographic games being removed from Steam due to bad-faith actors pressuring credit card companies and payment processors.</p>

 <p>Santa Ragione claims that <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam"><em>Horses</em> not being able to launch on Steam</a> could make it very difficult for the company to recoup development costs, and the studio admits that it might shut down in the near future. The developer has set aside funds to support Horses for around six months after launch, but beyond that, it is unsure of what the future holds, as being banned from Steam will keep <em>Horses</em> away from “<span data-testid="content-text">more than 75 percent of the PC gaming market.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Horses</em> launches on basically every other PC gaming storefront besides Steam on December 4. It will cost $5.</p>

              <p>Top tech, kitchen appliances, outdoor gear, and games aren’t the only things going for less during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s also a great time to grab some useful subscriptions and software for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">StackSocial has dropped the price of Microsoft Office Professional 2021 for Windows to just $35, after a massive 84% discount.</a> It’s a lifetime license, so you won’t have to worry about paying an additional monthly or yearly fee after your purchase, ever.</p>
<p>It’s one of the many early Black Friday deals by the retailer, but it’s selling out fast. At the time of writing, over 20,000 licenses have been sold at the discounted rate. We don’t know how long it’s going to stay around, so it’s best to grab it quickly.</p>

<h2>Instant Access to All the Essential Programs</h2>
<p>It’s more of a one-and-done purchase. You’re going to receive access to your software license keys and download links instantly after you complete your purchase. The code needs to be redeemed within 7 days, or it’s going to expire. The licensing type will be connected with your actual device and not your Microsoft account, so you won’t exactly be able to transfer it across multiple machines.</p>
<p>There are some system requirements you need to know about. It runs on Windows 10 and 11, and doesn’t support older systems like Windows 7 or 8. The retailers recommend installing it on a device with at least 16 GB of RAM, plus having 4GB of available storage and a screen resolution of at least 1280×800. Most standard PCs already have these built in, but we still suggest peeking at your system settings before you proceed.</p>
<p>Once installed, you’ll have access to the full Microsoft Office Professional 2021 suite. This includes Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Whether you’re someone who needs to write a bunch of documents or create long, never-ending spreadsheets at work, it’s all covered. PowerPoint lets you create stunning, professional-level presentations with a whole bunch of useful tools built right in. Accessing your emails and communicating with the team will be just as easy with Outlook. You can even use it to manage your everyday calendar and stay on top of your tasks for better productivity throughout the day.</p>



<p>Support for Teams (free version) lets you take meetings on the go. Students will appreciate OneNote, a program that makes it both fun and easy to take notes, mark documents, create diagrams, and organize everything into different categories. Publisher and Access are available, too. The former can be used to develop your very own publications, while the latter is great for creating databases and automating tasks. The entire suite is great for work professionals looking to manage tasks better, students wanting to study more efficiently, creatives who need to organize their workflows, and even casual users who want to enjoy better efficiency.</p>
<p>This isn’t the latest version of Microsoft Office, but it still delivers all the basic features you can possibly need to get through your busy, demanding days. Just note that it does not work like Microsoft 365, so you won’t get access to cloud-based storage or features like real-time collaboration. It’s more suited for solo, offline use.</p>
<p>On a regular day, this Microsoft Office Professional 2021 for Windows license would set you back around $220. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">The current deal takes $180 off and offers it for just $35, which is practically nothing for the convenience it brings.</a> You also don’t have to worry about entering any long coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the drop. Just add it to your cart, receive the credentials, and follow the suggested steps to complete the process.</p>
