              <p>Black Friday has arrived in all its glory, slashing rates across a wide range of categories right, left, and center. We’re spotting tons of items hitting their lowest ever prices, and even some of the latest releases getting surprise discounts. It’s basically a great time to pick everything you’ve had your eyes on for less, whether it’s a MacBook, a pair of premium Bose headphones, or even an air fryer to finally start eating healthy.</p>
<p>If you rely on multiple devices to get through the day and are done dealing with cord clutter, a multiport charger is the way out. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">Right now, you can snag the 3-port 65W Anker USB-C charger for $24, after a whopping 40% off its usual price of $40 at Amazon.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in 2 free months of Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more. Both Prime and non-Prime members can grab it, but subscribers will enjoy free shipping, so they’re saving a few bucks on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Speed Charging for All Your Devices</h2>
<p>This compact charger is roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and the plugs fold in for easy portability. The smooth, scratchproof surface handles everyday wear and tear well, making it easy to take it with you on the go without worry.</p>
<p>There are three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) to charge up to three devices at the same time, whether it’s your smartphone, tablet, or even a laptop. 65W ultra-fast charging is enough to juice a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just 35 minutes, or a Google Pixelbook to about half in a little over 40. You’ll get maximum power when using a single port, but when multiple devices are plugged in, the charger automatically spreads the output intelligently. For instance, when topping three devices up at the same time, the top USB-C port can output 40W, while the second USB-C port and USB-A port can deliver 12W each. You can connect your power-hungry devices to a USB-C port, while other essentials to the rest.</p>



<p>Despite this power, the charger stays calm and cool while it works. GaN II technology makes for higher energy efficiency and upgraded heat dissipation in a compact frame that is around 53% smaller than your regular, everyday blocks. The box comes with the Anker 735 Charger, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">To wrap it up, you’re saving a massive 40% or $16 on this compact, but powerful charger that’s easy to use and makes any workspace more efficient.</a> It plays nicely with a range of devices, so you can use it to top up your earbuds, smartwatches, smartphones, tablet, laptop, and even consoles.&nbsp;You’re also getting a free 60-day Audible trial on top of that, which typically costs $15 a month. Audible gets you access to a huge library of podcasts, audiobooks, and Audible Originals that include documentaries, comedy shows, and more. You can purchase titles, enjoy on-demand streaming, and even enjoy offline access to your favorites!</p>
<p>Both the offers, however, are expected to expire soon, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly. Once these are gone, there’s no guarantee they’ll be back. This is also a great time to grab other tech gadgets for less. We’re covering the top deals here at Kotaku, so don’t forget to check back for the latest drops and some exclusive offers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Expensive OLED TVs, 4K Fire TV on Black Friday Sale Does the Job for 97% of People]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-expensive-oled-tvs-4k-fire-tv-on-black-friday-sale-does-the-job-for-97-of-people-2000648430</link>
            <guid>1367569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon sells Insignia-branded TVs despite the brand being owned by competitor Best Buy and creates the unusual situation where Amazon’s platform promotes a rival’s house brand.&nbsp;Several popular sizes including <strong>55-inch and 75-inch variants have already sold out</strong> completely, but remaining models like this 50-inch version offer exceptional value that doesn’t justify spending significantly more on competing brands.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">55-inch TV costs $169 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299, and hits a record-low 43% discount</a> that makes 4K smart TVs cost less than many soundbars or streaming devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fire TV integration</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD resolution at 2160p has four times as many pixels as 1080p Full HD</strong>. This makes images sharper with text that is still readable, faces that show detail, and faraway objects that stay clear instead of becoming blurry copies. HDR10 support improves dynamic range by using metadata to adjust brightness and color on a scene-by-scene basis, and this lets you see more detail in shadows in dark scenes while keeping bright highlight information.</p>



<p>The wide color gamut shows more colors than standard dynamic range and makes images that are more colorful and realistic like what we see in real life, instead of the flat colors that SDR content has. The upscaling engine looks at content with lower resolution and smartly adds detail to make it look like 4K quality.</p>
<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate works well with regular TV and movie content</strong> because it has native frame rate support that stops the judder from happening on displays with different refresh rates. The refresh rate is good enough for almost all types of content, including streaming services, cable TV, and DVDs and Blu-rays, which never go above 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>You don’t need any extra streaming sticks or boxes to <strong>use the built-in Fire TV operating system to get to streaming services</strong> like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and thousands of other apps right away. The all-in-one design gets rid of the HDMI port, the need to switch between remotes, and the mess of cables that come with separate streaming devices.</p>



<p>With the <strong>smart home hub</strong>, you can watch camera feeds from compatible video doorbells and security cameras directly on the TV in picture-in-picture or full-screen mode. You can use voice commands to control Alexa-compatible lights, thermostats, and smart plugs through the TV remote. This makes it easier to manage your smart home without needing separate Echo devices or phone apps.</p>
<p>Insignia’s 50-inch 4K Fire TV is now the cheapest on Black Friday at $169: It <strong>costs less than many 32-inch TVs but has a much bigger screen and all the smart features you could want</strong>. This deal makes 4K smart TVs available at prices that have never been seen before so you can get big-screen entertainment without losing any of the important features.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crucial X10 1TB SSD Now Costs Less Than a Dime per GB, Actually Only $0.08 While Black Friday Supplies Last]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/crucial-x10-1tb-ssd-now-costs-less-than-a-dime-per-gb-actually-only-0-08-while-black-friday-supplies-last-2000647763</link>
            <guid>1367566</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cruising Amazon for the best Black Friday deals is a hunting expedition for those red digits next to the price — the negative numbers with the percentage sign that guide you to the biggest price drops. It was -13% that led us to the deal on the Crucial X10 1TB Portable SSD, but it was the Crucial name and the features of this awesome drive that led us to click “buy now.”</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">The new $85 Black Friday price on the Crucial X10 is well worth jumping on.</a> The 1TB capacity of this model of the X10 is enough to serve as a secure backup for tens of thousands of irreplaceable files. It’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, and many gaming consoles. The Crucial X10 transfers data at a fast 2,100MB/s, and it has advanced dust, water, and drop resistance built in. Crucial might not have as recognizable a name as SanDisk or Samsung or some of the other big tech companies, but the reputation and the performance are impeccable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny Yet Enormous</h2>
<p>When you click over to Amazon to check out the Crucial X10 the first thing you’ll notice is how much smaller it is than most other portable SSDs. Just 2.55 by 1.96 inches square and a truly remarkable 0.39 inches thick, it’s probably the most pocket-sized 4TB drive on the market. Even so, you don’t have to treat it with kid gloves — the Crucial X10 has IP65 dust and water resistance ratings, and drop resistance of nearly 10 feet.</p>
<p>With that kind of rugged construction combined with the 1TB capacity and outstanding speed of data transfer make the Crucial X10 a prime candidate for anything you would use a portable SSD for. Add 1TB of storage to your gaming console — it works with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox — and bring the extra games with you on the road. It’s a perfect Time Machine drive for automatic Mac backups, and as storage or transport for huge files like hi-res photo and video files, it’s a massive amount of space in a tiny package, and it can move the files back and forth to your editing station with great speed.</p>
<h2>Ditch the Thumb Drive</h2>
<p>Students, remote workers, and frequent business travelers have mostly relied on USB thumb drives for ferrying their files. They’re pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and inexpensive, so that tracks. But the Crucial X10? Pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and for a exceptionally fast, nearly universally compatible, massive-capacity drive, inexpensive. And unlike those thumb drives, the Crucial X10 can take a little bit of abuse, and isn’t going to glitch out on you like those cheap thumb drives. It’s a worthy investment in keeping your irreplaceable files safe and secure, especially during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">Amazon Black Friday sale with the fat 13% price drop that makes the Crucial X10 one of the best portable SSD buys of the day at just $230.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Dumps 22,000Pa Robot Vacuum at Zero-Profit, Self-Emptying Tech Now at All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-dumps-22000pa-robot-vacuum-at-zero-profit-self-emptying-tech-now-at-all-time-low-2000648426</link>
            <guid>1367527</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cheap robot vacuums that bump randomly around rooms, miss entire areas and get stuck constantly serve no purpose beyond cluttering the market and disappointing <strong>buyers who conclude that robot vacuums fundamentally don’t work</strong>. These failures damage the category’s reputation while advanced models demonstrate what’s actually possible when engineering takes priority over cost-cutting that creates barely functional products.</p>
<p>The <strong>Roborock Saros 10R</strong> represents ultra-premium robot vacuum technology that handles everything, and it is now available at <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">$999 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $1,599</a>. The $600 reduction brings this flagship model to pricing closer to Roborock’s mid-tier offerings before this sale, and makes the best autonomous cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>3.14-Inch Ultra-Slim Design That Fits Everywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>new slim 3.14-inch profile gets rid of the raised LiDAR towers</strong> that stop regular robot vacuums from getting under furniture with low clearance, where dust builds up without being disturbed. Cleaning beds, sofas, cabinets, and coffee tables is now possible instead of having to manually vacuum or let dust build up all the time.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000Pa suction gives it cleaning power that rivals high-end upright vacuums</strong>&nbsp;and the robot itself is small and can move around on its own. This powerful suction pulls out pet hair that is stuck deep in carpet fibers that weaker robots can’t reach, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines, and picks up fine dust from hardwood floors in one pass without needing to clean again. The <em>DuoDivide</em> main brush and <em>FlexiArm</em> <em>Riser</em> side brush don’t get tangled up so they can handle hair up to 40 cm long without the problems that other robots have.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm Riser</em> technology is the first of its kind in the industry: It lets <strong>both the side brush and the mop automatically reach corners and edges</strong> that fixed-position cleaning heads can’t get to. Watch the arm swing out when it gets close to baseboards. It cleans all the way up to the walls instead of leaving the one-inch dirt lines that regular robots leave along the edges.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis has wheels that can be <strong>adjusted independently and can climb over things up to 4 cm high</strong> like door thresholds, thick rugs, and cable runs that stop regular robots from working without help. The system changes the height of each wheel based on the terrain, keeping the robot stable as it goes over obstacles that would tip or beach standard robots with fixed chassis heights.</p>
<p>The dock does all of the maintenance work such as removing the mop automatically for vacuum-only modes, washing the mop with 176°F hot water to get rid of tough stains, drying it with 131°F hot air to stop mildew, c<strong>ollecting dust automatically every 60 days</strong>, refilling the tank automatically, dispensing detergent automatically, and cleaning the hot water dock itself.</p>
<p>Roborock’s best technology costs $999 on Black Friday which is the lowest price ever and it saves you $600. Their mid-range models don’t have the ultra-slim design, <em>FlexiArm</em> extension, <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis, or full dock automation that their best models do. If you want to really get rid of manual floor cleaning with technology that works, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Cube Price Falls Below Profit Lines, Plus It’s 2× Faster Than the Fire TV Stick 4K Max]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-fire-tv-cube-is-2x-faster-than-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-and-can-be-yours-now-for-just-90-2000647768</link>
            <guid>1367524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is on a mission to make streaming easy for everyone with its compact, feature-packed devices, and the retailer is now letting you bring one home without paying the full price.</p>
<p>Black Friday kicks off tomorrow, but Amazon is already offering up to 50% off its top-rated entertainment gadgets, smart home devices, TVs, and more.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/"> The sale also brings the price of Amazon’s fastest-ever streaming media player — the Fire TV Cube — down to just $90.</a> That’s after a whopping 36% drop on the retail price of $140. Best of all, using the code ALEXAPLUS10 at checkout nets you another $10 discount in Amazon Credit with your purchase.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have an older Fire TV device lying around, you can trade it in to get an additional 20% off your total, plus an Amazon gift card, making the purchase even sweeter. But just note that such offers tend to wrap up fast, so you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the discounts. If you have been looking to give your entertainment experience a boost, now is the time to make that happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Hands-Free Streaming</h2>
<p>The cube, in a way, blends the functionality of both a streaming stick and an Echo. It comes with a built-in HDMI input and features additional ports for you to connect other entertainment devices for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>The new octa-core 2.0 GHz processor at the center makes it twice as fast as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, letting you launch apps and browse content within seconds. Support for Wi-Fi 6E translates into smoother 4K streaming with faster speeds, more bandwidth, and low latency, meaning you can search your favorite content fast, plus enjoy an uninterrupted, cinema-like viewing experience right from your couch. Visuals and sound don’t take a hit, either. 4K Ultra HD keeps picture quality lifelike, while Dolby Atmos Audio support puts the sound all around for a 3D experience. Super Resolution Upscaling makes it easy to convert an HD picture to 4K for better detail, so all your favorite classics are going to come to life, as well.</p>



<p>Navigating around is made easy with voice control. Not in the mood to press some buttons? Just ask Alexa to do it for you. You can find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. Just say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Christmas movies” or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and it’s going to pull every relevant title up in no time. Entertainment options come built right in, as well. The cube lets you stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes. You’ll have all your favorite streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more) in a single place. It even doubles as a speaker when you’re in the mood to listen to some songs in the background as you finish house chores.</p>
<p>Setting everything up couldn’t be easier. Simply connect the Fire TV Cube to your TV’s HDMI port, and then your WiFi. Follow the on-screen prompts to finish the process; as simple as that. If you have speakers around, it’s recommended to place the cube at least 1 to 2 feet away from them to avoid interference. The device also comes with early access to Alexa+, which is an advanced, more sophisticated version of the OG Alexa. It communicates better, understands context well, and can remember information from previous parts of a conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Thanks to Black Friday, the Fire TV Cube is now sitting at just $90, plus there are additional offers you can take advantage of to maximize your savings.</a></p>
