              <p>I spent years playing games without ever thinking about the controller I was using. It was just the thing that came in the box with the system. If you wanted to play co-op, you’d buy a second. If it broke, you’d replace it. It wasn’t until the PS4 and Xbox One generation that <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-quest-to-make-a-better-video-game-controller-1818823822">it began to feel like there were options</a> and I started experimenting with alternatives.</p> <p>Now, in the summer of 2025, it feels like <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamesir-tarantula-pro-controller-pc-switch-mobile-1851754990">a new controller is getting announced every other week,</a> and the rising prices of first-party hardware, as well as, on Switch 2, the still unimpressive quality of the console’s Joy-Con, makes comparing your choices a necessity. Let’s take a quick look at some of the newest entrants into the ever-more-chaotic marketplace for third-party controllers.</p> <h2>EasySMX S10 is a cheap Switch 2 Pro alternative</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617564"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617564">EasySMX</figcaption></figure> <p>Announced back in May, the <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx-s10-gaming-controller-for-switch-2-tmr-sticks-hd-rumble-motion-control?variant=44813624246460">EasySMX S10</a> pitches itself as a budget Switch 2 Pro controller. It’ll be $60 compared to the Pro Controller’s $90 and ships before the end of August. Like Nintendo’s premium controller, it can read Amiibo and wake the console up from sleep. The big features are a 1,000Hz polling rate for minimal latency and drift-resistant TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) Hall Effect joysticks. It’ll also support backwards compatibility with Switch 1 as well as gaming on PC and mobile. It’s a decent package at a compelling price point and I like the RGB-lit white version a lot, even with the ugly branded insignia on the side. But we won’t know if it can actually deliver until the first pre-orders begin arriving later this summer.</p>

 <h2>GameSir G7 Pro offers precision with weird caveats</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617563"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617563">Gamesir</figcaption></figure> <p>Another controller sporting TMR sticks is the <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-g7-pro">GameSir G7 Pro</a>. Announced more recently, it’s an $80 mid-tier option for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Android. It sports a nice look overall and a customizable three-piece magnetic faceplate, but the real draw are the mechanical micro switches that let you fine-tune the sensitivity of the triggers. But there’s a massive downside: it only works wired on console. There’s a long USB-C cable to keep you connected but it really cuts against the power efficiency of the TMR stick if you’re always connected anyway.</p> <h3>8BitDo Pro 3 upgrades what was already great</h3> <figure id="attachment_2000617567" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617567"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617567">8BitDo</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-3">The Pro 3</a> was revealed back in July and just started shipping this week. It looks like a PlayStation DualSense but with Nintendo’s style sensibility. The newest iteration of 8BitDo’s Pro line also sports extra buttons and TMR sticks. Most importantly, there’s a 2.4G adapter this time around for lower wireless latency. But my favorite feature by far is the pair of arcade-style ball-top caps that come in the box and can be attached to the Pro 3’s joysticks. It all comes in at the decent price of $70 and supports Switch 1, Switch 2, PC, Android, and iOS.</p> <h2>Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K spares no expense on PC</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617565" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617565"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617565">Razer</figcaption></figure> <p>If the above options were all looking a bit too affordable for you, Razer has just the thing. The <a href="https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-8k-pc">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K</a> is an esports-centric upgrade to last year’s model that promises ultra-responsiveness with TMR sticks and an 8000 Hz polling speed so the controller can register inputs faster than you can even think about them. It might be overkill, especially for a wireless model that costs $200, but it essentially has all of the bells and whistles from a top gaming keyboard shoved into a gamepad. There’s also a wired version for just $120.</p>

 <h2>Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is a luxury option for console</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617568"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617568">Victrix</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S and still want to pay more than double the price of a standard controller, Turtle Beach revealed the <a href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/victrix-pro-bfg-reloaded-wireless-controller">Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded</a> earlier this month. It promises 20 hours on a full charge and an extended wireless range with the option to plug in. More importantly, in addition to all the drift-resistant jazz that’s become table stakes at this level, the Pro BFG Reloaded is aimed specifically at fighting game players, with an “ergonomically optimized” resting position if you want to treat it like a mini-arcade stick. The whole kit costs $210.</p> <h2>WX5+ Wireless RGB looks cheap but fun</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617566">WX5+</figcaption></figure> <p>Enough of these 1-percenter gamepads. Let’s get back to the economy end of things. <a href="https://www.gioteck.com/products/wx5-wireless-rgb-controller-switch-2-doodles">The WX5+ Wireless</a> is essentially an upgraded version of the WX4 for the Switch 2, though it also works on PC. The Doodle variant comes with playful colors and RGB lighting. There’s hall-effect sticks, a rechargeable battery, and a headphone jack for plugging in your headset. The real standout for the Switch 2 controller, however, is the promise of a dedicated GameChat button that will bypass a bunch of the console’s menus to take you directly to talking with friends. It’s unclear if it’s just replicating what the Switch 2 Pro Controller does or speeding it up, but it’s neat either way. If it’s anything like the WX4 it’ll do just fine, especially at the low, low price of just $35.</p>
