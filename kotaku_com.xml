              <p>Wildlight Entertainment, the studio behind the new not-hero shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a>, has reportedly laid off “most” of its team just weeks after the game launched on January 26.</p> <p>Level designer Alex Graner posted about the news on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427480816940892161/?originTrackingId=%2FqMD4ALWpJvcsmxWmoXMGw%3D%3D">LinkedIn account</a>, saying he’s looking for whatever’s next after he and an unknown number of his fellow employees have been let go. <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>has reached out to Wildlight for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p> <blockquote><p>Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today.</p> <p>This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>However, I’m excited for my next adventure. If your team or anyone you know needs an experienced Level Designer, hit me up!</p></blockquote> <p><em>Highguard&nbsp;</em>was announced in December during the 2025 Game Awards, and it <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">didn’t go over very well with some sides of the internet</a>. Then the team at Wildlight went <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-breaks-radio-silence-and-the-internet-reacts-2000662650">radio silent for weeks</a> until the game finally launched at the end of January and press and content creators <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">got hands-on time</a> with the game. The response to the final game was a bit lukewarm, though Wildlight was quick to respond to feedback about the game’s small 3v3 team compositions by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-surprise-5v5-mode-is-sticking-around-but-its-not-enough-2000665423">adding a 5v5 mode</a> within the first week.</p>

 <p>Though the game seemed to struggle in terms of concurrent players, director and studio head Chad Grenier said in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-wildlight-interactive-interview/"><em>Polygon</em></a> that the team was less concerned with player counts than it was with making something its player base enjoyed. “Whether it gets a thousand people or a hundred million people, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “What matters most is that the game is loved by the people who played it.”</p> <p><strong>Update 2/11/2026, 7:39 p.m. ET</strong>: More and more developers are speaking publicly about the layoffs, reiterating that most of the studio seems to have been impacted.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I was laid off from Wildlight along with most of the staff. It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before. I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ yrs for anything. I'm still spinning, and won't be in a place to start thinking… <a href="https://t.co/AimTVwrJ7N">pic.twitter.com/AimTVwrJ7N</a></p> <p>— Josh Sobel (@Joshiepoo25) <a href="https://twitter.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><strong>Update 2/11/2026, 7:52 p.m. ET:</strong> Wildlight provided the following statement:</p> <p>“Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p>

 <p>We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Blizzard Crafted Diablo 2’s First New Class In 26 Years: ‘We Don’t Want To Mess Up The Mona Lisa’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/diablo-2-resurrected-reign-of-the-warlock-new-class-2000667816</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Blizzard is bringing a new class to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><i><span>Diablo II: Resurrected</span></i></a><span> for the first time ever, giving players a new way to make their way through the nearly 26-year-old RPG for the first time in decades with the </span><i><span>Reign of the Warlock </span></i><span>add-on launching today, February 11. It’s a big swing for the remaster, as it toes the line between preserving the original experience and creating something entirely new. The team is aware that some might view it as sacrilegious, so it isn’t making this change lightly.</span></p> <p><span>In a group interview on the Blizzard Irvine campus last month that</span><i><span> Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, game producer Matthew Cederquist and game designer Tim Vasconcellos talked about adding to the legacy of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-dev-folks-deciding-if-theyll-buy-1847702995"><i><span>Diablo II</span></i></a><span> and whether or not the Warlock is the last addition fans can expect. It sounds like the Warlock was one of a handful of classes in discussion, but it wasn’t the only one.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We started with maybe, I don’t know, three or four [classes] that were top of mind,” Cederquist said. “But then we kind of shopped that around to the team, and the team was most excited about two specifically out of those, but then we thought, ‘All right, we’re gonna rock out the Warlock just because the team was so excited about it.’ They’re like, ‘oh yeah, we can make this amazing.’”</span></p> <p><span>While they wouldn’t say what the runner-up class was, Vasconcellos says the Warlock’s summon-based blend of melee and ranged functionality lets it take up some unfilled space in </span><i><span>Diablo II</span></i><span>’s line-up. But still, the team worries about “painting over the Mona Lisa,” so to speak. They wanted to find ways to make the Warlock feel like a natural fit, as if it had always been in the game, and the devil is in the details.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We looked at the warlock and said, ‘Okay, so what would make this feel as if we were coming out of </span><i><span>Diablo I</span></i><span> and this is a class that would have launched with </span><i><span>Diablo 2?’</span></i><span>” Vasconcellos said.&nbsp; So you’ll find references […] Did you notice the </span><i><span>Diablo I</span></i><span> icons in the skill tree? Subtle hints like that try to make it feel familiar, as well as something that’s new still in the game. How it’s expressed and what space do you actually have to develop in that are all things that we’ve tried to consider, and we’re eager to hear from the community of whether or not we actually accomplished our design goal.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Blizzard reiterated during the interviews that the people working on </span><i><span>Diablo II: Resurrected </span></i><span>are longtime players who still play the game to this day and want anything new they bring to the package to be additive, but whether or not the studio keeps doing this will depend on whether or not players take to it. Although the team said they would like for this to not just be a one-off marking the series’ 30th anniversary, they had nothing further to announce at this time.</span></p>
