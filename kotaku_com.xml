            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As AI continues to encroach on game development, the worry that the studios that make your favorite games are dabbling in the tech, especially for art assets and written dialogue, grows ever greater. Sometimes this concern and the scrutiny that comes with it are well-founded, but other times it leads to witch hunts with fans seeing AI-generated art where it actually doesn’t exist. Blizzard’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> has been the subject of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941"><span>these moments of mass hysteria</span></a><span>. So what exactly is Blizzard’s stance on genAI? Well, it sounds like the company itself is of one mind, while the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team itself is in a different camp.</span></p> <p><span>In a group interview on Blizzard’s Irvine campus last month that </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>leadership was asked by </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-president-supports-generative-ai-exploration"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span> if the company had been integrating genAI into its workflow. Blizzard president Johanna Faries said the company wants to take a “dev-led” approach that allows its teams to use whatever tech is out there to “the extent that they’re comfortable” and in line with what the company believes is “responsible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We do actually, at Blizzard, have a centralized governance team specifically focused on AI and the role it can or should play in our development cycles,” Faries said. “What’s great about that is it’s very cross-functional, so you’re going to have voices from around the horn thinking about not just what’s hot-topic now, but where do we want to be five, 10 years from now? What’s the implication on our teams? What’s the implication on our values? How do we make sure that we don’t stymie the opportunity for devs, artists, whomever, to want to play with new tools and play in the sandbox, if it unlocks creativity or gets rid of drudgery or what have you? We want happy devs, right?</span></p> <p><span>“But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it’s a responsible tool and aligned with how we want to show up as a company,” she said. “So I feel very good in terms of the process we have in terms of vetting: is it secure, is it safe, is it values led? But I keep coming back to: I want the teams to feel safe, to explore to the extent that it drives joy in the work. And I think we have a good process, all up, in terms of making sure we’re doing it in a responsible manner.”</span></p>

 <p><span>So it sounds like, as a company, Blizzard is open to allowing its developers to use AI if they want to, though Faries didn’t get more specific about the parameters under which it considers its use “secure,” “safe,” or “values led.” But what about the </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> team, specifically? Game director Aaron Keller doesn’t sound like a fan. In an interview with </span><a href="https://x.com/gamespot/status/2019127667899961722"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>, he said the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team wants the hero shooter to be a “handcrafted universe.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller speaks out against adding AI-generated content to the game. <a href="https://t.co/44ZznZWiXJ">pic.twitter.com/44ZznZWiXJ</a></p> <p>— GameSpot (@GameSpot) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameSpot/status/2019127667899961722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“We don’t want to put AI-generated content out in front of players,” Keller said. “It’s just not something that we’re comfortable doing. I know it’s a moving space, right? I don’t know where players or society’s perception of this is going to be five years or 10 years from now. So it’s not like, I don’t think that there’s ever gonna be a ‘Hey, here’s a forever policy around it,’ but that’s just where we’re at right now. We want this to feel like a handcrafted universe, and it is a handcrafted universe.”</span></p> <p><span>So it sounds like, for now, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>won’t have genAI-created heroes, maps, or skins. These questions come after Microsoft, which acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, has been reportedly pushing for AI use within the company. Blizzard teams, including those behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003"><i><span>Diablo</span></i></a><span>, recently unionized, with concerns about AI replacing artists being top of mind among organizers.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is undergoing a revamp next week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from its title</span></a><span>, adding five new heroes, and restructuring its seasonal content to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>prioritize linear storytelling</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-8-in-1-usb-c-docking-station-crashes-to-an-all-time-low-barely-any-margin-left-at-this-price-2000665542</link>
            <guid>1427119</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re looking to expand your workstation with more devices, or just want to manage the gadgets you currently use, a docking station can help. Anker makes some of the top options around, and right now you can snap up its 8-in-1 option without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/">Amazon just knocked the Anker 8-in-1 docking station by 26%, bringing its price down to $40, from $54</a>. There are no shipping charges to worry about, either, so $40 is all you’ve got to pay today. The only thing to keep in mind is that the offer – as you’d expect – is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the savings. It’s best to grab it as soon as you can to avoid paying the full price later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger, Productive Setup</h2>
<p>It’s a compact docking station that packs a mighty punch. It’s equipped with a USB-C PD-IN charging port, two USB-A data ports, two HDMI ports, an Ethernet port, and a microSD/SD card reader. That’s all you need to create a productive workstation for all your office and entertainment needs. The station is also compatible with USB-C Power Delivery to provide high-speed pass-through charging up to 85W, so you can juice your essentials up while catching up on work deadlines.</p>
<p>There’s support for a dual display setup via HDMI ports. You can stream or mirror content to a single device in sharp 4K at 60Hz, or connect to two external screens to both HDMI ports in 4K@30Hz. For instance, if you’re planning to game with friends, add a high-quality external monitor to enjoy breathtaking visuals and smooth performance. Working on an office project with colleagues? Having two external screens lets you take quick meetings on one, while viewing reference materials on the second and working on your primary screen. Note that Windows users can use each screen for different content, but macOS mirrors the same content across both external monitors.</p>



<p>As for compatibility, the docking station supports USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections. It plays nicely with a range of devices, including MacBook (macOS 12 and newer), Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops equipped with DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. Included in the box are the 8-in-1 USB-C PD hub, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for added peace of mind. A charging cable isn’t included, so you’d either have to buy one separately or use what’s already available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/">There’s a lot more to appreciate here, especially now that the hub is going for just $40 at Amazon.</a> Again, the deal is selling out fast, so it’s best to place your orders without wasting much time. That said, we’re spotting plenty of other discounts across the tech section at Amazon. Everything from smartphones to laptops, gaming monitors, and tech accessories is going for less. We’re covering the top deals, so be sure to check back to discover the latest drops worth your money.</p>

              <p>Astonishingly, we are already eight months into the life of Nintendo’s Switch 2 console. And three-quarters of a year in, it’s perhaps fair to say there’s not exactly been a rollercoaster of must-have games released. Given the disappointment of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, and the sheer paucity of other first-part originals, it’s becoming tricky not to think of it as a $400 <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> machine that has a side-hustle in ports. With a desperate need for the console to be given any sense of vitality in 2026, today’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> not only did very little to take away from the impression of stagnation, but if anything seemed to go out of its way to endorse it.</p> <p>It was a very peculiarly put-together showcase. Any who try to fathom the decisions made by Nintendo are doomed to spiraling madness, but after the very pretty but previously announced <em>Orbitals</em>, we saw a visual novel sequel, a soccer anime oddity, and then what looked like a 2002 PC shovelware knock-off of a generic Capcom game, <em>Tokyo Scramble</em>. It was a deeply inauspicious start, suggesting that these desultory offerings were the games Nintendo thought we should be most excited about in 2026.</p>

 <p>This was then further cemented by longer looks at two years-old ports. First up was&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, the 2021 PC survival game, arriving on Switch 2 without a new addition or significant update, presented looking choppy and blocky (which I suppose are at least thematic) for the brand-new console. This five-year-old game still has a loyal following on Steam, with 30,000 people playing every day, so it’s not exactly forgotten, but it’s a weird pick to make such a fuss of. Then came the two-month-old news that the original 2017 <em>Hollow Knight</em> is receiving a free upgrade for the Switch 2. Very welcome, of course, and a great move by Team Cherry, but you know, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-sea-of-sorrows-switch-2-2000653816">something that was announced back in December of last year</a>.</p> <p>Somehow this was followed by&nbsp;<em>another</em> soccer game, a previously announced cross-platform Square RPG, another previously announced and previously released cross-platform Square RPG (OK, I’m being slightly facetious, people are excited to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Switch 2), and then two more long-ago-revealed but still potentially interesting cross-platform titles, <em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>and <em>Turok: Origins</em>. At this point the Direct seemed completely lost, just stringing together games we already knew were coming to Switch 2, but also coming to Xbox, PlayStation and PC, and all with little new information nor even release dates. The whole thing felt more and more like a proof-of-life for the console, rather than a showcase of reasons to be excited.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666069"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666069">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps you’re delighted by the reveal of a sequel to 2015’s PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Xanadu</em>, a long-awaited revival of Nihon Falcon’s classic ’80s/’90s <em>Xanadu </em>series, and all power to you if so, but this alongside <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> also felt like pretty weak offerings. But wait, hold on to your socks and hats, because up next was&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</em>! You know&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>, right? The 2014 mobile game? Or perhaps you’re more of a fan of the&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em> games that came to, er, PS4 and Xbox One? Even&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> didn’t come to Switch in 2024, instead arriving only on PlayStation and PC.</p>

 <p>Finally, way too late into the stream, some previously unreleased games with broader name recognition appeared. We got the already very well-known <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em> as well as <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which would have been a massive deal if they hadn’t already been announced for the system last year, and in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>‘ case, via a previous Nintendo Direct. Between these, we also had the welcome news of a collection of literally 40-year-old classics, and a rapid-fire montage of yet more previously announced games. But why <em>Star Trek Voyager – Across the Unknown</em> and&nbsp;<em>Reanimal</em> were confined to this purgatory, and the rest of this dismal half hour was not, is anyone’s guess.</p> <p>And then the big finish! An 11-year-old, two-year-old, and 20-year-old game, each from Bethesda. <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Oblivion</em> are last year’s versions, but still games that have been re-released a comical number of times across the decades. And honestly, the fact that it felt borderline exciting that 2024’s <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was revealed as a Switch 2 game really underlined just what a dreadful Direct this had been. “Oh my goodness, a big-name game that was released in this decade!”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666070">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This was a Partner Showcase, which is to say a Direct which features no first-party Nintendo announcements at all. But given just how little of those first-party efforts we know about at this point, it needed to do some damned heavy lifting to offer hope to Switch 2 owners who might be wondering exactly why they upgraded over the holidays. Next week’s <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> from Camelot will likely be a lovely 8/10 sports game, and there’s reason to hope that next month’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>will offer us a fresh face for an&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-like, but neither feels like a console-selling blockbuster. A repolished&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> at the end of March is…sure, great. Then we have&nbsp;<em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em> set for spring, and that’s it for games with even that vague of a release date. At some point in 2026 we should get <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Wave</em> and it’ll be gratefully received, but seriously, fucking hell, that’s it. Apparently there’s another&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em> at some point in the distant future, too.</p> <p>It is surely impossible that Nintendo doesn’t have something up its sleeves for&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>‘s 40th anniversary, right? But then it also feels impossible that Nintendo launched a brand new console without a 3D&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> title even announced, let alone released, and that’s somehow still true.</p> <p>Given all of this, today’s showcase needed to have some massive third-party announcement, some huge reveal that everyone would be buzzing about. And we didn’t even get close. It was abysmal.</p>
