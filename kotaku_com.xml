That’s the big question that a lot of game developers, fans, industry analysts, and publishers are wondering right now.

But it ain’t just fans who have been waiting for a decade that are desperate for a <em>GTA 6</em> release date. Studio and publisher execs across the industry as well as smaller devs are watching closely, as nobody wants to release a game too close to <em>GTA 6 </em>and get demolished by it. As a result, everybody seems nervous about announcing a fall release date for their non-<em>GTA </em>games. And investors and analysts are watching to see if Rockstar’s behemoth lands in 2025 or slips into next year, something that would cause a lot of industry chaos.</p><p>Okay, so with seemingly everyone wanting to know when <em>GTA 6</em> will specifically launch, I’m here to provide a date. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/mzAfTmC3It0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/mzAfTmC3It0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A drumroll, please</a></span>...</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>will launch on October 28.</p><p>Probably. Or, like, right around there. Pretty close to that point. I mean I’m fairly certain that if the game doesn’t get delayed into 2026, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">which Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick doesn’t think will happen</a></span>, <em>GTA 6</em> is arriving <em>sometime </em>in late October. And October 28 is the last Tuesday of the month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_published_by_Rockstar_Games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_published_by_Rockstar_Games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a month in which Rockstar has historically</a></span> released a lot of its biggest games. But this isn’t just a random guess based on the fall 2025 release window and Rockstar’s past game releases. </p><h2 id="h169633"><a id=""></a><em>Borderlands 4</em> and Take-Two’s CEO</h2><p>Earlier this week, 2K Games and Gearbox announced the release date for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044"><em>Borderlands 4.</em></a></span> The co-op sci-fi looter shooter is set to arrive on September 23. Why does that matter? Well, Take-Two Interactive is the parent company for both Rockstar and 2K Games. So unless Rockstar Games is completely rogue and never communicates with Take-Two leadership, I’d imagine they know when <em>GTA 6</em> is landing, even if it’s just a rough window. And that would likely help inform when they would choose to launch <em>Borderlands 4. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Stephen Totilo’s <em>Game File </em>on February 13</a></span>, there was a lot of excitement and chatter at DICE during the week due to the announcement of <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s release date. Totilo reports that a “well-plugged-in attendee” that he spoke to at the industry event explained that “everyone’s waiting for Take-Two and Rockstar” to pick a release day for <em>GTA 6</em>. And <em>Borderlands 4</em> is a signal from Take-Two: September 23 and the weeks immediately before and after it are probably safe.</p><p>Pull out a calendar and that likely means <em>GTA 6</em> isn’t landing in September. Fall starts on September 22 and the next day <em>Borderlands 4</em> launches. So September is out. That leaves October and November. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/all-call-of-duty-games-in-release-order&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/all-call-of-duty-games-in-release-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historically <em>Call of Duty</em> has arrived in November</a></span> and while <em>GTA 6 </em>is likely to outsell this year’s <em>CoD </em>sequel, I doubt Take-Two and Rockstar want that big of a game launching so close to <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p>So with that in mind, and based on Zelnick sounding very committed to a fall release date, I think that points to a late October launch while <em>Call of Duty</em>, which is now owned by Xbox, probably moves into the middle of November. Remember, Xbox wants <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> to be a big hit as it’s a game that will likely sell a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-performance-mode-1851074000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-performance-mode-1851074000">Xbox Series S</a></span> consoles. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-xbox-series-s-pc-take-two-boss-worried-rockstar-1851691951?_gl=1*9mbwku*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTU2OTQxNy40NDguMC4xNzM5NTY5NDE5LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-xbox-series-s-pc-take-two-boss-worried-rockstar-1851691951?_gl=1*9mbwku*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTU2OTQxNy40NDguMC4xNzM5NTY5NDE5LjU4LjAuMA..">The tiny Xbox is the cheapest way to play the upcoming <em>GTA</em> sequel</a></span>. </p><p>So there you go: <em>GTA 6 </em>is out on October 28. Or maybe Take-Two does an early access period for the game and the “official” release date is the 28th but it really arrives three days early on the 25th. Either way, I’m thinking this Halloween season a lot of people are going to be too busy causing mayhem in Vice City to go to any spooky parties. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both were in the top five most-played games on the platform, alongside <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>. The company reported $1.09 billion spent by 295 million PC players on the Epic Games Store last year, but only $255 million of that went to third-party games. For comparison, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/valve-runs-its-massive-pc-gaming-ecosystem-with-only-about-350-employees/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/valve-runs-its-massive-pc-gaming-ecosystem-with-only-about-350-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft estimated Valve’s annual revenue</a></span> at over $6 billion back in 2021.</p><p>So the Epic Games Store is still very much a <em>Fortnite </em>launcher with a ton of other cool stuff grafted onto it, but it’s certainly not <em>just</em> a<em> Fortnite </em>launcher. And with that in mind, the company also signaled what’s ahead for its digital storefront in 2025. The roadmap includes an overhaul of discoverability, new social features, the addition of pre-loading and a new download manager, as well as the ability to finally gift games to other people. </p><p>All of this is being done with the intent to seamlessly integrate it across an Epic Games Store mobile app as the company lobbies regulators the world over to force iOS and Android to play nice with it. We’ll see if, as that grand vision comes closer to being a reality, the Epic Games Store finally becomes a more central force to be reckoned with in PC gaming. For now, it’s still a great place to snag tons of cool games for free. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
