              <p>Pick ingredients off a conveyor belt. Drag them around a plate. Try to unlock point combos and hope your incredible, edible abominations pass muster with an idiosyncratic cast of anthropomorphic guests. <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/omelet-you-cook"><em>Omelet You Cook</em></a> is a tight, simple, rewarding roguelike with more than enough personality and flare to earn a seat at the table. The only thing I want to do after I lose is fire up the grill all over again.</p> <p><em>Omelet You Cook</em> was really neat when it hit Steam Early Access in early 2025. It’s even cooler now after it’s launched in 1.0. It’s a cooking roguelike in which you select ingredients and get awarded points based on how they’re arranged on top of an omelet according to an ever more intricate cascade of scoring rules. The spatial strategizing and arrangement synergies are where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/luck-be-a-landlord-boycott-bds-xbox-israel-palenstine-indie-dev-2000654628"><em>Luck Be a Landlord</em></a> flavor comes in. Points that blaze more intensely the better you do and an in-game economy for purchasing items that bestow special perks is where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a> feel comes into play.</p>

 <p>But like the best games in this RNG triage, min-maxing roguelike genre, <em>Omelet You Cook</em> exists as something more than the sum of its parts that can’t simply be reduced to its obvious inspirations. There are elements of cozy sims and chillout puzzle games here, with unique and finicky patrons reminiscent of <em>Animal Crossing</em> villagers, each with different dietary restrictions and preferences. The emphasis on how food is positioned and empty space is managed reminds me a bit of the calming fiddliness of <em>A Little to the Left</em>.</p>  <p>This is the part where I tell you that if you tried <em>Omelet You Cook </em>last summer and liked it then, there’s a whole lot more to love now. Nearly two dozen updates and seven months later, February’s 1.0 update (released early <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/">to get ahead of <em>Slay the Spire 2</em></a>) includes a bunch of different modes as well as the option to do the whole game turn-based if the conveyor belt continually moving was getting too stressful. There’s a Black Apron difficulty and a final showdown with Principal Clucker himself, the chicken that roasts your chef skills every time you fail.</p>

 <p>While the combo chaos is great for math nerds and the absurd recipes are fun and silly, I think <em>Omelet You Cook</em>‘s greatest strength is its quirky animal characters and light but satisfying conversational bits. There’s a generous spirit that comes through in the hospitality work and sense of community within the game, that games like <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> and <em>Balatro</em> don’t have. It’s slight but touching, with shades of <em>Donut County</em>. The music is delightful. The visuals are splendid. Every screen and object buzzes with vibrant energy.</p>

 <p>It took over 500 Steam reviews for <em>Omelet You Cook</em> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cooking-roguelike-game-omelet-you-cook-has-its-perfect-steam-review-record-ruined-by-contrarian-player">get its first negative one</a>, and that was just somebody being a dick. Play it and you’ll instantly understand why.</p>

              <p>PC gamers were left scratching their heads when <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-everything-we-know-date-2000663464"><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></a> revealed its surprisingly beefy spec requirements last month. The recommended rig to play the open-world action game would need a whopping 32GB of RAM. No longer. The action-adventure’s developers have now slashed that requirement in half as the great AI-fueled RAM shortage of 2026 intensifies.</p> <p>The <em>Lego Batman</em> specs were a shock when they were first spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeTheL3mur/status/2012737400544350217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2012737400544350217%7Ctwgr%5Efd34a35d456b8d5e150c2e218cfc364e8e95ac5a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000668982action%3Dedit">on January 17</a>. They were immediately compared to the specs for the last Lego game, 2022’s <em>Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>, which had a recommendation of just 8GB of RAM. That number had been multiplied four times for TT Games’s newest Lego anthology in as many years. It was immediately accused of being the latest example of PC games coming in hot and under-optimized.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The left is The Requirements for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</p> <p>The Right is the Requirements LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</p> <p>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE WE DOING HERE GUYS!?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGO</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOStarWars?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGOStarWars</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOBatman?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGOBatman</a> <a href="https://t.co/qYDmO3mHi8">pic.twitter.com/qYDmO3mHi8</a></p> <p>— L 3 M U R (@JakeTheL3mur) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeTheL3mur/status/2012737400544350217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The studio responded at the time by saying that <em>Lego Batman</em> was still being optimized but&nbsp;<em>something</em> had to be submitted on the spec sheet to get a Steam listing published so the game could <a href="https://twitter.com/zayinpriv/status/2013012344712937946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2013012344712937946%7Ctwgr%5E1f9eace8ea501c7d7ee38918cb2dfa71bef86d7e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Flego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-pc-specs-confusion%2F">start collecting pre-orders and wishlists</a>. It turns out TT Games was being conservative and significant improvements have been made. No one’s going to have to go out and buy another 16GB stick just to run around Lego Gotham when the game launches on May 29.</p> <p>“As part of our ongoing testing for <i>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</i> on PC, we have revised our recommended hardware specifications from 32 GB RAM down to 16 GB RAM,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">a new update</a> on February 13. “Please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final. We will be continuing to optimize and make improvements as we move closer to launch. For more information, visit our product page on Steam.”</p> <h2>RAM shortage fuels spec retreat</h2> <p><em>Lego Batman</em> isn’t the first game to go on this recommended PC spec rollercoaster ride. IO Interactive’s <em>007: First Light</em>, out just days before on May 27, also walked back a pretty unforgiving initial spec sheet earlier this year. That game also recommended 32GB at first before later dropping the requirement to 16GB. Its VRAM requirement dropped as well. IO Interactive <a href="https://twitter.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">blamed the whole thing</a> on a miscommunication.</p>

 <p>To put this all in perspective, say you were someone planning on playing one or both of these games on PC. Your rig only has 16GB of memory right now, so you’d have originally needed to upgrade. If you’d done that last fall, the popular <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/p6RFf7/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3200c16">Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory</a> would have only cost you $80. Now it’s being sold for double that at $160, at least when it’s available to buy at all.</p>

 <p>These AI-fueled price hikes don’t seem to be turning around anytime soon. Valve already blamed these spikes for why <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">the Steam Machine’s pricing hasn’t been revealed yet</a> and why it’s now expected to ship later in the first half of 2026 than previously planned. <em>Lego Batman</em> wasn’t the first to budge on its spec requirements, and it definitely won’t be the last PC game this year to blink, either.</p>

              <p><span>The most memorable experience I’ve ever had with a captcha, those li’l online tests you have to complete to prove you aren’t a bot trying to DDOS someone’s blog, was being shown a puzzle grid that used images of the building I was currently sitting in. It was a moment that would be written off as too “on-the-nose” in an episode of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891"><i><span>Black Mirror</span></i></a><span>. That intimidation tactic will be tough to beat, but a free new game from Paper Hat Projects is going to have a go at it anyway.</span></p> <p><a href="https://paperhatprojects.itch.io/captchaware"><i><span>CaptchaWare</span></i></a><span>, a “totally normal captcha game,” blends the agony of proving your humanity to a robot on a web page with the manic ecstasy of </span><i><span>WarioWare</span></i><span>’s fast-paced micro-games. Before gaining access to this mysterious site, you’ll have all of your web browsing faculties tested, from correctly identifying fire hydrants, simple math, and agreeing to the terms of service, to devilish riddles, grass touching, and proper art appreciation.</span></p>

  <p><span>Survive 20 consecutive captchas, each with increasing hostility and reflex demands, to claim your prize of proving you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8">a real human being</a>. The fun and fancy of </span><i><span>CaptchaWare</span></i><span> suggests that even the internet’s most agonizing rituals can become a little more whimsical by making them incomprehensibly fast, instead of routinely </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951"><span>harvesting our user metrics for lord knows what purposes</span></a><span>. Even if that means sweating through your shirt on whether those two pixels of a bicycle tire overlapping to a neighboring square are enough to mean you should click it.</span></p> <p><i><span>CaptchaWare</span></i><span> can be played for free on </span><a href="https://paperhatprojects.itch.io/captchaware"><span>Paper Hat Project’s Itch.io page</span></a><span>.</span></p>
