The mutant daylights as a pop star, and it looks like she’s going on tour during the events of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. As Hoshi points out in the TikTok below, the poster also has Dazzler’s signature, which every hero has on their character’s lore page in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ menus.</p><figure id="" data-id="629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-recommend-id="image://629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1032" data-height="580" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-recommend-id="image://629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1032" data-height="580" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The poster isn’t the only reference to Dazzler in the game right now. In a pre-match exchange over music, Star-Lord suggestively asks Luna Snow if she knows the pop star. Like Dazzler, Luna Snow is also a hero juggling a music career, so it would make sense if they’d crossed paths at some point. While these are only easter eggs for comic fans at the moment, some players are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/snoozeclock/status/1877064523774898446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/snoozeclock/status/1877064523774898446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hopeful</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OmniGulano/status/1877067026390221142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OmniGulano/status/1877067026390221142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this means </a></span><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Teatitty/status/1877054180633858514&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Teatitty/status/1877054180633858514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dazzler </a></span>could be bringing her sound-wielding powers to the hero shooter in the future. Come on, a music-based Luna Snow and Dazzler Team-Up ability is an easy pull. I went looking and it turns out fans have been making mock-ups of Dazzler’s hypothetical <em>Marvel Rivals</em> design for a bit.</p><p>Right now there are already a handful of X-Men in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it could certainly do with more. I can already envision Dazzler using her abilities to turn sound into light to produce a flashbang to temporarily blind enemies. However, NetEase is introducing Invisible Woman this season, whose kit also plays with visibility, albeit in a defensive manner rather than an offensive one. Should Dazzler make her way to the roster, it will likely not be any time soon as Season 1 is already bringing four heroes to the mix, with the Human Torch and the Thing set to follow Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman in the second half.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The most eye-catching part of the footage is that Bumblebee can transform between a robot and a car on the fly in what seems like a pretty seamless and satisfying animation to control. Traversal looks like it might have been a big part of <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, and it probably had the potential to play off of the core ability at the heart of the Hasbro toy franchise in interesting ways. </p><p>An executive for the company had previously said the game was shaping up well. <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> would be a “milestone for<em> Transformers</em> in the next year or two” that “nailed the feeling of playing as a massive, bipedal robot,” senior VP of digital strategy and licensing for Hasbro, Eugene Evans, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-gaming-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-gaming-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game File</em></a></span> in early 2024. </p><p>Who knows whether the rest of the game around that core gameplay premise would have been fun or worthwhile. Making all of the disparate bits of game work together in a satisfying and worthwhile way is one of the biggest design and technical challenges of making any game, and maybe <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> was ultimately canceled because it just wasn’t coming together, at least in a timeframe Hasbro was willing to foot the bill for. </p><p>“This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people,” Splash Damage <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in its statement this week</a></span>. “We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on <em>Transformers </em>for their dedication and passion. Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A new trailer shows the 2025 version will add new characters to fight with, mechs to pilot, zones to explore, and a much-improved UI. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

In addition to showing off the game’s sprawling alien planet geography and setting up the stakes for its sci-fi story, the trailer also gives longtime fans a glimpse of new content, including a section of<em> Chrono Trigger</em>-esque floating islands teased at the very end which weren’t part of the original game. </p><p>But the most important addition to the 2015 game is probably the reworking its UI seems to have gotten. The on-screen HUDs for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles </em>games are notoriously busy and tiny, and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> was perhaps the series’ worst offender of all with tiny character portraits and stat bars on the left side of the screen while ability cooldowns were wedged in along the bottom. </p><p>In the <em>Definitive Edition</em>, the fonts are bigger, things are more spread out, and there’s more information on the screen explaining what bonuses players will get from what abilities, as well as a combo guide for the game’s all-important but very obtuse Overdrive system. It’s still busy but a lot easier to parse, and will hopefully be part of an overall attempt to make <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>’s myriad systems easier to navigate for new players. </p><p>The trailer also ends with a look at a hooded figure on a beach, suggesting new story content is coming that might continue the decade-old Wii U game’s story. Fans are already speculating that it might be on the level of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>'s <em>Future Redeemed</em> expansion, which helped tie that game into the other entries in the franchise. At the very least it looks like <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> will be a complete package worthy of the Switch’s final year as Nintendo’s main console. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
