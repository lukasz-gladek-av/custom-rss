            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s mildly shocking that <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><em>Hollow Knight</em> was just $15</a> when it came to PC back in 2017. It’s even more surprising that eight years and over a million Steam wishlists later, the sequel is only $5 more. Team Cherry has confirmed <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><em>Silksong</em>‘s final price</a> and launch times cementing this upcoming week as the official kick-off of the 2025 fall video game release blitz.</p> <p>While most games have gone up $10 or more in the jump to the current console generation, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is aggressively going against the grain with just a $20 price tag on Steam and elsewhere. Team Cherry only <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1962330350681735642">officially confirmed</a> the amount on Sunday night after a weekend of speculation following leaks on GameSpot and elsewhere.</p> <p>The move has won Team Cherry tons of additional good will with fans who were already praising it for withholding review copies so that Kickstarter backers would still be among the first to get access to the game. Plenty of players commenting on the latest pricing announcement still can’t understand why the game isn’t more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/cR0JuzvhxH">pic.twitter.com/cR0JuzvhxH</a></p> <p>— Kalrim Frosthill (@KalrimFrosthill) <a href="https://twitter.com/KalrimFrosthill/status/1962333593570795730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Make it $40 or I’m not buying,” joked one. Others recalled co-director Ari Gibson’s previous defense of charging so little for the first game, noting the development team’s desire for as many people as possible to play the game. And <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">with 15 million copies sold</a> of the original<em> Hollow Knight</em>, Team Cherry has the flexibility to make that happen.</p> <p>In retrospect, it’s also wild to think one of the biggest games of the year only had a placeholder in the pre-order box until now. Maybe discussions were still ongoing within the team. After all, fellow indie darlings <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233">like Supergiant Games’ <em>Hades 2</em></a> are currently $30 and likely to cost even more at the end of Early Access (the studio behind Bastion and Transistor seems to be doing us all a favor by waiting to launch its own sequel until later in the fall).</p>

 <h2>What time does<em> Silksong</em> go live on Steam?</h2> <p>While the September 4 release date for <em>Silksong</em> has been known for just over a week now, it wasn’t entirely clear exactly when the game would go live until today. Alongside the price, Team Cherry also confirmed the launch time for each time zone:</p> <ul> <li>7AM PT | 10AM ET | 4PM CEST | 11PM JST</li> </ul> <p>That suggests everyone across PC and console will begin getting to play Hollow Knight sequel at roughly the same time.

              <p>Stroll by Larian Studios’ <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> display at PAX West and you’ll see fans quietly playing the <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> board game. Linger a little too long though, and you’ll hear what sounds like a car crashing through a McDonald’s drive-thru in the far corner of the show floor. And then another, and another. Follow the piercing sounds for long enough and you’ll arrive at the <em>Borderlands 4</em> Ripper Rage Room, by far the most ridiculous marketing stunt at this year’s expo.</p> <p>Fans of Gearbox Entertainment’s anarchic loot shooter, some adorned with its enemies’ iconic Psycho masks, are wrapped around a small, encased exhibit waiting for their chance to smash aluminum trash cans, glass bottles, and Dollar Store ceramics. Staff dress them in jumpsuits and riot helmets with plastic visors. Then, one at a time, they make their way into a plexiglass-ensconced chamber where they emotionally unburden themselves with a post-apocalyptic baseball bat.</p>   <p>It’s surprisingly loud and jarring, even when you know it’s coming. Imagine the heart-stopping moment in the restaurant when a waiter accidentally drops a giant tray of dishes. The immediate gasps as everyone experiences a simultaneous shot of fight-or-flight adrenaline followed by the hushed murmurings of people gawking at reality’s brief departure from the mundane.</p>

 <p>The Ripper Rage Room debuted during the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/borderlands/reel/DMnrGlOJjgH/#"><em>Borderlands 4</em> Warped Tour fan event</a> earlier this summer in L.A. and is reprising its role for PAX West. The big difference, however, is that the annual Seattle-based expo features lots of booths ranging from PC gaming giveaways to first-time indie developers desperately trying to get someone to pay attention to their passion project.</p> <p>More than one exhibitor has privately confided to me that “it must suck” for all the nearby booths who are trying to get attendees meandering on by to hang a second and listen to their pitch. In the case of Limited Run Games, the boutique physical game retailer closest to the Rage Room, that might mean hanging around long enough to pull the trigger on a copy of <em>Clock Tower: Rewind</em> for the Nintendo Switch. Then all of the sudden: *SNAP* *CRACKLE* *SMASH*.</p>       <p>But Gearbox is the king of PAX and it knows what the people want. Its massive booth for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, filled with dozens of demo stations and massive statutes of each of its Vault Hunter heroes, is both the most packed and the fastest at getting people through the queue. Fans at the Nintendo and Capcom booths complain about wait times and arcane requirements, like a lottery system for who actually gets to try <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> on Switch 2.</p>

 <p>And then there’s the Ripper Rage Room which, despite the absolute vibe-killing antics, always has people watching as each new fan briefly descends into a performative rampage, quietly realizing as they enter the translucent box that they are as much a part of the display as the brutalized silicon dummy standing in the corner. People love smashing shit. They love watching other people smash shit. Like the beautifully cel-shaded Skinner box at the heart of <em>Borderlands</em> franchise, it sometimes is just as simple as that.</p> <p>Less straightforward is the task of needing to reassemble the Ripper Rage Room after each demolition. At least three staff race to stack the trash cans, folding chairs, bottles, and plates in precarious positions for optimal smashing. Trying to replicate chaos is an oxymoron but that is the mandate. Everyone knows what’s going to happen but they wait to watch it unfold again anyway. And what could be more <em>Borderlands</em> than that?</p>

              <p>In June, Roborock released a line of affordable robot vacuums after the unveiling of ultra-premium models (Saros line) during CES. Luckily, some of these models are already on sale, <strong>like the Roborock QV 35A</strong>, which is now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3822/">listed on the official Roborock website for just $399 instead of $599, which is a nice 40% off for the 11th anniversary of the brand</a>. Even though it is in the budget category, this robot vacuum is still one of the most feature-packed models on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<h2>Multifunctional Dock</h2>
<p>The QV 35A begins with a bang with an<strong> incredible 8000 Pa HyperForce suction</strong> which is way more than enough to effortlessly remove dust, dirt, and pet hair from carpets and hard floors. Of particular note here is the <strong>zero-tangle arc side brush</strong> that is designed to pick up debris without hair becoming tangled and caught. If you have pets shedding or long hair around, this spares a great deal of annoyance from frequent maintenance.</p>
<p>Its <strong>all-in-one multifunctional station</strong> is a game changer here: Not only is it the charging dock, but it also cleans the mop with cold air drying, auto-empties the dust, and refills the water tank so that the robot is always ready to go without much fuss from you.</p>
<p>The QV 35A also features<strong> twin rotating mops and automatically raises the mop when it encounters carpet</strong>&nbsp;so it’s capable of both vacuuming and mopping at the same time. With this kind of electronic mopping system, you have control over water flow and deep cleaning according to different surfaces so that your floors get the treatment they need without damage or leftover moisture.</p>



<p>Thanks to PreciSense LiDAR navigation, <strong>this model creates a map of your home with incredible precision</strong>. It creates 3D maps and uses intelligent planning to determine the most efficient cleaning route. The robot avoids obstacles on its own thanks to reactive tech, easily working around furniture and other domestic items without stopping.</p>
<p>With the 11th anniversary sale cutting nearly 40% off the cost, it’s the best time to acquire a premium robot vacuum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">coming to Switch 2</a> in just a few days. It’s Ubisoft’s first big port for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. So why isn’t the company talking more about its 2024 blockbuster coming to the best-selling console of 2025? Maybe because it’s the latest Switch 2 port to reportedly run less than great.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, a stealth adventure about gangsters and bounty hunters on the fringes of the Galactic Empire, is currently the 10th best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop thanks to digital pre-orders, but you won’t find it anywhere on the show floor at PAX West this weekend. Despite stations for fans to try big ports like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo’s new hardware, a demo of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was only playable behind closed doors, according to YouTube channel <em>GVG</em>‘s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">new hands-on video</a>.</p> <p>Even worse, the outlet was prohibited from sharing any direct capture footage of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> running on Switch 2. Over-the-shoulder recording wasn’t allowed either. The demo <em>GVG</em> tested included an early section inside of a Star Destroyer and a ship fight in space. The frame rate often appeared to dip below 30fps while the visual quality varied from good to unimpressive depending on the scene. And <em>GVG</em> didn’t even get to try any of the open-world sections down on planets.</p>

 <p>There have been some potential red flags around<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ performance on Switch 2 for a while now. At a Partner Nintendo Direct earlier this summer, Ubisoft only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIBt_Qnf1_M">showcased the game for two minutes</a>, and most of that was developers (Ubisoft Red Lynx is doing the port) talking into the camera rather than direct feed of gameplay. What little snippets the publisher did share didn’t look outstanding either. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCYL2f49jyQ"><em>Digital Foundry</em> pointed</a> to some impressive lighting effects at the time, but was left mostly with concerns about just how downgraded it would be from the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.</p> <h2>How will <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> run on Switch 2?</h2> <p>While not officially confirmed, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-release-date-1851786749">reading between the lines</a> of recent Ubisoft earnings calls leaves the strong impression that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> isn’t the only current-gen exclusive the company is planning to port to Switch 2. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> sounds destined to arrive eventually as well. Has Ubisoft been investing more resources in optimizing that port, knowing it’s the bigger franchise, at the cost of quietly leaving<em> Outlaws</em> to flounder a second time (remember,<em> Shadows</em> was originally delayed precisely because of <em>Outlaws</em> launch struggles last year)?</p>

 <p>Right now, there are basically two buckets of third-party Switch 2 ports. One includes <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which rarely remind you that you’re playing on weaker hardware than what the games were originally designed for. The other includes stuff like<em> Hitman World of Assassination</em>, which despite being serviceable, often feels like a noticeable downgrade (though things improved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjJVzd-FWI">just this week</a> with a capped frame rate option).</p> <p><em>Elden Ring</em>, which reportedly ran like goop when you hit the open-world sections, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> appear to be in that second bucket as well. Bandai Namco tried to prevent people from filming footage of FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">first Switch 2 game at Gamescom 2025</a> as well, though that game at least doesn’t have a release date yet. Unless a day-one patch or series of other upgrades can improve <em>Outlaws</em> on Switch 2, there’s now a question of whether a potential <em>Shadows</em> port will fall into the “meh” column of ports as well.</p>
