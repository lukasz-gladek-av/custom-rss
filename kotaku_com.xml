              <p>We’re all now used to every big-name game coming out in five differently priced versions, each containing more in-game stuff than the last, but no matter which you choose you will still be buying the <em>same game</em>. That’s never been the case for the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>series, starting even with its very first English-language release in 1998 with <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em>, each version subtly (but to fans, crucially) different. But have you ever stopped to wonder why? The reason is wonderfully silly.</p> <p>Creating two versions of what mostly boils down to the same game is certainly not an obvious choice. It introduces a huge amount of confusion to an unaware audience, not sure which is the most recent game or whether they’re making a mistake by buying one over the other. To those familiar with the series, it’s a huge feature and selling point, and deciding which version of the game you’re going to buy and why is a big part of the experience. But given the fear of alienation and confusion, it’s hard to imagine most marketing executives would ever allow such a conceit to survive its first boardroom whisper. Yet one of the best-selling game series of all time suggests it can work out OK.</p>

 <p>But why? Well, as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-says-one-of-the-reasons-pokemon-red-and-green-were-made-was-because-creator-satoshi-tajiri-joked-mario-couldnt-be-surpassed-unless-fans-were-sold-2-copies-of-a-game/">GamesRadar</a>&nbsp;</em>spotted via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097">Genki_JPN’s X account</a>, in a recent shareholders meeting Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto was asked if anything could ever outsell <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This caused him to recall a conversation with the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> franchise, Satoshi Tajiri, about how the monster-catching games could ever outdo the success of the <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games. Via machine translation, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf">Miyamoto told investors</a>, “A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of <em>Pokémon</em>, joked with me that if you want to surpass Nintendo’s <em>Mario </em>you’ll have to sell two copies of the game to each customer.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a shareholders meeting Shigeru Miyamoto shared a story about Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri and one of the reasons Pokémon Red and Green came to be!</p> <p>"A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of Pokémon, before creating the first Pokémon game, once joked to me ‘If you want to… <a href="https://t.co/YTS4AvAbu9">pic.twitter.com/YTS4AvAbu9</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Miyamoto continued, “This was one of the reasons why <em>Pokémon Red&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> were created.”</p> <p>(In Japan, the games were originally released in 1996 as&nbsp;<em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em>, with a&nbsp;<em>Blue</em> later the same year.)</p> <p>For what it’s worth, it’s rarely actually worked! As phenomenally successful as the <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games have been,&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> tends to beat them on each system. The two wins for <em>Pokémon</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in this match-up have been <em>Pokémon Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Silver</em> on Game Boy Color and <em>Pokémon</em> Ruby and&nbsp;<em>Sapphire</em> on Game Boy Advance. On the DS, 3DS and Switch, <em>Mario</em> has taken the lead each time. (There were no mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games on Wii or Wii U.) But it certainly hasn’t hurt, either, with&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em> selling 26.84 million copies, and&nbsp;<em>Scarlet </em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em> hitting 27.15 million. It’s just that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em> has rather rudely sold 69.56 million, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. <em>Ultimate</em> 36.93 million, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> 29.84 million.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony is filing a lawsuit against an eBay seller who it accuses of selling fake PlayStation 5 accessories, such as carrying cases for the console and its various peripherals, claiming that it has made unauthorized use of the company’s trademarks.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-lawsuit-ebay-counterfeit-playstation-5-accessories-2-million/"><i><span>The Game Post</span></i></a><span> lays out, Sony’s lawsuit against eBay user “zaocuand-002” has the company seeking potentially millions of dollars in damages as it continues to target counterfeit PlayStation products being sold around the internet. eBay is but one of several platforms Sony has been combing through in its search for fake PS5 accessories, as it has also gotten into legal scraps with sellers on Amazon, Walmart, and other sites.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has previously targeted “dozens” of anonymous marketplace sellers in its lawsuits targeting counterfeit PS5 accessories, but this latest eBay lawsuit specifically homes in on the zaocuand-002 account which has, according to </span><i><span>The Game Post</span></i><span>, sold over 9000 items on the platform. A PS5 carrying case is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit, but this listing has seemingly been taken down after the lawsuit was filed in October. Sony’s suit demands that platforms such as eBay “shall disable and cease displaying any advertisements used by or associated with Defendant in connection with the sale of counterfeit and infringing goods using the PlayStation Trademarks</span><span>.” </span><span>Alternatively, the company requests up to $2 million “for each and every use” of the counterfeit trademark, as well as compensation for its legal fees.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Defendant created an e-commerce store operating under at least the Seller Alias that is advertising, offering for sale, and selling Unauthorized Products to unknowing consumers,” the complaint reads. “Defendant attempts to avoid and mitigate liability by operating under at least the Seller Alias to conceal both its identity and the full scope and interworking of its counterfeiting operation.”</span></p> <p><span>Sony’s been getting pretty lawsuit-happy these past few months, as the PlayStation company is also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163"><span>suing Tencent over a pretty blatant </span><i><span>Horizon Zero Dawn </span></i><span>knock-off</span></a><span>. However, the Chinese publisher claims Sony is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858"><span>trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions</span></a><span> with the suit.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Talk to any <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> fan lately and you’ll find a tarnished husk eager for a reason to jump back into their favorite obsession of 2025. Even after spending hundreds of hours toiling across the same map and fighting the same bosses we’re hungry for more, especially after the game’s new <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">Deep of Night ranked mode</a> ended up being a dud. Well, we apparently only have to wait a little longer. FromSoftware’s parent company has confirmed the game’s first official paid DLC will arrive by April 2026.</p> <p>That morsel of good news came in Kadokawa Corporation’s <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a>. In it, the company said the <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off exceeded sales expectations but fell off steeply in the second quarter. It’s hopeful an expansion can revive the game’s momentum the same way <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> did with the original game.</p>

 <p>“FromSoftware is currently developing <em>Elden Ring Nightreign DLC</em> (planned for release in FY2025), <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and <em>The Duskbloods</em> (planned for release in 2026),” Kadokawa Corporation confirmed. Is FromSoftware working on anything else for next year? <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-armored-core-6-fromsoftware-1851786550">Previous rumors</a> suggested it’s next game isn’t as far away as some fans might think, with hints that it could be a new <em>Armored Core</em> or a remaster for <em>Dark Souls III</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Nightreign</em> needs a new map</h2> <p>But for <em>Nightreign</em> sickos like myself, the DLC will be more than enough to keep us occupied, at least if it’s on par with the studio’s previous expansions. What does that wishlist include? A new map, for one. I’ve grown quite <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-items-wending-grace-flask-1851782963">fond of Limveld</a> during my time there, but it represents only a small, randomized portion of the original game’s big open world. There are so many other parts that could be adapted into similarly sized, procedurally generated maps.</p>

 <p><em>Nightreign</em> is, first and foremost, a game about logistics and cost-benefit analysis. Much of that decision making has become streamlined and rote as players have become experts in all of the tradeoffs and probabilities underlying the current map. A new one, in addition to a fresh visual palette and new enemies and points of interest to draw upon, would almost feel like a sequel.</p>

 <p>Fans have also been begging for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-renant-summon-necromancy-faith-1851784379">more character classes</a> to try. There are currently eight in the game and most players have settled in on their favorites. Two new classes, especially ones that favor different weapons and abilities than the existing ones, would be another draw. New bosses also seem like a must for any DLC. FromSoftware has its entire Soulsborne back catalog to draw from, and the time it takes not just to learn new encounters but master them is no small investment.</p> <p>That’s especially the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">case for the Nightlords</a> that cap off each run. The game currently has eight. Add four more and their Everdark variants and we’ll essentially have <em>Nightreign 2</em>. But I’ll settle for anything at this point. I just want a reason to send out party invites, round up the crew, and get our asses kicked like it’s launch all over again.</p>
