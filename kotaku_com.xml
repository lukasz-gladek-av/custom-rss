              <p>Sure, Jedi and giant space battles are cool and an important part of the<em> Star Wars</em> franchise. But as I’ve said before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-games-dont-always-need-to-include-jedi-1840696384">not every <em>Star Wars</em> game needs to include lightsabers and Force powers</a>. Thankfully, later this year, we are getting <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>, a very different kind of <em>Star Wars</em> game that is promising a fast-paced racing experience similar to past games like S<em>tar Wars: Racer’s Revenge.</em> If that sounds like something you want to know more about, well, just keep on scrolling down to learn even more about <em>Galactic Racer</em>.</p> <h2>What is <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced during the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is a high-speed arcade-like racing game that will feature a full single-player story featuring new and old characters and plenty of different race tracks to speed around on.</p> <h2>When is <em>Galactic Racer</em> launching?</h2> <p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but it is scheduled to launch sometime in 2026.</p>

 <h2>What platforms will it be available on?</h2> <p>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>  <h2>Is there podracing in this game?</h2> <p>Yes! Fans were a bit nervous that <em>Galactic Racer</em> might not feature podracing when its first teaser trailer didn’t feature any podracers.<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-racing-game-podracing-confirmed-2000665131"> But the devs have since confirmed that yes</a>, it will include podracing, and a new trailer even shows it off. But it should also be clear that this isn’t exclusively a podracing game, but a <em>Star Wars</em> racing game that will let players mix and match different types of speeders and other vehicles together.</p> <h2>Is it true that some former <em>Burnout</em> devs are making this?</h2> <p>Yup. Fuse Games is a studio formed by a bunch of developers who previously worked at Criterion on games like<em> Burnout Paradise</em> and <em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">So these folks know speed and racing</a>.</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> an open-world game?</h2> <p>No! <em>Galactic Racer</em> isn’t an open-world racing game like <em>Forza Horizon</em> or<em> Burnout Paradise</em>. Instead, it is a track-based racer similar to older <em>Burnout</em> titles.</p> <h2>Is there multiplayer in the game?</h2> <p>Yes. <a href="https://www.pcgames.de/Star-Wars-Galactic-Racer-Spiel-75467/News/star-wars-galactic-racer-tga-1488889/">Fuse Games says 12 people will be able to race together online</a>. There will also be some sort of online ranking system.</p>

 <h2>When is <em>Galactic Racer</em> set in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline?</h2> <p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is set after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi.</em> But beyond that, the creators behind the game don’t seem to be too worried about <em>Galactic Racer</em>‘s placement in the grander <em>Star Wars</em> canon. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">Here’s what Fuse Games CEO and founder Matt Webster told <em>IGN</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“I don’t think it really matters. As you say, you’re on Jakku after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi,</em> the galactic civil war is over, and that’s where sport becomes a more interesting opportunity. I don’t think we’re ever specific about timeline beyond that.”</p></blockquote> <h2>Wait, was that Sebulba from <em>The Phantom Menace</em>?</h2> <p>Yes, it was. But he is older now and sports a cool beard. Maybe he’s learned his lesson after cheating against Anakin and other racers all those years ago. But I doubt it…</p>  <h2>Will <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> include a battle pass or seasons?</h2> <p>When asked about seasons in the previously mentioned <em>IGN</em> interview, Webster bluntly said “No” and said the game is a “premium” release.</p>

 <p>“We have our campaign, and we have arcade mode, and we have multiplayer, and it’s a self-contained thing,” said the CEO. “But what we also recognize is that the landscape of <em>Star Wars</em> evolves and changes over time and so do games as they go. So we see an opportunity for us to tap into more<em> Star Wars</em> or new<em> Star Wars</em> over time, but in terms of us outlining what we think post-launch is going to look like, [seasons are] not something that we see. The only reason I say a blind no to it is, in my head, season pass is connected to free-to-play games, and that’s not what we are making.”</p> <h2>Will you be able to walk around on foot in <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>?</h2> <p>Yes! Your main character in the game’s campaign is named Shade, and they will be able to walk around a social hub area and interact with NPCs while also being able to upgrade their vehicles.</p> <h2>This is cool and all, but I wish we’d get a big <em>KOTOR</em>-like RPG <em>Star Wars</em> game again…</h2> <p>Good news, that’s also a thing that is happening. <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076">You can learn more about it here!</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Discord Delays Controversial Age-Verification Rollout After Backlash: ‘We’ve Made Mistakes’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-delays-controversial-age-verification-requirements-2000673309</link>
            <guid>1445245</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Discord hears you. It gets your concerns. It wants to win back your trust. That’s the message from cofounder and CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who announced the <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884">company’s controversial new age-verification requirements will be delayed</a>, but not reversed, as it works to try to better explain what’s happening to its millions of users. “We’ve made mistakes,” he wrote.</p> <p>Vishnevskiy says he’s just like you, getting off work and hopping on voice chat with friends while playing games like <em>Baby Steps</em> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Leveraging his gamer cred, the executive tried to quell the recent backlash while making clear that nothing is fundamentally changing about the age-verification rollout coming, other than the timing and optics. For Discord, the issue appears to be a failure to properly communicate the policy rather than the policy itself.</p>

 <p>“In hindsight, we should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works,” he <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">wrote in today’s update</a>. “The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we’re requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That’s not what’s happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we’re doing and why.”</p> <p>Vishnevskiy continued, “We know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all. We hear you.” He then went on to insinuate that Discord’s hands are tied as new regulation rolls out across more countries and U.S. states. The company promises more transparency about its vendors and processes, but otherwise nothing about the age-verification rollout is fundamentally changing other than the timing.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the newly delayed rollout will work as outlined <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">on Discord’s website</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>We’re delaying our global rollout to the second half of 2026.</strong>&nbsp;Where we have legal obligations, we will continue to meet them, but we will only expand globally after we’ve done the following:</p></blockquote> <ol role="list"> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Adding more verification options.</strong>&nbsp;We already had alternatives in development, including credit card verification. We’ll complete and expand those before scaling globally so you have more options you’re comfortable with.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Vendor transparency.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll document every verification vendor and their practices on our website, and make it clear in the product who each vendor is. We’ve also set a new requirement: any partner offering facial age estimation must perform it entirely on-device. If they don’t meet that bar, we won’t work with them.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>A new spoiler channel option.</strong>&nbsp;We know many communities use age-restricted channels not for adult content, but for topics people prefer to engage with on their own terms: spoilers, politics, and heavier conversations. We’re building a dedicated spoiler channel option so communities don’t have to age-gate their server just to give members that choice.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>A technical blog post before global launch.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll publish a detailed post explaining how our automatic age determination systems work, including the signal categories and privacy constraints. So you can evaluate our approach for yourselves.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Age assurance data in our transparency reports.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll include how many users were asked to verify, what methods they used, and how often our automated systems handled it without any user action.</p></blockquote> </li> </ol> <p>The apologetic backpedaling comes after weeks of Discord users pushing back on new requirements that would require some users to submit photos and IDs to the gaming chat platform if its AI tools decide you’re not over the age of 18 and you try to access “adult” content servers. A prior “<a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-hack-persona-2000672570">experiment</a>” with this new policy that was implemented in the UK became a lightning rod for some frustrated users when it was revealed that one of the vendors involved in the process, a firm called Persona, was backed by funds from surveillance company Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel.</p>

 <p>Discord later said it cut ties with the vendor and that it has new safeguards in place to prevent user data from being hacked as it accidentally was last fall. But the bubbling cauldron of AI surveillance, data security concerns, and Discord’s reportedly impending IPO has left even some of its most hardcore users skeptical.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Users Aren’t Happy That Steam Next Fest Feels Overrun With AI Art]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-gen-ai-art-demos-2000673280</link>
            <guid>1445131</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Steam’s tri-yearly Next Fest, a week-long “celebration” featuring hundreds of new demos from triple-A and indie publishers alike, isn’t quite hitting the same as it used to for the community, due to the ever-growing influx of “slop” and “games that use generative AI and flip assets.” </span></p> <p><span>While this has been an issue for the last handful of Next Fests, Steam users on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/the_next_fest_has_too_much_ai_slop_and_asset/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>Reddit</span></a><span> are reporting that this time around, they’ve had enough, and are opting to sort through the new games by popularity. For the indie devs banking on the free publicity that Next Fest provides, this seems like an awfully counterproductive use of the event as a whole.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are a zillion demos in this Steam Next Fest, and I'm going to be very real…I don't feel very compelled to check out demos with AI art capsules</p> <p>— Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/2026122068023226447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Of course, the issue here has been exacerbated by the misuse of Valve’s AI disclosure section on Steam. While developers on the Steam storefront are required to admit to the use of AI-generated assets in their games, a quick glance at the latest, non-featured titles in the Next Fest line-up features more than a few suspiciously AI-generated-looking titles, none of which include any sort of AI-disclosure tag on their Steam storefront pages.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000673295" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673295"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673295">Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As one user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/comment/o728gau/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>explains</span></a><span>, they believe this is happening because developers are seemingly never punished for lying about generative AI use. “There is no real penalty so far for not disclosing. Only if you blatantly used like LLM text generation at run time would Valve care and that’s just for legal reasons. For assets etc it’s very much a trust system by Valve, they mostly did it to shut people up.”</span></p>   <p><span>So what’s the solution? According to several commenters, the only way to combat the rising tide of AI-generated games on Steam is to sort by popularity and reviews. However, the irony of sorting by popularity during Next Fest, an event designed to freely advertise indie demos, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1rd10ws/comment/o72ewb7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>hasn’t been lost</span></a><span> on the community. “These last few fests I’ve just had to sort by popularity. But I feel like that defeats the purpose of these events if all I’m doing is ‘finding’ the stuff that I would’ve heard about anyway. It’s just too exhausting to filter through.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the flipside to the issue at hand, there’s an equally terrible problem plaguing a large swathe of indie devs taking part in Next Fest: false-positive AI-generated accusations. In the lead-up to the event, dozens of developers on subreddits such as </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1p72gqo/how_can_we_defend_from_aiallegations/"><span>r/IndieDev</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1pr677z/how_should_devs_handle_curator_reviews_that_make/"><span>r/gamedev</span></a><span> have reported being incorrectly accused of using AI to make their games. Whatever the fix is, it’s clear that the onus here is on Valve, because this new wave of false-positive reporting proves that it’s getting harder and harder for the common man to accurately spot AI-gen’d assets.</span></p>
