And like every year before, the show ended with the reveal of 2024's Game of the Year. </p><p>Maybe after watching all that (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032">or reading our wonderful summary of the event</a></span>) you wondered: “Hey, who won in 2016?” Well, I’m here to help! I’ve put together a list that looks back at the last 10 years of The Game Awards to see which games have won the top honor over the last decade. </p></div></div><div><p>A decade ago, BioWare’s open-world fantasy RPG <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>was the first game to win Game of the Year at the inaugural Game Awards in 2014. It might have been cool in a poetic kind of way to see 2024's<em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>win again a decade later, but alas, the universe doesn’t work like that.</p></div><div><p>In 2015, CD Projekt Red’s RPG <em>The Witcher 3 </em>was the big winner of the show. The game not only walked away with the top award of the night, but it was also the most nominated game at the awards, being in the running in six categories and winning three of them. And nine years later, CDPR officially unveiled <em>The Witcher 4</em> at the 2024 Game Awards. </p></div><div><p>In 2016, Blizzard’s super-popular multiplayer hero shooter <em>Overwatch</em> made history and became the first non-RPG and the first multiplayer game to win GOTY at The Game Awards. Spoilers, but another mulitplayer-only game wouldn’t win Game of the Year again until 2021. </p></div><div><p>In 2017, another open-world, third-person RPG won the top award of the night. This time the beloved<em> Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>took the top honors at The Game Awards. This was also the first and, as of 2024, the only Nintendo-published game to walk away with the GOTY trophy. It also means that a Wii U game has won Game of the Year. Weird! </p></div><div><p>In 2018, Sony’s big-budget open-world reboot of<em> God of War</em> won Game of the Year at The Game Awards. This will not be the last time a PlayStation-published title ends the night with the biggest award of the event. I remember some controversy over <em>God of War</em> beating out <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em> that year, but hey, both games received 8 nominations, so that’s something. </p></div><div><p>Oh look, another third-person pseudo-open-world action game wins the top prize at The Game Awards. This time it’s the Activision-published FromSoftware samurai action game, <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. </p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Death Stranding</em> set a record for most nominations in Game Award history, with Hideo Kojima’s walking simulator earning ten. I wonder how long that record will last...</p></div><div><p>Oh, that record didn’t last last long! In 2020, the very next year, Naughty Dog’s <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>received an incredible (and still unbeaten) 11 nominations and won seven of them, including Game of the Year. It was also PlayStation’s second GOTY win at the event. </p></div><div><p>For only the second time in Game Awards history, a multilplayer-only game won the top award in 2021. However, it wasn’t a big online shooter or MMO, but instead EA and Hazelight’s <em>It Takes Two</em>, a split-screen co-op action-puzzle game. And this year, the studio behind <em>It Takes Two</em> announced its next co-op game, <em>Split Fiction</em>, which looks great and is out in early 2025. </p></div><div><p>In 2022, FromSoftware became the first (and so far only) development studio to win Game of the Year at the Game Awards twice. This time the studio won for <em>Elden Ring,</em> a game which took over 2022. </p><p>The big fight in 2022 was between<em> God of War Ragnarök</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. And while the <em>God of War </em>sequel tied <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> for most nominations with 11  and picked up six wins, <em>Elden Ring </em>ultimately earned the GOTY honors. </p></div><div><p>Last year, <em>Baldur’s Gate III </em>from Larian Studios was the <em>Elden Ring </em>of the year, taking over my social media feeds for months and quickly becoming many people’s anticipated GOTY winner at the 2023 Game Awards. </p><p>However, 2023 was an incredible year for games and the Game of the Year noms at the Game Awards proved that, with releases such as <em>Alan Wake 2, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, </em>and <em>Spider-Man 2</em> all competing in a stacked line-up. Yet <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> beat them all, and won five other awards that night, too. </p></div><div><p>And that brings us to 2024. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-tgas-geoff-keighley-reviews-trailers-1851720812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-tgas-geoff-keighley-reviews-trailers-1851720812">The 10th Game Awards was probably the best show</a></span> Geoff Keighley has ever hosted, and the nominees for the top spot were a diverse bunch. There was <em>Balatro</em>, a card game made by one guy, DLC for<em> Elden Ring</em>, and a turn-based RPG, <em>Metaphor Refantazio</em>. </p><p>But the winner of the night was the delightfully fun <em>Astro Bot,</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-rebirth-astro-bot-winners-goty-list-1851720291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-rebirth-astro-bot-winners-goty-list-1851720291">which also picked up three other awards and received seven noms</a></span>. This was also the third PlayStation-published game to win GOTY at The Game Awards. Will Microsoft’s <em>Avowed </em>be able to win next year in 2025, giving Xbox its first GOTY win? I don’t know, but we’ll find out in December 2025. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As we were doing the run-up to the film, it was like, ‘Alright, Danny, try this on. Alright, try this on.’ At the same time, I was training. So the suit kept changing and changing. By the time it was ready for me to wear on set, I remember looking at it and being like, ‘Oh, that’s it. Holy shit!’”</p><p>I think we all had the same reaction as Ramirez after watching the latest trailer. Now, we just have to wait until February 14 to see the Falcon fully in action. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even as the series won awards and drew in millions of viewers, there was an overarching sense that people are tired of <em>The Last of Us</em>. It doesn’t help that for the last few years, the series has been prominently sticking around without giving us anything new to talk about, as every new project has been a remake or recreation of what’s already come before. So even as a third game is apparently lurking in some office drawer at Naughty Dog, we haven’t anything truly new to talk about in years. <em>Part II</em> is an all-time top-five game for me, and even I’m tired of retreading it, though I’ll have to do it again when the second season of the show arrives next year. So yeah, let’s finally get Naughty Dog into a fresh new universe, and not one that it’s been taking us back to for the past two or three generations.</p><p><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> is a new science fiction game in which space travel had advanced significantly by the mid-‘80s. Director Neil Druckmann has cited sci-fi anime like <em>Akira </em>and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> as inspirations, and you can see that in just the brief glimpse we’ve gotten into the game thus far. There’s a retrofuturistic aesthetic to the first trailer, seen in details such as bounty hunter protagonist Jordan listening to compact discs and using CRT TVs in her spaceship. The game’s tone and subject matter look to be a far cry from the swashbuckling treasure-hunting and grim zombie-killing the studio has been focused on for so many years. Druckmann says it’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“return” to the studio’s action-adventure roots</a></span> which date back to the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> series, though <em>Intergalactic </em>is clearly maintaining some of the cinematic prestige television aspirations of Naughty Dog’s recent projects. It’s exciting to see a studio of talented people getting to flex on something wholly original for the first time in so long.</p><p>Druckmann told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em></a></span> that the studio had “earned” the space to make something new after the success of <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em>, both of which have gone on to become multimedia franchises Sony has pushed into other mediums. I’m not thrilled to hear that Naughty Dog is seemingly attaching the same aspirations to <em>Intergalactic</em>, as Druckmann says that the studio is now primed to be “an I.P. powerhouse.” I could see it becoming tethered to this game just as it has been to <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em>. After the end of <em>Uncharted 4</em>, that series could (and should) go away, but if it’s just going to be replaced by another decades-long franchise that Naughty Dog returns to every other game, I hope it doesn’t also mean the studio won’t be free to explore its next big idea for another console generation or two. It seems safe returns to profitable franchises that are harvested again and again for every drop of profit that can be extracted is all big companies want right now, though</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span><em> </em>launched this year, and despite being a tribute to PlayStation history, was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150">notably lacking in PS5 games</a></span> to celebrate.
