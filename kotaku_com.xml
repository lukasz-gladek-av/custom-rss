              <p>Cooking can feel overwhelming if you’ve never mastered timing, temperatures or knowing when meat is actually done. The Ninja <em>DZ550</em> <em>Foodi</em> solves these everyday kitchen frustrations by removing all the guesswork from meal preparation through its integrated thermometer that tells you exactly when your food reaches the perfect doneness level.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5066/">dropped this dual-basket air fryer from $249 down to just $129</a>, and the timing creates a great opportunity if you’re looking for restaurant-quality results without culinary school training. The <strong>two independent 5-quart baskets</strong> eliminate the stress of coordinating multiple dishes because the <em>Smart Finish</em> feature syncs everything to complete simultaneously.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5066/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Independent Baskets That Transform Meal Preparation</h2>
<p>The <em>DualZone</em> Technology offers <strong>two completely separate cooking zones with independent fans and heaters in each 5-quart basket</strong>. You can air fry chicken wings in one basket at 400°F while roasting sprouts in the other at 375°F. Both finish cooking at the same time, thanks to the <em>Smart Finish</em> feature that automatically calculates timing differences. The <em>Match Cook</em> function copies your settings from one basket to the other instantly; this is very useful when you need to cook larger amounts of the same food in both baskets, and gives you a total 10-quart capacity. IQ Boost spreads the 1690 watts of power efficiently across both zones. This improves cooking speed when you are preparing different items at the same time.</p>



<p>The integrated Foodi thermometer takes the guesswork out of cooking proteins by continuously monitoring internal temperature throughout the cooking process. Just insert the probe into your chicken breast or pork chop, select your desired doneness level from rare to well-done, and the system alerts you as soon as your food reaches perfection. This feature is invaluable for novice cooks unsure when meat is safe to eat. It also prevents overcooking expensive cuts by constantly checking and maintaining heat. The temperature range goes from 105°F for gentle dehydrating up to 450°F for high-heat searing and air frying, allowing you control over every cooking method.</p>



<p><strong>Six cooking programs</strong> cover almost every meal preparation scenario you’ll encounter: <em>Air Fry</em> gives crispy results using little to no oil by circulating superheated air around food at high speeds and creates that satisfying crunch on fries, wings, and breaded items.<em> Air Broil</em> applies intense heat from above to caramelize the surfaces of meats and vegetables. <em>Roast</em> envelops food in moderate heat for even cooking, perfect for whole chickens or root vegetables. <em>Bake</em> offers consistent heat distribution for cookies, muffins, and casseroles. <em>Reheat</em> warms leftovers without making them soggy like microwaves do. <em>Dehydrate</em> removes moisture at low temperatures over long periods, making it ideal for jerky, dried fruits, or vegetable chips.</p>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch footprint fits two large baskets</strong> while keeping counter space in check. The unit cooks food up to 30% faster than conventional ovens by eliminating preheating time and focusing heat directly around the food. Both nonstick cooking baskets and crisper plates are dishwasher safe for easy cleanup, and the nonstick coating prevents food from sticking. The gray finish resists fingerprints and blends seamlessly into most kitchen color schemes. This air fryer turns frozen foods into crispy meals in about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This is the lowest price ever on this Ninja XL air fryer, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sure, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-buds-4-pro-only-have-one-shot-at-challenging-airpods-pro-3-2000677942">rumors about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are swirling around</a> but here’s the real deal you need to know right now: The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon, and they’re crushing the competition, including Apple’s AirPods Pro. These earbuds combine top-tier active noise cancellation with cutting-edge AI features that adapt to your environment in real-time: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">slashed the price from $249 down to just $165, and over 30,000 people have already grabbed them</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Sound Engineering That Rivals Studio Headphones</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have been totally revamped by Samsung from the ground up: The dual-driver design used in them stands them out in terms of design from almost every earbud existing on the market. In each earbud, there’s a 10.5mm dynamic woofer that’s complimented by a 6.1mm planar magnetic tweeter that’s driven by dual amplifiers. The two-way speaker design provides an outstanding separation of bass and high details.</p>
<p>This opens an incredible soundstage that’s as spacious as it gets considering that it’s an earbud. The stems on these earbuds aren’t only fashionable – inside them reside cutting-edge microphones that enable the adaptive functions and provide sound that’s as clear as it gets on calls that have a 15kHz bandwidth.</p>



<p>The <strong>adaptative active noise cancellation powered by Galaxy AI</strong> adjusts based on your environment and automatically reaches peak isolation levels throughout your daily routine. Riding on a crowded subway to work? The noise cancellation amps up to max isolation levels. Headed to your favorite coffee shop that’s a bit less crowded? The noise cancellation adjusts to save on battery life while still staying focused on your work.</p>
<p>The system automatically pairs perfectly with Siren Detect capabilities that automatically shift you to ambient mode as soon as it picks up emergency vehicle sounds. All of these come in conjunction with an adaptive equalizer that automatically adjusts based on the earbuds’ fit inside your ears. In plain sight, it adjusts sound profiles based on acoustic leakage. No matter whether it’s a workout routine or working at your desk, these earbuds deliver constant levels of optimized sound. The earbuds’ <strong>water-resistant rating of IP57</strong> guarantees extreme durability despite exposure to rain or heavy sweating.</p>



<p>Galaxy AI integration offers capabilities that genuinely add value as opposed to just being catchy: The <strong>real-time interpreter offers face-to-face conversation translations via your earbuds</strong>. This overcomes language barriers during travel or international business meetings: The service enables you to answer calls in a given language and receive translations of those conversations in another. This functionality functions during earbud conversations via the Samsung Phone app.</p>
<p>Battery life provides the same six hours with ANC enabled and seven hours without it, <strong>which goes up to 26 hours when using the wireless charging case</strong>. The charging case design includes a transparent lid as well as an easy-to-carry design that fits perfectly inside your pocket. The charging slot for wired charging is positioned at the bottom of the charging case.</p>
<p>The earbuds come equipped with the latest connectivity of Bluetooth 5.4. They also feature Auracast that enables easy broadcasting of sound to nearby devices with Auracast capabilities. The company provides an additional two-year Amazon warranty exclusively for Samsung users.</p>
<p>All these factors combined at such an unbelievable low cost make the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro an incomparable value.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-is-going-all-in-now-selling-its-1800w-delta-3-classic-power-generator-for-peanuts-2000639643</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter’s arrival brings shorter days and unpredictable weather which makes backup power more important than ever. Power outages can strike at the worst moments, leaving you without heat, refrigeration or the ability to charge essential devices. That’s where portable power stations come in, and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5064/">Amazon has dropped the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic (1800 AC output) to an all-time low of $399, down from $599</a>. This is the Classic model, which differs from the base Delta 3 by offering a more streamlined feature set at a much lower price point. For most households, the Classic delivers everything you need without the premium add-ons.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5064/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power Without the Premium Price Tag</h2>
<p>The Delta 3 Classic comes with a 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery that holds immense value in terms of practical battery life. LiFePO4 battery life may sound like an advertising gimmick at first: The truth remains that LiFePO4 batteries enjoy an <strong>unmatched lifespan of more than 10 years</strong>. That simply implies that you can power this power bank thousands of times with minimal capacity loss.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1800W of continuous power</strong> supports your necessary electronics without an issue. The fridge in your house may not get power. Carry a space heating device to heat your room. No issues at all. Coffee maker in the early morning hours at your camping site. Nothing is more important than that. The<strong> X-Boost Technology increases your power capacity to 2600W</strong>. The starting surge power of 3600W provides power to your devices that consume high startup power without shutting your system down.</p>



<p>Charging speed is what sets good power stations from great ones: In that respect, the Delta 3 Classic stands out. The X-Stream AC charging system gets your power <strong>levels from zero to 80 percent in only 45 minutes</strong>. Consider that for a moment: In that amount of time, it takes to watch an episode of your favorite TV show, you’ll have enough power to last your laptop an entire workday as well as keep your fridge full of cold food throughout an outage.</p>
<p>The &lt;10ms UPS or uninterrupted power supply function may not seem like much at first, but it’s actually an enormously helpful addition. As someone who works from home and deals with flickering power supplies on a daily basis, the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic’s seamless changeover from power to battery backup means that your computer won’t miss a beat.</p>



<p>The ability to charge via solar power raises the functionality of the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic to a whole new level. Using an optional 500W solar panel, you’ll be able to recharge the power station within 2.5 hours of direct sunshine. This turns the power solution from being an emergency power solution system to being a long-term off-grid power solution. Planning an adventure camping experience at a remote destination over an extended weekend? Use your solar solution setup during the day. No power at your destination due to a power outage? Solar charging solutions ensure that you’re not off grid.</p>
<p>At $399, the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic provides an incredible value within the portable power station industry.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate 20TB External Hard Drive Now Costs $0.10 per GB, 50% Cheaper than Launch Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-20tb-external-hard-drive-now-costs-0-10-per-gb-50-cheaper-than-launch-price-2000639636</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-20tb-external-hard-drive-now-costs-0-10-per-gb-50-cheaper-than-launch-price.1337692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Digital storage needs spiral out of control faster than you can keep up with them, and watching your available space shrink while cloud subscription costs climb month after month creates a frustrating cycle that never ends.</p>
<p>Seagate has lost its mind <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">with the pricing on its 20TB Expansion HDD, slashing it to $229 from the $499 launch price</a> which creates the situation where this massive drive costs less than the 12TB model still sitting at $299 on Amazon. You’re <strong>paying around $0.01 per gigabyte</strong>, half the launch cost and <strong>roughly ten times cheaper than equivalent SSD storage</strong> for this kind of capacity.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Mechanical Beats Solid State on Value</h2>
<p>SSDs dominate performance conversations with their 2,000 MB/s transfer speeds and instant access times, but when you need to store 20 terabytes of data, the math shifts dramatically in favor of mechanical drives: A 2TB SSD runs $150 to $200 (putting it at $0.07 to $0.10 per gigabyte) while this Seagate unit delivers the same price for ten times the capacity.</p>
<p>This <strong>Seagate drive pushes data at 220 to 246 MB/s over USB 3.0</strong> which handles large backup operations, media library management and archive storage without breaking a sweat since you’re not booting operating systems or running applications from external storage anyway. Moving a 50GB file takes roughly four to five minutes which is perfectly adequate for transferring weekend photo shoots or shuffling game installations between drives.</p>



<p>The quoted capacity of 20TB provides ample capacity for the <strong>retention of more than 5 million high-definition images at 3.5MB each, 4,000 hours of video at 1080p resolution, or 50 full game copies of 100GB on average</strong>. The drive comes pre-formatted with exFAT and allows it to work seamlessly with both Windows computers and computers from Apple without needing to format it once.</p>
<p>The setup process could not be simpler since you simply attach <strong>the 18-inch USB 3.0 cable from the drive’s micro-USB connector to your computer’s USB port</strong> and attach the 18W power adaptor to an electrical outlet. The set comes with international plug adapters that fit on the power brick; thus, various electrical outlets found in different nations won’t pose a problem. No need to install anything on your system since the process of getting underway happens in less than a minute as you simply drag files from your system to the drive icon on your desktop to copy them or drag them back to retrieve them.</p>



<p>The drive has the advantage of supporting backward compatibility on older ports of version 2.0. However, data transfer rates on these ancient interfaces become 30 to 40 MB/s. The power gadget uses wall current as opposed to drawing power from the universal bus. As such, the drive has unrestricted access to 7200 RPM on 3.5-inch disks without reducing laptop power without overstressing the power output on USB connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>data recovery services from Seagate come free</strong> with every purchase for professional data recovery needed in the worst of circumstances of drive failure and comes at an added cost of $500-$2,000. The limited lifetime hardware parts and labor warranty given by the company insures that the buyer can get a replacement should anything fail within a year of purchase.</p>
<p>The competitive pricing of this offer makes it even more impressive since Western Digital’s 20TB drives usually starts at $400 and enterprise-oriented solutions from companies like G-Technology cost $400-$500. In comparison to that, the lowest-priced category of drives like the <strong>reviewed Seagate solution offers the same capacity and speed at a way more affordable price</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-60000mah-power-station-is-cheaper-than-a-budget-no-name-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies-2000639627</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-60-000mah-power-station-is-cheaper-than-a-budget-no-name-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies.1337647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your phone dies at the worst moments. Your laptop battery gives up mid-presentation. Power outages leave you sitting in the dark scrolling through a phone at 5% battery. Generic power banks help a little but they barely charge your phone twice before needing a recharge themselves. The Anker <em>PowerCore Reserve</em> changes the game with 60,000mAh of capacity that can <strong>charge an iPhone 17 over ten times</strong>. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/"> just dropped this powerhouse to $79, down from $149</a>, hitting an all-time low price that costs barely more than a no-name 10,000mAh power bank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Battery Technology That Lasts a Decade</h2>
<p>The power bank uses LiFePO4 battery types. Although it may sound complicated, it’s actually very important: In normal Li-ion batteries used by those cheap power banks that last only a year at most, the charging cycle ends at 500 to 1,000 cycles. The power bank from Anker uses 3,000 cycles: That’s three thousand charging cycles or complete discharge cycles before the battery’s capacity reaches 80%. <strong>That’s around a decade of normal life</strong>.</p>
<p>The true advantage of LiFePO4 over a standard lithium ion battery is more than endurance: This form of battery prevents thermal runaway. In technical terms, LiFePO4 <strong>prevents overheating of a battery</strong> that eventually leads to it exploding in a fire. The high temperature tolerability of LiFePO4 ranges from –4°F to 140°F which makes it ideal for winter camping or summer road travel.</p>



<p>The <strong>192Wh battery capacity translates to 60,000mAh with a cell voltage of 3.2V</strong>. The battery provides enough power to charge a MacBook Air 2.9 times or power an LED light of 3 watts for 42.3 hours. The LED power duration comes in handy during prolonged power outages of several days when you may require constant illumination without having to recharge smartphones. The <strong>power bank comes with four charging ports</strong>: These include <strong>two charging sockets of 27W and 60W</strong> through the USB C charging sockets.</p>
<p>The <strong>XT60 input port supports the connection of solar panels</strong> with a capacity of up to 60W: The Anker power station can now become a sustainable off-grid power solution (the solar panels are not included). The power station takes around four hours to recharge with a 60W USB C wall charger.</p>



<p>The <strong>digital smart display</strong> takes over the face of the front panel and comes with information such as battery life, input power level, output power level, and estimated remaining life. This provides real-time data that helps you determine perfectly the amount of power being used and the remaining life based on current power levels. No need to guess whether you’ll have enough power to last the night.</p>
<p>The device measures <strong>4.59 inches wide, 4.59 inches deep, and 8.17 inches high</strong>: That’s comparable in size to a large water bottle. Weighing 5.1 pounds makes it heavy enough to be substantial but light enough to throw into a backpack or emergency kit. The green cloth exterior provides good traction that won’t slide off and comes with a flat-folded handle.</p>
<p>For $79 for a 60,000mAh LiFePO4 power bank that can recharge from the sun’s power, you’re paying pennies – 0.001 per milliamp-hour. That’s a fraction of what each power bank on the market costs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbls-mini-bluetooth-speaker-is-selling-for-pennies-now-cheaper-than-an-old-dumb-radio-2000639597</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl%E2%80%99s-mini-bluetooth-speaker-is-selling-for-pennies-now-cheaper-than-an-old-dumb-radio.1337644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tiny speakers get no respect, but they solve a real problem. Your phone’s speaker sounds terrible. Your laptop barely projects past your keyboard. You need music in places where dragging a full-size speaker makes zero sense: the shower, the kitchen counter while cooking, your workbench in the garage, or clipped to your backpack on a winter hike. Amazon just dropped the JBL Go 3 to $29, down from $39, hitting an all-time low price that puts this rugged Bluetooth speaker cheaper than most wired alarm clocks. At this price, you’re paying less than a dollar per hour of battery life for a speaker that can survive getting dropped in a snowbank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4565/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pocket-Sized Power That Survives Everything</h2>
<p>The JBL Go 3 has a width of 3.4 inches by 2.7 inches high and 1.6 inches deep, and a weight of 0.46 pounds. The speaker has a 43 x 47mm driver that produces 4.2 watts of sound: The sound signature of JBL’s Pro Sound design <strong>includes bass response from the tiny speaker</strong> instead of high-pitched treble on lower-priced models. The frequency response of the speaker includes 110 Hz to 20kHz to encompass the full range of your hearing.</p>
<p>The <strong>rating of IP67 water resistant and dust resistant</strong> provides that it can withstand being submerged in full water, at a depth of a meter for 30 minutes. Place it in your shower as you rinse off the chill. Use it on your countertop as you clean dishes from dinner. Attach it to your jacket as you walk out into the snow and aren’t concerned as freezing rain begins to fall. The speaker won’t slip from the countertop or smooth surface as it sits there. The attached loop of cloth that comes with it enables you to attach it to your shower hooks or carabiners.</p>



<p>The speaker <strong>comes with Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity that connects rapidly to smartphones</strong>, tablets, and laptops and provides a constant connectivity connection from 10 to 15 meters away. The five buttons on top of the speaker control power on/off, pair the speaker with devices via Bluetooth connectivity, play/pause music as well as increase and decrease the sound volume.</p>
<p>Battery life goes an <strong>estimated five hours on a single charge</strong> but it’s been known to extend well beyond that based on overall audio output levels. Charging only takes 2.5 hours via the new USB C port. This leaves behind those days of digging around for a proprietary charging cord only found in your smoking hot new TV or powering a brick-sized micro-USB wall charger.</p>



<p>The internal microphone provides speakerphone capability with noise and echo reduction: This makes it a convenience device for when <strong>you want to take your calls while cooking in the kitchen or showering</strong>. The speaker design provides mono sound that resonates from the front on one side. The rubber on the back of the speaker prevents it from slipping: This particular design trait appears practical for transportability as opposed to stereo sound that you won’t be needing inside a shower or kitchen.</p>
<p>At $29, the speaker may be purchased for less than the average ticket to a movie and provides years of enjoyment. Budget-friendly Bluetooth speakers usually have to cut back on either sound quality, durability, or battery life. The Go 3 doesn’t scrimp on anything in those departments.</p>

              <p>Apple’s iPad Pro lineup easily soars past the $1,000 mark, and that’s before you even think about adding a Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil. But the standard iPad has always been refreshingly different. It brings the Apple experience without the Pro price tag. Right now, Amazon is clearing out the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">2025 iPad 11-inch with the A16 chip, 128GB storage and WiFi connectivity for just $299, down from $349</a>. This drops Apple’s already approachable tablet right into budget Android territory, where devices like the Fire Max 11 typically hang out. Except here, you’re getting the full Apple ecosystem with iPadOS.</p>

<h2>The Apple Chip That Changes Everything</h2>
<p>Inside this iPad sits the A16 processor which is same chip Apple put in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15. We’re talking about a <strong>5-core CPU running at 3.4 GHz paired with a 4-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine</strong>. That means smooth multitasking across apps, fast photo editing and gaming performance that leaves budget Android tablets in the dust. The A16 powers through 4K video playback and handles productivity tasks like document editing or spreadsheet work. <strong>Apple paired this chip with 6GB of RAM</strong>, up from 4GB in the previous generation so you can keep more apps running in the background without slowdowns.</p>
<p>The screen also gets a mention: The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina offers 2360 x 1640 resolution</strong> at 264 pixels per inch with 500 nits of brightness. The True Tone comes handy as it <strong>adjusts the color temperature depending on the lighting</strong> of your room. This makes reading on the screen very easy on your eyes when you’re late at night. The screen size comes handy as it helps you watch movies on planes, read digital copies of your favorite magazines and watch recipe videos in the kitchen.</p>



<p><strong>Apple increased the base memory to 128GB of storage</strong>, at last providing enough room for your apps, photos, and downloaded Netflix content without having to juggle memory around. The 12-megapixel camera on the rear of the laptop now records 4K video. The camera scans documents quite well using Smart HDR 4 capabilities to extract additional detail and colors from your images, and the 12-megapixel Ultra Wide camera on the front of the laptop supports Center Stage: Apple’s clever functionality automatically zooms as you move around during video communications.</p>



<p>Connectivity includes the basics with Wi-Fi 6 for improved internet speed and efficiency on busy networks, as well as Bluetooth 5.3 for your wireless headphones and keyboards. The USB-C connector supplies power to the tablet as well as hooks it up to an external monitor or an external storage drive. The limitation here being that it maintains only USB 2.0 data transfer speed. The fingerprint ID sensor resides inside the power button: This provides swift and secure unlocking without resorting to facial recognition. The <strong>battery life lasts an entire day of normal use and 10 hours of web browsing</strong> or video playback before needing a recharge.</p>
<p>The true value comes in the software ecosystem: The latest version of the operating system (iPadOS) provides better multitasking functions that enable you to work with two applications at once or have access to a third via Slide Over. The new and improved App Store provides you with access to two million applications that have been designed with the bigger screen of the iPad.</p>
<p>For $299, it goes low enough on the totem pole among low/mid-range Android offerings but offers world-class build quality.</p>
