              <p>The thing I love most about Evo is you can turn on any of the tournaments at any moment and instantly feel the tension, hope, and despair with every combo, counter, and unexpected reversal of fortune. <a href="https://kotaku.com/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025-2000614410">Evo 2025 is over now</a>, but it left us with plenty of great matches (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCdhFfH85a8">the highlight for me was the T<em>ekken</em> top 8</a>) and lots of new fighting game announcements.

Arc System Works revealed dates for a closed beta next month. It’ll take place on PS5 on September 5 through 7 and include Captain America, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Star Lord, Storm, and Doctor Doom. <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/">Players can sign-up here</a>.

Now Sega has released a short trailer showing series fighters Akira and Sarah Bryant unloading on one another in front of a training stage. The next entry in the series is being developed by <em>Yakuza</em> maker Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and fans can expect more info out of Tokyo Game Show this fall. <a href="https://x.com/GamesCage_/status/1952149691736760393">People are hyped</a>. The <em>VF5 </em>remaster <em><span>Virtua Fighter</span> 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</em>, meanwhile, arrives on October 30.</p>

Some <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1952275304774508728?t=GTrscs-QIQA1T8PwgO2HOg&amp;s=19">fans are already debating</a> whether they like the final version more or less than the original concept art, which shows her with a darker complexion.</p> <h2><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> comes to <em>Guilty Gear</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Season Pass 4 Playable Character #4 [Lucy] Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hi76aA61PQQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The <em>Guilty Gear -Strive-</em> Season Pass 4 includes Lucy from the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> Netflix anime <em>Edgerunners</em>. The introverted protagonist will be available starting August 21, while season 2 of the show isn’t expected to become available until late next year or early 2027. Producer Ken Miyauchi <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-producer-speaks-out-on-rumors-of-canceled-follow-up-game-3233422/">shot down recent rumors</a> that a new <em>Guilty Gear</em> game had been canceled and suggested <em>Strive</em> still has a long road ahead, including the new 2.0 update coming later this month.</p> <h2><em>Street Fighter</em>‘s Ken joins the new <em>Fatal Fury</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FATAL FURY: CotW × STREET FIGHTER｜KEN" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6byynkBnQOM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>He isn’t<em> Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>‘ first cameo character but he’s by far the most exciting. Ken is available now, with Chun-Li joining sometime over the winter. It’s the follow-up to a crossover exchange that began with Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui coming to <em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>last year. The game itself has some strong fundamentals but is extremely content-light and hard to recommend with so much stronger competition around.</p>

              <p>Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios—a team made up of four EA-owned studios—are focused on making sure the upcoming military shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield</em> 6</a> is extremely well-optimized, with the developers claiming the game will run on all consoles and platforms at 60FPS or more.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">EA revealed <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s multiplayer in a big event in Los Angeles</a>. A large group of journalists (myself included) and content creators were invited there and got to play over four hours of <em>BF6</em>. The game reminds me a lot of <em>Battlefield 3</em> and <em>Battlefield 4,</em> and that’s not by accident. The team of studios working on the FPS is specifically trying to create a new <em>Battlefield</em> game that harkens back to those more grounded and contemporary military shooters that were both fan favorites. From what I’ve played so far, they’ve nailed it. And another thing that I can confirm EA and Battlefield Studios have nailed is the game’s performance, which ran perfectly during my preview. That’s not shocking considering how hard the devs are working to ensure<em> Battlefield 6</em> runs well on all platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106788/battlefield-6-on-ps5-60fps-fidelity-mode-90fps-performance-120fps-pro/index.html">As spotted by <em>TweakTown</em></a>, in a recent interview with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s principal game designer Florian Le Biha during the LA event, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2VK2fCG3HI?t=78">YouTuber Tech &amp; Co asked about the game’s&nbsp;performance and optimization</a> and Le Biha confirmed that it will run at a minimum of 60FPS on all consoles and PC.</p>

 <p>“Well, optimization for us has been one of the most important things for [<em>Battlefield 6</em>],” said Le Biha. “We want to make sure that it’s not just a game that looks graphically super beautiful, but it’s also a game that runs on all configurations, whether it’s on PC or on all Xbox or PS5 [consoles] of this generation. So we put a lot of effort into optimizing the game. We guarantee 60FPS on all experiences on consoles, [higher framerates] on PC, obviously, and even more on consoles [which support] performance mode, which allows you to go even higher.”</p> <p>As further reported by <em>TweakTown</em>, a player who says they are involved in <em>BF6</em>‘s extensive early access playtesting program, known as BFLabs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mesy9p/battlefield_6_pc_console_performance/">claims on Reddit</a> that the upcoming milsim targets 80FPS in performance mode on PlayStation 5 and also suggested that the PS5 Pro version of the game will hit 120FPS. They also explained that the Xbox Series S doesn’t have a performance mode, but still hits 60FPS, which lines up with what Le Biha told Tech &amp; Co.</p> <p>I can personally confirm that when I played <em>Battlefield 6</em> on PS5 at a party hosted by EA after the event, the game ran extremely well, looking like at least a stable and locked 60 FPS with no noticeable drops. On PC, when I played the game during the event, it ran at over 120FPS and felt buttery smooth. Of course, things could change when the game arrives in October or when people go hands-on later this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700">during <em>BF6</em>‘s open beta.</a> But it does indeed seem like the devs are focused on making sure BF6 is super well-optimized on all platforms, even the Xbox Series S.</p>

              <p>Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to <em>The Sims 4</em>? Why is <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em> objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at <em>Kotaku</em> experiment with reviving our <a href="https://kotaku.com/culture/morning-checkpoint">old Morning Checkpoint roundup series</a> that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first <em>Call of Duty</em> developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go!</p> <h2><em>The Sims 5</em> wouldn’t be ‘player friendly’</h2> <p>That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">told <em>Variety</em></a> when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. “What I wouldn’t want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that you’ve purchased over the years,” she said. “We put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on <em>The Sims 4</em>, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.” What fans are getting is a <em>Sims</em> movie <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-ea-1851355482">with help from <em>Barbie</em>‘s Margot Robbie</a>. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p> <h2>One sequel we are getting is <em>Darksiders 4</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Darksiders 4 - Announce Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_Wx2qlbdOM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> testers win second Microsoft gaming union contract</h2> <p>Quality assurance devs at <em>Call of Duty</em> support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-to-1847362030">amid the 2021 workplace fallout,</a> but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at <em>Updater</em> <a href="https://shannonliao.substack.com/p/3-years-later-they-won?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">now reports</a> that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao.</p>

 <h2>Global warming will make it harder to play Switch 2 outside</h2> <p>Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/heat-records-broken-japan-heatwave-climate-change-5275641">continuing to blaze through temperature records</a>. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651">posted</a>. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5–35°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-climate-change-temperature-handheld-1849168252">back in 2022</a>. Everything is <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462">going great</a>, folks.</p> <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors</em> is getting a super, secret remaster</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS 25th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qlDkMLMoSg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the <em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlDkMLMoSg">celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-beginner-tips-upgrade-skirmish-1851744251"><em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em></a>, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> <em>3</em>, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games?</p> <h2>Fight censorship, get free games</h2> <p>Over 1 million people claimed the <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/">FreedomToBuy bundle</a> from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1951999439024869715">the storefront reports</a>. It included <em>Postal 2</em>, <em>Agon</em>y, <em>Fetish Locator Week One</em>, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">due to payment processors</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> isn’t getting delayed</h2> <p>The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/">near the end of August</a>. A November release date is feeling more and more likely.</p> <h2>Happy 40th Birthday Rare</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614509"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614509">8bitdo</figcaption></figure> <p>Someone on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/1mh6aho/new_wireless_8bitdo_xbox_controller_leaked_on/">found a leaked Amazon listing</a> for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">the 40th anniversary</a> of Rare, the studio best known for<em> Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, among other iconic classics. It’s $90 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ?tag=kotaku01-20">looks very nice</a>. There’s also a vinyl soundtrack collection and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/04/rare-40th-anniversary-rewards-sea-of-thieves/">Evercade cartridges for old Rare games</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">Valve and Mastercard are feuding over who’s to blame for sex game censorship</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">A <em>Bioshock</em> remake was shelved and <em>Bioshock 4</em> is in trouble</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">After 4 Hours With <em>Battlefield</em> 6 I’m Convinced It Has The Juice</a></strong></li> </ul>
