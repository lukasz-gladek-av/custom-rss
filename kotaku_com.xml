And now, with the arrival of the <em>Lunar Remastered Collection</em>, the long and tortuous wait for these beloved games is finally over. This updated collection combines both titles alongside plenty of improvements that will make returning and new players excited to dive in. Here’s what’s new, how long the games take to beat, and which platforms the <em>Lunar Remastered Collection</em> is available for. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,196055,195755" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#new&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#new">What’s new in the remastered collection?</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#silverstar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#silverstar">How long is <em>Lunar: Silver Star Story</em>?</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#blue&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#blue">How long is <em>Lunar 2: Eternal Blue</em>?</a></span><br>4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#platforms&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#platforms">Platforms</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h30283"><a id="new"></a>What’s new in <em>Lunar Remastered Collection</em>?</h2><p><em>Lunar Remastered Collection</em> features a wide variety of quality of life upgrades over the original versions of these classic role-playing titles.

I’d say that’s a pretty damn good deal, so just take the plunge. Do it. Really. They’re awesome. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though it may lack the polish of many of the games it borrows ideas from, it provides compelling enough gameplay that genre fans may find it worth their time to see how things play out for main character Zoe and her little drone, Koby. But how much time will you need to invest exactly? Let’s take a look at how long it takes to beat <em>Steel Seed</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,197551,197550" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h28155"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Steel Seed</em>?</h2><p><em>Steel Seed</em> is a pretty linear game with <strong>a clear and focused campaign that should take the average player somewhere between 10-12 hours to complete</strong>.

For those who enjoy collecting everything in this type of game, though, that won’t be a bad thing, especially since it’s all relatively straightforward.</p><p>You’ll need to buy every upgrade in the game from each of the three skill trees. You’ll also need to find all 114 glitch crystals, as well as various health modules, drones, notes, and more as you explore levels. In other words, you’ll have plenty to look for when you’re not engaged in the game’s stealth and action gameplay. You should expect a completionist run to add another two or three hours.</p><p>If you’re going for every trophy or achievement in <em>Steel Seed</em>, you’ll definitely have to do all of the above—and then some. You’ll need to eliminate a certain number of specific enemy types, ensure you kill 50 enemies using your drone, and even play a couple of melodies on a piano at some point in the game. </p><p>Whether you want to do everything in the game or simply see the campaign through, you can pick up <em>Steel Seed</em> now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, there are some optional improvements you can make early on that’ll make a difference. </p><p>The Scanner and Survey Tool enhancements in the Suit tree are some the most important, as these are vital to your exploration. For the Scanner, you’ll want to grab “Intelli-Visor Upgrade” to improve the range of your Scanner. And for your Survey Tool, make sure you pick up “The ‘Fancy Nancy’ Equipment Tagger” so that using Survey will let you tag nearby Supply Crates and Orange Goo, and “Survey Range Booster” to increase the range you can do so.</p><p>Oh, and don’t pass up “Landing Impact Nullifier” in the Suit tree either, as it’ll completely eliminate fall damage. You’ll be doing a lot of exploring at high altitudes, so you’ll be thankful you don’t take damage when you take a tumble down a mountain.</p><h2 id="h22320"><a id="survey"></a>Survey, survey, survey</h2><figure id="" data-id="5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-recommend-id="image://5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-recommend-id="image://5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of the Survey Tool, make sure you’re spamming it as you explore new areas by clicking in the right stick on the controller (or whatever key it is on PC for those of you using a typing device to control a video game). Once you have the upgrades listed above, you’ll be able to tag a lot of nearby collectibles, as well as ping any veins in the vicinity that you can destroy for materials.</p><p>A lot of collectibles are gated off during the early hours due to you not having the necessary upgrades to access them, but they’ll nonetheless get tagged when you survey. You can note which Supply Crates and Orange Goos are accessible to you at any given time on the map by checking to see if they have a small lock on the icon. So, even if you can’t get to them now, you’ll be very happy to have these locations tagged for you when you’re ready to return later.</p><h2 id="h22321"><a id="research"></a>Don’t put off challenges or research</h2><figure id="" data-id="582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-recommend-id="image://582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-recommend-id="image://582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll sometimes get side-quests in the form of challenges to complete. For instance, one of the earliest of these gives you a handful of tasks to perform out in the world, such as sliding a certain distance or dive bombing into water from high up. While these may seem relatively unimportant at a glance, completing them will actually unlock new blueprints at the 3D printer for some of the best weapon and movement upgrades in the game. So, ya know, don’t let these waste away in your quest log.</p><p>Meanwhile, don’t forget to research your captured creatures! Each creature you capture can be researched using the computer terminal at the habitat, and staying on top of this can earn you stuff like color schemes and upgrades. Make sure you’re checking in frequently to keep the research rolling.</p><h2 id="h22322"><a id="death"></a>Always retrieve your stuff after you die</h2><figure id="" data-id="864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-recommend-id="image://864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-recommend-id="image://864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, you’re probably gonna die in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. So get used to it. But each time you die, you’ll drop much-needed materials which can set you back quite a bit if you don’t go back for them. When this happens, you’ll receive a quest called “I Take That Back”. Immediately set this as your tracked quest, then return to the biome in which you died.</p><p>Unfortunately, your stuff is frequently not in the exact location you died but rather somewhere in that general vicinity. This can make for a more frustrating recovery, but just play things safe and follow your compass. When you reach the location of your stuff, you’ll find a loot box you can click on to grant you everything you dropped. Whew. </p><hr><p><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming to know what’s most important to tackle next. But as you acclimate to the game’s pacing and information, you’ll slowly start being able to narrow down what’s most pertinent.</p><p>Once you’ve settled into a groove, you’ll be able to decide whether you want to focus on the main story or go the completionist route. If your goal is the former, <strong>you can expect to spend around 12-15 hours reaching the credits for the main story</strong>. But opting for this path means that you’ll be leaving a lot of fun quests and optional exploration behind.</p><p>If you decide to go for a completionist run of <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>, you’ll get a whole lot more out of the adventure. <strong>A 100% run of the game can net you between 20-25 hours worth of gameplay,</strong> depending on how good you are at sussing out secret areas and well-hidden collectibles.</p><p>And there are a<em> lot </em>of collectibles in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. Folks who enjoy searching every nook and cranny for upgrade resources and fun extras will have fun exploring the game’s multiple dense planets. And you’ll need to do a hell of a lot of scanning for research purposes, too.</p><p>As you can see,<em> Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> can keep you pretty busy. If that sounds up your alley, the game is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The report notes that a Tarnished Pack DLC will be made available for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC, presumably with a price tag in the realm of $10-$20, though FromSoftware hasn’t confirmed that yet. We also don’t know if it will arrive on all platforms at the same time or have a brief staggered release window. <br></p><p>Still, I’m sure the over 30 million players who have already bought <em>Elden Ring</em> will be stoked to know there’s new stuff coming, and while it’s not an entirely new boss or other major piece of content, new classes and items should offer returning players some fun additional tools to experiment with. Somehow I don’t think the open-world RPG has hit its last major milestone. I also don’t think anyone would be put out if FromSoftware decided to keep sneaking out new content here and there, either. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
