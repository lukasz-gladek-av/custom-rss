              <p>Laptop upgrades don’t always have to break the bank. Even though Black Friday and Cyber Monday are long gone, there are ways to bag some massive discounts on items across a range of categories, including laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">Gamers and creatives looking to upgrade their everyday machine should consider grabbing the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, which is currently available at a whopping 65% discount at Amazon.</a> It would run you around $2,000 on a regular day, but you can grab it today for just $700. That’s similar to what most entry-level options cost these days. This is also the lowest we have seen the laptop drop to in a while, and the deal is available to all shoppers, whether you’re a Prime member or not. Note that the retailer has listed the discount as a limited-time one, so it’s best to grab it fast. Deals such as this one tend to wrap up quickly, and we’re expecting Amazon to push the price back up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Gamers and Creatives</h2>
<p>IdeaPads are sleek powerhouses. This one, in particular, comes with a full-sized keyboard with a dedicated numeric keypad; comfortable to type longer documents with ease. It’s not backlit, but the keyboard is paired with a bright display that lets you work in any lighting. The 15.3-inch WUXGA IPS screen delivers a brilliant 1920×1200 resolution to bring all your favorite content to life in vibrant detail. The 300 nits of brightness take care of the visibility, while the anti-glare coating makes sure the display is easy on the eyes, whether you’re using it in a dimly lit room or out there in the sun.</p>
<p>There’s also a 720p HD camera with a privacy shutter included, plus digital microphones for better video calls. Audio is taken care of by the built-in dual 2W speakers, meaning you won’t just enjoy stunning visuals, but enjoy better sound for whatever’s playing on the screen, too. Additionally, the battery life is impressive. You can expect it to last a full day for lighter tasks (browsing, streaming), while around 2-4 hours for heavier tasks. When running low, the Rapid Charge Boost gets the machine back up and running in no time. You’ll get an extra 2 hours of usage with just a quick 15-minute top-up.</p>



<p>As for the power, Slim 3 runs on the 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, which smartly combines portability and durability, letting you be productive (plus game) on the go. The 24GB DDR5 SDRAM memory keeps things running smoothly, even during demanding days, which is especially great for multitaskers. You’ll be able to perform a bunch of tasks at the same time without slowing down, whether it’s using different apps simultaneously, gaming with friends, trying to hit deadlines in a short period of time, getting feedback on your creative tasks, using multiple windows side-by-side, and more.</p>
<p>The built-in 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD makes it just as easy to store all your important stuff in a single place. The laptop can house most of your important media files, work documents, creative projects, and programs without a problem. Of course, it’s not massive enough to store entire game libraries, but should be sufficient for casual use. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a wide range of ports to connect peripherals.</p>
<p>All things considered, we recommend the laptop for casual gamers, creatives, work professionals, and even students. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">It’s now down to just $700, which is quite affordable considering all the features you’re getting with this one.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="157" data-end="888">Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean all the best discounts have disappeared with them. In fact, one of the strongest lingering deals right now is on the Apple AirPods 4. Even though these earbuds are just over a year old, they’re getting a surprisingly steep price cut—making this an ideal moment to grab a pair if you’ve been waiting for a sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">The ANC-enabled AirPods 4 launched at $179, but Amazon currently has them marked down 45%, bringing the price to just $99</a>. That’s a staggering $80 off the original cost. If you prefer add on AppleCare+, the version packed with Apple’s coverage is also discounted down to just $118 (down from $208).</p>
<p data-start="890" data-end="1292">AirPods have been a staple in Apple’s lineup for years, and each generation sees subtle but meaningful refinements. The newest AirPods 4 introduce a sleeker shape with a shorter stem and intuitive quick-press controls for managing your audio. Apple has put an emphasis on all-day comfort in this redesign, aiming to make them easier to wear for longer stretches—whether you’re commuting, working, or relaxing.</p>

<h2 data-start="1294" data-end="1311">Isolate Sound</h2>
<p data-start="1313" data-end="1686">One of the biggest upgrades comes from Apple’s H2 chip, which significantly improves call quality. The chip enables advanced voice isolation that filters out background noise, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly, even in loud or crowded environments. Instead of competing with chatter, engine noise, or street sounds, your voice remains front and center.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">That same H2 chip enhances your listening experience as well. Apple’s updated acoustic architecture is designed to deliver richer audio, offering detailed highs and deeper bass for music, podcasts, and videos. The improvements make everyday listening feel more dynamic and polished.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">With active noise cancellation, you can reduce unwanted background noise so you can focus solely on your entertainment or phone call. The H2 chip allows the AirPods 4 to blend together ANC and Transparency Mode. If you start speaking with someone nearby, the AirPods 4 can automatically adjust the volume of what’s playing so you can hold a conversation.</p>


<p data-start="1972" data-end="2365">Another enhancement is the new interaction capabilities with Siri—Apple’s voice assistant. The AirPods 4 can interpret simple head gestures like nodding yes or shaking your head noas responses to Siri’s questions. It’s a futuristic touch, though I’m not sure which is weirder. Someone sitting across from you seeing you blankly nodding and shaking your head, or deadpan whispering “yes” or “no” to seemingly nobody.</p>
<p data-start="2367" data-end="2703">One immediately noticeable change from the previous generation is the charging port. Apple has finally moved away from the proprietary Lightning connector. The AirPods 4 charging case now uses USB-C, aligning with the broader industry standard and making charging more convenient if you already have USB-C cables for your other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2705" data-end="2995" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday now behind us, it is a pleasant surprise to see a deal this strong still available—especially on a newer Apple product.</a> If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your earbuds, the ongoing discount on the AirPods 4 is worth taking advantage of while it lasts.</p>
