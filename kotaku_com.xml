              <p>Roger Clark, who plays&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>‘s lead character Arthur Morgan, has a sideline in Cameo messages. The actor recently posted to his X account (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">thanks&nbsp;<em>IGN</em></a>) to talk about an all-time favorite request he’d received, from a man who had just deleted his fiance’s&nbsp;<em>RDR2</em> save game and was looking for any hope of getting out of trouble.</p> <p>“I just deleted by fiance’s saved game in Red Dead Redemption II by accident,” began the anonymous buffoon’s message to Roger Clark. And as if that weren’t bad enough, he underlined the severity of the situation. “She was having so much fun and made every ethical decision, had about 2/3 completed.” Oh dude. There’s surely no coming back from this.</p>

 <p>Although reaching out to Arthur Morgan himself is likely an excellent first step. Posting <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022059161887137920%7Ctwgr%5E9637e6ec535fb2abda3e575092f1fa3e90fd65de%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Flet-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">to his X account</a>, Clark told his followers how much he values their support on his Cameo, thanking them for “liking my shout outs.” He notes that he enjoys them all, but adds “it’s ones like these that I live for.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really am blown away by the support you guys show me on cameo. Thank you for liking my shout outs. I enjoy them all but it’s ones like these below that I live for. Let us all send this poor girl positive vibes. At least her man knows what he did. <a href="https://twitter.com/cameo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cameo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cameo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cameo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rdr2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rdr2</a> <a href="https://t.co/U0nHM2pLVT">pic.twitter.com/U0nHM2pLVT</a></p> <p>— Roger Clark (@rclark98) <a href="https://twitter.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While we can’t see the Cameo itself, for obvious reasons, we do get to see the full text of the request. After explaining the situation, the requester added, “Can you say some words of support for this devastating loss and let her know I am sorry?”</p>

 <p>What a situation to be in. This is dozens of hours of impassioned playing, lost forever, somehow not stored in the cloud. And this is a fiance, remember—it’s not too late for her to walk away without any paperwork. Will a message from the game’s main character be enough, or will that just rub salt in the wound?</p>

 <p>The agonizing thing is, unless the perpetrator reveals himself, we’ll never know how this worked out! Did the message patch things up? Is she some sort of angel who can forgive an enormity of this scale? Please, anonymous person, find your way to Reddit.</p>

              <p>I hope Capcom doesn’t spoil<a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em> Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>‘s momentum with an annualized release roadmap. Someone modded Goku into <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></a>. And I bet you can’t guess how upset God of War’s creator is at the new 2D <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-sons-sparta-prequel-2d-retro-shadowdrop-2000668367"><i>God of War Sons of Sparta</i></a><em>&nbsp;</em>game. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. All the clipped drama that’s fit to print!</p> <p>Let’s remember some games. How about <a href="https://x.com/RagnarSan22/status/2022639748796588448"><em>Radiata Stories</em></a>? Now <em>that </em>was a great game. <a href="https://shmuplations.com/radiatastories/">Here’s an interview</a> with its development team, including its director, Naoki Akiyama, who, as far as I can tell, hasn’t worked on a new game since. It’s one of the only JRPGs that’s ever been brave enough to <a href="https://kotaku.com/revisiting-radiata-stories-my-favorite-video-game-as-a-1819006170">let you kick kids</a>. “Radiata Stories is supposed to feel like these characters are really living this world, and for that, kicking seemed like the perfect interaction,” he said.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Resident Evil</em> game every year until 2030</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) RE"10" (though likely won't be called that) is a bit shorter than usual (presuming RE10 doesn't get delayed too, it's right now aiming for a 2029 release date, but could be delayed to 2030, 2031 at worst, up to the whims of game dev), &amp; DLC for RE9 has had time to cook.</p> <p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s what a new leak from <em>RE</em> insider AestheticGamer, formerly known as Dusk Golem, <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022244942085832763%7Ctwgr%5Ef221d152e261de65c9565b722ec4964e84884a3f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000669435action%3Dedit">is claiming</a>. They suggest the horror franchise’s upcoming roadmap is as follows:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></strong> – February 27</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem DLC</em></strong> – TBA 2026</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil – Code: Veronica Remake</em></strong> – 2027</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil Zero Remake</strong></em> – 2028</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil 10</strong></em> – 2029</li> </ul> <p>That is a relentless amount of zombie knifing action. Some fans might think this unverified pipeline rumor sounds too good to be true. I think it sounds like way too much. Hype levels for Resident Evil Requiem are currently off the charts and it’s not just because Leon is back and the previews have all been very solid. It’s also because it’s been five years since the last mainline game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, and three years since the last remake, <em>Resident Evil 4</em>.</p>

 <p>In an era of way too many games, four remakes and sequels in four years might look great on an investor sheet but it feels like overkill for a franchise that’s currently at the top of its game. And we all know what happened the last time<em> Resident Evil</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-6-the-kotaku-review-5948171">got overexposed</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Apex Legends</em> has a new roadmap and it doesn’t include Cardi B skins</h2> <p>After a rough couple of years, Respawn Entertainment’s battle royale is <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/2026-roadmap">promising to double-down on rapid improvements</a> and new content, including two new characters joining in 2026. What this roadmap doesn’t include is a bunch of wild crossover skins.</p> <p>“When we’re designing skins, we try to keep in mind the personality of the Legend,” lead Legend designer Brett Marting <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/apex-legends/titanfall-legacy-change">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “We haven’t always hit it perfectly, but most of the time we do try to keep that in mind when we’re picking a skin for a character, or a visual to match with them. We like to hit their personality, otherwise it’s going to feel off for the entire immersion of everybody playing the game.”</p>

 <h2>Who needs a <em>Dragon Ball</em> racing game when you’ve got Goku in <em>Sonic CrossWorlds</em>?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn">https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn</a></p> <p>— Boost ☆ 🇵🇷🐵 (@Boos2fer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Boos2fer/status/2022173524384002530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Sega go-kart game continues giving <em>Smash Bros.</em> a run for its money with all of the crossover characters getting added, but where licensing deals fail, modders will prevail. Someone recently replaced the Monkey Ball character in the game with Kid Goku riding on his Nimbus cloud and it looks really awesome (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-goku-fan-creation/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). I hope Bandai Namco is paying attention.</p> <h2>No <em>Spider-Man</em> on Xbox, probably</h2> <p>Fans have been told over and over again that the game will never be ported to Xbox. Insomniac Games responded to the latest wave of speculation as more companies explore multiplatform releases to reiterate that its Spider-Man games coming to Xbox remains “<a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766">unlikely</a>.”</p> <h2><em>God of War</em>‘s creator loses his mind over the new pixel art prequel</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">David Jaffe absolutely  rips the new GoW game apart.

Jaffe, never one to flinch when it comes to exploring the full range of the King’s English, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liEszJCMW-k">unloaded on the game in a recent video</a>.</p>

 <p>“Every time you make a new game, you don’t have to go, ‘You know what? Let’s not go back to the great character that people love that built this franchise. Let’s see him as a little kid, some generic boring little fucking kid,'” he said. “It’s just insulting to the fans. It’s insulting to people who worked on the games that they would think this character right here is what people want. It’s crap. It’s dumb. It’s stupid. I would say avoid this fucking thing.”</p> <h2><em>Rayman 30th Anniversary</em> Edition bugs</h2> <p>In addition to being accused by some Steam reviewers of just being an overpriced collection of ROMs run in an emulator, players have also discovered that the Atari Jaguar and MS-DOS versions of the classic Ubisoft platformer <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2026/02/15/rayman-30th-anniversary-has-save-data-bug-and-ubisoft-support-says-post-launch-support-has-ended/">don’t save your progress</a>.

              <p>I know what you were thinking: You were tentatively looking forward to April 3’s <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, but you just weren’t convinced it was going to feature your all-time favorite character, R.O.B. the Robot. Well break out the ticket purchases, because as Nintendo attempts to throw every last scrap of shit at the wall, ol’ Robby’s going to be in there too. A fact that has been leaked by his teensy appearance in a forthcoming tie-in toy set.</p> <p>A whole bunch of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> merch has been announced just recently, due to go on sale in the first week of April. There’s a six-inch <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-toy-exclusive-reveal/">Yoshi egg complete with chatty Yoshi inside</a>, already <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/fashion-and-dolls/interactive-pets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-interactive-toy-egg/p/254238">up for pre-order in the UK</a> at an eye-watering £60 ($81), alongside <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/action-figures-and-playsets/mario-figures-and-playsets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-deluxe-bowser-castle-playset/p/252460">a Bowser Castle Playset</a> and <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/action-figures-and-playsets/mario-figures-and-playsets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-with-star-launcher-set/p/254896001">star-shaped launchers</a> that kwa-ping characters into your eye.</p>

  <p>But hidden among all these reveals (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-old-spice-and-pillsbury-cookie-leaks-a-deep-cut-super-mario-galaxy-movie-cameo-has-been-revealed-by-toy-packaging/"><em>Total Film</em></a>) appears one certain robot. We found an even clearer image in a YouTube review of the Super Mario Galaxy Movie Jakks Gateway Galaxy Playset:</p>  <p>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) originally appeared as a peripheral toy for the NES in 1985. The character then sporadically popped up as a deep dive in various games, first showing his metal face in&nbsp;<em>Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</em> in 1996, popping up in various&nbsp;<em>WarioWare</em> games, and most notably being a playable character in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart DS </em>and <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>titles. However, somewhat pertinently, he didn’t make an appearance in <em>Super Mario Galaxy.</em></p>

 <p>R.O.B.’s inclusion does rather lean in to the notion that this&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie is going to be less an epic tale told in the specific video games’ universe, and more another attempt to just cram in as many&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> references as possible for the nostalgic nerds and hope the bright colors keep the kiddies happy. The trailers so far have failed to suggest any form of cogent plot, but rather just bombarding us with nods to familiar aspects of the franchise, with a lot of focus on <em>Super Mario Odyssey.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Switch Emulation Dev Is Fighting Back Against Nintendo’s New Takedowns: ‘We Want To Keep Continuing The Work In The Preservation Of Video Games’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-emulator-eden-nintendo-legal-takedown-2000669430</link>
            <guid>1437331</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nintendo’s fired off a new volley of legal notices against the <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-brick-threat-homebrew-1851779895">Switch emulation scene</a>. Close to a dozen GitHub pages were hit with DMCA takedown requests over the weekend. However, while several of the Nintendo Switch GitHub pages have given in to Nintendo’s demands, the development team behind the Eden emulator has boldly refused. Instead, they proceed with publishing a new v0.2.0 build of the Eden Switch emulator on GitHub just days later.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>You may remember that, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-android-zelda-totk-piracy-1851662440"><span>back in 2024</span></a><span>, Yuzu and Ryujinx, the two most well-known Switch emulators, were subject to legal takedown notices from Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-settled-1851306441">following a massive million dollar settlement</a>. Nintendo’s crackdown on the Switch emulation scene scattered homebrew efforts to various, less easily accessed corners of the internet. But the cat and mouse game has continued over the years, and Nintendo is once again trying to prune back grassroots efforts to reverse-engineer <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326">its most popular console ever</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>You could argue that, technically, the majority of these emulators aren’t exactly new, as almost all of them are forks (an offshoot of the existing codebase) of either Yuzu or Ryujinx. In the case of Eden, this is true, as the Nintendo Switch emulator is a fork of Yuzu. In spite of this, Eden’s development team seems relatively un-phased by Nintendo’s latest wave of DMCA notices. The project’s founder isn’t being shy about the team plan to fight back against the company’s latest legal offensive.</span></p>   <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-once-again-brings-dmca-hammer-down-switch-emulators/"><i><span>Wccftech</span></i></a><span>, Eden founder Camille LaVey revealed that they believe the emulator’s GitHub page isn’t breaking any of the website’s hosting policies: “Effectively, as founder of Eden, I can say that we want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware. Since this is a community-driven project, we always look to provide the best result possible for all; yet, we’re never sure of what the future can bring, so we’re always trying to ask the community to help us in any way they can, so Eden can still be alive for the years to come.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As of writing, Eden’s GitHub page is still up, even though GitHub clearly states that pages issued with DMCA notices have roughly “1 business day to make requested changes” before being removed. Tied with LaVey’s statement to </span><i><span>Wccftech</span></i><span>, this likely means that the Eden team has issued a counter notice against Nintendo.</span></p>

 <p>Even if Eden’s stand is short-lived, emulation enthusiasts are adamant that Nintendo’s crusade will never be able to completely eradicate Switch emulation from the internet. “If they kill one, 10 more will pop up,” wrote one commenter on the Android emulation subreddit. “Kill 10, 100 more will pop up. They can never kill emulation.”</p>

              <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is one of the premier PC gaming handhelds currently on the market. Despite some half-baked UI tweaks and finnicky Windows holdovers, it’s an <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">excellent way to play PC games on the go</a>, for existing Xbox and Game Pass users. The only problem when it launched last fall was the $1,000 price tag. And in Japan at least, that’s just gone up even higher.</p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/rog-xbox-ally-x-20260216-421609/"><em>Automaton</em> reports</a> that Asus has raised the price of the ROG Xbox Ally X in Japan from 139,800 yen tax included ($911)&nbsp; to 169,800 yen tax included ($1,107). That’s a jump of 30,000 yen or almost $200 at the current exchange rate. Notably, the price hasn’t been chanced on Microsoft’s website in Japan, though its listing for the ROG Xbox Ally X then sends users to the Asus page with the new price.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, the base ROG Xbox Ally price has remained the same. That price is still listed at 89,800 yen, or roughly $585. One obvious reason for the discrepancy is that the regular Xbox Ally has 16GB of LPDDR5-6400 memory compared to 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 in the Xbox Ally X. As RAM prices spike amid the ongoing shortage, the Ally X is going to be much more susceptible to the pricing volatility.</p> <p>Asus <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">was one of the first PC gaming manufacturers</a> to tell its partners at the start of 2026 that some prices would be going up as AI “hyperscaler” companies race to acquire available memory supply to build out data centers. At the time, nothing was mentioned specifically about the Xbox Ally X handhelds. While it’s unclear just how many Asus has sold, it promised consumers late last year that it <a href="https://www.asus.com/event/Investor/Content/attachment_en/2025Q3%20IR.pdf">was ramping up production</a> to meet higher demand than originally expected.</p>

 <p>A similar issue is facing every other hardware manufacturer in the gaming space. Valve already delayed announcing the price of the Steam Machine as it evaluates the rapidly changing economic conditions, and its existing Steam Deck, a much cheaper competitor to the Xbox Ally X, has quickly become impossible to buy. Sony is reportedly considering delaying the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410">launch of the PS6</a>, Nintendo is looking at having to hike the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">price of the Switch 2</a>, and god help you if your PC is at the end of its life and you need to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gamers-are-dumpster-diving-for-ram-because-prices-keep-skyrocketing-2000667727">buy or build a new one</a>.</p>
