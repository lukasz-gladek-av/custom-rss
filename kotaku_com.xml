              <p><span>The Nintendo Switch ports of </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed</span></i><span> and <em>LeafGreen</em></span><span> have officially been out for just a few hours, which may as well be a few months as far as dataminers are concerned. In the past two hours alone, the internet has been doing its best to speedrun all of the secrets hidden within the ROMs for </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>That includes t<span>he saddening news that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-nickname-rival-censorship-2000674512"><span>profanity is now banned</span></a><span> when naming your in-game character/rival and, according </span><a href="https://x.com/_Gon_z/status/2027423326285750594"><span>to one player</span></a><span> who has somehow already made it to the end of the game, the inclusion of the Aurora Ticket and Mystic Ticket limited-time distribution items. You can shiny-hunt Deoxys, but you can no longer call your arch-nemesis ASSCLOWN. Nintendo giveth, and Nintendo taketh away.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the most interesting revelation, according to a dataminer by the name of <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027442636810838416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2027442636810838416%7Ctwgr%5Ee6838a986b66fc7a54c129f59ae6b3f7529b29fd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000674544action%3Dedit">Yakumono/LuigiBlood</a>, is that the emulator used to boot </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed</span></i><span> and <em>LeafGreen</em></span><span> reportedly </span><span>supports ROMs</span><span> for </span><i><span>Pokémon Sapphire</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Ruby</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Emerald </span></i><span>as well</span><span>. That would hint at possible plans for Nintendo to bring more classic Pokémon games from the series’ GBA days to the Switch and Switch 2 libraries.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to a dataminer, the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen releases from today internally also have compatibility for Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, meaning those could be coming in the future. <a href="https://t.co/MvdB0sJS7N">pic.twitter.com/MvdB0sJS7N</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027442636810838416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/luigiblood.bsky.social/post/3mfu5wabxac2t">In a post on Bluesky</a>, LuigiBlood stated that they’d uncovered a few interesting tidbits about the new GBA Switch ports, including that the emulator in question is Sloop, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-emulator-leak-p-1848809116">the same emulator Nintendo uses for the Game Boy Advance games</a> featured in the Nintendo Classics library, and that the ROMs have been “heavily modified and rebuilt.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, that’s small potatoes compared to their biggest reported discovery. “The only other information I will put out is that the emulator explicitly recognizes ROMs of<em> Ruby</em>,<em> Sapphire</em> and <em>Emerald</em> alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-version-exclusives-switch-2-2000674027"><em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em></a>. I found this alongside the initialization code that is related to enabling emulator hacks for specific games.”</span></p>

 <p><span>If this is indeed correct, does this mean that ports of the third-gen </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games might be coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop in the near future? In a follow-up reply, LuigiBlood was quick to state that we shouldn’t be getting ahead of ourselves on that front. “What we see is a snapshot of current code at the moment it was built. It’s not an oracle. Maybe it means RSE is next, maybe it’s never actually happening. It just means they had intentions at one point and nothing else.”</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bloodbrone-remake-bluepoint-fromsoftware-ps5-2000674548</link>
            <guid>1449076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, PlayStation fans have begged for a remake of<em> Bloodborne</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">Bluepoint Games</a>, the PlayStation studio behind the excellently received <em>Demon’s Souls</em> remake, seemed like the obvious candidate. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA">According to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the first-party team actually did pitch a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake not too long ago, but FromSoftware rejected the idea.</p> <p>In fact, many at Bluepoint had assumed for a long time <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-remake-bluepoint-demons-souls-ps5-sony-playstation-2000671988">that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake was inevitable</a>. Then in 2025, after its <em>God of War</em> multiplayer project was cancelled, Bloomberg reports that the idea of the studio fielding such a remake was formally pitched within Sony. Unfortunately, FromSoftware wasn’t onboard. While Bluepoint scrambled to come up with other ideas, including a potential <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> spin-off, Sony never greenlit any of the other pitches.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> doesn’t report exactly why FromSoftware rejected the pitch. The only real theory for why is one offered by former PlayStation Worldwide Studios executive Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356">in an interview last year</a>. “I have only my personal theory to that situation,” he said in 2025. “I left first-party Sony so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is— because I remember Miyazaki really, really loved<em>&nbsp;Bloodborne</em>, what he created—and so I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy so he cannot do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish.”</p> <p>All of this suggests that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake by FromSoftware itself could still happen at some point in the future, but that possibility is little consolation for fans who don’t want to see one of the last console generation’s best games locked away exclusively on PS4. It’s also of no use to the folks at Bluepoint who might have had their studio saved if their remake pitch had actually come together.</p>

 <p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the ultimate reason for the studio’s closure was a loss of faith among the higher-ups at Sony that Bluepoint could still deliver a high-quality original game as it has once been tasked with. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">The <em>God of War</em> live-service project</a> it had previously been working on would have reportedly featured Atreus navigating the underworld, but shift to co-op gameplay that never came together. Sony has moved forward with a remake of the original single-player trilogy, just without its best remake studio at the helm.</p>

              <p><span>Well, folks, it looks like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a> <span>may have finally broken the series’ bad graphics curse. At least, that’s what it looks like based on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-trailer-breakdown-presents-pikachu-2000674465"><span>the first trailer</span></a><span>, which appears to be a marked visual improvement over </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which have become </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><span>a poster child for the series’ poor technical performance</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, released in 2022,</span> <span>were the last Switch-exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, and were heavily derided for not only being a buggy mess, but for looking like a GameCube tech demo. They had a big map that had no real texture or life to it. When they got a Switch 2 update, they ran at a buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second, but they still looked really rough and old. </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>, meanwhile, have a notable technical and graphical leap, with much more dynamic lighting, shading, and water physics. The Pokémon themselves have a bit of texture to them similar to </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s models, but beyond that, any direct comparisons we might make work in </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’</span> <span>favor. I’d still argue that it doesn’t look incredible by any stretch, but it definitely is the most dynamic-looking </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game we’ve had in a while.</span></p>
