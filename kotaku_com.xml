              <p>A strange countdown clock. Missing games and weird glitches on Steam. Cryptic comments from Todd Howard. The end of <em>Fallout</em> season two fast approaching. All of this is feeding into an ongoing belief among many <em>Fallout</em> fans that long-rumored remasters of <a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346"><em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em></a> are coming soon. But how much of this is true, and how much is just out-of-control hype from fans hungry for a new entry in the series?</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/a-steam-glitch-convinced-some-fallout-fans-a-new-vegas-remaster-was-imminent-only-to-have-the-rug-yanked-out-from-under-them-slowly-turning-into-r-halflife/">As reported by <em>PC Gamer</em> on January 14,</a> <em>Fallout</em> fans on Reddit noticed something odd with <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and <em>Fallout 3.</em> When trying to leave a review, Steam would block it and say the games weren’t out yet. Considering the games have been out on PC for closer to 20 years than I want to admit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1qcc9xg/both_fallout_new_vegas_and_3_are_experiencing/">this confused people</a>. It also fueled the ongoing belief that a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster, as well as a possible <em>New Vegas</em> remaster, are launching in the near future. People theorized that this was some backend snafu related to Bethesda getting ready to shadow-drop both remasters soon.</p>

 <p>And then someone noticed that if you search for <em>Fallout</em>, Steam lists 12 games, but there are actually only 10 games currently available. Curious! This further convinced a lot of people who frankly didn’t need much convincing to begin with that<em> Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vega</em>s remasters were coming in hot.</p>

 <h2>Debunking the<em> Fallout</em> remaster theories</h2> <p>But let’s slow down and throw some cold water on all of this.&nbsp; First, the issue with being unable to review games on Steam despite them already being released, while strange, isn’t related to any upcoming remaster. Instead, it was an issue that has affected various Steam games over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1qcb7ak/this_is_a_first_for_me/">past 72 hours or so, including <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>.</a> It also seems like it has been fixed. I was able to leave a review for<em> Fallout: New Vegas,</em> no problem.</p>

 <p>As for the 12 <em>Fallout</em> games listed but only 10 being actually available on Steam, this is a common quirk on Valve’s storefront and often happens as a result of various editions and versions of games being available or not available depending on your region. For example, looking up <em>Call of Duty,</em> Steam lists 25, but there are only 24 on the franchise page. So I wouldn’t read too much into this piece of evidence either.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660210">©Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, before Steam glitches and oddities got <em>Fallout</em> fans freaking out, there was all the hubbub about Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> countdown clock. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-new-vegas-remaster-3-amazon-s2-show-bethesda-announcement/">As explained by <em>Polygon</em></a>, Amazon recently activated <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">a website that features a <em>Fallout</em>-like map</a> with different locations. Clicking on them lets you explore these places via 3D and 2D tours. It’s neat, but what caught people’s attention is that one location is locked and won’t open until the season two finale of <em>Fallout</em> airs on February 4. It didn’t take long for people to connect the dots between this date and some past comments from Todd Howard explaining that Bethesda is working <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">on more <em>Fallout</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">that he thinks the shadow drop of <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>was a successful test.</a></p>

 <p>But once again, I’ve got some cold water to pour on all this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1q7ru1e/fallout_s2_interactive_website_final_location_and/">as according to one Redditor</a> who dug into the data of the Amazon site, the locked location is just the Lucky 38 Casino, and when the clock runs out, players will be able to explore it like the other spots on the map. That’s not to say that nothing else will be announced or revealed after the finale, but don’t expect that locked spot on the site to turn into a portal leading to <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em>.</p>

 <h2>All the evidence that <em>Fallout 3 </em>R<em>emastered</em> is happening</h2> <p>Okay, so is there any actual evidence of a <em>Fallout 3</em> or <em>New Vegas</em> remaster? Or is it all just fan hype and rumors? Well, there is some hard proof that at least a <em>Fallout 3 </em>remaster is in the works.</p> <p>First up, in 2023, a remastered version of Bethesda’s popular wasteland RPG was listed in a leaked court doc that got out during the <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">FTC vs Activision/Xbox hearing.</a> That doc listed other unannounced games, including <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> and a <em>Doom</em> prequel, both of which did launch, though later than planned. So it seems very likely that, yes, <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> is a thing, and it is being worked on as we speak.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fallout 3 Remaster, Ghostwire Tokyo Sequel, Dishonored 3, Oblivion Remaster, Doom Year Zero appear on a release schedule list<a href="https://t.co/xttFBM30wp">https://t.co/xttFBM30wp</a> <a href="https://t.co/A1sv7TAuL7">pic.twitter.com/A1sv7TAuL7</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1703996755560546707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette">In November 2025, <em>VGC</em> further corroborated</a> the leaked doc and confirmed it had heard that, yes, <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> was real and is currently being developed. The site didn’t share any other details, but did suggest this remastered version of the RPG will be similar to last year’s <em>Oblivion Remastered.</em> So I expect the original engine will still be running under some fancy new Unreal-powered visuals.</p>

 <p>As for a <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> remaster? Well, there’s not really much evidence for that beyond <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/fallout-3-is-getting-a-remaster-after-all-and-new-vegas-is-too-but-thats-not-what-the-tv-shows-countdown-timer-is-for">pure speculation and some supposed leakers and insiders teasing it.</a> And while I know a lot of people would love both <em>FNV</em> and <em>Fallout 3</em> to be remastered, I can’t imagine both happening at the same time and both launching on the same day. That just seems too outlandish and would have likely leaked by now, especially if it is happening sooner rather than later.</p> <p>So, that’s where we are at. <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> is basically a confirmed real game that is happening, but we don’t know when it will launch, though it could be this year. Meanwhile,<em> Fallout</em>: <em>New Vegas Remastered</em> is more of an internet-created rumor that could happen one day; in fact, it probably will happen, but for now, it remains a pipe dream. So in short, everybody calm down, stop checking Steam for weird bugs, and enjoy the last few episodes of <em>Fallout</em> season two.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Even before its release in 2025,</span><i><span> Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</span></i><span> has faced controversy. The revival of the long-dormant </span><i><span>Fatal Fury</span></i><span> series came after publisher SNK was purchased by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, and it’s suffered from accusations of sportswashing ever since. Now, SNK and </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> are getting called out for releasing a trailer full of alleged AI slop.</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, SNK released a trailer for </span><i><span>Fatal Fury: CotW</span></i><span>’s upcoming second season, which launches on January 22. The trailer promises a pretty robust release schedule for the game’s anniversary with monthly character drops over a six-month period. Returning characters Kim Jae Hoon, Nightmare Geese, Blue Mary, and Wolfgang Krauser are slated to join the game’s roster, too. However, the excitement of fan-favorites returning has been almost entirely overshadowed by the game’s latest trailer incorporating apparent AI-generated clips.</span></p>

  <p><span>“I’m stepping down after this trailer, I’m thankful for what you guys did for us and all but this is too much for me to deal with, this is against what I stand for,” a moderator </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spicysauce.bsky.social/post/3mchxy2n7uc2d"><span>wrote in their parting message to the official Discord server</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s easy to see why. The AI stuff is just really, really ugly. The shots of cities feature skyscrapers with the most inconsistent windows I’ve ever seen, and something about the character introduction clips just looks…very off. (It’s almost like SNK knew the clips looked bad because half of them are overlaid with big walls of text and graffiti-like flourishes.)</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz/app.bsky.feed.post/3mchxy2n7uc2d" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiamudluymmnrigb3heteb3bgpjx2ajjvyjb5abgxtw34tfzpgipwa"> <p lang="en">i was a SNK moderator for 6 years and official Cotw Discord for a year, this trailer made me step down after all those years, i don't / i can't promote a product that i don't support,thanks for all of those years friends, it was fun 🫡 bsky.app/profile/wari…</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz?ref_src=embed">Spicy Sauce (@spicysauce.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz/post/3mchxy2n7uc2d?ref_src=embed">2026-01-15T16:11:59.809Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>It also just seems wildly inconsistent with the game itself. </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> has a pretty vibrant cel-shaded art style, and the trailer’s AI shots ignore that entirely for a false sense of edginess that looks pretty corny when juxtaposed with clips of colorful, cartoonish gameplay. The studio didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>SNK was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/snk-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman-mbs-king-of-fighte-1848754233"><span>purchased by the Saudi Public Investment Fund in 2022</span></a><span>. Despite promises that the ownership change </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snk-saudi-arabias-96-ownership-doesnt-affect-us-in-any-way"><span>would have no impact</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> doesn’t seem to have been exempt from the effects of this. The country’s sovereign wealth fund also owns Al-Nassr FC, and its soccer star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cristiano-ronaldo-fatal-fury-city-wolves-saudi-arabia-1851772758"><span>Cristiano Ronaldo</span></a><span> was later added to <em>CotW</em> as a playable character. It’s a shame because the game itself is decent.&nbsp; It even took home the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>Best Fighting Game award</span></a><span> at this year’s Game Awards.</span></p>

 <p><span>SNK’s problematic ties to Saudi Arabia aren’t going anywhere in the future, but it could avoid making things worse by not piling gen AI junk on top of them. This also doesn’t bode well for Saudi Arabia’s other massive game purchase. It’s currently on track to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726"><span>own Electronic Arts by the end of the summer</span></a><span>. </span></p>

              <p><span>The </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> love hotel has shut down. Japanese </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> creator churip_ccc announced on X that their adults-only </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> island had been shut down by Nintendo, </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/"><span>according to a translation of the post on </span><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Actually, just a day before the update, the Dream Address for the Adult Island was deleted by Nintendo,” chrip_ccc wrote. “To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years. To everyone who visited the island, and to all the streamers who showcased it in their videos, thank you so much.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660193">© Nintendo via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX2_XeIBrEM">コアラ’s GAME SHOW on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Automaton</span></i><span> reported that the island was created just a few months after </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> was released in 2020. It was pretty popular with Japanese YouTubers and livestreamers, the publication said. It’s a high quality island; there’s a love hotel flanked by several of </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ Gallant statues—inspired by Michelangelo’s David—using neon palm trees for clever censorship. There’s a pachinko parlor and a luxury, uh, love suite with a rose-shaped bed, in-house jacuzzi, and dim lighting.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> players were able to visit the island using the Dream Island feature, which essentially made a public copy of an island. You could visit a player’s island without them being there. Alas, now it’s gone, and the adults only </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> island will live only in infamy, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX2_XeIBrEM"><span>on YouTube</span></a><span>.</span></p>
