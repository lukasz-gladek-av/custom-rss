Millions of dollars have been raised for various vital causes through the generosity of developers throwing in games by their hundreds, in deals that have done incredible work to not only make money, but also noise about these issues. The latest, already at $40,000 after a day, is No ICE in California, where $10 will get you an astonishing 560 games, 427 of which are table-top RPGs.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,197586,196599" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Other recent Itch fundraisers have included 2020's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/itch-io-is-selling-a-bundle-of-over-700-games-for-5-t-1843936605&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-is-selling-a-bundle-of-over-700-games-for-5-t-1843936605">Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a></span> which raised an extraordinary $8.1 million for Black Lives Matters-related charities, and 2022's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bundle for Ukraine</a></span>, that brought in over $6.3 million.

Its modest goal is set at $50,000, which it’s already very close to reaching. Hopefully, as more attention is gained, and more developers throw in, that target can be absolutely smashed, not least because of the urgent need for help for LA immigrants facing ICE invasions.</p><h2 id="h60996"><a id=""></a>What should I play in this bundle?</h2><p>But what are you getting for ten bucks? Isn’t everything on Itch a scratchy PS1-style horror game set in the cells of an invasive bacteria, played using cutlery-based inputs? Pshah—get away with your needlessly cruel yet accurate parodying. Instead, here you have things like <em>Periphery Synthetic</em>, an “interactive musical experience” played in a procedurally generated planetary system. I set this up to be a joke, because yeah, the bundle is packed with bonkers esoteric gaming, but dammit this game looks amazing. You synthesize new abilities through exploration in this super-lo-fi which will eventually let you “command these worlds in every dimension.”</p><p>...</p><p>Er, sorry, you lost me there for a bit. I’ve been playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep/download/ukOfyoBFkGtJS_9O36KNdp5c6KvTsR0ZQJqvPq_I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep/download/ukOfyoBFkGtJS_9O36KNdp5c6KvTsR0ZQJqvPq_I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Periphery Synthetic</strong></em></a></span>, and I absolutely love it. I got wheels! And I just improved my climbing ability. And I’m obsessed with how you can have an open-world game with the fidelity of a <em>Ghosts of Yotei</em>, and yet here just a pattern of squares still manages to evoke an incredible sense of place.</p><p>There’s also Necrosoft’s delightfully bonkers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://necrosoftgames.itch.io/gunhouse/download/O2OMAIhfQE_QqUid7KuF5Oclvh_UEOepKcxVDcad&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://necrosoftgames.itch.io/gunhouse/download/O2OMAIhfQE_QqUid7KuF5Oclvh_UEOepKcxVDcad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Gunhouse</strong></em></a></span>, a weird take on a tile matching game, where your dragging rows to create blocks of four tiles, which turn into weapons and ammo used to survive attacks from encroaching enemies. It’s instantly hooky, with a very peculiar aesthetic.</p><figure id="" data-id="e4a14bf47ead16d331a8108ef6c2c74b" data-recommend-id="image://e4a14bf47ead16d331a8108ef6c2c74b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1738" data-height="978" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young person talks to a raptor in a baseball cap, pushing a bike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A young person talks to a raptor in a baseball cap, pushing a bike." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rocket Adrift Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4a14bf47ead16d331a8108ef6c2c74b" data-recommend-id="image://e4a14bf47ead16d331a8108ef6c2c74b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1738" data-height="978" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young person talks to a raptor in a baseball cap, pushing a bike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But perhaps today is a day for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rocketadrift.itch.io/raptor-boyfriend-a-high-school-romance&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rocketadrift.itch.io/raptor-boyfriend-a-high-school-romance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Raptor Boyfriend: A High School Romance</strong></em></a></span>, Rocket Adrift’s dating sim about—no, actually, you’re wrong! It’s not about dating dinosaurs. It’s that, but also dating a fairy and a sasquatch. Also, there is a vengeful ghost. And that dino? That’s Robert, a velociraptor, and he wears his baseball cap <em>backward</em>. Yup, it’s the ‘90s, and you’re at a high school for cryptids, so get sharing mix tapes, staring at stars, and smooching the beasts.</p><p>There’s also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://square2mom.itch.io/valiant&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://square2mom.itch.io/valiant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>(Val)iant</strong></em></a></span>, a game about being an 18-year-old non-binary teen with “a broken vag.” It’s a superb piece of fiction, that immediately puts you in the position of being someone “struggling with their relationship to their body,” beginning in a doctor’s office as you try to explain your physical pain during sex, but are faced with a bombardment of assumptions about your gender, your self-perception, and your goals. It’s incredibly open and honest, straightforward about straightforward topics, and explores subjects that I’d never otherwise have to consider in my straight, male life. Just an incredible tool for empathy, as well as a fantastically written game.</p><h2 id="h60997"><a id=""></a>Fill my table tops</h2><p>However, the real focus of this particular bundle is table-top gaming. There are a whopping 96 games in there for your ten dollars, so no worries if that’s not your sort of thing, but the 427 TTRPGs should at least give you cause to investigate.</p><p>This isn’t my area of expertise either, but I can tell you what’s intriguing me.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://titanomachyrpg.itch.io/nighthawks&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://titanomachyrpg.itch.io/nighthawks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Nighthawks</strong></em></a></span> is a 3-6 player game based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks_(Hopper)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks_(Hopper)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the painting by Edward Hopper</a></span>. I mean, that’s interesting enough right there. What makes it even more fascinating is that this game that requires a group of people to be together is exploring loneliness. Each person takes on a person who might appear in the painting, deciding among yourselves what kind of place this diner is, what sorts of relationships you might have between you. The GM-free game leaves players exploring the topic of loneliness together, choosing whether they might succumb or battle against it. It sounds incredible.</p><figure id="" data-id="868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-recommend-id="image://868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1070" data-height="279" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pinayu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-recommend-id="image://868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1070" data-height="279" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Solo TTPRGs are an aspect of the genre that I constantly forget can be a thing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pinayu.itch.io/helan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pinayu.itch.io/helan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Helan</strong></em></a></span> is one such example, where you play as a person who spends their life accompanying those who visit the white sands of Helan in order to help them reach their destinations. It’s a road trip, one about relationships with strangers, and a world-building game where the conversations you choose define the world around you. Oh, and you have a hoverbike. The game comes with print-outs of a 16-page booklet that tells you how to play, and all the information you need, along with a two-page guide filled with 108 travelers you can accompany as you play.</p><p>God there are so many games about being a dad. But there are so damn few about being a mom. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://floaker.itch.io/mum-chums&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://floaker.itch.io/mum-chums" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Mum Chums</em></strong></a></span>, however, is “a slice of life RPG about people who care for kids.” You don’t have to be a mom—any adult carer can be portrayed—but the game states it’s specifically written from a “white Scottish perspective.” The game begins when your kids are about to start school, with no winning or losing, but rather roleplaying a specific part of life. The game is still in development, but fully playable.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://floaker.itch.io/be-seeing-you&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://floaker.itch.io/be-seeing-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Be Seeing You</strong></em></a></span> is a 3-5 player (or “prisoners”) about our dystopian surveillance culture. There’s no GM, and no dice, but rather a <em>Prisoner</em>-inspired exploration of the infiltrating nature of capitalism. Outside of this bundle, you can buy the game for $13, or just download it for free because “Digital media should be freely available.” Developer Tanya Floaker then encourages people to upload and share the files with others as much as they wish.</p><h2 id="h60998"><a id=""></a>Where is the money going?</h2><p>The money raised is being split between two charities working with U.S. immigrants affected by the brutal and despicable actions of ICE. The first is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.immdef.org/support&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.immdef.org/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Immigrant Defenders Law Center</strong></a></span>, a law firm created in 2015 by immigration lawyers, looking to defend people faced with deportation, but also to bring about systemic change to the grim system. Of course, the people ImmDef works with are rarely in a position to be able to pay for legal representation, so this non-profit provides always free services, and is sustained by donations. They also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.immdef.org/shop&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.immdef.org/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have merch</a></span>!</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://raicestexas.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://raicestexas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>RAICES</strong></a></span> also offers legal services for families looking to make the U.S. their home. It provides a broad range of services, either free or low-cost, in many parts of Texas, and again is reliant on donations to continue its work. And why a Texan organization given the Californian nature of this bundle? That’s because a lot of the people ICE targets in LA are then forcibly taken to Texas.</p><p>So, you know, even if you pay the $10 (or as much as you want to give) and then forget you ever did, you’ve made an important difference. But you’ve also got an enormous trove of games and table-top RPGs to explore for months to come.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085]]></content:encoded>

The PlayStation exclusive sold a whopping 2.4 million copies in its first three days on sale, with the most recent figures claiming lifetime sales of 13 million. Both a critical and financial success, obviously developers Sucker Punch immediately began work on a sequel, and some five years later we’re finally getting a good, long, detailed look at what the stealthy action-adventure follow-up has to offer.</p><figure id="" data-id="a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-recommend-id="image://a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1236" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-recommend-id="image://a6a06debe81ad12663a52f50d9bf70f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1236" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atsu walks through blue flowers, as many birds take flight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, this isn’t picking up where <em>Tsushima</em> left off. <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is a standalone sequel, set 329 years later, in 1603. This is an entirely new story, in a game all about revenge, main character Atsu returning 16 years after her whole family was murdered to kill the so-called Yōtei Six. And to really drive this home, the game will let you switch the world around you to Atsu’s childhood to contrast her before and after realities.</p><p>Once again, combat can be approached as you prefer, whether that’s melee sword battles, or ninja-like stealthy assassinations, or of course any mix of the two. And that sense of choice is, they claim, endemic throughout the game. As an open-world, the new footage explains you can mainline the central story, let yourself disappear off on extensive side-quests, or just explore the ridiculously pretty realm. However, the emphasis presented here is to take it slowly, no rush, “enjoy the ride.” And with those scenes of Atsu charging on horseback through the grasslands, seeds flying up around her, that does look like a rather lovely idea.</p><p>I really liked the extended trailer’s stressing that this isn’t a game about “honor,” about respecting the ancient traditions of this or that, but about a furious mercenary, willing to use dirty tricks and a shitty attitude to reach her goals. </p><p>Atsu will have access to a huge arsenal of slicey-choppy weapons, including a katana, spear, ōdachi (very long samurai sword), kusarigama (a brutal “chain-sickle”), and dual swords. And you can use these for broad third-person combat against crowds of foes, or sneaking up and silently taking people out. (If you’re playing this sort of game properly, that invariably means starting with the latter, then switching to the former when it all goes wrong.) And then there are bows and guns too, for ranged onslaughts. There’s also a bunch of rock, paper, scissors to it, as enemies switch weapons meaning you need to change up your response too.</p><figure id="" data-id="5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-recommend-id="image://5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="695" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-recommend-id="image://5c8317e74ad74c8550156484012aa636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="695" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Yotei special edition PS5." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a whole bunch of bounties you take on, both plot-critical and side-quests, for which you’ll discover clues to track people down.

They’ve also once more licensed the right to call a grainy black-and-white filter on the game “Kurosawa Mode,” which is, um, sure. Go for it. This is extended in <em>Yōtei </em>with the claimed “Miike Mode” to mean the camera is closer up in combat, with more mud and blood, and “Watanabe Mode” which will replace the game’s music with “lo-fi beats.” I mean, pretending that this is “partnering” with famous directors seems very silly to me, but I’m down for an ambient chill mode, as hilariously incongruous as it looked in the footage.</p><p>The game releases October 2, and damn, yeah, after this I’m very in. It looks fabulous, potentially out-Ubisofting Ubisoft in the open-world world. Let’s hope it meets these promises.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081]]></content:encoded>
