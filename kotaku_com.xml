              <p>Legendary survival horror series <i>Silent Hill</i> has entered a new era this week with the arrival of <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">the highly anticipated <i>Silent Hill f</i></a>. <i>f</i> aims to deliver <i>Silent Hill</i>’s themes of dreadful, psychological horror in a brand new setting, featuring new characters and a new combat system.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent Hill f</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>The combat here is a little more action-focused than in previous entries in the series, though the game still manages to feel dangerous at every turn. And while I had a delightfully macabre time with this elegant survival horror game, there were a few things I wish I’d known before jumping in. So, after spending tens of hours on this game in both Story and Hard mode, allow me to share with you what I learned while surviving the fog.</p> <hr> <h2>1. Don’t sleep on omamori</h2> <p><i>f</i> may be a survival horror game, but it’s got a touch more build-crafting than you might expect. Not only can you improve Hinako’s max health, stamina, and sanity, you can also equip omamori to augment her abilities. You can increase the maximum amount of omamori slots by spending enough faith at shrines.</p>

 <p>While you might be better off investing faith in improving your stamina first, you should still be regularly checking which omamori you’ve collected thus far to see where you can gently improve your combat skills. Plus, unlocking an extra omamori slot can be really advantageous.</p>

 <hr> <h2>2. Stop hanging onto those offerings</h2> <p>As you traverse the weird and terrifying world of <i>Silent Hill f</i>, you’ll find various offerings like antique combs and dried carcasses. These items have no utility beyond earning faith by offering them up at a shrine. But they do take up inventory space. On more than a few occasions, I found my inventory full only to see that there was some random offering I picked up a while back still taking up space, doing nothing but inconvenience me.</p>

 <p>Check your inventory for offerings every time you’re at a shrine and you’ll have a lot more room to spare.</p> <hr> <h2>3. Invest in Stamina first, Sanity second</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000629310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629310"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629310">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Stamina is Hinako’s super power. No, really! While our girl is plenty capable of bashing in a monster with a steel pipe, weapons break pretty quickly and there are more than a few occasions when you can easily be overwhelmed by enemies. You’ll need to be able to deftly get in and out of skirmishes with the creatures of the fog. For this reason, I recommend investing in improving your stamina first, followed by sanity second.</p>

 <p>Sanity is what will allow you to pull off a pretty powerful counter attack, as well as Hinako’s charged light melee strike (this ability isn’t available at first).</p> <p>Having a generous amount of stamina to maneuver out of the way of enemies, and enough sanity to deliver more powerful strikes, will help you get hit less and ensure enemies go down faster.</p>

 <hr> <h2>4. Don’t get into useless fights</h2> <p>The creatures of the fog might be creepy, but you’ll quickly realize that many of them are pretty easy to take out–especially if you’re used to combat-focused games like <i>Dark Souls</i>. That said, resist the urge to go wild and clear the town of monsters. While your weapons in the Dark Shrine segments of the game won’t break, the random pipes, crowbars, and kitchen knives you’ll pick up in Ebisugaoka are fragile little things and you can easily find yourself without a weapon all too easily.</p> <p>Hinako can’t punch or kick, so if you’re without a weapon, you will have no offensive options against monsters. No bueno. Pick your battles strategically.</p> <hr> <h2>5. Higashi is kinda broken</h2> <p>Early on, I neglected eating any Higashi, which restores your stamina, because managing stamina seemed like a me-problem more than anything else. That was until I got to hard mode and had to take on one of the game’s early bosses and, well, I learned that this item is kinda broken.</p>

 <p>Not only will eating it replenish your stamina, but you’ll have unlimited stamina after eating for a rather generous amount of time. This provides a perfect opportunity to spam your dodge while also getting in close to deliver a ton of hits without worrying about your stamina.</p> <hr> <h2>6. Keep your distance and use the camera to peer around corners before exposing yourself</h2> <p><i>Silent Hill f</i> is pretty low on jump scares. But there are more than a few occasions in which monsters are eager to hop out from a hiding spot and attack you. When this happens, it’s more than likely that you’ll get pulled into a grab animation where the camera will zoom up to show the monster brutally attacking Hinako.</p>

 <p>There’s no way out of this animation once it starts. Mash all the buttons you want, you’re not getting out of it without losing a chunk of your health. So in general, it’s best to try and leave some distance between you and any monster you happen to be fighting.</p> <p>One way to do that is to use the third-person camera to peer around a corner where you suspect a monster may be hiding. The game will play some gentle static (though it sounds a little more like a record player looping on silence in this game) when a monster is nearby, so trust your eyes and ears to avoid unnecessary damage.</p> <hr> <h2>7. Counter attacks get easier once you unlock Hinako’s charged-up attack</h2> <p><i>Silent Hill</i> <i>f</i>’s counter-attack can be a little challenging to pull off at first. You have to wait for the monster to flash in color, then hold down focus, then execute a heavy attack. Given that focusing drains your sanity meter pretty quickly, countering an enemy can be a weird, time-sensitive juggling act.</p>

 <p>That said, once you unlock Hinako’s charged-up light attack, things get a little easier.</p> <p>Since you have to hold down your focus button anyway to charge up your light attack, it has the added benefit of putting you in a good place to successfully pull off a counter-attack. While you’re waiting for Hinako’s attack to charge up, keep your eyes on the enemy. If they flash in color, forget the light attack and immediately hit your heavy attack button. Since you’re holding down your focus button, you’ll trigger the counter attack.</p> <hr> <h2>8. Nail that perfect dodge</h2> <p>Dodge just before an enemy strikes you, and Hinako will hack the foggy Matrix to slow down time and recharge her stamina instantly. It’s a pretty small window, but nailing this move is pretty essential for surviving the game’s tougher enemies. Hinako runs out of stamina pretty fast, so do everything you can to preserve and restore it.</p> <hr> <h2>9. Look out for helpful items during boss fights</h2> <p>Fragile weapons and sparse items can make you feel pretty on edge at times in <i>Silent Hill f</i>, especially during boss encounters. Fortunately, the game wants you to succeed more than you might think. While my first run through “Story” difficulty didn’t have me desperate for healing items, Hard mode is a different matter.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629311">© Screenshot:: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Fortunately, I’ve noticed that it’s pretty common for the game to throw some items your way during boss fights; you just need to keep your eyes peeled in corners and other non-obvious places.</p> <hr> <h2>10. Collect everything; read everything</h2> <p>Us masochists sure do love a game that kicks you when you’re down. But there’s so much more to <i>Silent Hill f</i> than the struggle against the fog’s shambling, knife-wielding monstrosities. Hinako is quite the diligent note-taker and artist, and you are missing out on so, <i>so </i>much if you don’t take the time to read the various character entries and in-game documents. Not only is the art design on-friggin’-point in <i>f</i>, but so much of the game’s wonderful use of metaphor and its dives into Japanese folklore are found in the journal.</p>

 <hr> <h2>11. Resist brute-forcing your way through puzzles</h2> <p>Trying to brute-force your way through most puzzles in <i>SHf</i> is a quick way to sink into some serious ennui. Puzzles in this game often have too many variables for this approach to succeed in a reasonable amount of time, and trying to do so is way more frustrating than just figuring them out as intended.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629312"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629312">© Screenshot:: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While the clues in it aren’t always the most obvious, spend some time studying Hinako’s notebook. You can always jump to it while looking at a puzzle via the on-screen prompt in the lower left-hand corner.</p> <hr> <p><i>Silent Hill f</i> won me over with its brutally dark tale first and foremost, but its combat has a satisfying rhythm that settles into place over the course of the game. Hopefully with these tips, you’ll end up with a few less broken weapons and even fewer scars from those mannequin psychopaths.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a><span> is out next week. It’s the latest in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093"><span>turn-based RPG series</span></a><span>, but these digital monsters have shown up in a lot more games than just RPGs. Across its nearly 30 years, </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>has been pretty experimental in the video game space. Not every swing has landed, but it has kept things interesting. A few of these games never made their way out of Japan, but the best ones came stateside, though they’re harder to come by because companies do not care about preservation. If you’ve never played a </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>game before, here are some of the best ones to go back to.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon World </i></b><b>/ </b><b><i>Digimon World: Next Order</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Despite my dislike of the virtual pet mechanics of </span><i><span>Digimon World</span></i><span>, I know if I don’t include the original PlayStation game on this list, someone will get mad at me. As frustrating as it can be, </span><i><span>Digimon World</span></i><span>’s vibes are still unmatched by most of the franchise. There’s a true sense of loneliness as your character is isekai’d into the Digital World, aimlessly wandering through this unknowable realm and discovering new friends and enemies as you explore. It also still has that PS1-era grit that has kind of washed away from more modern </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games, which is especially effective when you’re young and these worlds still feel vast and scary. If you can train your Digimon into something powerful enough to fight through its various challenges, </span><i><span>Digimon World </span></i><span>has an expansive, fascinating world to watch grow over the course of the game. It’s the training part that can become tedious. But those with the patience to fight through it found a lot to love. </span><i><span>Next Order </span></i><span>is a modern spin on this same loop, and if you can handle it with one monster, that game lets you manage two at a time. Godspeed, friend.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon Racing</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Wait, no. Come back. I swear, the Game Boy Advance kart racer rules, actually. If you ever played </span><i><span>Mario Kart </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Sonic Racing, </span></i><span>you know the gist of what </span><i><span>Digimon Racing </span></i><span>has to offer. The </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>spin is that the monster you put behind the wheel will gradually digivolve over the course of a race as you drift over a digitized track, gaining speed and power as you leave your opponents in the dust. </span><i><span>Digimon Racing </span></i><span>was also one of the only games that supported the GBA’s wireless adapter, as Nintendo was trying to cut the link cable in the lead-up to the Nintendo DS. I have some pretty fond memories of racing against my brother across our living room. It felt like magic at the time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Digimon Rumble Arena 1+2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Everyone has tried a </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. </span></i><span>knock-off at some point, right? </span><i><span>Digimon Rumble Arena </span></i><span>and its sequel may not have become competitive darlings that had people dragging CRT TVs to conventions decades later, but they’re silly, fun party games starring your favorite Digital Monsters. The first game was on the original PlayStation and only supported two players, which could make some fights a bit of a drag as they devolved into games of tag with the two fighters chasing each other around the large arenas. </span><i><span>Rumble Arena 2 </span></i><span>came out two years later and leaned harder into the </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. </span></i><span>comparison, supporting four players and making fights much more active, frantic, and fun.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Digimon World 2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Digimon World </span></i><span>game implemented the series’ digital pet mechanics in a way that some people get really into. Personally I can’t stand it, and was annoyed when it came back in </span><i><span>Digimon World: Next Order</span></i><span>. Do you know how annoying it is to try to train your partner Digimon for an hour, only for them to end up turning into one of the poop monsters? However, the </span><i><span>World </span></i><span>series has changed a fair bit over the years, too. </span><i><span>Digimon World 2 </span></i><span>left the first game’s real-time digital pet era behind, and is instead a dungeon crawler with turn-based battles. The battle system isn’t too deep, but its elaborate, experimental Digivolution mechanics set the tone for future iterations.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Digimon Survive</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Digimon Survive </span></i><span>isn’t a great tactical RPG, but it is a damn good visual novel. The combat is mind-numbingly simple and lacks the depth of much older classics like </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>. That said, its choice-driven horror story visual novel side is actually a pretty gripping tale that really brings a fresh take to the universe. </span><i><span>Survive</span></i><span>’s tedious fights are worth slogging through to get to the rich, often harrowing story it has to tell.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Digimon World 3</i></b></h2>  <p><span>If </span><i><span>Digimon World 2 </span></i><span>brought the subseries into turn-based battles, </span><i><span>World 3 </span></i><span>solidified it with a solid, more streamlined system in one of the coolest versions of the Digital World. The RPG’s roster of Digimon is much more limited, but its challenge comes from working within its set party compositions and finding a party that works for you in all its limitations. Outside of battles, its gorgeous PS1-era sprite work still holds up. Meanwhile, its dark story of a group of people trapped within a virtual reality MMO is a bit rote by today’s standards, but was pretty unnerving back in the day. Plus, it was the first time Guilmon, the best Digimon, got to have a starring role in one of the RPGs. More than most </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games, I constantly wish I could go back to </span><i><span>World 3</span></i><span>, but it’s been trapped on the original PlayStation for over 20 years.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</i></b></h2>  <p><span>I just finished a replay of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914"><i><span>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</span></i></a> <span>earlier this year, and that shit holds up. The turn-based detective RPG is one of the series’ best stories, and it perfectly marries the franchise’s mysteries, mythology, and themes of the power of friendship. It is the closest to a </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>game the series has ever gotten, and though its turn-based battles are pretty simple, the game, with its elaborate evolution mechanics that enable you, through careful planning and metagaming, to turn just about any Digimon into almost any of the other 200+ on the roster, is dripping with depth. The </span><i><span>Hacker’s Memory </span></i><span>follow-up, which you can find packaged with the original game on PC and Switch, adds another 50 hours of parallel story that’s also worth your time. If you haven’t played the game before and are curious about </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span>, you won’t find a better onboarding on modern platforms than </span><i><span>Cyber Sleuth</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-could-have-ended-up-as-a-free-to-play-game.1310064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> was, at one point, going to be a free-to-play game that would have been “completely” different than what we got in 2024. And this pivot is part of the reason why <em>Helldivers 2</em> has some nasty performance problems.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-update-terminid-2000620349"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> launched on PS5 and PC early last year, it quickly became a massive hit for PlayStation and developers Arrowhead. And since then, the sci-fi co-op shooter has remained popular as more updates have expanded the game, adding new weapons, enemies, locations, and more. But in recent months, players have complained about performance issues and technical problems.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-new-content-bug-fixes-1851419351">Arrowhead’s CEO, Shams Jorjani,</a> isn’t shying away from these criticisms and is directly addressing them in the official <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord server. And it’s here that he also revealed that at one point in time, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was a much smaller game that was planned to be free-to-play and not a paid experience.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-blames-helldivers-2-performance-issues-on-tech-debt-accumulated-thanks-to-goalposts-being-moved-a-few-times-during-development-the-foundations-of-this-big-tower-were-made-for-a-little-bungalow/">On September 25</a>, while talking to fans about <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sequel-dei-politics-woke-arrowhead-1851731175">Helldivers 2</a> a</em>nd its ongoing performance issues on console and PC on Discord, Jorjani explained that the shooter had a lot of built-up “tech debt” from various pivots that happened during development.</p> <p>“[<em>Helldivers 2</em>] started as a AA game,” <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420832196813389824">said the CEO</a>. “[It] then grew in scope, then pivoted to a launch title for PS5, then pivoted to F2P, then back to premium ( I might have the order messed up) – so the goal posts were moved a few times – so the foundations of this big tower were made for a little bungalow on the beach.”</p>

 <p>As far as I know, this is the first time it’s been officially confirmed by anyone at Arrowhead publicly that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was at one point planned to be free-to-play. It’s interesting to think about now, and according to Jorjani, that version of the game would have had a “completely different content pipeline” and would have likely been a very different game compared to what we actually got.</p>

 <p>“I wasn’t with Arrowhead back then so I don’t know – but the model was always to give away as much nice stuff for free and monetize other things,” said Jorjani. “It would have been a completely different angle. It [would have] required a completely different content pipeline.”</p>

 <p>Making all of these changes and pivots during development led to a lot of tech debt, which the CEO says is a big reason the game’s performance is “so-so.” But they are planning to improve things in the future, with the CEO telling fans in the Discord that improving the game is like cleaning out a garage.</p> <p>“Tech debt is like a garage filled with stuff you just chucked in,” said the CEO. “We really need to put up shelves in the back to get organized.” This isn’t the first time he’s talked about the game’s tech debt causing issues. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-ceo-just-comes-out-and-says-it-the-technical-debt-is-crippling-and-we-didnt-hit-the-mark-with-into-the-unjust-update-so-arrowhead-is-trying-to-get-our-s-in-order/">Earlier this month,</a> he reiterated that<em> Helldivers 2</em> wasn’t in a great place and that the team needed to get their “shit in order” and fix it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/live-action-beauty-and-the-beast-was-an-inspiration-for-ff7-remake-trilogy-says-director.1310022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix arguably broke the internet about 10 years ago when it finally revealed it was working on a long-anticipated remake of <i>Final Fantasy 7</i>. Now, in 2025, two parts of this trilogy project have arrived on PlayStation and PC, with ports expected on Switch 2 and Xbox in the near future.</p> <p>Speaking with a number of outlets, <i>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</i>’s director Naoki Hamaguchi shed some light on <i>FF7 Remake</i>’s upcoming arrival on Switch 2 and Xbox, what it took to get the game running on less powerful hardware, how <i>Rebirth</i> is shaping up on Switch 2, and which <i>Final Fantasy</i> he’d be eager to see remade next.</p> <h2>The key to the Switch 2’s <i>FF7R</i> port was nailing the lighting</h2> <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/ff7-remake-director-interview-rebirth-switch-2-confirmed/">Speaking to <i>ScreenRant</i></a>, Hamaguchi zeroed in on “character expressions” and “lighting” as being essential to delivering a quality experience on Nintendo’s hybrid console:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our aim was to align more towards the lightning we see in the PS5 version, and then we also kind of balance this by aligning more towards the sort of switch to post-effect and fog. And in this way the user is not really able to make out a huge difference</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-xbox">In an interview with <i>Inverse</i></a>, Hamaguchi said that a Switch 2 port seemed likely early on once “Nintendo first shared with [Square Enix] the new hardware […] the thought came to me that <i>Final Fantasy 7 </i>can likely run on these specs.”</p>

 <p>According to Hamaguchi, the Xbox version was already in the works before the team got their first look at the Switch 2 hardware. And, contrary to what you may think, the underpowered Series S wasn’t much of an issue. Though the team has run into some memory problems on Series S, Hamaguchi still describes Microsoft’s budget console as “quite high in terms of specs.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7 Remake</i> isn’t the only part of the remake project headed to Switch 2. The more graphically ambitious <i>Rebirth</i> is also expected to arrive at some point in the future. Hamaguchi described <i>Rebirth</i> as being in a “working state” on Switch 2. “Our desire was to be able to ultimately offer and serve all of the platforms available,” Hamaguchi told <i>ScreenRant</i>. He declined to say, however, whether or not the third installment will arrive as a multiplatform title on day one.</p>

 <h2>Development on part three of <i>FF7</i> remake’s trilogy is ‘going extremely well’</h2> <p>The <i>FF7 </i>remake project is still ongoing, with a yet-unnamed third entry on the horizon. Hamaguchi describes development as “going extremely well.” “A lot of the content is already playable,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">he told <i>Automaton</i></a>, “and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now the team is united around refining everything.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7</i>’s remakes have certainly impressed a number of fans, but concerns over the sales of the last entry and the general direction of the various plot changes do remain. For his part, Hamaguchi has described <i>Rebirth</i> as “doing very well on both PS5 and PC” in terms of sales. He also shared with <i>ScreenRant</i> how the recent live-action <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> remake inspired his decisions in reinterpreting <i>FF7</i> for the remake trilogy:</p> <blockquote><p>When development [on <i>FF7 Remake</i>] was happening, the <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> movie remake was released. That movie, the original, was one I watched as a child. And then they now had the live-action that’s a remake…I saw the overall story and the world itself was not altered, but it was completely deconstructed in a way to really entertain today’s viewers, which was deeply satisfying.</p></blockquote> <p>Although <i>FF7</i>’s remake chapters have occupied his time, Hamaguchi has spent some time daydreaming about other possible remakes in the classic JRPG series. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Speaking to <i>Windows Central</i></a>, the director described <i>FF6</i> as his favorite, saying “That would be very cool to take on as a remake. I’ve put my heart and soul into the <i>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</i> series for over a decade now. Working on something completely new would be quite fun as well.”</p>
