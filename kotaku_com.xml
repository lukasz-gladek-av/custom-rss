            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October was going to be a special month. For the first time since <em>Shovel Knight</em> came out over a decade ago, Yacht Club Games was going to release a new game that had nothing to do with its hit 8-bit platformer. It’s a <em>Link’s Awakening</em>-sized adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-mina-the-hollower-zelda-castlevania-game-1848463038">called <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>. Unfortunately, it also just got indefinitely delayed.</p> <p>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay <em>Mina the Hollower</em>,” the studio wrote in <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a new blog post on Monday</a>. “The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.”</p>

 <p>Unlike its 2D side-scrolling predecessor,<em> Mina the Hollower</em> is a top-down action game that focuses a bit more on puzzles and combat. Think <em>Castlevania</em> if it fell on the ground with a <em>Zelda</em>-inspired interconnected map. It has all the signs of becoming another clever, charming retro homage if Yacht Club can deliver. Apparently, it still needs more time to cook. There’s no new release date yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily far away from finally coming out.</p>

 <p>“We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line,” Yacht Club wrote today. “The game is&nbsp;<i>so</i> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day.” In the meantime, the developers say they’re working on finalizing design, art, sound, game balance, localization, and QA.</p> <p><em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the third notable game <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-release-october-2025-pokemon-battlefield-ninja-gaiden-2000630373">to drop out of the busy October release calendar lineup</a>. Roguelike dungeon game <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>moved to November and <i>Kingmakers </i>is missing its Early Access date this week with no new date announced yet. <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the one I was looking forward to most, however. I’d love to be spending my end-of-year travel season cozied up to my Switch like it’s 1998 again and the Game Boy Color just came out. We’ll see if it still ends up arriving in time for the holiday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon-2000632012</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon.1318015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>GoPro almost never puts its cameras on sale</strong>. Outside of a handful of major shopping events each year, and exclusively through Amazon, you’re paying full price. That’s why <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> and Black Friday are the only real opportunities to snag a deal on their latest gear. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/">the HERO13 Black bundle (including two batteries) is down to $399 from its usual $499, and this is an all-time low for the newest model</a>. If you’ve been waiting to document your ski trips, capture your kids’ soccer games from unique angles, mount a camera on your mountain bike for trail footage or simply record your travels in stunning quality that your phone can’t match, this is your moment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This package comes complete with goodies that truly make a difference: You receive <strong>two Enduro batteries</strong>, which is a big deal because action camera batteries have a short life when you’re recording in chilly weather or capturing high-def video. Enduro batteries are also designed to hold up better when it’s cold outside and have a longer overall life, <strong>giving you up to 2.5 hours of solid 5.3K recording per battery pack</strong>.</p>
<p>Another welcome innovation is t<strong>he waterproof shutter remote</strong> which allows you to initiate recording or stop recording from a distance of up to 196 feet away. This allows you to affix the GoPro HERO 13 Black camera on your helmet, your ride or a tripod and operate it without awkwardly pressing the small buttons on the camera which is extremely handy when your hands are gloved or the camera is mounted somewhere out of easy reach.</p>



<h2>Film-Like Experience That Accommodates Your Trek</h2>
<p>The <strong>HERO13 Black captures at 5.3K resolution</strong> which provides 91% more information than regular 4K and a whopping 665% more resolution than 1080p. That extra resolution provides serious leeway in post-editing. Crop-in on your shots, firm up shaky frames or punch-in on details without sacrificing quality. The GoPro Quik app even allows you to <strong>pull 24.7-megapixel still images straight out of your 5.3K video</strong>&nbsp;so you never have a bad photo because you happened to be recording video rather than pics.</p>
<p>One of the coolest capabilities is <strong>Burst Slo-Mo which takes action at 13 times normal speed</strong>. Just think about being able to capture a skate trick, a breaking wave, or a bike jump with all the little details witnessed in silky smooth slow motion. And you <strong>can capture 4x slow motion at the full 5.3K resolution</strong>&nbsp;which creates extremely detailed slo-mo video that freezes movements and moments your eye might otherwise miss.</p>



<p>The GoPro HERO13 Black includes native support for HB-Series Lenses that are automatically switched when you put them on the camera. The Ultra Wide Lens Mod is perfect for POV shots when you need to see all that’s in front of you, from ski slopes to surf sessions. The Macro Lens Mod places you very close to the subject for close-ups of small objects, details, or animals. Neutral Density filters enable you to naturally blur fast-paced scenes for motion blur and exposure control for sunny scenes, adding a cinematic effect to your clips.</p>
<p>Designed to withstand the toughest environments, the <strong>HERO13 Black is water-resistant up to 33 feet without the need for extra housing</strong>. Water-repellent lens cover minimizes lens flare, giving you clear shots even when wet.</p>
<p>For that price, getting the complete bundle with two batteries is a steal.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/players-are-getting-jump-scared-by-one-offinal-fantasy-tactics%E2%80%99-most-iconic-battles-all-over-again.1317970/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a special battle in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactic</em>s</a> that’s been punishing unsuspecting players for generations. Thanks to <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster, fresh recruits can witness the joy and terror of randomly getting jumped by 11 monks in one of the strategy RPG’s lesser-known endgame challenges.</p> <p>Every spot on the map in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> comes with an <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">array of random encounters</a> the game can pull from depending on which side you enter from and how far along you are in the story. Once you hit Chapter 4, the game’s “rare” random encounters become accessible. These special battles are weird, hard, and memorable. None more so than the 11-Monk brawl on Grogh Heights (known in the original PS1 version as Grog Hill). They hit hard and have great range thanks to the Monk’s versatile Martial Arts abilities. God help you if you accidentally drop into the battle while trying to train your squad up on weaker jobs they don’t have many abilities for.</p>

   <p>Fans on the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> subreddit have been posting about these Monks for years. Every so often, someone new to the game takes a photo, uploads it in a thread, and writes something to the effect of “WTF?” Community hero Kronikle has been cataloging every instance and posting each of them under every new thread. This happened <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1nyutyr/anyone_seen_a_random_battle_like_this_lol/">again over the weekend</a>.</p>

 <p>“Homie really pulled up with the receipts,” wrote one fan in response. “Dude replies this every time and adds to it. It’s my most favorite thing ever on this subreddit,” wrote another. A third chimed in, “gotta respect the dedication.”</p>

   <p>While the Monks are arguably the game’s most absurd rare battle, there’s close to <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/41329250">a dozen others</a> scattered across the map, each with a chance of occurring when you walk to that specific point from the right direction. A small army of Calculators can spawn at Lenalia Plateau, Yuguo Woods can spawn seven Samurai, and Germinas Peak can spawn a group of Chemists and Orators with powerful guns worth stealing. Certain rare monsters like Tiamats can only spawn in the Bariaus Valley rare battle.</p> <p>Some players seek these fights out in order to farm abilities off the crystals the enemies drop. Others just like the added challenge and variety. Most story battles in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> only draw from a very limited pool of Jobs, making the rare battles extra fun. Fortunately, with the Enhanced mode’s ability to retry and flee battles, you’ll never have to worry about seeing hours of progress get wiped out this way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i><span> is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082"><span>holding an online beta test</span></a><span> until October 8, so fans can play the online modes before the full game launches on November 14. Some players are having matchmaking issues, but I suppose identifying such issues is the whole point of betas, so that’s not too surprising. What is surprising, however, is that players were reporting earlier that </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>’s in-game text chat was censoring the name of another shooter launching soon. No, it’s not direct competitor </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>. It’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540"><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, the upcoming extraction shooter from Embark Studios.</span></p> <p><span>Players were reporting earlier today (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>) that if you sent “Arc Raiders”</span> <span>in the </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> beta’s text chat, the message that would actually pop up would just be a series of asterisks. According to those who tested it, the words “Arc” and “Raiders,” individually, seemed to get through the moderation system just fine. It was only when they were put together in that order that a switch flipped. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>, arguably </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>’s biggest competitor, didn’t seem to be affected, even after taking </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><span>shots at the military shooter in a recent ad</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>However, </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>has verified that this has since been patched out. I downloaded the beta myself. That was 52GB installed on my scalding hot gamer laptop just to type another game’s name into chat to see what happened.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> isn’t the type of game I would have expected Activision to view as a competitor or threat to </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>. It’s a science fiction extraction shooter in which, sure, you point and shoot at things, so maybe that was enough in someone’s eyes at Activision? I’m now curious what other games could be crossed out in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>’s backend. Embark Studios also made another shooter, </span><i><span>The Finals</span></i><span>, so it’s not like it’s a bright-eyed newcomer to making video games, but it’s still an odd target for Activision to hone in on. They’re not the only ones, as </span><i><span>Battlefield </span></i><span>publisher EA was also </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/"><span>censoring the game’s name in its apps</span></a><span>. What are y’all so scared of? Could it be an error? We’ve reached out to Activision and Embark Studios about the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/your-%E2%80%98wtf-happened-%E2%80%99-guide-to-all-of-xbox%E2%80%99s-game-pass-changes.1317937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Following a whiplash-inducing 50-percent price hike for Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">the Xbox brand overall are in a funky place</a>. That nauseating price increase is likely the loudest adjustment being made to the once-decent Game Pass subscription service, but it’s far from the only one. Old tiers have been overhauled and renamed, with tighter restrictions on when you can access certain games and how many of them you’ll have access to, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">discounts and deals subscribers once enjoyed</a> are but ash scattered to the wind.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">The Enshittification Of Game Pass Is Here</a></p> <p>While the Ultimate plan now has a few more features than it once did, the sting of paying 50 percent extra has caused serious damage to the Xbox brand, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-lina-khan-ftc-microsoft-activision-merger-2000631611">progressive lawmakers saying “told ya so</a>” after Microsoft gobbled up a bunch of studios and publishers. This is all going down while <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">rumors of an ad-supported version of Xbox Game Streaming</a> are swimming around. That last point shouldn’t be surprising as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ad-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-1850987502">Xbox consoles have routinely been home to various ads</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/4i1LCVSdD7k?t=277">taking up your full screen</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/consoles/comments/1nw5so9/xbox_consoles_are_now_getting_a_fullscreen_xbox/">on boot</a>.</p>

 <p>As is customary for the first quarter of the 21st century, <a href="https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/">we’re all quoting comrade Doctorow</a> in response to these wild changes. But in case you’re looking to shrug off that late-stage-capitalism ennui with some gaming on Xbox, let’s break down what Game Pass now costs, and how you can still get it for pre-hike prices, for now.</p>

 <h2>How much does Game Pass cost now?</h2> <p>Following last week’s changes, Xbox Game Pass presently offers three tiers:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Essential ($10/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Premium ($15/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Ultimate ($30/month)</li> </ul> <p>All of these tiers let you play online multiplayer on Xbox, though <b>the number of games available and when you get access to them varies</b>. Essential and Premium don’t offer day-one access for new Xbox games. Premium, however, lets you play recently released Xbox titles “within 12 months of launch.” Ultimate (which will run you a ridiculous $360/year if you hang on to your sub all year) grants you the most games with the fastest access: Day-one availability on first- and third-party games, plus all the games in EA Play and Ubisoft+ Classics.</p>

 <p>You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass#join">check out the full details on Xbox’s site</a>, but it’s clear that Game Pass isn’t only more expensive than it once was, it’s also become far more complicated than just throwing a modest sum of money at Microsoft per month to be sure you can play the new <i>Gears</i> or <i>COD</i> at launch.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-game-pass-price-xbox-ally-leak-marvel-rivals-cross-platform-2000631038">GameStop Hits Back At Massive Xbox Game Pass Price Hike</a></p> <p><b>There’s also a PC-only plan for $16.49/month</b> which promises day-one availability of Xbox-published games, as well as some third-party ones. It also includes EA Play.</p>

 <h2>Hang on to Game Pass for Console if ya got it</h2> <p>There’s a select group of Game Pass subscribers who will be happy to know they just dodged a bullet (for now, anyway). As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-console-grandfather-accounts/">confirmed by our comrades over at <i>Polygon</i></a>, if you are presently subscribed to the now-phased-out Game Pass for Console and automatic payment is still set up and functioning, you will be grandfathered in with all of the benefits of the old subscription.</p>

 <p>Should you cancel payments, however, you’ll lose access to that retired plan and will need to choose among the three poison pills of a service Microsoft is selling you. Checking which plan you have is as simple as logging in to Game Pass’ website, clicking on “My Microsoft Account” and checking what active subscriptions you currently have.</p> <h2>GameStop is still selling subs at the older prices (for now)</h2> <p>In an unlikely turn of events, GameStop of all companies has lol’d at Xbox by continuing to sell Ultimate subscriptions for just $20/month. It may be worth checking out other retailers, probably in brick and mortar stores, to see if you can snag a subscription card for a cheaper price as well.</p> <h2>Discounts got the ax. Now it’s all about “Rewards”</h2> <p>One of the cooler things about the Game Pass of Old™ was that you’d regularly get access to exclusive discounts on games and DLC. That’s obviously no longer in Microsoft’s interests to offer you as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-it-scrapped-the-xbox-game-pass-discount-on-all-games-and-dlc-purchases-gives-subscribers-more-rewards-points-instead">Microsoft has confirmed to <i>IGN</i></a> that instead of getting a 10-percent discount on DLC, you’ll now just earn more Rewards.</p>

 <p>“Rewards” are a non-Xbox-exclusive program that basically lets you earn money to spend on various Microsoft products. You can earn points otherwise by browsing the web with Bing while using Microsoft Edge (lol what are we doing here, ya’ll?), and now by playing games with an active Game Pass subscription.</p> <p>If that sounds confusing, I regret to inform you that it’s probably that way by design. Essential will net you up to $25 in rewards per year, Premium allows for up to $50, and Ultimate will let you earn up to $100. You can read all of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards/about">nitty gritty details about the Microsoft Rewards program here</a>.</p>

 <h2>What are other gaming subscription services charging?</h2> <p>Pricier subs, the death of discounts, it all sounds painful and it is! That might have you wondering what’s going on with other subscription services, especially if you value an ongoing service over just straight-up purchasing and owning your games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions">PlayStation has a similar three-tier structure</a> (no options for PC gamers though). The most costly version of these will only cost you $160 for the full year, which is a full $200 less than what Xbox is charging for Ultimate. The most basic version of its subscription service will only cost you $80/year, but it doesn’t come with a game catalog. You’ll need to buy the middle-tier option at a minimum for that, which will run you $15/month or $135/year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/online/">Nintendo has two subscription services</a> but doesn’t offer any Switch games via a Netflix-style, download-on-demand service. Its most basic service costs $20/year, lets you play online among other benefits, and lets you play from a library of NES, SNES, and Game Boy games whenever you want. At $50/year, a pricier tier expands that retro library to include select GameCube, GBA, N64, and Sega Genesis games (yes, really!).</p>

 <h2>A reminder: No company can increase the cost of games you fully ‘own’</h2> <p>I put ‘own’ in quotes there because, especially on PC, there’s debate as to whether or not our Steam libraries (or any digital library) is made up of the games themselves, or is just a collection of licenses granting us access to the games. (There’s always GOG if you want to be sure you’ll just get straight up .exe files of your games, though it is a more limited collection.) But that argument aside, if you plunk down $60-70 bucks to snag a new game that doesn’t have a perpetual monetization scheme baked into it, you will continue to have access to that game without needing a corporation to charge you every month.</p> <p>Maybe you’ll have a smaller library of games available to you at any given moment, but at least they’ll be yours. Period. Consider it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">Xbox Still Swears It’s Not Giving Up On Console As Fan Morale Craters</a></p> <p>Subscriptions make sense for many folks, no doubt. But having direct access to your games keeps you away from these kinds of shenanigans, and I shudder to think there’s a generation of gamers growing up right now that think more about getting an Ultimate Game Pass card for their birthdays or holidays than an actual copy, digital or physical, of a game that they’ll own for the foreseeable future.</p>

              <p>Ridley Scott is one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ridley-scott-movies-ranked-gladiator-ii-1851701914">most prodigious directors</a> working in Hollywood right now. Every movie studio seems content to lavish him with massive budgets no matter how tenuous the pitch. But the filmmaker behind <em>Blade Runner</em> and other classics has grown unimpressed with what everyone else around him is producing. “The quantity of movies that are made today, literally globally–millions. Not thousands, millions,” he said during an interview this weekend. “And most of it is shit.”</p> <p>The choice comments came during a retrospective on his career at the BFI Southbank in London, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/ridley-scott-hollywood-drowning-in-mediocrity-1236570875/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a>. Scott, whose 2024 blockbuster <em>Gladiator II</em> at one point featured a mostly green-screened sea battle within a colosseum with massive sharks, lamented that too many bad films are “saved” with digital effects added in post-production instead of relying on solid scripts.</p>

 <p>Scott was asked if he has any movie comfort foods. Why yes, yes he does: his own movies.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I watched Alien with his commentary last night and every other scene he said something along the lines of “damn that’s good” or “it hasn't aged at all” and I just nodded in agreement every time. <a href="https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj">https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj</a></p> <p>— Barto (@bartonovopolis) <a href="https://twitter.com/bartonovopolis/status/1975050651299426475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Well, actually, right now, I’m finding mediocrity–we’re drowning in mediocrity,” he said. “And so what I do–it’s a horrible thing–but I’ve started watching my own movies, and actually they’re pretty good! And also, they don’t age.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I watched&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk</em>&nbsp;[<em>Down</em>] the other night and I thought, ‘How in the hell did I manage to do that?’ But I think occasionally a good one will happen, [and] it’s like a relief that there’s somebody out there who’s doing a good movie.”</p> <p>It’s unclear if he went on to mention what those “good ones” are. It would be hard to top 2023’s <em>Napoleon</em>, after all. Scott’s next movie is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller called <em>The Dog Stars</em>. It’s out March 2026.</p>
