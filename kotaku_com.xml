              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714"><em>Divinity</em></a> was one of the biggest reveals at <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">the Game Awards 2025</a>. Hell, there was an entire demonic statue sitting in the desert for over a week to get people hyped. Actors were paid to sit in the front row of the showcase and get lifted into the air on pulleys to introduce the game’s first trailer. But what is it and why should you care? Here’s the little we know so far about Larian Studios’ next major RPG.</p> <h2><strong>What is&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It’s a new game from Larian Studios, most famous for the acclaimed 2023 hit RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;Like that one, <em>Divinity</em> is also an RPG. Unlike that one, <em>Divinity</em> takes place in Larian’s own made-up fantasy universe instead of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Forgotten Realms. Larian’s land of Rivellon is still inhabited by humans, elves, dwarves, and so on, though it has some peoples you won’t find in <em>BG3 </em>too, and it still revolves around magic and demonic forces, but there are seven gods and more religious overtones. It started in 2002 with the studio’s first fantasy RPG, <i>Divine Divinity.&nbsp;</i></p>

 <p>“The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir.” That’s the tagline for the new <em>Divinity</em>, which Larian promises will be its “most ambitious title yet” and even larger than <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It was <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">massive statue</a> and a gnarly cinematic trailer that suggests the world of <em>Divinity</em> may be on the verge of succumbing to some truly wicked hellspawn.</p>

  <h2><strong>Wait, is this <em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>?</strong></h2> <p>No, it ain’t. While fans of that turn-based sub-series would love to see Larian go back to that solid foundation, the company’s head of publishing was very clear that this isn’t a direct sequel. “There aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will,” Michael Douse wrote on X <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">prior to <em>Divinity</em>‘s announcement</a>. But Larian did name-check both<em> Original Sin</em> games in its press release, saying fans of those will have a better understanding of this new game’s world.</p>

 <p>Here’s how director Swen Vincke put it in the announcement: “Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled ‘Divinity.’ We’re ready to bring everything we’ve done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before. We’ve been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. This is the <em>Divinity</em> we’ve always wanted to make and you’re going to have loads of fun with it.”</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Divinity</em> be turn-based?</h2> <p>That’s one of the great debates raging among fans as <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1999108111789851024"><em>alleged</em> rumors</a> circulate that Divinity&nbsp;<em>might</em> not be turn-based. That would be a big departure from Larian’s last decade of projects which have all been that way. Back in the beginning, however, the <em>Divinity</em> franchise was a real-time action series that played like <em>Diablo</em>. It’s not hard to see Larian going back to that, especially if <em>Divinity</em> is operating on a grander scale than past projects. Maybe it’ll be third-person action more in the vein of modern <em>Dragon Age</em>? Still, the studio has a history of sticking to what works and iterating from there. If I had to bet money, I’d say it’s probably still turn-based.</p>

 <h2>Is that old guy getting <em>Wicker Man’</em>d in the trailer important?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653115"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653115">Larian Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>Probably! Fans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/1pkhj33/they_commited_the_original_sin/">Divinity subreddit</a> have been debating who it might be. One theory is that it’s a character called <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Lucian">Lucian</a> who’s the canonical hero for the original <em>Divine Divinity</em>, eventually getting godly powers and being worshiped. He also adopts a child named <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Damian">Damian</a> who ends up being a vessel for demonic entities. Here’s one fan’s theory:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“The implication of this trailer seems to be that the people of Rivellon stopped worshipping the dead gods and committed, besides the seven deadly sins, the Original Sin of killing the powerless Lucian, which causes the Hellstone to spawn, as the last remnants of the gods and Source were destroyed that way.”</p></blockquote> <p>Much of this interpretation depends on where in the existing timeline the new <em>Divinity</em> takes place. Is it after <em>Original Sin 2</em> or a prequel to the entire franchise? Or maybe somewhere in the middle? Whoever is being tortured in the game’s first trailer, it seems clear that all is not well in Rivellon and the demons are coming to take over.</p> <h2>When is <em>Divinity</em> coming out?</h2> <p>There’s no release date yet. Not even a release window or a whisper of one. <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> was made in three years. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> took six. A lot will depend on whether this is the only game Larian has in production or it’s working on something else alongside it. Either way, we probably won’t see it out in the wild until 2027 or beyond.</p> <h2>What platforms will <em>Divinity</em> launch on?</h2> <p>PC seems like a safe bet. Maybe even an Early Access launch like Larian did with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It could be far enough away to be a cross-gen console release on both PlayStation 5 and PS6. Same for Xbox. Hopefully it runs well on PC handhelds and Valve’s Steam Machine. Maybe it’ll even come to Switch 2? Larian’s only other game to launch on a Nintendo platform was <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>.</p>
