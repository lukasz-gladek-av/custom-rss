This gives you, the player, more opportunities to take advantage of <em>Death Stranding </em>2’s online features.</p><p>Additionally,<em> <strong>Death Stranding 2</strong></em><strong>’s online functions do not require a PlayStation Plus subscription to access</strong>.</p><h2 id="h405578"><a id=""></a>The Chiral Network, demystified</h2><p>When you conduct deliveries across Australia and connect the terminals to the Chiral Network, the range of the network increases and covers more segments across the country. This brings electronics online and lets Sam build structures like bridges and ladders with a Portable Chiral Constructor (PCC). Note that if an area hasn’t been connected to the network yet and is offline, Sam will not be able to deploy a PCC.</p><figure id="" data-id="ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-recommend-id="image://ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-recommend-id="image://ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once an area is online, you’ll be able to see structures that other players have left behind. This form of asynchronous multiplayer plays into <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s themes of building connections and helping others out.</p><p>When you ping your immediate surroundings using Sam’s Odradek, you’ll receive a signal that’ll highlight any nearby structures as blue. These can be your own equipment, as well as others left behind by players. You’ll often see ladders used as makeshift bridges or ropes placed nearby steep hills that you can take advantage of.</p><figure id="" data-id="c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-recommend-id="image://c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-recommend-id="image://c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also pieces of cargo that other players may have disregarded for whatever reason, and you can go ahead and deliver them to the appropriate terminal if you desire. You can also come across abandoned vehicles that can come in handy, especially if you’re in the middle of a delivery, lightening your load.</p><p>Other structures, like Timefall Shelters and Generators can come in clutch during your deliveries as well. As someone who relies heavily on vehicles when delivering cargo, coming across another person’s Generator always feels like a godsend, letting me recharge my vehicle’s battery to make the final mile to my destination without requiring me to pull out my own PCC to build a power source myself.</p><p>However, <strong>the best part of <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s online elements is that you’re able to complete unfinished structures that other players have left behind</strong>. All you have to do is contribute the proper materials. There have been times where I’ve seen giant bridges near rivers that were left incomplete, seemingly waiting for someone else to take over the reins and finish them. Other players have also elected to create their own roads, which you can utilize.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-recommend-id="image://0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-recommend-id="image://0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your own structures will show up in other peoples’ games too, so be sure to pay it forward and build as many useful ones as you can.</p><hr><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> is now available on PS5.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-chiral-network-multiplayer-connect-1851785246]]></content:encoded>

Capcom writes that it has “adjusted the amount of VRAM used with texture streaming, resulting in reduced overall VRAM usage.” That could help with resolution, framerate, and the amount of pop-in players encounter on PC while exploring the map. Other notable changes include new support for  DLSS4 and FSR4 for graphics upscaling, including multi-frame generation for new Nvidia cards. I’m not confident this is nearly sufficient to address what players are complaining about on PC, so we’ll have to wait and see just how much this improves game performance for the average <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fan. </p><p>While Capcom <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992">promised to address the poor state</a></span> of the PC version, major improvements have been slow to arrive. The game has been flooded with negative Steam reviews over the last month, with many players arguing that performance has actually gotten worse with each new update. “As of 5/28/2025, after 250+ hours of gameplay, the game will no longer boot up,” wrote one player on Steam. “<em>Monster Hunter Wilds?</em> Total disaster, folks. Frame rate drops harder than Biden on Air Force One,” wrote another. “Gameplay is fantastic, but the system requirements are a total lie fallacy, as is the benchmark,” wrote a third. “It’s not so bad at first until you get farther in, where weather effects really start taking effect and the framerate just tanks.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As players beat the drums of <em>Monster Hunter</em> discontent throughout June</a></span>, another major issue has been a sense that <em>Wilds</em>’<em>&nbsp;</em>endgame is too shallow, and there’s been renewed criticism arguing that playing it can feel like being on autopilot. Director Yuya Tokuda promised this week that Seregios will be the game’s most unpredictable boss fight yet, suggesting a fresh challenge for fans who feel like they’ve been sleepwalking the last few months. As teased by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese<em> Wilds </em>social media account</a></span>, September’s Title 3 update will include a new difficulty tier for quests, additional rewards, and RNG talismans, one of the core building blocks of every hunter build. </p><p>It’s good news that’s left some players scratching their heads. “So the actual endgame is going to come out 6 months after release date, huh?” one wrote on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the<em> Monster Hunter</em> subreddit</a></span>. <em>Wilds</em> is currently averaging 17,000 concurrent players on Steam, scarcely 1 percent of its debut back in late February. Perhaps even more notably, it’s less than what <em>Monster Hunter: World </em>averages, and that came out back in 2018. That entry’s first big expansion didn’t arrive until 18 months after its release. Some fans are worried it could take <em>Wilds</em> that long to become the game they hoped it would be. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248]]></content:encoded>
