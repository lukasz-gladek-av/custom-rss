The rest of the studio was then mostly populated with fresh graduates. “I didn’t even have a budget when I started, because it was an internal production,” Yoshida said. The <em>Legend of Dragoon</em> team would eventually be 100 strong and  end up costing Sony $16 million. </p><p>A lot of the effort by that large team went toward the game’s infamous 30 minutes of, at the time, gorgeous CGI cutscenes. While the prerendered backgrounds and polygonal character models were looking roughly on par with what Square was doing at the end of the PS1's life, the cinematics helped elevate into a much more epic and lavish-feeling game overall. The other highlight was the timed battle mechanic that turned combat into a mini-rhythm game, an evolution of what Hasebe had created for <em>Super Mario RPG</em> (and which continues in the modern <em>Paper Mario</em> games). <br></p><p>“Eventually, we recouped that (cost), thanks to sales outside Japan,” Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w">previously told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “The sales in the U.S. were very strong.” Unfortunately not strong enough to manifest a sequel or spiritual successor. Fortunately, <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em> is playable today after coming to PS5 a couple of years ago, though deep down in my heart of hearts I’m still hopeful we’ll eventually get <em>The Legend of Dragoon 2</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A premium edition will be available on PS5 and, like its Xbox counterpart, will give players two days of early access. </p><p>While on the surface <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> would seem to have a lot in common with the relic hunting <em>Uncharted</em> games, it’s much more of an immersive stealth game than Sony’s cinematic, setpiece-driven third-person shooter. Plus the bad guys in <em>Great Circle </em>are Nazis which players are encouraged to punch early and often. </p><p><em>Indiana Jones </em>is the latest Xbox first-party release to dispense with console exclusivity. id Software’s upcoming <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, meanwhile, will be day-and-date on both PS5 and Xbox. Rumors have been swirling of <em>Halo:The Master Chief Collection</em> and a<em> Gears of War</em> remaster anthology coming to PS5 this year as well, leaving many fans to suspect that 2023's sprawling sci-fi RPG <em>Starfield </em>can’t be that far behind. </p><p>Microsoft hasn’t completely dispensed with exclusivity yet, however, with action adventure<em>&nbsp;</em>game <em>South of Midnight </em>arriving on Xbox next month from Compulsion Games. The Southern gothic fantasy features platforming, puzzle solving, and magical abilities inspired by Southern folklore, and while we’ll probably see it on PS5 as well at some point, as of yet no date has been confirmed. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
