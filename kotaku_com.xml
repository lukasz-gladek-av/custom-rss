And now, because of a moon in a screenshot, <em>GTA </em>superfans are convinced that on November 22, we’ll either get the next trailer or an announcement from Rockstar of when to expect.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1852350119250628835?&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1852350119250628835?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 1, Rockstar Games provided an update</a></span> on<em> GTA Online</em>’s next major patch, which is set to arrive in December. The tweet contained a screenshot of someone sitting on a car and looking at a building at night. And in the sky above is the moon. Seems like a fairly mundane, boring image. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1gh69am/a_waning_gibbous_moon_in_the_most_recent_rockstar/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1gh69am/a_waning_gibbous_moon_in_the_most_recent_rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But one fan on Reddit</a></span> pointed out that the moon seen in the screenshot was in its waning gibbous phase. After some additional research, the community decided that on November 22, something will (<em>probably</em>) happen. </p><p>What exactly are they predicting? Well, that remains to be seen, with some suggesting a new trailer, others a release date announcement, and others a teaser for a future trailer. <br></p><p>This whole moon theory popped up not long after the tweet was published, but has continued to pick up support and momentum online as we get closer and closer to November 22. At first, this was a fringe theory, but now it’s all <em>GTA</em> fans can talk about at the moment. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/that1detectiv3/status/1858561899597619561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/that1detectiv3/status/1858561899597619561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I even saw one popular account suggest</a></span> that, because the first trailer contained a Tom Petty song off the album “Full Moon Fever,” this moon theory was more plausible. </p><p>Here’s the wild part: This isn’t the first time the Rockstar community has tried to predict the future using the phases of the moon as seen in a tweet. Last year, fans did the same thing, and guess what...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1ghdw6o/before_yall_say_im_loosing_it_last_year_there_was/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1ghdw6o/before_yall_say_im_loosing_it_last_year_there_was/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> they ended up being right in the end</a></span>! Two months before the first <em>GTA 6</em> trailer was announced, Rockstar shared an image with the moon in it, with the phase pictured arriving on December 1. And weeks later, on December 1, Rockstar teased the December 5 release date for the first <em>GTA 6 </em>trailer. Hmmmm. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> arrives in Fall 2025</a></span> for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And, if all this is to be believed, we might be only a few days away from a new trailer for the highly anticipated open-world game. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s because the event changed its rules this year to allow DLC to be considered alongside full, standalone games. It seemed obvious that the loophole was added to give FromSoftware’s latest release a shot at recognition, and not undeservedly so. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has received almost universal acclaim. At its most reductive, it’s just more <em>Elden Ring</em>, but that still puts it head-and-shoulders above much of the competition.</p><p>At the same time, there are a bunch of other games that could have taken that nomination slot and added something newer and more interesting to the mix. Plus, it’ll be a bit weird if <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> wins and a bunch of people run out to play 2024’s GOTY, only to realize they need to play dozens of hours of a different game and also beat two of its toughest bosses. Maybe a better solution is just to give expansions their own category, especially as they become more and more frequent. <em>Factorio</em>’s <em>Space Age</em> DLC, for instance, just came out and reinvents a game that was already one of the best resource management sims around. —Ethan Gach </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55c66314777f98a02f3007ceef94f978" data-recommend-id="image://55c66314777f98a02f3007ceef94f978" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Helldivers stand triumphant on a hill.

Arrowhead Game Studios’ coop alien shooter was more than just a great game, it was an entire phenomenon, taking over Tiktok and even convincing normie friends of mine who haven’t played games in ages to hop in. While it’s on the lower end of the Metacritic spectrum for a GOTY winner (at 82), it’s one of the fresher and more innovative games of the decade so far.</p><p>The Game Awards jury didn’t agree, however. And based on years past, perhaps no standout game of 2024 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/awards/450688/what-makes-game-of-the-year-tgas&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/450688/what-makes-game-of-the-year-tgas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had more going against it</a></span> for a GOTY nomination than <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It’s a multiplayer game with no story-driven campaign, open world, or RPG systems to speak of. It didn’t have the blockbuster production chops to make up for it either, unlike 2016’s <em>Titanfall 2</em> which snuck into the category even before it was expanded to six entrants. Perhaps to make up for <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s snub, it’s in the running for best ongoing game despite not even being a year old yet. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1567bfb41aae79fd688796649a1ec93" data-recommend-id="image://b1567bfb41aae79fd688796649a1ec93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cards on a board deal combo points.

Some great reviews here, positive chatter on social media there. Eventually, it had people everywhere hooked. Then it came to mobile and everyone kept playing its compulsive mix of roguelike deckbuilding and high-score arcade chase. The mix of playing card combos and<em> Diablo</em>-style buildcrafting is nominated across five different categories, including best game, best indie game, and best mobile game.</p><p>Its total number of nominations is equal to that of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> and one ahead of<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em>, and behind only <em>Astro Bot</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, which each have seven. It still seems like a long-shot for the best game win—my guess is that it and <em>Animal Well </em>split the best indie and best debut indie categories—but it’s an impressive showing for a game that wasn’t even on anyone’s radar until it blew up this year. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70897997f420d5fcdc92f3f980266a42" data-recommend-id="image://70897997f420d5fcdc92f3f980266a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dragon Age heroes confront a monster.

We here at <em>Kotaku </em>really like it. I’m currently in the middle of a 40+ hour playthrough and I’m loving it. Sure, it’s not perfect and some might miss the darker tone of the older <em>Dragon Age</em> games, but what’s here is a very good RPG that expertly balances combat, exploration, and narrative.</p><p>And yet, <em>Veilguard </em>only got one nomination at this year’s Game Awards. The new RPG from Bioware was nominated for “Innovation In Accessibility,” a very important category, and the devs should be proud. Still, it’s a bit wild that <em>Veilguard </em>failed to receive any other nominations at this year’s Game Awards. Perhaps the game was too new and too big, and so too few jurors had gotten a chance to finish it and vote for it. Or maybe it had some support, but it was too divisive to get enough votes in any one category. It’s a shame that one of the best BioWare RPGs in years won’t have a chance to win in the RPG category, yet a DLC for <em>Elden Ring</em> is in there.

The very idea of remaking <em>Silent Hill 2</em> angered people, and it didn’t help that Bloober, a studio with a spotty track record, was handling it.

One of the best horror games in years.</p><p>Sure, the remake was not as impactful as the OG game, but they’re different enough that the new<em> Silent Hill 2</em> feels more like an adaption of the source material that’s worth experiencing in its own right, and not a replacement for the original classic. And now, after years of fans fearing that the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake would suck and ruin the game’s legacy, here we are in December and it’s up for multiple nominations at the Game Awards.

Scrolling down will let you see every card available in the three Genetic Apex booster packs. Click on the one you want and you’ll be able to trade your points for a copy.</p><p>Depending on the card’s rarity, it will cost a different amount of Pack Points. These aren’t given proper names but are categorized by Diamond, Star, and Crown cards.

It will take opening 100 booster packs before you can trade in for a basic ex card. Interested in the cooler full-art versions?

Crafting that card was a simple process that filled me with joy and now I can take joy from those that I play against.</p><p>Of course, it’s all up to your personal preference at the end of the day. The minuscule chances of pulling those rarer cards are certainly a great reason to craft them instead. Statistically, you probably have better chances of getting the more common cards over time than a sick full-art Mewtwo.</p><hr><p>It doesn’t boast the best rates, but Pack Point Exchange is a nice option to get a specific card in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>. You don’t need to rush yourself to use them too soon either. Although each expansion will use its own exclusive Pack Points, they won’t expire on you.

The animation then ends with a powerful counter hit that sends the opponent a short distance away. Unless they’re in a corner, they will likely be launched too far away to start your own rush chain. However, you can follow up with vanishing attacks and then combo into smashes or even a rush super.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p>Aside from Sonic Sway only being able to counter rush chains, the biggest thing to stress here is the precise timing required. <strong>Sonic Sway will only come out if you press the button(s) right as an attack hits, while Super Perception comes out right before the attack hits</strong>. It’s very easy to keep performing the latter when trying to nail the timing for the former. Although both can be helpful, Super Perception does cost one skill count each time you use it.</p><p>Another important similarity to Super Perception is that <strong>you’ll want to use Sonic Sway while blocking</strong>. It is possible to immediately counter the first hit from a rush chain, but that will require some crazy reaction time and a lot of knowledge of the character you’re fighting. The general instability of the online mode will only make that more difficult too. That’s why I recommend blocking an opponent’s rush chain so you can better see the rhythm of their attacks and try to counter them.</p><h2 id="h581"><a id="practice"></a>The Best Way to Practice Sonic Sway</h2><figure id="" data-id="27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-recommend-id="image://27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-recommend-id="image://27276ba7bde56cd5993bf01358f3e8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Opponent Settings and Strategy submenu in the training mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pulling off a successful Sonic Sway is complicated further by the large roster size and differences in attack speed.

You’re going to be taking a lot of punches and kicks to the face, so it’s best to have health to spare.</li><li>Scroll down a bit under Gauge Settings and set the opponent’s Ki to Minimum. The CPU likes to switch things up a bit now and then. This will prevent them from throwing out Ki blasts or charging for Ki.</li><li>Under Opponent Settings, set the strategy to either Rush Attacks or Rush Chains.</li></ul><p>This approach will ensure the CPU only uses Rush Chains against you. Sometimes the training dummy will get a little stuck, so you might need to throw out a Ki blast or a couple of punches to get it back in the rhythm. Just remember to go back to blocking as soon as you can. Once you feel comfortable landing it, try switching to a different character to practice against.</p><hr><p>Sonic Sway might be the hardest defense mechanic to use in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, but the potential rewards are more than worth the trouble. Turning the tide on your opponent’s offense and wasting a whole bar of their Ki is amazing, especially when it doesn’t cost you any resources such as Ki or a Skill Count.

Scott’s widescreen frames brilliantly capture our universal feelings and anxieties and blows them all up in spectacular fashion. Even when his execution falls short of his reputation – and admittedly, they do so more often than not – a mediocre Scott film demands more attention than a perfectly fine whatever else.</p><p>With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-mf-doom-popcorn-bucket-regal-russell-crowe-1851668769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-mf-doom-popcorn-bucket-regal-russell-crowe-1851668769"><em>Gladiator II</em></a></span> waiting in the wings, it’s a good time to reflect on his extensive body of work. Here are all 28 movies directed by Ridley Scott’s, ranked from worst to best:</p></div></div><div><p>Exhibiting some of Ridley Scott’s worst tendencies, the 1992 historical drama <em>1492: Conquest of Paradise</em> is so poorly executed that it might make you sympathize with flat earthers. While Scott’s camera captures a staged rendition of Christopher Columbus’ expedition to the New World with operatic grandeur, there’s no substance behind its sails. The film is merely a string of shots, each resembling a glorified screensaver, featuring a saltwater-soaked Gérard Depardieu aimlessly wandering in colonial cosplay. This critique isn’t about how monstrous the real Columbus was or the film’s gross mythologizing of historical atrocities—it’s simply a dull, uninspired movie with nothing meaningful to say.</p></div><div><p>Here’s Scott operating at his usual maximum decibels, a big budget escapist piece for grownups that were falling out of favor amid Marvel’s rise to power. Unfortunately, <em>Exodus</em>’ bloated excess, melodramatic incoherence, and overall <em>300</em>-ification of a story other filmmakers of years past have beautifully told already make it among the weakest entries in Scott’s prolific oeuvre.</p></div><div><p>This should’ve worked. It’s Sir Anthony Hopkins returning to one of his most famous roles in a sequel helmed by one of the preeminent studio auteurs of the time. Instead, <em>Hannibal</em> is a sequel far too schizophrenic to know what kind of horror movie it wants to be and too unambitious to compete with its predecessor, Jonathan Demme’s handsome <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p></div><div><p>It’s painful to think about <em>Robin Hood</em> when you remember the movie it almost was. In the original <em>Nottingham</em> script by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris, the story took a fresh approach with a more sympathetic Sheriff, an amoral Robin Hood, a steamy love triangle, and even period-accurate forensic science. Silly? Perhaps. But it would have been different—essentially a big-budget <em>Law &amp; Order</em> set in 1199 AD. Instead, what we got was Russell Crowe starring in a beautifully rendered but uninspired retelling of the English legend. <em>Robin Hood</em> is big, bloated—and not bad, but why bother when Errol Flynn’s version is still unbeatable? (Honestly, even Kevin Costner’s will do.)</p></div><div><p><em>Someone to Watch Over Me</em> is a neat dive into the neo-noir thrillers that proliferated the latter half of the ‘80s. Scott’s blocking and framing is once again worthy of study for film students. Beyond its striking visuals, however, it’s underwhelming—a story filled with bland characters and a lackluster romance that never manages to ignite any real passion or intrigue.</p></div><div><p>Reuniting Scott with Russell Crowe (in the second of five movies together), <em>A Good Year</em> stars Crowe as a workaholic London trader who inherits his uncle’s vineyard in France where he falls for an alluring cafe owner (Marion Cotillard). Mostly sauceless with its few dashes of zest coming out of Crowe and Cotillard’s chemistry, <em>A Good Year</em> is like a full plate of bland cuisine – when “fine” feels too far from good.</p></div><div><p>Based on the real-life tragedy of the brigantine <em>Albatross</em>, which sank on May 2, 1961, the film follows a group of young men on a school-sponsored sailing trip led by their captain, “Skipper,” Dr. Sheldon (Jeff Bridges). When the ship is devastated by a sudden windstorm—the titular “white squall”—the boys’ survival hinges on the critical lessons they’ve learned throughout their journey. <em>White Squall</em> doesn’t chart any new or particularly thrilling cinematic waters, but its earnestness and emotional pull make it easy to get swept away.</p></div><div><p>Not long after Tom Cruise rose to stardom dancing in his underwear and socks, Scott worked with the newly certified A-lister for his dark storybook fantasy <em>Legend</em>. Fantasy was a new genre playground for Scott, who, in 1985, had already unleashed two of his most seminal sci-fi movies, <em>Alien</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em>. But as magnificent as its vibes are (and a movie I personally recommend to <em>Soulsborne</em> faithful), <em>Legend</em> doesn’t have much going for it besides Tim Curry as a devilishly masculine Darkness—an all-time achievement in makeup and design working in concert with Curry’s flamboyant charisma. <em>Legend</em> is a confused movie, ostensibly a classic fairy tale with arthouse stylings.</p></div><div><p><em>All the Money in the World</em> is often remembered as the film that erased Kevin Spacey in the wake of his career-destroying allegations, but it deserves more recognition than that. Based on John Pearson’s 1995 nonfiction book <em>Painfully Rich</em>, the film recounts the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III and his mother’s (Michelle Williams) futile attempts to convince his billionaire grandfather (Christopher Plummer, replacing Spacey) to pay the ransom. This leads to increasingly desperate measures to recover her teenage son. While it functions as a fairly standard ransom thriller, it’s Williams’ powerhouse performance that elevates the movie, making it a compelling watch. It’s nothing short of a crime that her exceptional work was overlooked by the Academy Awards, earning only a Golden Globe nomination.</p></div><div><p>Demi Moore’s dubious (and totally undeserved) Razzie Award win for Worst Actress aside, Ridley Scott’s <em>G.I. Jane</em>—a fictionalized account of the first woman to train in the U.S. Navy SEALs—is an imperfect but commendable film. Moore stars as Lieutenant Jordan O’Neil, who is hand-selected for a trial program to integrate women into the Navy. Her commanding officer, Master Chief John Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen), pushes her to the brink. In contrast to most of Scott’s work, <em>G.I. Jane</em> is an uplifting story about grit and perseverance, underpinned by a potent feminist message. Its noble efforts, however, are somewhat undermined by an uncritical embrace of jingoism.</p></div><div><p>Loaded with all the hallmarks of post-9/11 spy thrillers, Ridley Scott’s <em>Body of Lies</em> delivers entertaining dadcore fare that fans of Tom Clancy games might enjoy. Based on David Ignatius’ 2007 novel, which was inspired by the real-life Operation Mincemeat conducted by British forces during World War II, the film follows the intense efforts of a CIA operative (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his manipulative boss (Russell Crowe) as they work to flush out a terrorist leader in the Middle East. But how much can they really trust each other? With complex surveillance shots, roving black SUVs, and DiCaprio shouting into tiny cell phones, <em>Body of Lies</em> doesn’t reinvent the spy movie wheel—but it doesn’t have to.</p></div><div><p>Depending on which version you see, <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> can be either holy or unholy. The theatrical cut of <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em>, a liberally fictionalized chronicle of the Italian noble Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom) who fought in the Crusades, bombed in theaters. Incoherent and oppressive, the film captures the misery of the Crusades, but ultimately falls short. While it contains moments of visual beauty, expected from the director of <em>Gladiator</em>, it feels incomplete. That was because it was. When <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> hit DVD, Ridley Scott personally supervised an extended director’s cut, adding 40 minutes of restored material originally excised due to studio meddling and audience test screenings. The result transformed a flawed film into a modern masterpiece.</p></div><div><p>In his critically acclaimed directing debut, Ridley Scott came out swinging with <em>The Duelists</em>, a historical drama in which Harvey Keitel and Keith Carradine portray rival French officers locked in a 20-year battle of attrition. The film marked Scott’s transition from television commercials to theatrical narrative filmmaking, with the director drawing ample inspiration from Stanley Kubrick’s <em>Barry Lyndon</em>. Told through a series of painterly tableaus, <em>The Duelists</em> captures the broader political turmoil of Napoleonic France while making each duel intensely personal, thanks to the onscreen tension between Keitel and Carradine. Uncharacteristically for Scott’s later films, <em>The Duelists</em> received particular praise for its historical accuracy, especially the meticulously choreographed sword fights.</p></div><div><p>Ridley Scott’s recent take on the life of French officer-turned-Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte has drawn criticism from historians, but Scott has never claimed to be making documentaries. In this exceptionally long historical biopic, Joaquin Phoenix takes on the iconic role of Napoleon, charting his rise to power in 19th-century France, with the captivating Vanessa Kirby co-starring as his calculating first wife, Joséphine. While the film captures the dour gloom surrounding a figure often regarded as a tyrant, <em>Napoleon</em> is unexpectedly funny at times, thanks to Phoenix’s committed performance and his knack for portraying the outsized power wielded by one small man. The result is a compelling film—but be ready to bid <em>au revoir</em> to your entire afternoon.</p></div><div><p>Imagine <em>Blade Runner</em> without the flying cars—that’s essentially Ridley Scott’s <em>Black Rain</em>, a sleek ‘80s crime thriller that follows a hard-edged cop and his partner (Andy Garcia) from New York to Tokyo. After delivering a yakuza hitman to Japanese authorities only for him to escape under their watch, the duo teams up with a local, by-the-books officer (Ken Takakura) to track down their fugitive—a tattooed needle in a neon-soaked haystack. Much like <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Black Rain</em> taps into American anxieties about declining global dominance, with its narrative reflecting the unease about Japan’s economic rise in the late 20th century. At the same time, it weaves an unexpectedly heartfelt story of bridging cultural and personal divides. For fans of Scott’s rain-drenched, atmospheric visuals, <em>Black Rain</em> delivers plenty of eye-catching noir-inspired style.</p></div><div><p>Once again, you’ll want to seek out Scott’s extended director’s cut. A muscular crime thriller filled with hardened bodies and calloused souls, Scott’s 2013 film <em>The Counselor</em> brings Cormac McCarthy’s first spec script to life. It’s a philosophically dense and dialogue-heavy tale about a lawyer (Michael Fassbender) whose decision to involve himself in a drug deal at the Mexico-Texas border spirals out of control. One of Scott’s most divisive films—polarizing audiences between admiration and disdain—<em>The Counselor</em> is undeniably intriguing. It offers a dark, unflinching interrogation of human failings like greed, delivered with a perspective as bleak and unforgiving as crude oil.</p></div><div><p>A star-studded, buttoned-up tale of aristocratic intrigue, <em>House of Gucci</em> chronicles the doomed romance between Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), heir to the Gucci fortune and its iconic fashion brand, and his wife Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga). The highly publicized feud within the Gucci dynasty feels tailor-made for Ridley Scott’s sensibilities—a director who often prioritizes drama and detail over strict factual accuracy. <em>House of Gucci</em> mirrors the irony of the fashion industry itself: a world where characters obsess over appearances and reputation but have no qualms about getting their hands dirty.</p></div><div><p>At once part of the <em>Alien</em> franchise but eager to forge its own path, Ridley Scott’s <em>Prometheus</em> marks a return to the director’s haunting and enigmatic sensibilities after years of Hollywood grandeur. Set in the late 21st century, the film follows a team of explorers aboard the starship <em>Prometheus</em> on a mission to uncover the origins of humanity—only to find themselves in a desperate fight for survival. A visually stunning piece of sci-fi horror, <em>Prometheus</em> explores humanity’s hubris, weaving together influences from Greek mythology, Judeo-Christian themes, and the chilling vastness of Lovecraftian cosmic horror.</p></div><div><p>In Ridley Scott’s adaptation of Eric Jager’s nonfiction book, a French knight (Matt Damon) during the Hundred Years’ War accuses his former squire (Adam Driver) of sexually assaulting his wife (Jodie Comer) and challenges him to one of the last recorded trial-by-combat duels in France. Essentially a <em>Rashomon</em>-style tale with striking #MeToo parallels, <em>The Last Duel</em> unfolds through three conflicting perspectives—though the film asserts there is only one truth. Sober, somber, and gripping, <em>The Last Duel</em> brims with unflinching brutality. While it may not rank as Scott’s all-time best, it stands out as one of his finest works in years.</p></div><div><p>You can practically smell the dust and debris, feel the heat radiating from a hot assault rifle, and hear your ears ringing from freshly detonated grenades. Released just weeks after 9/11, Ridley Scott’s <em>Black Hawk Down</em> offered audiences a visceral glimpse into the evolving face of warfare through its depiction of the 1993 Black Hawk Down incident during the Somali Civil War. The film follows a U.S. military mission to stabilize the conflict, which spirals out of control when Black Hawk helicopters are shot down, leaving outnumbered soldiers to regroup and survive against overwhelming odds. Despite its historical inaccuracies and a sometimes dizzying narrative, <em>Black Hawk Down</em> masterfully blurs the line between thrilling spectacle and nail-biting terror. Unsurprisingly, it became a touchstone for military media that followed, influencing everything from <em>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</em> to Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune</em>.</p></div><div><p>Five years after <em>Prometheus</em>, Scott returned to helm his own sequel to the franchise he began. 2017's <em>Alien: Covenant</em> officially bridges <em>Alien</em> and <em>Prometheus</em>, following the story of a damaged colonial ship that makes landfall on a mysterious planet hiding a dark secret—and a hostile entity. While the narrative borrows heavily from Scott’s original <em>Alien</em> and offers nods to other entries in the franchise, <em>Covenant</em> serves as a satisfying continuation of <em>Prometheus</em> while delivering some fresh thrills of its own. True to the spirit of the iconic tagline that made <em>Alien</em> unforgettable, <em>Covenant</em> reminds us: “In space, no one can hear you scream.”</p></div><div><p>As smart, funny, and suspenseful as Andy Weir’s book—and featuring a striking auburn-orange color palette to bring Mars to life—<em>The Martian</em> allows Ridley Scott to flex different tonal muscles. The film manages to be as light as zero gravity without downplaying the severity of its premise. Matt Damon delivers a commanding performance, supported by an exceptional ensemble cast (Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, and many more), even though most of the characters feel light years apart from each other for much of the runtime. <em>The Martian</em> is simply good stuff—very good stuff.</p></div><div><p>If <em>Gladiator</em> isn’t Ridley Scott’s greatest movie, it certainly deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as whatever is. A massive hit upon its release in summer 2000, the film resurrected the sword-and-sandals epic with a gripping revenge tale about Maximus (Russell Crowe), a decorated Roman general betrayed by the scheming new emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) and forced to survive as an enslaved gladiator. Brimming with raw machismo and solidifying Crowe’s star power in cinematic bronze, <em>Gladiator</em> was one of the last films to both dominate the box office and claim the Oscar for Best Picture. “Are you not entertained?” We definitely were.</p></div><div><p>The next time <em>Matchstick Men</em> pops up on cable (assuming you still have a subscription), give it a chance—you might be pleasantly surprised despite its seemingly ho-hum premise. Nicolas Cage stars as a neurotic, tic-riddled con man whose carefully constructed life of crime unravels when he meets his teenage daughter (Alison Lohman). <em>Matchstick Men</em> feels distinct from most of Ridley Scott’s filmography, its understated mise en scène lacking the grand scope and sensory overload typical of his work—except for a final twist so devastating it might knock you off your couch. What <em>Matchstick Men</em> does showcase, however, is another of Scott’s greatest strengths: collaborating with top-tier actors and bringing out their very best performances.</p></div><div><p>The beauty of Scott’s <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em> lies in more than just its iconic final shot—it’s in the journey that brings its characters to that unforgettable moment. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis shine as the titular protagonists, two friends whose short road trip spirals into a run from the law after they kill an attempted rapist. As they traverse the country, Thelma and Louise embark on a deeper quest for independence, finding meaning and self-actualization in the ever-growing distance between themselves and the oppressive world they’ve left behind. Celebrated as both a landmark feminist film and one of the greatest road movies ever made, <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em> endures in memory just as it concludes: bold, defiant, and unforgettable.</p></div><div><p>Scott’s sweeping exploration of the American Dream comes to life in <em>American Gangster</em>, embodied in the story of Frank Lucas, the infamous Harlem gangster who built a heroin empire during the Vietnam War—allegedly smuggling the drug into the U.S. via caskets carrying dead servicemen. Denzel Washington commands the screen as Lucas, delivering a performance of chilling ruthlessness and emotional reserve. Russell Crowe reunites with Scott to play the determined cop relentlessly pursuing Lucas’s criminal enterprise. </p><p>Nearly flawless from start to finish, <em>American Gangster</em> transcends its generic title to become perhaps one of the greatest films about gangsters and dreamers, capital and power, and the opportunities within corruption since <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>Goodfellas</em>. How good is it? Good enough to inspire Jay-Z to record one of his finest albums.</p></div><div><p>It’s almost unfathomable that <em>Blade Runner</em> was overlooked at the box office in 1982, only to later become one of the most influential films of all time. A mesmerizing blend of detective noir and speculative science fiction, <em>Blade Runner</em> delves deep into themes of identity, purpose, and memory. The film follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), an ex-cop turned bounty hunter tasked with retiring lifelike androids known as “replicants,” including a particularly dangerous one (Rutger Hauer) leading an outlaw gang. </p><p>Its impact on the sci-fi genre cannot be overstated; nearly every piece of sci-fi media since owes something to <em>Blade Runner</em>. What holds it back from the absolute top tier of Scott’s filmography is the existence of seven different versions of the film, each offering a slightly different vision. For first-time viewers, seek out the 2007 <em>Final Cut</em>—the only version where Scott had complete creative control.</p></div><div><p>A startling and visually stunning sci-fi horror about humanity’s (or more precisely, women’s) survival against the unknown, Scott’s sophomore feature, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-10-year-art-design-original-film-1851452422&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-10-year-art-design-original-film-1851452422"><em>Alien</em></a></span>, follows the ill-fated crew of a spaceship as they attempt to expel a malevolent entity after it infiltrates their vessel—delivering one of the most grotesque and iconic reveals in movie history. Sigourney Weaver gradually takes center stage as Ellen Ripley, a warrant officer who joins the ranks of Sally Hardesty and Laurie Strode in defining the “final girl” archetype of the horror genre.</p><p>Even without considering the countless sequels, comics, video games, and other media it inspired, <em>Alien</em> stands tall as one of the finest achievements in Scott’s illustrious career. More than that, it’s simply one of the greatest films ever made. Period.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a game featuring a large cast of flawed people trying to come together to stop someone who thinks they are doing the right thing, but which will kill many. But who cares about all that? I’m here to talk about kicking people off cliffs over and over again and how much fun it is.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

After releasing live-service shooter <em>Anthem</em> and open-world checklist simulator<em>s Mass Effect Andromeda</em> and <em>Dragon Age Inquisition</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/mj05e3utmclxx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/mj05e3utmclxx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Veilguard</em></a></span><em> </em>feels like a return to form for the famous studio. The new RPG is more linear, more character-focused, and probably the best BioWare game since<em> Mass Effect 3. </em>And one big reason I love the game is that it lets me kick enemies, big and small, off cliffs and into giant pits. </p><p>Very early into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-tips-faction-inquisition-romance-1851685483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-tips-faction-inquisition-romance-1851685483"><em>Veilguard</em></a></span>, my character was given the special ability to do a powerful drop kick that sends enemies flying. And 40+ hours later, I’m still drop-kicking fools and smiling each and every time. I know the game probably expected me to try out more abilities, and I have, but I always keep the big kick in my hot bar. I can’t imagine playing <em>Veilguard </em>without it.</p><figure id="" data-id="4efbc8843e03fe95ad193a8adaec25d1" data-recommend-id="image://4efbc8843e03fe95ad193a8adaec25d1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows the main character drop kicking an enemy off a ledge.

Kick ‘em into a giant lava pit! Tiny monster that I could easily kill with two hits? Sure, why not? Drop kick that small bastard off the edge of a mountain and watch them sail into the void below. </p><p><em>Veilguard’s</em> narrative, combat, characters, and worlds are truly great and I’m loving the game a lot. But I’d be lying right now if I said the drop kick wasn’t a big reason why the new RPG is currently sitting on my preliminary game of the year list. </p><p>I’ve talked about this before on <em>Kotaku</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deathloop-players-all-agree-the-dedicated-kick-button-1847688695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deathloop-players-all-agree-the-dedicated-kick-button-1847688695">with <em>Deathloop</em></a></span>, but I give a big thumbs up to any game that lets me instantly defeat enemies by kicking them off cliffs, buildings, or ledges. <em>Veilguard </em>let me end a boss fight in seconds by kicking the enemy off a platform. Wonderful stuff. </p><p>Truly, more games could learn from <em>Veilguard</em>. If you want people to have more fun, add a big kick button.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
