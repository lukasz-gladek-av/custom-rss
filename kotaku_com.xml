              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kenneth-shepards-top-10-games-of-2025-pokemon-hundred-2000655496"><span>I loved </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, but looking at a game in every stage of its development is inevitably going to make you wish a studio had been able to implement every idea it had into the final product. The infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>Game Freak Teraleak</span></a><span> from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>last year</span></a><span> has given us a pretty thorough look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> journey from design doc to finished game, and while it’s interesting to see these screenshots and pieces of test footage, it also has fans weighing in on Game Freak’s processes and sharing how they feel about the final product now that they’ve seen how the sausage was made.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sdVmay2ky0"><span>TurtleBro</span></a><span> compiled all his findings in the Teraleak into a feature-length video that goes chronologically through </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s development files dating back to 2022, shortly after work on </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> had wrapped up. Some files are from so early in the process that Game Freak was using </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>’ Irida as a placeholder for the player. These screenshots and videos show some cut content and features, like additional building interiors to explore, being able to use overworld abilities around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, and even some additional multiplayer modes that had players throwing Poké Balls at one another, dodgeball style.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps most surprising in these early builds is a much </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>higher level of environmental detail</span></a><span> than we see in the final game. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> was memed to hell and back for its flat-textured buildings, and some of the first pieces of footage TurtleBro shows off include windows and building structures that are much more detailed. In January of 2023, many of these assets were swapped for something similar to the flat ones we have in the game now, and internal notes suggest this downgrade was a “burden” on the team. It’s here you can see a lot of the game’s initial ambitions get pulled back, though some things, like the real-time, action-based combat system, started to take shape here, albeit in a more third-person shooter style than the command-based one we have now. By March of that year, the team was on track to deliver the game we got, and morale started to improve.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s one aspect of the development timeline that is kind of fascinating considering 2024 was the first time in quite a few years since there wasn’t a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><span>or expansion</span></a><span>: it sounds like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was feature complete by June 2024, and Game Freak spent around 16 months on polish before it launched the game on October 16, 2025. </span></p>

 <p><span>TurtleBro speculates that the reason the game’s visuals were deliberately downgraded was to give the team the year to spend refining the game in order to avoid a massive performance fiasco like the one that surrounded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> in 2022</span></a><span>, though others who viewed the game less charitably </span><a href="https://x.com/soulsilverart/status/2005368278689222901"><span>suspect Game Freak may have just shelved </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> for over a year and moved onto a new project, rather than using that time for meaningful iteration. It’s unclear, however, as the development details stop at this point; the Teraleak occurred in August, and thus, we don’t have any more of these design docs that might confirm the team’s thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span>Overall, it’s a fascinating look at how </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> went from concept to finished game, and TurtleBro does a great job of comparing images of aspects of the game from early in development to what those aspects look and play like in the actual, released game you can play on your Switch or Switch 2. Check out the full video below:</span></p>

  <p><span>I do mourn some of the stuff we lost in the development process, but that’s the risk you take when you look at unfinished work. The video puts the leaks we’ve seen from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> into perspective, serving as a reminder that several of the mechanics and concepts those leaks have revealed may not make it into the final product, either. We’ll know for sure when those games are revealed, which will likely happen for the series’ 30th anniversary next year.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/malcolm-in-the-middle-revival-life-still-unfair-fox-hulu-trailer-disney-2000655971</link>
            <guid>1393948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Like everything else that was once popular, the early 2000s Fox TV comedy <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> is returning in Spring 2026 with stars <a href="https://kotaku.com/shop-contest-frankie-muniz-winners-1838809743">Frankie Muniz</a>, Bryan Cranston, and Jane Kaczmarek all back to reprise their roles as Malcom, Hal, and Lois, respectively.</p> <p>On December 29, Disney and Hulu released the first trailer for <a href="https://people.com/frankie-muniz-malcolm-in-the-middle-reboot-trailer-exclusive-11875191"><em>Life’s Still Unfair</em></a>, an upcoming 4-episode<em> Malcom in the Middle</em> miniseries event set around 20 years after the original show, which ran from 2000 to 2006 on Fox. Here’s the trailer:</p>

  <p>And here’s the official synopsis for the miniseries, which will be exclusively available on Hulu and Disney+:</p> <blockquote><p>“After shielding himself and his daughter from his family for over a decade, Malcolm is dragged back into their orbit when Hal and Lois demand his presence at their 40th anniversary party.”</p></blockquote> <p>As a young pre-teen in the early 2000s, I watched a lot of <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> during the show’s original run on TV. But like a lot of people, according to ratings data, I remember my family vaguely checking out around season four. Two years later, the show was canceled due to low ratings. Of course, nostalgia for content from this era is reaching its highest point as people who grew up in that era are now entering their 30s. So Malcolm and his family will soon return to TV (or internet streaming TV) as Hollywood execs and number crunchers hope to squeeze out as much profit and viewership from this reheated revival as they can before they move on to the next somewhat popular TV show or movie from about 20 years ago.</p>

 <p>I love leftovers as much as the next guy, but I’m not sure I need every TV show and movie I grew up with to return for what often ends up being forgettable and tired reunions. Anyway, <em>Malcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair</em> will premiere on Hulu and Disney+ on April 10, 2026. Regardless of how I feel about the revival, the show’s opening song still kicks ass.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Isn’t Clair Obscur, It’s A Remake Of An 18-Year-Old Chinese RPG]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-chinese-rpg-sword-fairy-trailer-remake-2000655947</link>
            <guid>1393918</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> vibes from the new trailer for <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em>, you’re not alone. Some are pointing to the upcoming RPG as evidence that we’re about to get lot of copycats trying to ape the 2025 Game of the Year’s aura, similar to the wave of open-world games that borrowed elements from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>after that game’s incredible success. But <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> didn’t spring up out of nowhere, and the series it’s a part of has a long history of its own.</p> <p>“This single-player&nbsp;turn-based RPG is reborn in Unreal Engine 5 with the latest technology,” publisher CubeGame <a href="https://twitter.com/CubeGameCN/status/2005594647792656573">announced on Monday</a>. “Set off on a journey to find the immortals with Tianhe Yun’s team. In the meantime, a hidden truth that has been sealed for a long time is revealing itself.” The update was accompanied by a fresh trailer that’s been turning heads for both its high production values and its flashy turn-based combat.</p>

  <p>That last part is the biggest reason why the game’s been drawing comparisons to <em>Clair Obscur</em>. Like this year’s hit RPG, <em>Sword and Fairy 4:</em> <em>Remake</em> seems to feature cinematic battle animations with lots of motion blur and slowdown, as well as a command wheel integrated into the scene rather than situated off to the side with the rest of the HUD. The fact that the whole thing is in Unreal Engine 5 adds another level of hyper-realistic sheen reminiscent of <em>Clair Obscur</em>.</p>

 <p>But while the internet has a penchant for condensing new stuff down into familiar buzz phrases and using the most popular things as lenses for understanding everything else, <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. Quoting one site’s post about the game that called it a “<em>Clair Obscur</em>-like,” <em>The CRPG Book </em>editor <a href="https://crpgbook.wordpress.com/">Felipe Pepe</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felipepepe.bsky.social/post/3mb4tg7zfjk2v">wrote</a>, “I really hate how games media handles anything out of China. We’re getting a gorgeous remake of one of their best RPGs ever, but the clown does zero research about it and just goes ‘I’m getting a lot of Boss Baby vibes from this…'”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The original Sword and Fairy 4 looked like this, the second screenshot is the remake, and the third is Expedition 33.  </p> <p>The only bar you have to clear is to recognize shape and colors at this point, and you are failing miserably. My 3-year old cousin can see the similarities <a href="https://t.co/HCNNmqtPFV">https://t.co/HCNNmqtPFV</a> <a href="https://t.co/0X9sXdrz9o">pic.twitter.com/0X9sXdrz9o</a></p> <p>— Dream's Longest Day (@Dreamboum) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/2005678913092231639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The first <em>The Legend of Sword and Fairy</em> launched for MS-DOS in 1995 and served as an analogue to <em>Final Fantasy</em> rooted in Chinese mythology, but it was never localized outside of East Asia. The most recent entry was 2021’s <em>Sword and Fairy 7</em> which abandoned turn-based combat for real-time action and is available on both PC and console. <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em>, meanwhile, is an update to the 2007 entry which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621680/Sword_and_Fairy_4/">also happens to be available on Steam</a>. It only looks like<em> Clair Obscur</em> to the degree that all turn-based battle RPGs have you similarly watching a static row of fighters enact the commands you select from a menu.</p>

 <p>It’s definitely possible that <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> developer UP software has leaned into some of the stylistic RPG design choices we now associate with <em>Clair Obscur</em> in the year since that game blew up (trailers for it were getting fans hyped well before its 2025 release, too). But <em>Clair Obscur</em> owes some of those elements, including its flashy command wheel, to series that came before it, like <em>Persona</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-director-says-jrpg-3-0-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-at-a-fundamental-level-2000647233">As RPG fans have been reminding each other a lot this year</a>, the genre extends well beyond <em>Final Fantasy</em> and a certain modern French riff on the franchise.</p>

 <p>Maybe <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em><em>&nbsp;</em>will be the latest one to help players continue to expand their turn-based horizons.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961</link>
            <guid>1393867</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> is nearly over, with its finale set to premiere on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-acquisition-batman-hbo-2000651036"><span>Netflix</span></a><span> and in theaters on Wednesday, December 31. Its penultimate episode, “Chapter Seven: The Bridge,” included a scene that was a long time coming: Will (Noah Schnapp) finally coming out to his friends as gay after crushing hard on Mike (Finn Wolfhard). It turns out Will’s identity isn’t merely a footnote on his character sheet, but actually ends up playing a pretty major part in the show’s supernatural horror elements. Now, after years of keeping the truth to himself, Will has finally told all his friends and a few acquaintances who were just kinda around that he is a card-carrying boy liker, and the final scene has received a pretty…mixed response.</span></p> <p><span>So let’s break it down. Will, who has a psychic connection with series big bad Vecna, is in his feelings after finding out the monster has been using him as a spy since he returned from the&nbsp; Upside Down in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ first season. He also learns that his connection to this other world created the Upside Down tunnel system that formed underneath Hawkins National Laboratory in season 2, which “infected” the real world and led to the deaths of many innocent people.</span></p>

 <p><span>Later in the episode, he tells his mother about Vecna’s hostile takeover of his mind, and says that the villain sees “everything,” knowing his secrets and preying on his fears. So in order to beat Vecna, Will says he needs to give him one less secret to wield, and wants his friends and family to know the truth.</span></p>

 <p><span>Will sits down with a dozen people of varying importance to him and gives, well, a pretty straightforward coming-out confession of the sort that you’d expect from just about any well-meaning show from the early 2000s. He goes on about how he and all his friends are still the same except for one little detail: “I don’t like girls.” He says that he had a crush on someone he knew wouldn’t like him back, and that Vecna showed him a manufactured future in which this came between him and his friends, not because of bigotry, but because their overbearing worry for him makes him feel othered to the point of pushing them away.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As Will starts to cry, his mother and friends, one by one, promise that they’re not going anywhere and then give him a big group hug. It’s sweet, but maybe a bit overwrought for modern sensibilities? There’s a lot to unpack about this moment and how it may or may not land.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so fucking absurd I can’t <a href="https://t.co/XkOJQEhjkL">pic.twitter.com/XkOJQEhjkL</a></p> <p>— َ (@janehopz) <a href="https://twitter.com/janehopz/status/2004430176176984386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>For some, there’s just some absurdity to seeing most of the cast of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>lined up to listen to Will tell everyone he has a crush on another friend in the room, and it also doesn’t help that much of the cast is just not reacting much at all to the revelation. But I don’t think that the silliness of the scene is the only issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>By 2025, it feels like some queer people may have become a bit jaded toward the traditional coming-out story. It’s certainly still a universal part of queer experience, but when it’s often the only lens through which mainstream media views the queer experience, a young twink tearfully telling his bros he’s “still the same” as he always was probably isn’t going to land with queer viewers the way it once would have. On the contrary, some queer people don’t find comfort in stories where a gay character only finds solidarity if they focus on how they are the “same” as their cishet friends. I’d rather see stories about that support not being given under the condition of what makes me similar to others, when it should be offered regardless.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the case of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, I think I’m willing to offer it some grace because it is ultimately an ‘80s period piece, and even though the Stonewall Riots happened nearly 20 years prior, there was still a lot of work to be done in 1987. So if 16-year-old Will has no other framework to communicate his truth to his friends in the late ‘80s, fair enough. Especially if there are still young people living in small towns like Hawkins who are watching shows like </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> and still at that stage in their lives.</span></p> <p><span>That said, the ‘80s setting does have some fans wondering where the hell this universal acceptance is coming from. Yeah, you could argue the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>gang has been through so much that they don’t have time for homophobia, but when has an apocalypse ever been enough to make a bigot admit to the error of their ways? I don’t know, it’s an awkward line to walk when you’re including queer characters in your story. If you show a completely accepting universe, you run the risk of coming off as inauthentic, but if you portray the reality of the queer experience, you will inevitably have the most online armchair consultant calling your work a moral failing to the gays you hope to represent.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After nearly 20 years of operation, digital video game storefront GOG is no longer a part of <em>Witcher 3 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt Red. It is now fully owned by one of CDPR’s co-founders who also helped launch GOG.</p> <p>On December 29, <a href="https://www.gog.com/pressroom/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/">CDPR announced via a press release</a> that its Steam-like storefront, GOG, has been fully acquired by CDPR co-founder Michał Kiciński. As part of the deal, Kiciński now owns 100 percent of GOG’s shares after purchasing them for 90 million PLN or about 25 million USD. The deal didn’t involve the co-founder selling any of his shares in CDPR.</p> <p>“GOG and Michał Kiciński are aligned by a shared belief that games should live forever,”&nbsp;said GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski.&nbsp;“In a market that’s getting more crowded, more locked-in, and forgets classic games at an increasing pace, we’re doubling down on what only GOG does: reviving classics, keeping them playable on modern PCs, and helping great games find their audience over time.”</p>

 <p>Launched in October 2008, GOG (originally known as Good Old Games) was started as a place for retro games to be sold by various publishers and developers. The store offers titles with no DRM and has since expanded greatly, selling new and old games while also <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">starting an ambitious preservation program</a> to help keep dated games running on modern hardware without publisher support.</p>

 <p>As to why CDPR is selling GOG now, joint CEO Michał Nowakowski says the company has an “<em>ambitious development roadmap”</em> and plans to expand the studio’s franchises, so it made sense to split GOG off and let CDRP focus on its own projects.</p>

 <p>“For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes,<em>“</em> said Nowakowski.</p>

 <p>While CDPR will no longer own GOG, it confirmed plans to continue to release its new games on the digital storefront. So, at least for now, it seems like nothing will be changing for players as GOG goes fully independent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="546">The trend of most software companies in the last decade has been to switch operations over to a subscription-based model, where you pay monthly for access to the latest features and updates. Microsoft, for example, offers its Office suite through Microsoft 365, which requires an ongoing monthly payment. While this model keeps you up to date with the newest software and app updates, it also means you’re committing to paying for it forever. There’s something much more appealing to just paying for a thing once and then owning it, which is why this Microsoft Office deal is very exciting. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6602/">For a limited time, StackSocial is offering Microsoft Office 2024 Home for both Windows and Mac at a significant discount—up to 40% off.</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="546">The offer includes doesn’t include the full Microsoft Office suite, just the big three. That’s Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can get the 2024 versions of this software for just $120 for a limited time. That’s down 20% from $150, saving your $30. If you really need Outlook as well, perhaps operating a small business out of home and are looking for alternatives to Gmail, then you can get the Home &amp; Business bundle which adds on Outlook to the other three. That package is 40% off which brings it from $250 to just $150.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6602/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2 data-start="548" data-end="585"><strong data-start="548" data-end="585">One-Time Payment, Lifetime Access</strong></h2>
<p data-start="1500" data-end="1745">This is the 2024 suite for Microsoft Office applications. They come with a lot of helpful features unique to 2024 and later versions. PowerPoint for instance now lets user record presentations from within the app. You can record voice, video, and closed captions. This is wonderful for teachers uploading courses for online classes as well as really any business presentation that’d be helpful to be able to reference back to later again and again.</p>


<p data-start="1747" data-end="2244">Once you purchase the software, you can immediately download and install it. After completing your order, you will receive an email with your software license keys and download links. The license is tied to your Microsoft Account—not your actual device—and is a one-time use code. Be sure to redeem your software within seven days of purchase, as all sales are final once the license is activated. Unredeemed licenses can be returned within seven days for a refund.</p>
<p data-start="2246" data-end="2621">If you’re setting up a new laptop or desktop and want to avoid the hassle of monthly fees, this is what you want over Microsoft 365. For just $120, you can get lifetime access to the 2024 versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can add in Outlook for just $30 more. The deal is available to both Windows and Mac users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you really liked the recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">this year’s <em>Silent Hill f</em></a> and are still craving more foggy survival horror, well, I’ve got some good news for you. Konami has no plans to slow down now and wants to release at least one game a year in the series moving forward. Nothing bad ever happens when a franchise becomes annual, right?</p> <p>In a recent interview with <em><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923">Famitsu</a>,</em> <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/japanese-game-creators-discuss-2026-ambitions">as translated by <em>Gematsu</em></a>, Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto talked about the franchise’s current state and claimed that after releasing two critically acclaimed best-selling <em>Silent Hill</em> games in the last two years, the franchise is “back on track.” And it now sounds like we’ll be returning to the foggy streets of Silent Hill about once a year, assuming everything goes to plan.</p>

 <p>“Including both announced and unannounced [<em>Silent Hill</em> games], we’re aiming for a release pace of about one title per year,” Okamoto told <em>Famitsu</em> in its end-of-the-year issue. “I’m not sure how much of that we’ll be able to realize, but I’ll continue to do my best as producer of the <em>Silent Hill</em> series. Ideally, we’d like to keep excitement around the <em>Silent Hill</em> series going at all times. We’re working hard to share new updates, so I’d appreciate it if you could wait just a little longer.”</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">Before the excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake in October 2024</a>, the survival horror franchise had fallen into disrepair, with very few new entries, and the few games that did arrive were generally disappointing. Remember 2023’s <em>Silent Hill Accession</em>, that interactive livestream…thing? Bleh. And before that, the last real <em>Silent Hill</em> game we got was <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-downpour-made-you-the-monster-1832640116">2012’s <em>Downpour</em></a>, a forgettable and bland horror game that basically put the series on ice for a decade.</p>

 <p>Now, in 2025 and after two great games,<em> Silent Hill</em> is in a great place, and while I’m nervous about it becoming an annual franchise, I think <em>Silent Hill 2</em> and <em>f</em> show a path forward that could make this work. If different studios are brought in and allowed to play around with the franchise’s past as well as take it in new directions, we might be in for a golden age of <em>Silent Hill</em> games. And that seems to be Konami’s plan, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-remake-2-f-bloober-team-cronos-2000630590">with a <em>Silent Hill 1</em> remake</a> in development as well as <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202">a mysterious project, <em>Townfall.</em></a> Or maybe the franchise is about to fly off the rails again.</p>
