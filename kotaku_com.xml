              <p>A holiday splurge is a good thing. A holiday splurge also does not mean paying full price for a bit of indulgence. That’s why we’re giving a hearty thumbs up to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">this Amazon deal that cuts 35% off the price of the truly jawdropping Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monito</a>r, a 57-inch giant with 4K UHD resolution and elite-level speed and refresh rate. The Odyssey Neo G9 is one of the absolute best gaming monitors available anywhere, and with this $800+ price plunge, it can and should be your 2025 holiday splurge at just $1,500.</p>
<p>Samsung’s established itself as the best monitor brand in the U.S., earning that title and best gaming monitor brand in the U.S. for two years running. The Odyssey Neo G9 is the best evidence of why — it’s truly huge, and the curved effect and flawless performance create one of the most immersive gaming experiences ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The World’s First Dual UHD Monitor</h2>
<p>Talk about unique — the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is the first dual UHD monitor ever. The 57-inch display is as wide as two UHD monitors and brings every bit of the mindblowing detail and sharpness across the entire field of view. The action literally wraps around you as you play, giving you as deeply immersive an experience as you can get without using VR goggles.</p>
<p>The 240Hz refresh rate is a lock-solid lag killer, and the 1ms response time ensures that you are on top of your game, every time, with every move. This is the kind of speed that pro gamers use in competition, but at a far smaller price during this Amazon deal. The Odyssey Neo G9 also supports DisplayPort 2.1 for the latest and best connection.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro technology is built into the monitor to create absolute sync between the Odyssey Neo G9 and the graphics processor of your console or PC, eliminating stutter, tearing, and other game-killing flaws.</p>



<h2>Outrageous Detail</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Quantum Matrix Technology with Quantum Mini LEDs creates some of the best brightness and contrast of any monitor anywhere. There are 2,392 separate dimming zones across the massive screen that combined with outstanding 12-bit black levels to create astoundingly accurate picture quality. The contrast ratio of 1 million to 1, spread over 57 inches of gaming space, will make you unbeatable.</p>
<p>The CoreSync and Core Lighting Plus won’t enhance your gaming, but they will greatly enhance your gaming space and save you the cost of buying gaming lights separately. The CoreSync tech projects your on-screen colors into the room behind you, with the gaming action and the lighting effects in perfect sync.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor — 57 inches of brilliant 4K UHD resolution and blazing speed and refresh rate — is a truly elite device that’s just come way, way down from its elite price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">It’s $800 off at Amazon right now, but only for a limited time, so don’t miss out on your chance to splurge on yourself.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378</link>
            <guid>1376185</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth and final season</span></a><span> is rolling out on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875"><span>Netflix</span></a><span>, and it’s true, something certainly seems stranger than in previous seasons this time around. Viewers of the long-running supernatural coming-of-age drama are arguing that the show’s writing has taken a massive nosedive, and even as someone who isn’t actively watching the series, I feel like some of the clips popping up on my social media feeds are not flattering. Fans think a Netflix initiative might be to blame.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, these two clips of Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard delivering extremely simple, flavorless dialogue with a seriousness and gravitas the language doesn’t earn. Some folks attribute the awkwardness of these scenes to the actors’ performances, but others point out that it’s not just the self-serious delivery that’s the problem; it’s that it’s mixed with dialogue so straightforward that it reads like a mandated plot summary for those who haven’t been paying attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>This dumbing down of dialogue is just one part of the issue; some are also criticizing the uptick in obnoxious quip-driven writing. Some fans are quick to point out that teenagers might believably say cheesy stuff like the kids do in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, however, so that’s more of an ongoing debate. The pushback hasn’t stopped people from making parodies of the latest season, likening its banter to cringe TikTok speak or MCUisms.</span></p>

         <p><span>Fans have a theory that this decline in writing quality may have come from a Netflix mandate. In January, </span><a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/"><i><span>N+1</span></i></a> <span>ran a story that detailed initiatives within the streaming company which told creatives to essentially treat the service’s original programming as if viewers are going to be on their phones scrolling through social media as they watch it. This means dialogue is dumbed down, basic plot points are repeated unnaturally in spoken exchanges, and ideally someone can follow what’s going on, even if the show doesn’t have their undivided attention.</span></p> <p><span>It’s a real shame that </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>might be falling into this trap in its final season, as fans have been waiting nearly a decade for this show to wrap up. Hopefully, the second set of episodes and the eventual finale will fare better when they’re released on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Also, let’s hope that this doesn’t end up bleeding into all of the upcoming Warner Bros. projects if Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><span>merger goes through</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dell-laptop-used-to-cost-several-times-more-than-a-macbook-now-its-70-off-and-cheaper-than-one-2000651216</link>
            <guid>1376140</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell makes some of our favorite laptops out there, and if you’re a student or a work professional looking to grab a solid option without shelling out big bucks, Amazon is making that possible today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/">The 15-inch Dell Inspiron laptop, which typically sits at a not-so-friendly price of $2,400, is sitting at just $760 at the retailer, after a massive 68% discount – the lowest we have seen it drop to in 30 days.</a> You’re even getting a whole bunch of useful accessories, plus Windows 11 Pro pre-installed with your purchase, for absolutely nothing to sweeten the deal even more. We’re expecting it to be a popular pick this holiday season, so you might want to grab it before the stock starts thinning out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Memory, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>For under $800, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen that delivers vibrant, immersive, true-to-life visuals consistently, whether you’re catching up on the latest episode of your favorite show or creating a work presentation. The anti-glare panel helps you fight reflections in brighter settings, while the Dell ComfortView software actively reduces harmful blue light to minimize eye strain during those all-nighters. Touch support makes navigation a breeze by letting you use just your fingers to pinch, scroll, swipe, zoom, and more directly on the screen. It comes in handy when you’re working through longer documents and don’t want to rely on the trackpad or the mouse to scroll, or when sharing the laptop with a friend and both of you need to access the screen or work on something together. Note that the screen does not fold all the way back as it does in 2-in-1 laptops, so this doesn’t exactly give you that tablet-like functionality.</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard that features a lift hinge design to keep your wrists comfortable while typing. Video calls are made easy with the built-in HD webcam that offers noise reduction for a clearer picture, even in low-light settings.</p>



<p>For power, Dell offers an Intel 13th Gen Core i5-1334U processor with 10 cores, 12 threads, and intelligent boost speeds up to 4.6 GHz. It’s more than capable of handling all your everyday work and play tasks, plus some resource-intensive creative projects with ease. The massive <strong>32GB of DDR4 RAM</strong> keeps the system running fast and smoothly, even when you’re trying to do multiple jobs at the same time. It’s excellent for demanding tasks like 4K video editing, running virtual machines, and even gaming with some apps running in the background.</p>
<p>Creatives and work professionals will also appreciate the<strong> 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD</strong> that not just offers sufficient space to house all your data, but also ensures better boot times, quick file access, and faster file transfers. Basically, the processor, memory, and SSD come together to ensure a lag-free, smooth experience during both regular and demanding days. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with the ultra-fast WiFi 6, Bluetooth, plus a wide range of ports like USB-C, USB 3.2, HDMI, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p><strong>The freebies include Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a mouse, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, a 128GB UFD, and a docking station</strong>. That’s everything you need to get started with work or play right away. Just note that drops this massive are only around for a short period of time before the stock runs out or the deal expires. If you’ve been after a reliable laptop that doesn’t blow your budget, this is it.</p>

              <p>We knew Paramount Skydance wanted to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. We knew that they company was pretty pissed when Warner CEO <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">David Zaslav turned down the offer for $20 a share for the entire company</a>. And we knew that this became a fury when <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix and Warner agreed to a deal at $27.5 per share last week</a>. Now Paramount has reacted, and reacted&nbsp;<em>big</em>. The company has launched a hostile takeover bid, swooping in with a $30 per share offer, which works out to over $108 billion, $25 billion more than Netflix is paying.</p> <p>It was rumored earlier this year, while Zaslav was making it clear how much he wanted to sell Warner Discovery, that he was looking for $30 per share—a <em>massive</em> over-valuation of the company, but one he was looking to justify <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">by splitting the company</a>, severing off the “Discovery” parts and its loss-making cable networks, and loading that doomed company with all of Warner’s debts. Paramount’s opening bid at $20, however, was for the whole shebang. Netflix, however, outbid everyone by agreeing to $27.5 per share&nbsp;<em>after</em> the split, which is due to happen in the second half of 2026.</p>

 <p>Now, Paramount is going hard in its efforts to prevent this, increasing its previous offer by an enormous 50 percent, and again for the whole company and all its debt. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj69xzpzrdyo"><em>BBC</em> reports that</a> the company, backed by the billionaire Ellison family, called this bid a “superior alternative,” and clearly one designed to make shareholders revolt if Warner sticks with Netflix’s lower offer.</p>

 <p>This was never likely to go smoothly. If the Netflix deal goes through, it would make the streamer one of the most powerful players in Hollywood, and with the absorption of HBO Max an even more dominant force in streaming. Regulators were absolutely going to be scrutinizing this, and in a time when such bodies are now fully under the control of president Donald Trump’s mercurial (and self-interested) whims, that could go in any direction. Things were looking positive for Netflix in this regard, after its CEO Ted Sarandos had recently been to the Oval Office, likely to play on the president’s infantile habit of agreeing with the last confident voice that spoke to him. However, Sunday night Trump gave hints that he was going to be a wrench in the works, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-netflix-warner-bros-merger-problem-f3e317b61899d34ce507ba38af4a2934">saying the deal “could be a problem.”</a></p>

 <p>It’s also worth noting that the recent Paramount and Skydance merger only took place after the company, er, “settled” a legal dispute with Trump <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-1236465383/">by giving him $16 million</a>.</p> <p>Paramount’s offer would work out to $108.4 billion for the whole company, including its cable networks, dwarfing Netflix’s post-debt removal offer of $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t worth close to either figure—optimistically valued at around $10 a share six months ago, and Paramount itself is only worth $11 billion in its own right. Larry Ellison, who backs the company, is said to be worth nearly $270 billion, so could certainly afford it, but it’d still be the most extraordinary outlay were there to be no external investors involved. As more details come to light from <em>Axios</em> reporter Sara Fischer, it seems that—inevitably—a lot of the money will come from wealth funds including Saudi Arabia’s, Qatar’s and the UAE’s, among others.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨🚨 WOW. Paramount's initial press statement didn't include a mention of sov wealth funds, but sep SEC filing said other outside financing partners include funds from Saudis, Qataris, Emirates as well as Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners (!)<br>Those funders, "have agreed to forgo… <a href="https://t.co/5kkhRQWHx4">https://t.co/5kkhRQWHx4</a></p> <p>— Sara Fischer (@sarafischer) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1998042711698378973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>‘ Lauren Hirsch further details the figures, stating that $24 billion of the total will be sourced this way, with a further billion from Tencent, and then a bunch from RedBird Capital Partners and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners. Kushner’s involvement could explain Trump’s intervention over the weekend.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paramount’s bid for WBD is backed in part by <br>– $24bn from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds <br>– $1bn from China’s Tencent<br>– Jared Kushner’s private equity firm <a href="https://t.co/Kdt94WevPc">pic.twitter.com/Kdt94WevPc</a></p> <p>— Lauren Hirsch (@LaurenSHirsch) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenSHirsch/status/1998050914674811068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p>So, there we are, more excitement in the world of billionaires buying up everything to feed us their homogenized sludge.</p> <p><em><strong>Updated: 12/08/2025, 11:17 a.m. ET:</strong> Updated the post to add details about Paramount’s potential investors in the deal.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[TP-Link Deco WiFi 7 Mesh System (3-Pack) Falls to an All-Time Low, Cheaper Than Budget WiFi 6 Routers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-deco-wifi-7-mesh-system-3-pack-falls-to-an-all-time-low-cheaper-than-budget-wifi-6-routers-2000651219</link>
            <guid>1376095</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re paying for high-speed internet but dealing with dead zones and slow performance in certain areas of your house, your router could be the culprit. An easy solution to actually enjoy the performance promised by your ISP is by investing in a solid mesh system. It works by using the interconnected devices to create a strong network that delivers consistent signals across your entire place.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick one up, as<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/"> Amazon is currently offering a sweet 29% discount on the TP-Link Deco BE23 dual-band WiFi 7 mesh system (3-pack), which brings its price down to $178.</a> You can also enjoy free shipping on your purchase if you grab it quick, but the deal is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag these savings. It’s better to act sooner rather than later if you want to score the discount before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage Throughout the House</h2>
<p>Deco BE23 uses Wi-Fi 7 technology, paired with Multi-Link Operation (MLO), Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM to deliver full speeds of up to 2882 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band with 4 streams. The 3-pack bundle blankets up to 6,500 sq. ft, while the 4x high-gain antennas per node and 4x high-power FEMs push more reliable signals across your home. You can connect up to 150 devices at the same time without compromising on the speeds. Translation? The mesh system is more than capable of delivering the signals you’re paying for in every room and corner around the house – think under the stairs, in the closet, near the balcony, etc. Everyone in the house can connect all their devices, from laptops to smartphones, PC, consoles, tablets, TVs, and more, which is especially great for remote workers and creatives who rely on a bunch of different devices to get through their days. You also won’t have to sit right next to the router to catch signals; the mesh system offers the same performance all around.</p>



<p>Those who need even better performance when working on an important task or gaming with friends can make use of the two 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN ports that come built right into each Deco unit. This lets you create a multi-gig pipeline from the internet to your devices. Best of all, the system uses AI-Roaming technology to deliver optimal speeds. It continuously adapts through advanced algorithms and learns your patterns over time as you move around. The system also plays nicely with a range of providers, but you might need to purchase a modem to get started. It’s backward compatible with all WiFi generations, so can fit into any existing system nicely.</p>
<p>TP-Link takes security seriously, as the Decos are designed, built, and maintained with advanced security as a core requirement. TP-Link HomeShield offers home network protection, plus access to handy parental controls for a safer internet experience. VPN clients and servers are supported, making it easy to access remote VPN servers without installing VPN software on each device. Setting everything up is quite straightforward, even if it’s your first time putting a mesh system up. It should be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re done dealing with painfully slow speeds and terrible coverage of your router, now is a great time to upgrade the internet situation in your home. This deal lets you do it without shelling out big bucks.</p>

<h2>Bold Sound In a Minimal Design</h2>
<p>Bose has paid attention to the looks with this one. The anodized aluminum paired with a high-quality fabric grille gives off a premium look, while the overall minimal design makes it easy for the speaker to blend into any setup without drawing too much attention to itself.

<p>Advanced Bluetooth 5.3 offers solid connection stability and reduced latency. For instance, when the speaker is paired with your phone, you’ll be able to roam around the house comfortably without worrying about audio dropouts, even when things get crowded. Reliability comes from its 9 hours of battery life, which keeps the good vibes going all night long. Best of all, it supports wired connection, too, so you can plug your device in using a USB-C cord when it’s running low; no need to pause the music. There’s also a microphone built right in, which makes it easy to take quick calls right from the speaker or access voice assistants like Alexa.</p>
<p>The sound this speaker delivers is solid on its own, but you can also pair two of these together for a bigger setup, which can be great for entertaining a larger crowd. Linking them together hardly takes a few seconds, and you don’t even need an app to do it.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this minimal, no-fuss, but efficient speaker. It’s now down to $179, which is still a bit of an investment, but definitely one that’s going to be worth it. To recap, this speaker offers clear sound, deep bass (even at higher volumes), an exceptional battery life, as well as plug-and-play functionality when needed. Place it anywhere you like, and get the part started. We highly recommend grabbing it quick, before the price goes back up to $219.</p>
