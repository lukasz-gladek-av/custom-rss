            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update is live, and lapsed players are rushing back to their near-abandoned islands. The update is technically two parts—the free part, which everyone will get, and the paid part, which is only for Nintendo Switch 2 players. Most of the content is tied to the free update, like Kapp’n’s seaside hotel which has been constructed on island piers. For existing owners, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade is $4.99; Nintendo says it’s got an “enhanced resolution,” as well as mouse control support and larger multiplayer sessions.</span></p> <p><span>Though Kapp’n’s hotel is the big, main content piece of the big 3.0 patch, there’s a lot of little details to love in both the free and paid updates.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000658997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658997"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658997">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><span>You can decorate two rooms per day at Kapp’n’s hotel</span></h2> <p><span>Isabelle will announce that the hotel is open, so head right down to the pier to check it out. Kapp’n and Tom Nook will be inside to give you the rundown on what’s going on. Basically, the hotel is already entirely built, but they’re looking for someone to help Kapp’n’s wife, Leilani, decorate the rooms. You’ll be prompted to decorate a room, and Leilani will walk you through it. She wants it to be themed, but you don’t </span><i><span>have</span></i><span> to follow that. You’ll get 200 tickets for doing so! You’ll continue to get prompted for a couple days to decorate rooms and help out with unlocking other features around the hotel.</span></p>

 <p><span>But, at max, you’re only able to decorate two rooms per day. Once you decorate a room, tourists will start showing up. You can keep helping with the hotel, though, by taking on tasks at a DIY requests stand on the pier, which will be unlocked as you proceed.</span></p>

 <h2><span>Tourists will roam your island</span></h2> <p><span>The animals that show up to rent the rooms on your island can be found wandering around, exploring the sights. They’ll interact with your residents, but can’t be asked to move onto your island, like with the campsite.</span></p> <h2><span>You can decorate your pier</span></h2> <p><span>All of the wooden parts of the hotel pier can be decorated as you please. It’s not a ton of room, but it’s enough to bring in some extra flair. It works exactly the same way as decorating anywhere else, but you’ve got to work around some of the permanent fixtures.</span></p>

 <p><span>The hotel’s facade can’t be customized, but it is decorated seasonally, it seems—there’s snow on the roof in winter, and an adorable little snowman outside.</span></p> <h2><span>Save up your bells for Resetti’s pricey service</span></h2> <p><span>Resetti will be wandering around your island when you update to 3.0. He’s able to quickly reset portions of your island, but it’ll cost you 60,000 bells per day. The good news is that it’s </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> 60,000 bells per portion of land—it’s a daily rate, so you can keep calling Resetti back for an entire 24 hours at no extra cost.</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, the first use of the service is free, so you’ll have time to save up if you want to give it a try but can’t afford his hefty fee. Here’s how it works: You first go tell Isabelle you want to use the service, and Resetti will be wandering your island. He’ll give you three options: to reset either the whole island, your beaches, or specific areas. If you choose the third option, you can go and choose the area and summon him.</span></p>

 <h2><span>New movement actions make decorating and terraforming more precise</span></h2> <p><span>This is a super small detail, but makes a huge difference. There are new movement options in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>. It’s easy: You just need to tap and hold the L button to move precisely in different directions. Basically, it’s movement on a grid—up, down, left, and right. When you press the L button and don’t hold it down, you can do a little, cute jump.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is particularly exciting for me, because it drives me crazy to be trying to dig up something and accidentally dig the wrong area. By being able to make precise movements, I can more easily position myself in the correct spot. It’ll help with placing items in the world, too, I think.</span></p> <h2><span>Craft without having resources in your pockets</span></h2> <p><span>Empty the sticks and rocks out of your pockets, because crafting now pulls from your home inventory! If you </span><i><span>do</span></i><span> have materials in your pockets, crafting will use those first, then move to home storage. You can do this from any crafting bench on your island, but it won’t work if you’re crafting on someone else’s island.</span></p> <h2><span>Bulk crafting limited to 10 items</span></h2> <p><span>Crafting that pulls from home storage is particularly helpful now that bulk crafting is a thing. However, bulk crafting is limited to making 10 of a certain item at once—no more than that. Ten is still a lot, and will certainly make life easier for people who are furiously crafting.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435</link>
            <guid>1407187</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/that-s-a-wrap-on-backlog-month-1846849615">We’ve written a lot about backlogs on this site.</a> Those long lists of games we want to play or finally get around to finishing. I have a backlog. It’s very big. It’s scary to think about. And I also recently realized, after returning to <em>Diablo 4</em>, that in 2026, a backlog is becoming an outdated concept as forever games take over the industry and live-service titles get killed, making it harder and harder to actually finish a game, cross it off your list, and walk away.</p> <p>For decades, competitive multiplayer games have existed, and the concept of a game that can’t be “finished” has been around for about as long as games themselves. But when I talk about the games that undermine the very concept of a backlog, I’m not talking about online-only PVP titles like<em> Arc Raiders</em> or <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. I’m instead talking about the growing list of live-service games, many of which can be played solo, that have campaigns with “endings” but also keep growing, that are all fighting for your attention and receiving an endless wave of updates and expansions.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">I finished <em>Diablo 4</em> in 2023</a> and really enjoyed it. With that completion, it was crossed off my backlog. But since then, it has received numerous seasonal updates, adding new content and narrative elements. It has also received an expansion and <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4s-second-expansion-adds-new-classes-and-big-changes-2000652722">is getting another one later this year</a>. I booted the game up last week to check it out again and realized that, well, shit,<em> Diablo 4</em> is <em>back</em> on my backlog. I completed <em>The </em><em>Division</em> <em>2</em>‘s main campaign once upon a time, but since then, it’s expanded into a bigger game with more missions to finish and more story to experience. That one is probably never leaving my backlog, despite me having over 300 hours in it at this point.</p>

 <p>Then there are those live-service games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">like BioWare’s <em>Anthem</em></a>, which I had on my backlog for years, always telling myself I’d get to them and finish up the main story one day. Well, in&nbsp;<em>Anthem</em>‘s case, I waited too long, and now the game is dead, the servers permanently shut down. And while I could just scrub it from my mental backlog of games, I know it will linger around like a ghost. A memory of what I could have done. There are a lot of live-service ghosts hanging out in my mental backlog these days. It’s getting crowded.</p>

 <p>A part of me wonders if the entire concept of backlogs is pointless now. Even single-player games that aren’t technically live-service titles, like Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a>, are often updated with <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644">new features and content</a>. It might just be time to try to build a new backlog in my head and reserve it only for offline single-player experiences that I’m confident won’t be expanded upon or killed in the future.</p>

 <p>At the very least, if I do rebuild my backlog, I’ll have a more manageable one. I mean, it will still be <em>extremely</em> long and nearly impossible to complete. But at least this new list–which will be devoid of live-service titles and “forever games” that, ironically, can go away forever with little warning–won’t be literally impossible to finish. And that’s nice. I guess.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon Looks Gorgeous In New Deep-Dive On Each Character’s Unique Playstyle]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170</link>
            <guid>1407118</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m not one for video game marketing drip-feeds, but everything we’ve <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">seen of <em>Marathon</em></a> since it emerged from its 2025 playtest delay has had me more and more excited. The latest trailer from Bungie provides developer breakdowns of each of the extraction shooter’s classes, and while I have no idea if they’ll be interesting in practice, the footage sure looks cool.</p> <p>“Each Runner shell is built around a different gameplay archetype, such as intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing,” reads a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev-insights-runner-shells-new-video">new blog post</a> from the <em>Destiny 2</em> maker. “With distinct silhouettes, shells allow you to evaluate player threats and strategize your next steps on the fly. Each Runner shell’s playstyle can be customized using the cores, implants, weapons, and mods you bring on your runs.”</p>

 <p>Even before getting into each of the six character classes and their abilities, the new gameplay footage <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-visuals-art-bungie-updated-director-2000655713">has would-be fans impressed</a>. “<span dir="auto" role="text">It is insane how much better this looks than the alpha test,” read one of the top comments on YouTube. “This game looks better than every extraction shooter,” wrote a viewer on X. Whether it actually plays better than every other extraction shooter, including <em>Arc Raiders</em>, will be the big test.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p>There are seven runner shells with the following main abilities:</p> <blockquote>  <ul data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0">Archetype: Combat specialist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="3oeqb-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="3oeqb-0-0">Armed with a personal defense barricade, missile systems, and movement thrusters, Destroyer shells are designed to bring the fight to enemy threats.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="79let-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="79let-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="79let-0-0">Archetype: Shadow agent</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="4t9ge-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="4t9ge-0-0">Synthetic smoke deployment and camouflage technology allow Assassin shells to plan unseen strikes or take cover during hostile engagements.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0">Archetype: Intel specialist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="7rb4a-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="7rb4a-0-0">Recon shells excel at identifying threats and tracking movements using echo pulses, tracker drones, and holographic footstep trails.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0">Archetype: Combat anarchist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="20tdg-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="20tdg-0-0">Vandal shells traverse ground at incredible speeds, using their advanced movement and knockback cannon to disrupt combat.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0">Archetype: Covert acquisitions</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="n6b7-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="n6b7-0-0">With enhanced visors and piloted butterfly drone, Thief shells can locate and acquire loot, then use their grapple to push an advantage or make an escape.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0">Archetype: Field medic</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="fdthu-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="fdthu-0-0">Triage shells help keep themselves and allies alive using deployable healing drones, onboard reboot abilities, and combat buffs.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0">Archetype: Scavenger</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="1f1uu-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="1f1uu-0-0">The Rook frame is designed for scavenger mode, a unique way to play Marathon. As Rook, you’ll drop into a match that’s already in progress as a solo player. You won’t be able to bring a loadout, but you also aren’t risking anything, which makes Rook an excellent option for scavengers.</span></p> </li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Each runner can be outfitted with cores and implants to augment abilities and stats. Cores will be unique to each runner class, while implants can be mix and matched across all types. The idea is that different builds will push runners into unique playstyles. For example, Vandal could equip a triple jump and speed boosts for more mobility, or go with an arm cannon that can be used to launch players into the air and ground-stomp for AOE damage for a more offensive-leaning shell.</p>

 <p>Bungie isn’t ready to spill the beans on how cosmetics will work just yet. Fashion has become a pillar of modern multiplayer shooters, as well as the microtransaction lifeblood that fuels their ongoing development. “We’ll talk about the ways you can customize your shells visually in the future, including more details on the earnable cosmetics you’ll unlock through the Codex and other ways,” the studio wrote today.</p>

 <p>But over 50 apparent early cosmetic shell options for each runner have <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-leak-first-look-55-runner-skins-deluxe-edition/">reportedly already leaked</a> from a recent test build, including some that will be exclusive to the Deluxe Edition. The base version of <em>Marathon</em> is priced at $40 and coming sometime in March 2026. We don’t have the specific release date yet, either. For now, the drip-feed continues.</p>

              <p>I’m having a lovely time playing the early access release of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. But then of course I am: I love playing&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>. So I’m enjoying building a pretty little log cabin, exploring underground caves for precious ores, battling skeletons with a bow and arrows, and travelling far from spawn to visit distant biomes. Because that’s what I do when I play <em>Minecraft</em>. What I’ve yet to figure out is why&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> exists as anything other than a texture pack for Microsoft’s behemoth.</p> <p>There&nbsp;<em>are</em> differences. But when I describe them to you, they’re going to sound so minuscule. For instance, <em>Hytale</em> has a much better jump: you can jump two blocks high, and you can mantle up from four blocks below. I love that. That would make <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/highjump">a good&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em></a><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/highjump"> mod</a>.&nbsp; And there’s the slightly improved combat in which enemies actually block and you need to time your attacks. Then again, I can just add the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smart-mobs">Smart Mobs</a> option to Mojang’s game. And you can <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/realistic-mc-graphics">see where I’m going</a> when I point out that <em>Hytale</em> is a far prettier game with gorgeous sunrises.</p>

 <p>Ten years in the making, and famously cancelled by Riot in the middle of last year <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">before being revived in November</a>, this early access build of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> is unquestionably a really good reimagining of <em>Minecraft. B</em>ut in its current form, as released this week for a minimum of $20, that’s <em>all</em> it is, and I’m left pretty bemused how that can be the case.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660163">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To give you an idea of how peculiarly the two games overlap—even beyond the core concept of a procedurally generated world made of cubes in which you dig, chop, mine and shovel to gather materials for crafting tools, construction materials and decorating items—let’s just look at the mobs. The main ones you’ll encounter at first are skeletons and spiders. Big, chunky spiders that are two blocks wide. It didn’t need to be skeletons and spiders, but it is. Are there zombies? Yes there are zombies. But surely not golems? I’m afraid there are golems. There <em>are</em> other mobs in there, with pillagers replaced by goblins and Outlanders, and villagers swapped out in favor of Ewok-like Kweebecs, as well as the most astonishingly overpowered underground-dwelling giant frogs. But then there’s also a place called the Void which I read contains a Void Dragon. Seriously?</p>

 <p>The other aspect I can imagine an angry person on Reddit bringing up in response to accusations of cloning is crafting. It’s…it’s a lot worse. While it’s true that <em>Minecraft</em> has a fairly broad array of workbenches, for the most part people are using the basic crafting table and then an anvil and enchantment table. Sure, there’s the cartography table, the loom, the stonecutter, but these aren’t exactly core to the game. In <em>Hytale</em>, within the first couple of hours, I had needed to build a Workbench, Furniture Workbench, Blacksmith’s Anvil, Tanning Rack, Armorer’s Workbench, Builder’s Workbench, Furnace, and Campfire. I had to upgrade my main workbench to be able to then build the Chef’s Stove and Salvager’s Workbench, but still haven’t crafted the Alchemist’s Workbench and Arcanist’s Workbench because I don’t have enough gold or thorium. Each is enormous, meaning I’ve twice had to add sizable new wings to my cabin just to fit them all in the same location. It’s bonkers!</p>

 <p>Legitimately great is that if you have chests directly next to workbenches, it’ll recognize their contents when showing what can be constructed. (Less great is the need for a small auditorium to fit all the benches in, and so of course not being able to have them all adjacent to the necessary chests.) This is a huge improvement, and I really appreciate it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660164">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But the more I try to allow <em>Hytale</em> to be its own game in its own right, the more it fights back against that. When you pick up items from the ground, which bob up and down floating in the air, they emit a little “pop” sound, exactly like in <em>Minecraft</em>. Put two one-tile chests next to each other and they’ll ping into one double-width chest. Let alone that you already know what every block type is likely to be, given its visual similarity to the source. And the thing is, it’s necessary! This game both looks and feels so much like <em>Minecraft</em> that any time it does behave differently, it feels wrong.&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> is such an unabashed clone that it’s backed itself into a corner of needing to do everything the same way&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>does. From the nine-box inventory along the bottom of the screen with a space for a shield to the left to how chest inventories appear, it’s just the same designs. It feels like playing the same game, in the same way, with the same goals.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660166" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660166"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660166">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This&nbsp;is supposed to change, when&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> adds its Adventure Mode, which will offer RPG-like storylines and quests to solve, and that sounds great! It’s something I always longed for in the earliest days of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> and that still only exist today through mods, and usually ones that eschew a lot of the core nature of <em>Minecraft</em> to do so. There are hints of this in place, like the Forgotten Temple which will teleport you to a peaceful hub-like area, almost entirely consisting of buildings with “Under Construction” signs over their doors, and a statue which catalogs every mob type you’ve encountered so far. It’s a cute idea, and unlocks more crafting options when you ding specified numbers.</p> <p>Adventure Mode should add in “Alterverses” and bespoke quests and all that good stuff that will make <em>Hytale</em> distinct from the game it’s so wantonly copied. You know, if it happens. Clearly none of us knows what happened over the last five years at Riot, and whether the Hypixel team had developed huge sections of this before Riot pulled the plug, forcing the developers to revert back four-and-a-half years for this early access version. Or perhaps even then the game was so much like a <em>Minecraft</em> texture pack that Riot couldn’t see a way to release it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000660165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660165">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>As I said at the start of this, I’m having a lovely time! There are a whole bunch of balancing issues, but that’s entirely expected at this point. (Those toads, man, with the tongues that grab you. And iron is wildly too rare just now.) But I’m not having as lovely a time as I do when I join my son on his <em>Minecraft</em> Realm, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">goof around on DonutSMP</a>, because, you know, it’s the OG.&nbsp;<em>Minecraft </em>has&nbsp;had 17 years to make itself buttery smooth, balanced to complete perfection, and at the same time old enough to engender nostalgia and comfortable familiarity.&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>is an awful lot prettier (albeit still in pixelly blocks), but right now it’s in no important way <em>better</em>. I mean, the jumping and mantling is great! But, you know, it needs to offer an awful lot more than that. I’m still left just wondering&nbsp;<em>why</em>? Why fight so, so hard to make the same game that already exists?</p>

 <p>I’ll happily keep playing it for a little bit, see what the biomes I’ve yet to reach have to offer (the one where everything’s on fire is pretty fun), but I fear that in its current state I won’t be the only one quickly drifting away.</p>
