              <p>It still feels odd to live in a post-<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> reality. The game was ephemeral for so many years that it feels almost crass for it to have been released three months ago. It probably helps that it’s been <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hollow-knight-silksong/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">rapturously received</a>—among <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568">more nuanced criticism</a>—and there’s now more good news: somehow, improbably, Team Cherry is well on its way to releasing a <em>free </em>expansion due in 2026. That accompanies the excellent news that those who bought the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>&nbsp;for Switch will soon be entitled to a free upgrade to a refreshed version for Switch 2.</p> <p>The enigmatically quiet Team Cherry has <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">posted an update to its hilariously infrequently updated blog</a>, detailing the news, but also making clear the small team’s delight at the success of the game’s release. Stating that <strong>over seven million people</strong> have bought the game so far (does quick math, takes off 30 percent for store tithes…that’s $98 million!), Team Cherry says “your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further.”</p>   <p>This leads us to the freshly announced expansion,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Sorrow</em>. There’s a teaser trailer, but don’t expect to get anything from it.</p>

  <p>Well that could have been a text message. <em>Sea of Sorrow</em> will have new areas (seemingly wetter than most), bosses and tools, in an expansion that will be completely free when it releases—Team Cherry claims—next year. But seriously? Anyone believe that? Come on. 2027 at the earliest, <em>for sure</em>. Actual information about the DLC, beyond that it has a nautical setting, will be held until “shortly before” the expansion is out, so expect more self-imposed silence from the developers, and then presumably a reply on the Discord when it slips.</p>

 <p>It’s all good, though! Of course they should take their time. It’s a passion project, no one’s entitled to it by a certain date, and it’s being given away for free. Plus they just made $100,000,000—why is any of them even acknowledging the existence of game development right now?</p>

 <p>Yet, still Team Cherry works, leading to even more generous news that there’s to be a Switch 2 refresh of the original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, and that too will be given to owners of the original Switch version for free! This will add improved framerates, a higher resolution, and a bunch of graphical effects that appeared in&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>. If you want a sneak peak of that updated goodness, you can jump into the beta branches on Steam or GOG, which include 21:9 support for ultrawide sickos.</p> <p>There are claims that there are even more plans for 2026, which are currently secret, but also word that Team Cherry’s games will be on sale across various stores over the holiday season. Given&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> was already only $20, that could mean some proper bargains.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-doesnt-care-about-profit-with-this-72-off-15-6-laptop-bundle-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-even-a-macbook-cant-compete-2000653800</link>

              <p>It’s not every day Amazon lets you pick a highly-rated laptop for less. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your everyday office/study machine but the scary price tags have been holding you back, the retailer is making it incredibly easy to grab one without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6417/">We’re spotting plenty of solid deals across a range of models like HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and more, but one of our favorite offers is the 72% discount on the HP 15.6-inch touchscreen business lapto</a>p. You’re saving a whopping $1,720 on this highly-rated model and getting some useful computer accessories for free, but the deal is only around for today. It wraps up at midnight, so it’s best to bag the drop as soon as you can. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back before New Year’s.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6417/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Vibrant Visuals on the Touchscreen</h2>
<p>In a portable build, you’re getting an impressive 15.6-inch FHD IPS touchscreen that delivers brilliant, sharp visuals. You’ll enjoy vibrant colors and sharp details for all your favorite TV shows and movies, plus be able to read text better. The 178-degree wide viewing angle offers consistent visuals from all sides, while the micro-edge design offers larger screen real estate to work on. Touch support takes the experience a bit further by letting you use your fingers directly on the screen to perform a bunch of tasks. You’d be able to scroll through long documents without relying on the trackpad, swipe through images, browse, sketch, and even type. Note that the screen does not fold all the way back like a 2-in-1, so this thing won’t convert into a tablet for an only-screen experience, but the touch support still comes in handy, especially when you don’t want to bother with the mouse or the keys.</p>



<p>There’s an HD camera right above the display, which is paired with AI noise reduction. Both of these come together to make your video calls better; you will look good, and sound just as great. The battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you up to 9 hours of usage, which means you can go an entire workday without plugging it in. Even better, recharging is just as quick. HP Fast Charge juices your laptop from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes. You can plug it in during lunch break and come back to a machine that’s ready to go.</p>
<p>Power-wise, the laptop features an 8-core Intel Core i3-N305 processor. It works with 16GB of RAM to deliver the performance you need for your everyday tasks, plus some demanding projects. There’s a built-in 1TB SSD that offers plenty of space to store all your important files and documents without feeling limited, plus delivers fast boot/load times.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed. Other freebies include a Redragon patented wireless mouse, an external optical drive, and a screen wipe. Together, these cost around $200, but you’re getting the kit here for absolutely nothing. That said, the discount is only around for a few more hours, and the stock could sell out before the offer ends. Grab it before that happens!</p>
