And that’s cool I guess, but why did they include a very overused  sound effect of kids laughing? And why does it pop up not just once, but <em>twice </em>in the 15-second clip? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106">As announced last February</a></span>, Marvel’s upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766">MCU</a></span> reboot of the Fantastic Four is set to hit theaters this July.

Since that announcement last year, we’ve not seen much else of <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>. But that changed today with a small teaser that also contains a really annoying sound effect. </p><p>On February 3, Marvel teased a trailer because it’s 2025 and that’s just a normal thing we have to deal with now. In the short teaser we see some kids running and laughing as they try to cram themselves in front of an array of TVs in the display window of a 1960's store. The televisions are preparing to show a rocket launch involving Marvel’s famous family. I hope nothing bad happens! We’ll see more in the full trailer tomorrow. </p><p>But instead of enjoying this little teaser for the new <em>Fantastic Four </em>movie, I was distracted immediately by a sound effect I’ve heard oh so many times before. You’ve undoubtedly heard this sound effect, too. It’s a group of kids laughing in a weird, somewhat unnatural way and it’s popped up in games, movies, TV shows, commercials, trailers, and songs. </p><p>This sound effect is known as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Group Kids Laug PE143601</a></span>" and was found on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Premiere Edition Volume 1</a></span> sound effects library produced by Hollywood Edge in 1990. This sound effect, which was originally recorded in 1983 for <em>Indiana Jones and the</em> <em>Temple of Doom</em>, has appeared in a very long list of movies, TV shows, and more since it was added to that sound effect library in the ‘90s. And weirdly, it keeps getting used decades later. Here’s a clip from the Netflix animated show <em>Wonderoos</em> that contains the laughing kids: </p><p>Apparently, this effect (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598">like the Wilhelm Scream</a></span>) has just become a standard option for sound engineers and designers in Hollywood. As someone who instantly recognizes this sound effect the moment it pops up in a movie or game, its continued use in 2025 is annoying. </p><p>And to bring this back to the <em>Fantastic Four</em> teaser, I’m honestly shocked and perplexed that the marketing folks behind it decided to include the effect twice in such a short clip. I’d bet money that in the full movie this sound effect won’t be used twice in such a short timespan (it might not even appear at all) as it’s really distracting and noticeable when it plays back to back like that. </p><p>Anyway, I guess I’ll listen out for this annoying sound effect when<em> Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> arrives in theaters on July 25, 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sequel expands on the first game with a bigger, more detailed world that includes new gameplay systems and a lengthier script. Does all of this extra stuff coalesce into something compelling and meaningful?</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>VGC</em>’s Jordan Middler</a></span>, the larger mix still feels cohesive and intentional in a way the first game’s did not. “This is Warhorse Studios’ <em>Witcher 3</em> moment,” he writes in his five-star review. “<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>is an extremely confident, accomplished, dirty, hilarious, and massively enjoyable RPG. The game tries a lot of things and executes on almost all of them very well, and its commitment to being ruthless must be applauded.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em>’s Katharine Castle</a></span> was similarly impressed but less in love with the finished product. “There’s a lot to admire here, sure, but you have to do so on its own terms,” she writes in her three-out-of-five star review. “It is a hard and maddening slog at times, but one that still has its moments where it surprises and quietly delights. Like the original, this isn’t an RPG designed to make you feel good - you continue to be little more than a passenger in this historical tapestry, following along behind the horse tails of Henry’s betters, and clearing up the mess they leave behind. Some will revel in that work, but I for one won’t be chomping at the bit for another sequel any time soon.”</p><p>Early reviews make <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> sound like its side quests and the way they’re woven together across its big world are a highlight, while combat remains a bit underwhelming, and text-heavy menus make navigating and learning about some of the systems a chore. The lock-picking mini-game is apparently terrible, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/1771300/discussions/0/591760496744510997/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1771300/discussions/0/591760496744510997/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as is saving the game</a></span>, and the beginning  seems hellbent on making players struggle to overcome even the simplest challenges.

And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it’s not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn’t get in the way of the other, and you’re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot. I was delighted to get lost in its world, and it will be a long time before I forget its exceptional story. </p></blockquote><h2 id="h22559"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> While Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 still stumbles in some aspects of its portrayal of 15th-century Bohemia, the shadow that lingered over the first game has mostly dissipated. This is a massively improved sequel in every other area, with better combat, quest design, and none of the technical issues that plagued the original. Not everyone will vibe with its slow-paced and oftentimes tedious approach, but those willing to meet it on its own terms will find a compelling open-world RPG that relishes in player agency and the consequences of your actions.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h22560"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>While a few failures trigger a “game over”, many produce scenarios as winding and gratifying as any victory, and in any case, living life in Henry’s shoes has taught me to take the rain with the shine. In particular, I never wanted to simply overpower people the way blockbuster games teach you to, and Deliverance 2 met me halfway, initially, by having characters dunk on me when I tried to act the tough guy, or applaud me for being a good sport when I got my arse kicked. But after a series of mandatory plot skirmishes, my Henry has become a proficient and well-appointed combatant, because that is what KCD2 fundamentally requires him to be. It’s as though the game had assumed the role of that servant girl from my intro: it won’t let me get on with my day unless I consent to my own greatness.﻿<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h22561"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-pc/#:~:text=From%20its%20memorable%20cast%20of,that%20you%20shouldn't%20miss.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-pc/#:~:text=From%20its%20memorable%20cast%20of,that%20you%20shouldn't%20miss." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Trends</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The branching dialogue options and reputation system make for some engrossing moments. At certain points, I’m given the option to respond using the key tenets of Persuasion, Coercion, Domination, and others. This isn’t just determined by a rudimentary point value system from leveling up skills and perks. Rather, it relies on several factors, such as my standing within a community and even the dirt or blood on my clothing. After all, you probably won’t convince merchants that you’re a member of the nobility if you look like a vagabond, just as how you might not be able to intimidate the guards if you look like a total pushover. </p></blockquote><h2 id="h22562"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is, in almost every way, the RPG that so many fans have been asking for. With Baldur’s Gate 3 taking the world by storm, amidst so many other RPGs that widely missed the mark, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 presents a colossal, in-depth, beautiful, masterfully designed game right at the start of 2025. The performances are excellent, it’s a major technical step up, and evolves the game beyond its foundation into something that embraces modern audiences without losing its identity. The original game turned away many due to its slow-paced, tedious aspects and technical shortcomings, and while the sequel exceeds on a technical level by far, the biggest shame will be if people still give it a miss because of the almost simulator-like mechanics.﻿</p></blockquote><h2 id="h22563"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>WindowsCentral</em></a></span><br></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Given that I was a big fan of the original title, I went into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 expecting to greatly enjoy the follow-up, too. Even so, I was thoroughly surprised by how <em>perfect </em>of a sequel it is, with Warhorse building on everything fans loved about KCD while simultaneously fixing its major story, combat, and performance issues. Between the immersive reactivity of its huge open world, countless varied quests to fill up your journal with, its engaging well-balanced combat, a gripping story, and immaculate presentation, it’s got everything a Kingdom Come fan could want and more. </p></blockquote><h2 id="h22564"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Looking for a sweeping fantasy romp? You won’t find one. Like its predecessor, this is a game whose story springs inevitably from the politics of its time and place: the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1403. Want to mow down your foes by the dozen? Good luck. Combat is a strange dance of positioning both your hands and feet relative to those of your enemies, and charging into the fray even in the late game is liable to get you cut apart. Want to equip a hauberk without first equipping a padded gambeson beneath it? What are you—some kind of moron?﻿</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But we can tell you how long it takes to beat <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>.</p><p><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> is no breezy platformer. Even in its easier Modern Mode—which grants you an extra heart and gives Cranky’s shop some additional items—this Kong adventure serves up some truly tough challenges to overcome. With that being said, dying is nearly inevitable for all but the most hardened platforming masters, so an average playthrough of the main story can take anywhere from <strong>10-15 hours </strong>depending on your skill.</p><p>Of course, completionists can expect to spend significantly more time with <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> thanks to the return of the franchise’s K-O-N-G letter collectibles. These offer tons of hidden puzzle pieces, and time trials for every level. Moreover, fully completing the game one time will unlock Mirror Mode, which tasks you with replaying flipped versions of every level. Seeing all of this through can take between <strong>25-35 hours</strong>—again, depending on your skill.</p><p>Now that you know how long it’ll take to tackle <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, go bananas and have a great time! <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
