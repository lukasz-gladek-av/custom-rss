              <p>For decades, TV speakers have disappointed viewers with thin and muddy audio failing to live up to the visual quality of modern displays. Soundbars solve that problem by fitting proper speakers and amplification into a sleek package that fits beneath your TV without taking up space and adding the complexity of full surround sound systems.</p>
<p>The Bose smart Dolby Atmos soundbar brings premium audio technology from one of the most respected names in sound, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/">and Amazon just dropped its price to an all-time low of $399 from the standard $499 tag</a>. It puts a Bose soundbar with top-notch features at the same price point as generic mid-range soundbars without the brand reputation or expert audio engineering that Bose brings.</p>

<h2>Immersive Sound Technology</h2>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos adds a third dimension of height channels</strong> to the traditional surround format, with the ability to place audio objects in space with pinpoint accuracy around and above you, rather than just from the left and right. It’s a spatial audio technology that makes movie soundtracks feel far more realistic, placing the sounds of helicopters passing overhead or rain falling from above in the correct places. To pull off this trick, the Bose soundbar features an acoustic architecture that somehow manages to shoehorn five separate transducers into its compact frame, including two upward-firing speakers that reflect sound off your ceiling to create the illusion of height channels.</p>
<p>TrueSpace technology denotes proprietary Bose processing that works beyond Dolby Atmos content. This intelligent system analyzes whatever audio signal you feed it, be it standard stereo music, older 5.1 surround soundtracks, or streaming content without spatial encoding. The <strong>processing upmixes those conventional formats to create a more enveloping and expansive sound</strong> <strong>experience</strong> from the soundbar’s multi-driver configuration.</p>



<p><em>A.I. Dialogue Mode</em> addresses one of the most common complaints about modern audio mixing: voices getting buried beneath music and effects. This artificial intelligence system continuously monitors the audio stream, and identifies dialogue frequencies and dynamically adjusting the balance to ensure voices remain clear and prominent without completely suppressing the atmospheric sounds that create immersion.</p>



<p>Voice control integration provides hands-free operation thanks to integrated Amazon Alexa functionality. Adjust the volume, change inputs, play music, or even fire up other smart home devices-all are possible with voice commands and no need to pick up a remote. Bose <em>Voice4Video</em> takes it a step further: it allows you to<strong> take control of your TV and either the cable or satellite box through the voice system</strong> of the soundbar, consolidating several devices into one unified voice control interface.</p>
<p>It features just about every major wireless streaming protocol, giving flexibility in the way you send audio to the system. Bluetooth connectivity works with any phone, tablet, or computer for easy wireless streaming. Apple AirPlay 2 offers higher-quality wireless audio for iPhone and Mac users while enabling multi-room audio with other AirPlay speakers. Spotify Connect lets you control playback directly from within the Spotify app with improved stability and quality compared to standard Bluetooth. Chromecast built-in supports casting from thousands of compatible apps on Android devices and computers.</p>
<p>Physical connectivity includes HDMI eARC for easy TV connection and support for all audio formats; optical input is available for older TVs, and USB is for service updates. The HDMI eARC connection carries both standard audio and advanced formats like Dolby Atmos through a single cable while allowing the soundbar to respond to your TV remote’s volume controls.</p>

              <p>Apple never discounts its products directly so third-party retailer deals are especially noteworthy for anyone looking to save on premium hardware. Amazon just kicked off Black Friday pricing for several Apple devices including AirTags, MacBook Air models, and the brand-new Mac Mini with M4 chip. The 2024 Mac Mini is Apple’s more affordable desktop computer, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">and the 256GB model is now available for $499 instead of its usual $599 price</a>. That’s a $100 discount and an all-time low for a machine that’s only been on the market for roughly a year now.</p>

<h2>Desktop Power in a Small Package</h2>
<p>The<strong> M4 is among the latest generations of Apple silicon</strong> and brings impressive boosts in performance from what was a breathtakingly remarkable M2 that powered the last Mac Mini. The processor houses 10 CPU cores-again, a mix of performance and efficiency cores-allowing the system to handle tasks dynamically, depending on their computational demands.</p>
<p>The <strong>GPU here is an integrated 10-core GPU on the same chip as the CPU for all graphical processing</strong>. It does away with discrete graphics cards while still offering high-end visual performance. This unified architecture allows the GPU to share the same 16GB of unified memory as the CPU, meaning that in graphics-intensive applications, data access is way quicker than in systems where the GPU has separate video memory that constantly needs data transfers.</p>



<p>Speaking of memory, <strong>the 16GB of unified RAM is a significant upgrade from the base 8GB configuration Apple used</strong> in previous entry-level Macs. You can run many applications simultaneously without the slowdowns that occur when systems begin swapping data to storage. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open while working in productivity apps, editing photos, and listening to music without the frustrating lag that comes from too little RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>256GB SSD will provide fast storage for your operating system</strong>, applications, and files. Solid-state drives allow for near-instant boot times and app launches compared to traditional hard drives, while Apple’s custom controllers push read and write speeds even further than standard SSDs. This capacity works well if you primarily use cloud storage services or external drives for large media libraries, though heavy users who store extensive local file collections might want to consider external storage solutions or the higher-capacity models.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gigabit Ethernet is built into the Mac Mini</strong> for wired network connectivity, thus offering more stable and faster internet in many situations than Wi-Fi. It proves very helpful when transferring huge files across your local network, streaming high-bitrate video content, or keeping reliable connections during video calls and remote work. Inclusion of Ethernet at the base price level means you don’t need to purchase adapters or sacrifice USB ports for network connectivity; wired connections eliminate the interference issues that sometimes plague wireless networks.</p>
<p><em>Apple Intelligence</em> offers advanced machine learning on the desktop and automates a range of tasks from intelligent writing assistance and image generation to enhanced Siri capabilities. Because these features are local on the M4 chip and run without using the cloud, execution is faster and more private, since your data never has to leave the device.</p>
<p>Its compact design <strong>measures 5 inches square and 2 inches tall</strong>, and occupies only a minimum of desk space but delivering full desktop performance. That small footprint makes the Mac Mini perfect for tight workspaces, minimal desk sets, or whenever you need powerful computing in a configuration without the bulk of a tower.</p>
