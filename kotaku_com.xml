They also say that the dock is rated for 60W and the Switch 2 itself is rated for 45W, both much higher than the model that launched back in 2017. And finally, the dock has two USB-A ports and one for USB-C, presumably the one that powers it, which is the same as the current model. </p><p>“I spoke with [NextHandheld], and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit,” wrote<em> The Verge</em>’s Seaon Hollister. </p><p>Whether it ends up being 100 percent accurate or not, everything shared by the latest alleged Reddit leaker continues to line up with the rest of what we’ve been hearing, as well as with alleged <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">CAD mockups of what the Switch 2 looks like</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which circulated back in the fall</a></span>. Basically, the Switch 2 will look a lot like the current Switch, just slightly bigger, with a more rounded profile and a number of spec upgrades and design tweaks to improve handling and quality of life. </p><p>That’s not surprising in the context of the rest of the gaming hardware market. The Xbox Series X/S were not a major departure from the Xbox One. The PlayStation 5 is basically just a much more powerful PS4 with two ugly white fins. No one expects the Steam Deck 2 to look dramatically different than the existing one, and most PC gaming handhelds at this point all basically look the same: like a thick tablet with controllers on the sides. </p><p>But it is surprising given Nintendo’s own history of constantly trying to innovate in spaces where no one else is working. The company clung to cartridges longer than anyone and now uses SD cards. The Wii chased motion controls instead of HD graphics. The Wii U prioritized a second screen instead of beefier specs. And the Switch used smartphone specs to take gaming on the go. The notion of the company just iterating on the existing Switch, already the second most popular gaming console ever and fast closing in on the number one PS2, both made a ton of sense and seemed like it might still be too un-Nintendo to be real. </p><p>As we approach an eventual reveal of the Switch 2, every new potential leak points to Nintendo surprising fans by <em>not</em> doing the unexpected and instead doubling down on what already works. The only official thing we know about the upcoming hardware—that it will be backwards compatible with existing Switch games—only reinforces that seeming inevitability. </p><p>I’m sure the company might still have a few tricks and surprises up its sleeve. We’ll find out for sure whenever Nintendo actually announces the dang thing. It’s promised to do so before April 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to multiple sources, the owner canceled the deal to pick up wide receiver Jerry Jeudy because the player had a low rating in <em>Madden</em>. Jeudy would be picked up by the Cleveland Browns and had a fantastic season. </p><p>The outlet reports that this isn’t the only time Johnson has relied on <em>Madden</em> when making decisions. The Jets owner pushed back on the team signing free-agent John Simpson due to his low “Awareness” rating in EA’s sports sim. The Jets signed him anyway and he had a good season. </p><p>According to some sources who spoke to the outlet, the use of <em>Madden </em>in decision-making is a sign that Johnson’s teenage sons have too much influence. </p><p>“When we’re discussing things, you’ll hear Woody cite something that Brick or Jack read online that’s being weighed equally against whatever opinion someone else in the department has,” a Jets executive told <em>The Athletic. </em></p><p>“It’s really sad that an adult would use a misleading anecdote about teenagers to make their father look bad. It’s ridiculous, quite honestly, the idea that this was used to influence the opinion of experienced executives,” said a Jets spokesperson. </p><p>“[The sons] have no roles in the organization. It’s completely ridiculous to suggest that any outside info is intended to replace the opinions of [Woody Johnson’s] staff.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is just one of many other problems reported by the outlet in a longer report about the Jets’ dysfunctional and messy behind-the-scenes culture.</a></span> </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each set adds a bunch of new abilities, enemies, and gameplay wrinkles to the compulsively replayable formula, and can be picked up via a current 15 percent off sale for just $10 total. Not a bad deal if you don’t mind installing the Epic Games Store launcher and playing there (<em>Vampire Surivovrs </em>is also free-to-play on mobile and just $5 on every other platform). </p><p>But the <em>Vampire Survivors</em> giveaway is just the start of Epic Games’ annual (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/epic-games-store-pc-profitable-google-court-case-apple-1850996972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/epic-games-store-pc-profitable-google-court-case-apple-1850996972">and fruitless?</a></span>) attempt to take some PC gaming market share away from Valve.

Instead of targeting enemies or controlling attacks, you simply move an 8-bit character around, collecting orbs and selecting power-ups as they auto-attack their way from lowly peasant to godlike warrior, at which point death shows up to end your run. It sounds simple enough, but try it once and before you know it you’ll be up way past your bedtime hooked on the magic of the 2022 GOTY contender. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
