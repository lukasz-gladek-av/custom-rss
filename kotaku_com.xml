            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stuff for gamers tends to look‚Ä¶ridiculous. You‚Äôve got all these sharp angles, and don‚Äôt get me started on the constant need to shove RBG LEDs into friggin‚Äô everything. Well, in stark contrast to that trend,&nbsp; Elgato, makers of the Stream Deck, various capture cards, and other kit for streaming setups, has a new chair that looks almost too normal. And for a decent chair that‚Äôll last you? It ain‚Äôt sitting at too terrible of a price.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798127/elgato-embrace-gaming-chair">As spotted by <i>The Verge</i></a>, Elgato‚Äôs new chair, the ‚ÄúEmbrace,‚Äù comes in at $500 bucks and will be shipping this holiday season. It comes with all the design elements that make gaming chairs decent to sit in. For hours. Without moving. Staring at the screen with little urge to get up beyond necessary biological impulses.</p>

 <p>As Tom Warren at <i>The Verge </i>states, the Embrace seems to be going up against Herman Miller‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-chairs/embody-gaming-chair/100160889.html?lang=en_US&amp;sku=100160889">Embody</a>‚Äù chair which, I‚Äôll be honest, has a touch more personality with its color options. I‚Äôm really into the white and purple theme. Elegant, not overbearing. But wow, that thing costs almost $2,000. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll save me back problems down the line, but if I‚Äôm spending that kinda money and it‚Äôs not for rent, it‚Äôs almost certainly for something completely irresponsible. Plus, do I want to be that girl who spent two grand on a chair?</p>

 <p>I‚Äôve had the same rando-brand chair I bought on Amazon for like five years now. It cost $300, and has held up through my many fits of punching the arm rests while listening to Gojira or some other crazy shit. If I do decide upon the Embrace as my next gaming chair, I‚Äôll be sure to let you know if you can beat the hell out of it. And how comfy it is.</p> <p>But seriously! Like even just a two-tone color option would have added at least some personality without making me feel like I need to hide it if I bring a guy over or something.</p>

              <p><span>The crossover characters and tracks are my least favorite thing about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>, an otherwise excellent kart racer that didn‚Äôt need a bunch of licensed partnerships to stand out. That said, it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that the modding community has taken that concept and run with it. I do wish someone would add more </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189"><span>Agent Stone</span></a><span> from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><span>live-action</span> <span>movies</span></a><span>, but it seems like modders have other ideas, like Jack Black‚Äôs Steve from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-second-minecraft-movie-is-hitting-theaters-in-just-two-years-2000634000"><span>the </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. This is basically my worst nightmare.</span></p> <p><span>Steve, as he exists in the </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>games, is already in </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>as DLC, but now you can play as his obnoxious film counterpart. The ‚ÄúJack Black Steve Collection‚Äù mod on </span><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/625763"><span>GameBanana</span></a><span> comes courtesy of user BROCHONKY, who has added two skins for Jack Black‚Äôs character to </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>. One is a photoscanned action figure that looks just like the actor, while the other is a stylized version of the character that uses </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>‚Äòs signature blocky style. As a bonus, the mod also includes the infamous Chicken Jockey as it appears in the original game.</span></p>

 <p><span>The mod doesn‚Äôt just include skins, it also has voice lines and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-lava-chicken-jockey-easter-egg-game-1851786345"><span>music from the movie</span></a><span>. Black‚Äôs trademark hammed-up delivery followed him into Overworld, so the movie has several soundbites that became memes, such as when he announces the Chicken Jockey‚Äôs arrival and says ‚Äúflint and steel‚Äù while teaching the other characters to craft. All of this seems like the making of a troll character, but I also feel like hearing these voice lines repeatedly during races would rot your own brain, so you reap what you sow.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Sega is apparently cool with character mods, so Steve will live to Chicken Jockey another day. The company recently </span><a href="https://x.com/RaceCrossWorlds/status/1976175976720867553"><span>banned cheaters who used mods to win races</span></a><span>, but the company‚Äôs </span><a href="https://games.sega.com/eula/?lang=en"><span>End User License Agreement</span></a><span> explicitly encourages creative work like adding new characters to their games. If I see Jack Black Steve on the racetrack, I will be running him off a cliff expeditiously. </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> is out today and it‚Äôs already blowing up on Steam. The multiplayer military shooter is already well on its way to a million concurrents on Steam alone as fans race to witness the franchise‚Äôs revival after years of <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">stumbles and collective disappointment</a>. The record-breaking influx initially meant long queues but now some players are facing others issues, including a weird bug that tells them they need to buy and download a multiplayer mode they already own to start playing.</p> <p>Currently in the top-five most played games on Steam, <em>Battlefield</em> is the only game in the top four that‚Äôs paid. A $70 price tag hasn‚Äôt stopped it from overtaking Valve‚Äôs<em> Dota 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, or the perennial chart-topping battle royale<em> PUBG</em>. Players logging on when the game went live around 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday were immediately greeted by absurd queue positions featuring hundreds of thousands of other players trying to get into the always-online game.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">350,000 in the queue for Battlefield 6 already ü§Ø <a href="https://t.co/O6tPcS7e7R">pic.twitter.com/O6tPcS7e7R</a></p> <p>‚Äî Tyler James (@FreakyMusic_) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreakyMusic_/status/1976666403723006090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Battlefield</em> lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1974844687484641683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1974844687484641683%7Ctwgr%5Ebe0e9b592c93c25f20d70e73f251027fe236f8e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fbattlefield%2Fbattlefield-6-lead-tempts-fate-says-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-after-numerous-betas-across-pc-and-consoles%2F">previously</a> seemed confident that the sequel would be prepared to welcome in the flood of day-one players following months of beta hype and promising feedback. DICE was quick to point out that login queues are part of trying to keep the ramp-up process ‚Äúsmooth and stable for everyone.‚Äù That didn‚Äôt stop fans from jabbing each other with screenshots of their positions on social media and the Battlefield subreddit. Long before anyone has a KDA to brag about in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, fans are turning to queue positions as high-score markers of elite status. Can anyone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o340g7/i_think_people_are_trying_to_play_bf6_idk_maybe/">beat 458,400</a>?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bro‚Ä¶.<br>how doe i play the game now? <a href="https://t.co/wMwXmmHGWm">pic.twitter.com/wMwXmmHGWm</a></p> <p>‚Äî DjKr4m3r Gaming (@djkr4m3r) <a href="https://twitter.com/djkr4m3r/status/1976671821476073568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But other players have been facing a strange issue in which, even after getting into the game, they would be asked to install it. ‚ÄúRunning into an error with <em>Battlefield 6</em> that states I need to install multiplayer, and it shows me all the files I need to install,‚Äù one wrote on X. ‚ÄúDoes anyone have any fixes? I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to have to queue again.‚Äù <a href="https://x.com/NachoCapart/status/1976678451252953251">Someone else</a> even tried deleting the game, reinstalling everything, and queuing again to try and get in. ‚ÄúIf it works, please tell me,‚Äù another player wrote back.</p>

 <p>So far, EA has said it‚Äôs aware of the problem but hasn‚Äôt shared advice on how to address it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aware of an issue preventing players from accessing the game with some receiving an error stating they need to purchase DLC or similar,‚Äù it announced around noon on Friday. ‚ÄúStay tuned for further updates as the team investigates this issue.‚Äù</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000634048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634048"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634048">Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In the meantime, <em>Battlefield 6</em> seems well on its way to living up to to the initial blitz of player interest some had been predicting. Data firm Ampere Analysis <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal">told <em>The Game Business</em></a> it was forecasting 1.7 million copies pre-ordered on Steam alone. If all of them login within the first 24 hours, the fall blockbuster will be well on its way to being Steam‚Äôs most-played game so far this month.</p> <p>To break into the top 10 of all-time highest concurrent player counts, it‚Äôll need to beat <em>Banana</em>‚Äòs 917,000 record. The top spot is still held by <em>PUBG</em> at over 3.2 million players simultaneously. EA will probably be content with having already edged out its own free-to-play giant <em>Apex Legends</em>, though. No wonder Activision seems so worried <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-free-battlefield-6-call-of-duty-rivalry-2000633176">about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> this year</a>. It‚Äôs the first time in six years it‚Äôs had to go head-to-head with a <em>Battlefield</em> that had a single-player campaign, even if this one has <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">left many critics overwhelmed</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Borderlands 4</i> arrived last month on September 12‚Äìand some people are <i>still</i> waiting for shader compilation! That‚Äôs a preview of what you can expect in this edition of ‚ÄúAs Told By Steam Reviews,‚Äù because, ya‚Äôll, either this game really, truly runs that poorly or the mimetic nature of the internet is working overdrive here.</p> <p>You‚Äôll quickly spot a trend when it comes to perusing <i>BL4</i>‚Äôs user reviews on Steam: Folks are generally struggling to enjoy this game&nbsp; not because of the story or the gunplay‚Äì the reviews mostly speak favorably of those elements. No, that pale orange ‚ÄúMixed‚Äù review status on the game‚Äôs Steam page is the result of countless reviews trashing how this game runs, with particular ire directed toward Unreal Engine 5, and for Gearbox‚Äôs talkative CEO who also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">spent some time doubling as tech support</a> after this game‚Äôs bumpy release.</p>

 <p>It‚Äôs hard to find a negative review that doesn‚Äôt just meditate on the misery of eternal shader compilation and signature UE5 stuttering. But those who ain‚Äôt too hot on what <i>BL4</i> is selling seem to find the open world a little shallow. On top of that, there are some who seem to just prefer <i>BL2</i>‚Äôs writing over the narrative and dialogue here.</p> <p>Positive reviews, however, reflect that <i>Borderlands</i>‚Äô gun-handling has come a long way since the awkwardness it exhibited of the earlier entries. It feels like a more refined shooter experience than ever, and, to some at least, it seems the writing is much better.</p> <p>So let‚Äôs get onto <i>Borderlands 4</i>, as told by Steam reviews!</p> <h2>‚ÄòWho are you and what have you done to the borderlands writing team?!‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634026"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634026">¬© Screenshot: Valve / SkeleBen / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòYou straight up can‚Äôt play this game if you‚Äôre broke.‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634029">¬© Screenshot: Valve / OnionMuncher / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634030">¬© Screenshot: Valve / Mister Macaroni / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòThe structure of the balance, postgame and gear has actual thought behind it for once.‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634031">¬© Screenshot: Valve / LazyData / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634032"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634032">¬© Screenshot: Valve / Tchii / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòBorderlands 4 feels like that first sip of an energy drink at 2 AM when you know you‚Äôre gaming all night.‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634034">¬© Screenshot: Valve / Shinigami/ Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòMost importantly the writing has taken a step in the right direction.‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634036">¬© Screenshot: Valve / Xzanos / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòRandy needs to get off twitter.
