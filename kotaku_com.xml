              <p>What would <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> be like if your fights with people and creatures played out like matches in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>? That’s the thought experiment at the center of <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-streamer-blurbs-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-voice-mod-1851443327">streamer Blurbs</a>‘ latest mod for the Rockstar open-world game. There’s lots of punching, lots of blood, and some downright nuts fatalities.</p> <p>Blurbs has transformed mod-making into a communal activity by having fans contribute ideas and constructing and testing them in real time as viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmhOVmdlUEJCc3RCVDZkLUhBTF9IMkI0MWhEZ3xBQ3Jtc0trVmQ1WjdyS3JDZjJ3VFBoVXh0Y2VUZ09OYWdKY2tBRUhzTS1aRVMzcUJOUGhHZFRPNWRjUXB5a0pHTFNDTDdBQWYzWTdSc2I2ekxIT3p1YmJEYkJKLVdrRFkxcG1wVUptVURnQmVuMjRrNUdSTVRDYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fblurbs">watch on Twitch</a>.&nbsp; Last time it was a <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> mod that shows you <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070">the dying memories</a> of all the NPCs you murder. Now, for <em>Red Dead Mortal Kombat</em>, he starts with a basic mechanic where any time you punch someone, the camera flips to a side-by-side view like a fighting game and builds from there.</p>

  <p>Blurbs even went ahead and added rudimentary animations, sound effects, and cheat codes that need to be entered for fatalities. In one, Arthur Morgan lets out a tuberculosis-filled cough that makes the opponent explode in a geyser of blood. In another, the loser is pushed out in front of a runaway train that obliterates them.</p>

 <p>But the mod doesn’t just allow Arthur to fight people. In the video above showing off the mod, Blurbs also has Arthur go head-to-head with an alligator, a deer, and a grizzly bear. That last one does not go well for him.</p> <p>He’s currently taking requests for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> mods.&nbsp;“My whole mission is overproducing really dumb ideas that no one else would ever think to make,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On October 15, the devs behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> announced that the game’s most popular mode, Conquest, would be tweaked in a big way that would potentially lead to shorter matches. This change was nearly universally hated by the online <em>Battlefield</em> community, and now, just 48 hours later, EA is reversing course as it continues to promise tweaks and fixes for the recently released online FPS.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042"><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched last week to massive sales and high player numbers</a>, making it already one of the most successful entries in the long-running milsim series. But, as with any popular online video game these days, a lot of players online have spent nearly every day since launch offering feedback, complaining, or pointing out problems that need to be fixed. And EA is working on a lot of this, with fixes incoming for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/">overly bright maps</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-devs-are-trying-to-find-the-balance-between-zoomers-and-battledads-following-movement-nerfs-were-looking-at-adjustments-for-sure-to-find-a-good-in-between/">tweaks to movement</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-ghost-bullets-update-hotfix-network-bloom-2000635677">and more</a>. But among these many recent changes, one caught players on Reddit and social media off guard. For some reason, EA and Battlefield Studios lowered the ticket count for all levels when playing <em>BF6</em>‘s flagship mode, Conquest. And oh boy, were people mad about this change.</p>

 <p>For those not familiar with Conquest in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>BF6</em></a>, the mode is all about capturing various points on large maps and holding them. The more you hold, the slower your ticket count ticks down. And any time a player dies and respawns, a ticket is also removed from that team. The side that hits 0 first loses. Before October 15, every map in <em>BF6</em> featured 1000 tickets for both sides. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">But then that was tweaked</a>, with different, lower starting ticket values depending on which map you were playing. EA claimed this was because battles were going on too long and timing out, so the idea was that lower ticket counts would lead to more matches ending because a team hit 0 and not because the timer ran out.</p>

 <p>This tweak angered many online as it seemed like something nobody was asking for. Likewise, many players, myself included, have played for many days now and have never seen a match end due to the timer running out. Other players were also mad because for them, <em>Battlefield’s</em> Conquest mode has always been about long matches that go back and forth for upwards of 20 minutes. As many pointed out online in thousands of messages and posts, if you want shorter matches, there are plenty of modes in <em>BF6</em> that offer that experience. Lowering the ticket count ultimately felt like a solution for a problem that didn’t exist, and EA seemingly agrees because it’s already reversed course on the controversial change.</p>

 <p>On October 17, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944">the official <em>Battlefield</em> social media account on Twitter posted</a> that the devs had “heard your feedback” and the studio was reverting the change.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45 minute timed rounds.</p> <p>Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm this…</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We’ve heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45-minute timed rounds,” posted the official account. “Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm, this change may lead to longer match durations. We’ll continue monitoring player feedback and gameplay data to ensure the pacing and overall flow of matches feel right.”</p>

 <p>It’s very odd to me that EA seems so concerned about long matches in Conquest, as that’s always been how the mode works, something other players pointed out in the comments below. I think the best way to solve this problem is to just add a “Fast Conquest” mode that has fewer tickets and is all about keeping matches short. Players who really prefer that version of Conquest can go enjoy it, and everyone else can grind away in 40-minute matches that go back and forth.</p> <p>In fact, I’d love to see EA do some official playlists that feature 2000-ticket matches, as sometimes I just want to spend an hour fighting in Operation Firestorm, you know? At least for now, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s most iconic mode is back to normal, and just in time for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">some big XP changes that should make it easier to unlock new gear</a>.</p>
