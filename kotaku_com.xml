              <div> <p>Chrome Boba Fett and the little baby Yoda are here to help you forget all about Disney’s complicity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">a grim attack on free speech</a>. Out in less than nine months, <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu&nbsp;</em>now has its first trailer, and the next<em> Star Wars</em> movie looks both incredibly unnecessary and also lots of fun.</p> </div>  <p>The film stars Pedro Pascal as the Mandalorian bounty hunter, with his Force-sensitive sidekick Grogu looking as adorable as ever. Set after the TV series, the film finds the pair back in the galactic hotseat, navigating post-war tensions between the New Republic (Sigourney Weaver plays a colonel named Ward) and remnants of the Empire (Jonny Coyne plays an imperial warlord). Also Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta is in the mix too.</p>  <p>Here’s a brief look:</p>   <p>The whole 90 seconds flashes by in an instant, but in addition to the aforementioned characters you can also catch a glimpse of some alien guy messing people up with an electrostaff and Grogu speeding around with some other cute god-knows-whats (paging <em>Star Wars</em> lore master Zack Zwiezen). But like I said at the top, it looks fun and not mired down in a bunch of <em>Star Wars</em> naval-gazing mythbuilding, which is a good a thing.</p> <p><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu </em>is directed by Jon Favreau and co-written by Favreau and Dave Filoni, and marks the first in a fresh slate of upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> movies for Disney. With everything else, including a new Jedi-centric tale with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797">Daisy Ridley returning as Rey completely MIA</a>, it’ll either feel like the start of something new or the death knell for the current streaming-wars-burnout incarnation of the franchise. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026, and can’t come soon enough for a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">company currently facing a boycott</a> from fans and celebrities over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy.</p>
