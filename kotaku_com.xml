              <p>Drone prices can really be all over the place, and that makes sense. If you’re just looking to have some fun in the park or your backyard, you can find a drone for under $50. They’re pretty much toys. For a few hundred, you can get a real hobbyist drone that gives you more range, durability, flight time, recording resolution, etc. Then there’s the professional tier, and that’s where this drone falls (or lands safely): The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5195/">DJI Air 3S drone combo pack (including a RC2 remote controller and three batteries)&nbsp; normally goes for $2,499 but following a 20% discount, it comes down by an even $500</a>. That brings the drone down to just $1,999 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5195/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This drone doesn’t just rely on you using your phone screen: It comes with its own <strong>dedicated controller featuring its own screen</strong> to view what your drone is seeing. The drone utilizes a dual-camera system which consists of a 1-inch CMOS 24mm 50MP wide angle camera along with a 1/1.3-inch CMOS 70mm 48MP medium telephoto camera. Between to tow of them, you can capture everything from beautiful, scenic landscapes to cinematic close-ups all from the skies. Video is capable of recording in up to 4K resolution at 60fps with HDR. You’re footage with be breathtaking.</p>
<p>The six-antenna array system is able to transmit the video down from the drone to your control panel, maintaining a live feed in 1080p at 60fps at up to a staggering 20 km away. The DJI Air 3S drone can keep up in the <strong>air for a long flight time of 45 minutes (and there are 3 batteries included)</strong>. That’s about a 48% increase over the previous model drone — the DJI Air 2S — so you can record stunning shots without worrying too much about battery life.</p>



<h2>Worry-Free Flying</h2>
<p>You can fly with confidence, staying in control, thanks to the drones omnidirectional obstacle sensing. The DJI Air 3S drone is able to intelligently navigate on its own back to it’s launch point passing through challenged environments like a tree-filled forest. Even if it’s dark outside, the forward-facing LiDAR can help maintain a clear path on its way back. Heck, even if access to GPS is lost, the drone memorizes it’s flight path so it can follow it back to its starting point without the need for GPS.</p>
<p>This bundle comes with a number of bonus gifts included with your DJI Air 3S drone. It comes with a 128GB microSD card, three flight batteries (allowing for up to 135 minutes total), a battery charging hub, a shoulder bag, photography backpack, three extra pairs of low-noise propellers, a gimbal protector, a cleaning kit, and even a drone landing pad</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-open-ear-headphones-slash-53-off-now-nearly-free-for-early-black-friday-2000640322</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-open-ear-headphones-slash-53-off-now-nearly-free-for-early-black-friday.1339981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Spending $250 on AirPods Pro makes sense for some people, but plenty of situations call for something more affordable and practical. Anker earns enough trust from Apple to sell its products directly in Apple Stores which speaks volumes about build quality and reliability from a brand that consistently delivers excellent audio gear at prices that seem almost too good.</p>
<p>The <strong>Soundcore V20i open-ear headphones</strong> normally retail at $49 (already reasonable compared to premium alternatives) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/">but Amazon just slashed the price to $23 for early Black Friday</a>. This represents <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/">an all-time low and a 53% discount</a> on earbuds that solve a specific problem: giving you audio without blocking out the world around you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The open-ear design <strong>positions the 16mm drivers just outside your ear canal</strong> rather than sealing inside it, and creates a fundamentally different listening experience that<strong> prioritizes environmental awareness over total immersion</strong>. This matters immensely during activities like running, cycling, or walking in urban environments where hearing approaching vehicles, other pedestrians, or important announcements keeps you safe.</p>
<p>The titanium-coated diaphragms in those 16mm drivers deliver surprisingly robust bass response through Soundcore’s BassUp technology which analyzes your audio in real time and enhances low frequencies without distortion. The adjustable ear hooks rotate through four distinct positions and lets you find the exact angle that balances comfort with secure fit based on your unique ear shape.</p>



<h2>All-Day Comfort</h2>
<p>Traditional earbuds cause pressure points and can be very uncomfortable after a few hours of wear, especially for individuals with small ear canals or sensitivities to in-ear designs. The V20i solves this through its non-intrusive architecture and rests against your ear rather than inserting into it, hence <strong>banishing that plugged-up feeling and letting your ears breathe during extended listening sessions</strong>. The lightweight construction adds minimal weight to your head, making these genuinely comfortable for all-day wear during work, commutes, or marathon study sessions. With <strong>an IP55 certificate</strong>, it provides protection from sweat, light rain, and dust exposure, so you can wear these during workouts or outdoor activities without concern about moisture damage.</p>



<p>When you factor in the charging case, <strong>this goes up to a total of 36 hours of playtime</strong> or about a week of regular daily use until you have to plug in. Bluetooth 5.4 is the latest wireless standard, featuring improved connection stability, lower latency for video and better power efficiency compared to previous versions. The added multipoint connection allows you to <strong>connect these earbuds to two devices at once</strong> so you can seamlessly go from listening to tunes on your laptop to taking calls on your phone without having to manually reconnect.</p>
<p>At $23 down from $49, these Soundcore V20i earbuds cost less than most wired headphones but offer wireless convenience, situational awareness, and real audio quality. Anker’s reputation for durability and the massive customer review count suggest these earbuds will survive daily use far longer than the bargain price implies. That makes this early Black Friday deal one of those rare times where cheap really does mean value, not compromise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-monster-laptop-64-gb-ram-2-tb-ssd-hits-mid-range-pricing-after-amazons-massive-2300-price-cut-2000640236</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-monster-laptop-64-gb-ram-2-tb-ssd-hits-mid-range-pricing-after-amazon%E2%80%99s-massive-2-300-price-cut.1339963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops rarely drop more than $2000, especially ones packing the kind of specs that make power users drool. The Hp 17 Business Laptop just crashed to $999 on Amazon, down from its typical $3,299 price tag, and this represents an all-time low that catches attention. Hp kicked off its Black Friday deals early on Amazon though the company’s official site hasn’t followed suit yet, and this configuration with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD delivers professional-grade performance at a price that usually buys mid-range machines with half the memory and storage. You’re looking at a laptop that handles heavy multitasking, video editing, and data-intensive work without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5134/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Power Behind Those Numbers Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The hybrid architecture 13th Generation <strong>Intel Core i5-1334U processor handles work intelligently</strong> between two high-performance cores and eight efficient cores. Those <strong>performance cores clock up to 4.6GHz</strong> when you need maximum speed for demanding applications while the efficient cores handle background tasks and lighter workloads to preserve battery life. In essence, this means you can run virtual machines, edit 4K video, compile code and have dozens of browser tabs open at the same time without everything slowing down to a crawl.</p>



<p>That<strong> 64GB of DDR4 RAM at 3200MHz turns this into a multitasking monster</strong> that professionals actually need: video editors scrubbing through multiple 4K timelines without rendering previews, data analysts loading massive datasets into memory for instant querying and developers spinning up multiple Docker containers or virtual machines without the dreaded ‘out of memory’ warnings popping up. The <strong>2TB PCIe SSD provides storage space</strong> that meets real-world needs and fits years of project files, photo libraries and application installs while delivering read speeds of up to 15 times faster than traditional hard drives.</p>
<p>The <strong>17.3-inch Full HD display (1920×1080 resolution)</strong> offers screen real estate that eliminates constant window-switching and provides the opportunity for practical side-by-side document comparison. The narrow bezels maximize the viewing area without making the laptop’s footprint too wide, while an anti-glare coating means you can work near windows without fighting reflections. It’s bright enough at 250 nits to remain readable in most lighting conditions; direct sunlight still presents some challenges but it does on most laptops.</p>



<p>It comes <strong>preinstalled with Windows 11 Pro</strong> and ads business-focused features that the Home editions lack. Remote Desktop functionality lets you access this machine from anywhere with an internet connection, BitLocker encryption protects sensitive data in case the laptop is lost or stolen, and advanced group policy controls are helpful for IT departments managing security settings. Several USB ports-including one USB-C-an HDMI output for external displays, and an SD card reader round out the connectivity options needed daily by business users.</p>
<p>This is the best deal available on a laptop with these specs. If you’re looking for a powerhouse, this is it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-an-iphone-this-dji-gimbal-stabilizer-costs-pennies-and-films-like-hollywood-2000640317</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-an-iphone-this-dji-gimbal-stabilizer-costs-pennies-and-films-like-hollywood.1339948/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your iPhone already has optical image stabilization built in but try filming while walking and you’ll quickly notice those micro-jitters and shakes that make your videos look amateurish. The DJI Osmo Mobile 7 solves this problem with <strong>professional-grade 3-axis gimbal stabilization</strong> that counteracts every movement in real time and delivers the kind of smooth footage you see in actual films. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5181/">Originally $89, this gimbal drops to $75 on Amazon right now</a>, which marks an all-time low for early Black Friday shoppers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5181/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It works via <strong>mechanical stabilization that’s independent of the digital system in your phone</strong>, basically three separate motors that work non-stop to adjust the position of the gimbal to compensate for hand movements, bumps and abrupt directional changes. These create <strong>footage that looks professionally shot</strong>&nbsp;even when you’re running upstairs or downstairs, or tracking a subject moving at high speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Coming in at just 300 grams</strong>, the Osmo Mobile 7 weighs less than most water bottles, has an ergonomic handle with anti-slip grip and remains comfortable even during extended shooting sessions. Meanwhile, an integrated foldable design collapses down to a compact 179x95x39mm size that easily slips into a backpack or large jacket pocket, and a built-in tripod deploys instantly for static shots or time-lapses without needing separate equipment.</p>



<h2>Intelligent Tracking That Works</h2>
<p>ActiveTrack 7.0 is the latest subject-tracking technology from DJI which uses complex algorithms to <strong>recognize and follow people, pets, or objects</strong> even through complex movements and crowded environments. This <em>Dual-Lens</em> enhanced tracking works by simultaneously leveraging both your phone’s main and secondary cameras to create a more accurate depth map so that the gimbal holds focus even on fast, close-up action shots. That means you can film yourself skateboarding, dancing or demo-ing products while the gimbal automatically pans and tilts to keep you centered in the frame without the need for a camera operator.</p>



<p>The DJI Mimo app makes this hardware a fully realized mobile production studio with features like <em>ShotGuides</em>&nbsp;which analyzes your environment and suggests specific camera movements and compositions used in professional cinematography. <em>One-Tap Edit</em> automatically assembles your footage into polished videos with transitions, music, and effects based on the content you capture, shaving hours off editing time and condensing it to minutes. The app provides <strong>manual controls for ISO, shutter speed, and white balance</strong> should you want granular creative control plus specialized modes like Slow Motion, Hyperlapse and Panorama that leverage the gimbal’s precise movement capabilities.</p>



<p>It makes for <strong>up to 10 hours of continuous operation on a single charge</strong>&nbsp;which means you can easily get a full day of content creation or event coverage without needing to stop and recharge. The <strong>USB-C port serves double duty by charging your phone while you film</strong>, and alleviates the problem of intensive video recording completely draining your device’s battery mid-shoot. The magnetic phone clamp attaches and detaches in a matter of seconds, utilizing firm magnets that hold your device secure even as you move around most aggressively but enable you to quickly switch between devices or to go handheld.</p>
<p>At $75 down from $89, this is the lowest price we’ve tracked for the Osmo Mobile 7, and these early Black Friday deals on DJI products have a history of selling out quickly once inventory starts moving.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell Quietly Offloads 1TB 16-Inch Laptops, Now Nearly Free at 71% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-quietly-offloads-1tb-16-inch-laptops-now-nearly-free-at-71-off-on-amazon-2000640311</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-quietly-offloads-1tb-16-inch-laptops-now-nearly-free-at-71-off-on-amazon.1339942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are laptops you dream about but never actually buy because they sit in that untouchable price bracket reserved for professionals with corporate budgets. Normally retailing for $3,399, this Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop, 32 GB of DDR5 RAM, and a full terabyte of storage, is just that kind of aspirational machine.</p>
<p>But here’s where things take a very interesting turn for early Black Friday shoppers: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5179/">Amazon just dropped this powerhouse to $999, representing a staggering 71% discount</a> and marking an <strong>all-time low price</strong> for this configuration. This isn’t some refurbished model or a stripped-down version: you’re looking at a full-spec business laptop with Windows 11 Pro, and at this price point, it won’t last long before inventory disappears.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5179/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Dell built this “Inspiron 16” around an Intel Core 7 150U processor which <strong>packs in 10 cores and 12 threads that can smartly scale up to as high as 5.4 GHz</strong> based on your workload. That means this laptop changes its performance dynamically and give you serious processing power for video editing or data crunching while staying efficient for lighter tasks such as browsing or working on documents.</p>
<p>The accompanying <strong>32 GB of DDR5 RAM easily allows multiple demanding applications</strong> to run simultaneously without that frustrating lag in switching between Chrome tabs, Photoshop projects and Excel spreadsheets. That 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD doesn’t just provide enormous storage capacity but also transfers at blazing speeds and allows your system to boot in just seconds and large files to move in near-instant timing.</p>



<h2>A Display That Improves Your Workday</h2>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen deserves its own spotlight</strong> because Dell has made some smart choices here. The 1920×1200 resolution adopts a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of the traditional 16:9 and translates to more vertical screen real estate while navigating documents and web pages without needing to scroll so much. This display stays clearly visible even in well-lit offices or by the window with a brightness of 300 nits.</p>
<p>Dell has also integrated <em>ComfortView Plus</em> technology which reduces hazardous blue light emission without that weird yellow tint you get with cheaper filters; it makes those long sessions easier on your eyes. The <strong>touchscreen adds another layer of interaction</strong> that becomes surprisingly useful as soon as you get used to it, specifically when doing quick edits or getting through the touch-optimized interface of Windows 11.</p>



<p>The practical features extend to everyday usability, ways that make this much more than just another laptop but a real productivity machine. The full-size backlit keyboard includes a dedicated numeric keypad that anyone who works with numbers regularly will immediately appreciate. That ice blue backlighting isn’t for looks; it makes typing in dim environments or during evening work sessions significantly easier without eye strain. <strong>Windows 11 Pro brings enterprise-grade security features</strong>&nbsp;while the integrated fingerprint reader adds biometric protection that’s much safer and far more convenient than continuously punching in passwords.</p>
<p>Right now, you can essentially get flagship specifications at mid-range pricing since this is a laptop that usually sells for over three grand. Dell clearly priced it to move inventory fast ahead of Black Friday, and those kinds of early deals rarely stick around once word starts getting out.</p>
