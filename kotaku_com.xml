<h2>Comfortable, stylish headphones with fantastic audio</h2>
<p>Immediately upon trying on the Beats Solo 4, you’ll recognize how comfortable they feel due to their lightweight design and soft padded ear cups. The ear cups don’t press against your ears as they would be squeezed by a lot of other headphones and this makes listening for extended periods of time less tiring and a lot easier.</p>
<p>The sound quality delivered by the Beats Solo 4 is fun and dynamic. The Bass is deep and punches, the Midrange is clear and defined and the Treble remains bright and crisp even when turned up high. With this well-balanced sound, the Beats Solo 4 headphones are capable of reproducing a variety of musical styles including energetic Pop and Hip Hop, Acoustic/Indie music and many others. The Solo 4’s ability to reproduce detailed audio provides an enjoyable listening experience that sounds full and rich.</p>



<p>Connecting your Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones to your smartphone, tablet or computer is quick and easy using the headphones’ built-in Bluetooth technology and stable connection. This gives you freedom to move around without being tied down to a cord or dealing with lost signal issues. Additionally, the Solo 4’s earcup contains controls that allow you to adjust volume, play/pause songs and answer/hang up calls without having to touch your device, providing you with a very portable and convenient option for on-the-go listening.</p>
<p>The Beats Solo 4’s battery life is also quite good for wireless on-ear headphones and should give you plenty of time to listen to your favorite content for hours before needing a charge. In addition, once the battery is depleted, they recharge quickly, so you won’t need to spend too much time waiting for them to be ready again.</p>
<p>Overall, the Beats Solo 4 are a great choice for everyday listening. They give you reliable connectivity if you’re on the iOS ecosystem, they fit well, and they’re comfortable to wear for long periods of time. If it matters to you, they’re also very stylish. Grab a pair while you still can now that the holidays are drawing to a close.</p>
