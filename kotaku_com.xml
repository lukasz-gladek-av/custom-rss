              <p>Dell has built its reputation on reliable laptops that get the job done and the brand offers an incredibly wide range of options for everyday computing needs. Right now, though, there’s a deal that’s so aggressive it barely seems real: This Dell <em>Vostro</em>&nbsp;which <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4713/">is a 15.6-inch business laptop packed with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, has dropped to $699 from its typical price of $1,699</a>. That’s a <strong>63 percent discount</strong>, and honestly, Amazon is likely operating at zero margin here or possibly even taking a loss. This wasn’t even close to happening during last week’s Prime Day, which makes this deal all the more surprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4713/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Laptop for Actual Work</h2>
<p>The Vostro series is aimed at small business users/freelancers/entrepreneurs who require computers that are able to meet intensive work requirements without having to shell out for high-end consumer laptops. This model offers just such no-nonsense performance: Intel’s 13th Gen Core i5-1334U processor is at its heart with a five-core hybrid architecture <strong>consisting of a 4.5GHz up to turbo boost performance core</strong> and four 3.3GHz up to turbo boost efficiency cores.</p>
<p>The 32GB of DDR4 RAM is where this laptop stands alone among budget competitors: Most budget laptops come with 8GB or perhaps 16GB, which is sufficient for minimal web surfing but begins to grind when you have a dozen browser tabs open, a Zoom conference running and a few Office apps open in the background. With 32GB,<strong> you can have virtual machines up and running, edit giant photos, work with complex XLS files</strong> and have your whole digital workplace open without the machine grinding to a halt.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides both speed and capacity: <strong>PCIe drives read and write data significantly faster than traditional SATA SSDs</strong> which translates to quicker boot times, faster application launches and snappier file transfers.</p>
<p>What’s more, the <strong>15.6-inch Full HD 1920×1080-resolution screen refreshes at 120Hz</strong>. You’ll appreciate that 120Hz difference even if you are not a gamer. Up and down movement in documents and web pages is smoother, as is cursor motion. Eye health during long work days is taken care of by the anti-glare treatment, and 250-nit brightness is more than enough for indoor applications, although direct sunlight may be a problem.</p>



<p>Connectivity options have their bases covered with <strong>two USB-A ports (one USB 3.2 Gen 1, one USB 2.0), two USB-C ports, HDMI 1.4 for external displays</strong>&nbsp;and a standard RJ-45 Ethernet jack for wired network connectivity. Having both WiFi and Bluetooth allows connecting wireless peripherals such as keyboards and mice with stable Internet connection at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Professiona</strong>l is already installed and this offers enhanced security functionality and administration tools compared to the Home version.</p>
<p>For $599, you are receiving a configuration that would be three times that amount under a typical situation.</p>

              <p>If you’re tired of spending your weekends pushing a vacuum around or constantly emptying dustbins, you’re not alone. Roborock has built its reputation as the premium brand in robot vacuum technology and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/">the QV 35A model is available for just $429, down from $649 on Amazon</a>. This is an all-time low price, and here’s the kicker: <strong>Roborock has extended its Prime Day pricing exclusively on Amazon</strong> for just a few more days which means you won’t find this deal anywhere else, not even on their official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The piece de resistance of this machine is its extremely advanced<strong> all-in-one dock station that makes your vacuum maintenance-free for up to two months</strong>. Take that in for a minute: no emptying dustbins, no washing mop pads, no wrestling with tangled hair wrapped around brushes. The dock eliminates all that automatically, washing the mop pads at the finish of each cleaning cycle and slotting detritus in a high-capacity bag that you’ll simply have to change every seven weeks or so.</p>
<h2>Accuracy and Power that Actually Delivers</h2>
<p>The <strong>Roborock QV 35A has 8000Pa of suction power</strong>, which is a nice upgrade from the previous Qrevo S version. Put another way, this amount of suction allows the robot to extract embedded dirt from carpets, pick up tiny dust particles off hard floors and tackle anything from a spilled bowl of cereal to pet hair without batting an eye. The <strong>dual spinning mops rotate at 200 RPM and applies consistent pressure</strong> to scrub away stuck-on messes rather than just pushing dirty water around like some competing models do.</p>



<p>What makes this model unique (and this is very specific to Roborock) is the <strong>anti-tangle brush system</strong>: If you’ve ever had a robot vacuum, then you understand the pain of turning it upside down every several days to hack away at hair that is bound up around the roller. Roborock has redone the brush design to positively prevent tangles in the first instance by deploying a series of rubber fins and very specifically angled bristles that direct the hair straight into the dustbin rather than wrapping up around the mechanism.</p>



<p>The intelligent obstacle avoidance employs sophisticated LiDAR navigation and reactive AI to <strong>map your living space with accuracy and avoid common obstacles</strong> such as charging cables, shoes and pet toys. Whereas simple infrared sensors merely bounce off walls, this device makes a detailed 3D map of your room, learns your floor plan with time and even recognizes specific rooms for localized cleaning.</p>
<p>The <strong>auto-mop washer function kicks in between floors</strong> and at the completion of every cleaning cycle so that the mop pads remain clean and do not just redistribute dirty water from floor to floor. The chute employs freshwater to clean the pads, and then at high rpm, they are spun to extract excess water. Your floors are dry sooner and that damp or musty odor that can build up with perpetually moist mop heads is averted.</p>
<p>At $429, you are getting technology that is regularly in the $600-1,000 bracket, and with the Prime Day sales extension running off the clock, this is the time to snap it up prior to the full price resumption.</p>
