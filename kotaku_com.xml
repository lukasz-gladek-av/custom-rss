            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re two days out from EA’s announcement that it would <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">sell to Saudia Arabia and private equity</a> for $55 billion, and as the dust settles, concerns continue to mount. Some inside the company are worried about possible cuts, layoffs, and censorship coming down the road, and the logistics of the deal don’t necessarily do much to reassure them. Downgraded credit ratings, rumors of ramped-up AI initiatives, and relative radio silence from the executives and investors involved isn’t helping.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/s-p-says-it-expects-to-cut-electronic-arts-to-junk-status?srnd=phx-fixed-income"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that S&amp;P Global Ratings plans to lower EA’s credit rating to “junk status” once the leveraged buyout deal is completed sometime next year. It’s currently “BBB+” but would fall into the “non-investment grade” or “speculative” territory once saddled with the $20 billion loan required to pay off all of the <i>Battlefield 6 </i>publisher’s existing shareholders at a 25-percent premium. Moody’s Ratings announced it is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/moody-s-says-it-s-likely-to-cut-electronic-arts-following-s-p?srnd=phx-deals">planning a similar reappraisal</a>. And the more context we get around the financing of the deal, the worse it looks.</p>

 <p>“JPMorgan made the commitment through its leveraged-finance arm, not its private credit strategy, and the biggest U.S. bank is expected to share the risk with rival firms to create a global syndicate of underwriters, according to people familiar with the deal,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reported yesterday. “The debt— expected to be rated in the single-B range—is set to be sold through high-yield bonds and leveraged loans in a cross-border, dual-currency transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential details.” Smells like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m23a2o4avs2f">high-interest-rate debt</a>.</p>

 <h2>BioWare on the chopping block</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-battlefield-6-mass-effect-bioware-private-equity-2000629947">Some analysts who spoke to<em> Kotaku</em></a> have suggested that going private could free EA from the whims of a stock market based around quarterly earnings reports, but it could also be that being saddled with a ton of debt completely reshapes the decades-old gaming company as we know it. EA has an infamous reputation for buying up acclaimed studios with big creative ambitions and eventually gutting them when they fail to live up to the earnings potential of the loot-box machines fueling <em>Madden</em> and <em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p>

 <p>Respawn Entertainment recently faced multiple rounds of layoffs and saw multiple projects canceled, including a prototype for a long-awaited return to the world of <em>Titanfall</em>. BioWare has suffered even worse. Following a tumultuous development cycle for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> due to shifting schedules and live-service goals, the RPG powerhouse is back to being a one-game studio (<em>Mass Effect</em>) and a shell of its former self. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> now reports</a> that EA was at one point looking to possibly sell off its $775 million acquisition from back in 2007. At least some developers there are just as worried about a future under Saudi ownership. They told<em> Insider Gaming</em> that it feels like only a matter of time before BioWare is downsized further.</p>

 <p>“For the studios that have more of a track record, especially a track record that maybe doesn’t line up with your own political views…you’re going to look at that studio and wonder how you make them fit into your new structure,” former BioWare project director Mark Darrah said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGc8oq9uq8&amp;t=50s">in a new YouTube video</a>. “It’s hard to imagine that you have BioWare pivot from having very progressive messaging to having the reverse because it’s what the government wants. It’s hard to imagine that the public perception of a game that comes out of BioWare, even if you do do that, isn’t apocalyptically bad.”</p>

 <h2>Pivoting away from human rights</h2> <p>In an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3m23abrrwj22v">FAQ directed at employees</a>, one of the only pieces of communication EA has released since the deal was announced, the company claims, “There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction.” Amid concerns about the abysmal human rights record of Saudi Arabia, where same-sex relationships are outlawed, EA has stopped short of reaffirming its long-standing commitment to inclusivity, which included asserting “<a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-trans-rights-star-wars-jedi-survive-apex-legends-res-1848998351">Trans Rights Are Human Rights</a>” as some US states pushed anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in 2022.</p>

 <p>“Andrew Wilson basically said ‘f you’ to all women and LGTBQ employees at EA with this deal,” one current EA employee <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners-deal">told <em>Game File</em> this week</a>. “It just shows how many people have been collateral this past year for executives to make out rich. Nothing feels great. And we know, when the deal closes, it’s going to get worse before it gets better, if better is even possible.” A separate employee, also speaking anonymously, reiterated those concerns to <em>Kotaku</em>.&nbsp;“Members of the Pride Employee Working Group are currently being very vocal about our concerns for our future,” they told me. “We’re worried LGBTQ content will be deprioritized or cut entirely and that LGBTQ and especially trans employees will be on the chopping block. Few of us feel heard right now.”</p> <p>There’s also concerns about what the new ownership arrangement will mean for EA’s ongoing push around generative AI. It was a big part of the company’s pitch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">at its 2024 Investor Day</a>. At the time, CEO Andrew Wilson said AI was “the very core of our business” and “not merely a buzzword,” claiming there were over 100 “novel AI projects” the publisher was experimenting with to improve how it made games. These lofty promises have reemerged in light of the Saudi deal.</p> <h2>Banking on an AI revolution that may never arrive</h2> <p>Reporting on the sale earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">the<em> Financial Times</em> wrote,</a> “investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in coming years,” according to people involved in the transaction. It continued, “The deal is a huge bet that artificial intelligence can significantly cut EA’s operating costs, allowing the equity consortium to manage a large debt load on a company that historically carried limited net debt.”</p>

 <p>Some employees <em>Kotaku</em> has spoken with say EA has continued beating the drum of AI over the last 12 months, but with varying degrees of urgency. While developers are encouraged to experiment with AI tools as much as they can, none reported being forced to implement them directly into their workflows. At the same time, AI is being incorporated into customer service management, something the company behind microtransaction-fueled sports franchises does a lot of. Where some players might have been routed to humans for help with things like Terms of Service violation reviews in the past, their complaints may no be routed first to AI agents instead.</p> <p>The Saudi deal is the second-biggest gaming merger ever. The first, Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, faced a surprising and prolonged level of scrutiny among regulators in the U.S. and abroad, including an entire lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission. That was under the Biden Administration, however, which made anti-trust enforcement a priority for the federal government. Under the pay-to-play and pay-to-win mechanics of the current Trump Administration, EA’s sale to private equity and a foreign government isn’t expected to hit so many roadblocks, especially with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as one of the buyers.</p> <p>“Kushner has a personal relationship and he has deep ties in Saudi Arabia. He is very comfortable operating in the Middle East. It created a basis of trust,” one source <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>.&nbsp;“We are in a regulatory environment that is welcoming of [Saudi Arabia]. We are not in what was the previous regime,” said another. And according to a third: “What regulator is going to say no to the president’s son-in-law?”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-2025%E2%80%99s-coolest-looking-games-now-has-a-demo.1314070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> may not have a release date yet, but it does have a demo. The coolest-looking Marvel game in years, and a game many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are excited to play later this year, now has a small demo up on Steam letting you play the superhero brawler alone or with a few pals.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013980/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion_Demo/">Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu announced and released a free, playable demo</a> for the upcoming <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>. The demo contains two full levels with boss fights, supports both local and online co-op, and features nine playable characters: Rocket Raccoon, Nova, Phyla-Vell, She-Hulk, Venom, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Storm, and Captain America. Here’s a new trailer for the demo:</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced earlier this year</a> during a Nintendo Direct,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is a side-scrolling 2D retro-inspired beat ’em up being developed by the same studio behind the extremely tubular and awesome <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler.&nbsp;<em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past games, is a snappy and action-packed retro throwback. I played the new demo on Steam for a few minutes and immediately had a blast smashing baddies as She-Hulk and Spider-Man. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">Swapping between the two, which is this game’s big gimmick</a>, was great as it let me switch between Spider-Man’s fast and agile action during some segments and She-Hulk’s heavy hits during fights with tougher foes. I did encounter some performance dips, which wasn’t ideal, but hopefully those issues get ironed out when the game launches…eventually.</p>

 <p>While there are nine characters in the demo, that’s not the game’s full line-up. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to include a large roster of 15 characters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-new-heroes-marvel-cosmic-invasion-full-roster-black-panther-ghost-rider-2000626521">We know 12 of the 15 characters</a> that will be playable at launch. Three more have yet to be revealed.</p>

 <p>Now the bad news for console players: The new <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> demo isn’t available on Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch. This has understandably disappointed many players online, with some jumping into the comments of the trailer above to share their frustration.</p> <p>Regardless, we shouldn’t have to wait long, as <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to arrive in 2025. Exactly when hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s not much time left in the year so if it’s not getting delayed, the game is likely weeks away from launching on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sweet Side Of Pokémon Card Collecting That Scalpers Can’t Steal]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sweet-side-of-pok%C3%A9mon-card-collecting-that-scalpers-can%E2%80%99t-steal.1314067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Although I’ve sought out a handful of cards featuring my favorite monsters and characters, I generally only pay casual attention to the </span><i><span>Pokémon Trading Card Game</span></i><span>.&nbsp; I grew up with a giant cardboard box of old cards under my bed, but as an adult, I can’t imagine putting in half the time or money I did into it as a kid. It just seems like it would be too much hassle, and that’s not to mention everything that happens around the game. When I do hear stories about the TCG, they’re usually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>stories of controversy</span></a><span>. Images of people nearly destroying the Van Gogh Museum in order to get exclusive cards and merchandise to sell online, as well as grown-ass men fighting and camping out for cards outside of GameStops, are seared into my brain. This toxic, predatory side of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>has pushed a lot of people out of the space</span></a><span>, as memories of excitement at finding your favorite card have been replaced by stories of scams and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241"><span>robberies</span></a><span>. That was how it was for me until fairly recently, when I saw a video from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>vendor @beard_dad_cardz having an extremely sweet interaction with a girl named Sophia at a card show.</span></p>   <p><span>As a fan of his streams, Sophia is excited to be at beard_dad_cardz’s booth, and his viewers are so excited about her excitement that they donate so she can get a card she likes. She says she’s a fan of Umbreon and Espeon, and after she finds a card of the dark-type Eeveelution she likes, beard_dad_cardz gives it to her for free. The moment went viral on multiple social media apps and has accumulated over 17.8 million views on TikTok alone.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card vendors have taken up content creation as an extension of their business, and that means several of them livestream from card shows and capture moments like this regularly. You wouldn’t know it from the news, but there’s a lot of kindness, charity, and community in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards that often gets drowned out by the worst bad actors. And as the stigma around the space has grown, creators and vendors like Chris Daywalt, the owner of HLD Cards and Collectibles, are trying to combat these notions by putting these moments of kindness on the internet, where people can see them.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The rise of videos where you’re seeing people scalping Costco for cards or doing things like that, that’s going to happen any time you really shine a spotlight on something, especially something as big as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,” Daywalt told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “When people start hearing money around it, those people are going to come out of the woodwork. They did the same thing to sneakers and to Supreme clothes, video cards, and PSIs, anything else that they feel like they can make a quick dollar on, but I think what makes </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>different is the 30 years of community that’s been built around it.”</span></p>

    <p><span>Daywalt started HLD as a way to connect with his son Henry, whom the shop and channel are named after. Henry returned from a summer camp trip with his first set of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, which led to the father and son bonding over their collections. Daywalt says this ignited a passion in his son to start collecting and gave them a common interest, as Daywalt has been a lifelong TCG player, and grew up playing and trading with others.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I always used to say ‘I play </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> for the gathering,’ and so I really knew the community part of it before I knew the reselling part of it,” Daywalt said.</span></p> <p><span>What started as an opportunity for Daywalt to pass on his values around taking care of something and finding community quickly became a family business after his brother started making content out of their card show appearances, and his wife started handling other aspects of the business. Daywalt says he’s comfortable sharing this with his son because in his experience, the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community sticks to the messages of kindness the franchise touts. There are still some bad actors that try to take advantage of others, though, which is why Daywalt </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hldcardsandcollectibles/video/7545145575449152799?lang=en"><span>doesn’t do “trade-ups,</span></a><span>” or card exchanges in which the card the event attendee receives is of greater value than the one they part with, with adults, but will do them with kids.</span></p>

   <p><span>Promoting those good moments is why a lot of vendors are branching out into content creation. Sure, it’s another extension of the business and also works as viral marketing, but the narrative of bad actors dominating the space has become so prevalent that long-time fans feel protective of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and the space they’ve cultivated, and want to push back. Aaron Lee, one of the co-founders of Duckbird, grew up watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime and has memories of waiting for new episodes to premiere on WBTV back in the day. As such, he’s been in the space long enough to have encountered people engaged in shady practices at card shows time and time again. However, he says a lot of these are less common at in-person events than one might think, and he especially experiences them less in his small North Carolina town.</span></p>

 <p><span>“You’ll see people who you can tell are, like, obviously there to make a quick buck,” Lee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “There will be even kids and adults who are obviously there trying to make money essentially; taking advantage of vendors and whatnot, and have their kids try to do a trade-up challenge to get them a better card. That’s a big one that I’ve seen a lot, and that has come from a lot of influencers or YouTube content creators being able to do that. But if it’s, you know, someone who knows what they’re doing and[is] just trying to take advantage of people, that’s something that’s not so fun.”</span></p>   <p><span>For Lee and his partner, “Duck,” trying to make people feel welcome at card shows is important. Lee says that the pair tries to give free stuff to kids who show up, especially if they seem to be in the early days of their own collection journey.</span></p> <p><span>“We kind of do like a rock-paper-scissors game, but we use Poké Balls with different types [of Pokémon], and we give them free packs if they win,” Lee says. “Even if they lose, we still give them free packs. We’ll do coin flips with kids for free, and then even if they lose, we’ll keep flipping until they win. So it’s stuff like that to just make sure that anybody who we feel like is new to the hobby or is genuinely passionate about collecting is able to have a positive experience when they go to a show or if they stop by our stream. Anything to just let them know,&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>‘Hey, there are still people out there who really enjoy the space and just want to grow the community in the right direction.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Stories of vendors going out of their way to help kids get cards they’re looking for are pretty common at these events. Which is why, despite all the talk of big money in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>these days, a lot of the biggest transactions are completely free.</span></p> <p><span>“I had people who were trying to find a card for a kid who’s looking for, like, a specific Pikachu card,” Lee said. “They’ll tell their buddies and their buddies will tell their buddies, and then the whole show will be searching for a card and bringing it to the kid. Half the time, they give it to the kid for free. It really just depends on where you are and who you talk with, but I would say like 80 to 90 percent of vendors that you see in real life are kind. They go out of their way to help the kid out or help somebody out when they’re looking for something specific. I see a lot of kindness with vendors when, sometimes, you might be trying to trade a card in that might not necessarily move as well. A lot of times, vendors will match the card 100 percent and just give the kid what they want, just to help the kid out. That’s where it starts, when you’re a kid and you don’t really wanna look at this in a monetary way. You just want to collect cards. You can really tell if a kid is just trying to collect cards, you know, versus trying to make some money. And that’s what I like to see.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with all these positive stories, piercing through all the constant reports of crimes and the viral moments showing scalpers acting a fool at major events can feel impossible. When I asked Daywalt what advice he’d give to someone trying to enter the space, he said the average collector and vendor is not going to be making thousands of dollars off these cards, and if you go into the hobby expecting that, you’re likely going to be disappointed.</span></p> <p><span>“If it’s about the money, go trade stocks or work in finance,” Daywalt says. “What I always say to people is that the reason I don’t necessarily worry if the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>market crashes tomorrow is because I’ll look at it as an opportunity to go get all the cards I wanted. They have a value to me outside of what a TCG player says the market value is. Don’t put that pressure on something, you know, buy it because you like it and it’s something that brings you joy intrinsically, not extrinsically, because it could make you some money.”</span></p>   <p><span>Lee echoed the sentiment and said that some of the best cards are ones you won’t find selling for three or more figures, and if you aren’t interested in the art or community, there are easier ways to make money.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We get tons of people coming up asking for particular Pokémon because they want to collect all of that Pokémon,” Lee says. “Then if it’s a less popular Pokémon like Dunsparce, then, you know, the cards aren’t gonna be as expensive, and it makes for a really fun time.”</span></p> <p><span>Daywalt says that even after the time he’s put into buying, selling, and collecting, HLD isn’t paying his family’s bills, and that every dollar they make at these shows is going back into the business. While he admits he does get invested in predicting the market, he encourages people who are hoping to find the golden ticket in a Target booster pack to interrogate whether they’re in it for the right reasons.</span></p> <p><span>“There’s a lot of knowledge and a lot of really sharp people that are already in the space, and you’re not going to catch up to them tomorrow,” Daywalt says. “I don’t care how many YouTube videos you watch or how many articles you read about it. If you want to get into this space, do it because it brings you joy. Do what you like, and make the money a secondary part of it if it’s important to you.”</span></p>   <p><span>After talking to vendors and seeing these kinds of wholesome interactions online, I still don’t know that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card collecting is for me. I have a collection of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371">Raichu</a> and Professor Turo cards on my shelf, and I think that’s probably enough. But after seeing the uptick in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card scams and content mills over the past few years, it was disheartening for a while to know a series that had brought me so much joy had become a symbol of predatory greed. At the very least, it’s comforting to know that some people are keeping the childlike wonder alive, and that they’re posting reminders of it online.</span></p>
