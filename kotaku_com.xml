              <p data-start="0" data-end="426">Spring cleaning is too far away. You need to stay on top of it all year long. Tidying up once a week keeps things manageable, and with the right tool, it doesn’t have to feel like a chore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, Amazon has the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for a whopping 55% off, dropping the price from $600 down to just $270.</a> That’s a $340 savings — not bad for one of the best vacuums in the game.</p>
<p data-start="428" data-end="887">The Dyson V9 Motorbar is designed to make cleaning easier and actually kind of satisfying. Weighing in at just 4.6 pounds, it’s lightweight, ergonomic, and easy to maneuver around the house. Whether you’re tackling the floors, reaching up to dust the top of your curtains, or squeezing into tricky corners, this thing moves effortlessly with you. It works on just about any surface from hardwood and tile to carpet and transitions smoothly between them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="889" data-end="1212">Need to clean a tight area? The Dyson V9 can quickly transform into a handheld vacuum, making it super versatile. You can take it outside to clean your car, tidy up the couch, or get crumbs out of those hard-to-reach crevices in the kitchen. It’s powerful enough for the big jobs yet compact enough for the quick ones.</p>
<p data-start="1214" data-end="1546">Since it’s cordless, you won’t have to deal with the constant unplug-replug routine as you move from room to room. The rechargeable battery gives you up to 40 minutes of run time, which is more than enough to handle most homes. Once you’re done, just dock it on the wall-mounted charger and let it power back up for next time.</p>
<p data-start="1548" data-end="1756">Emptying the bin is simple too. No need to get your hands dirty; just pull the release handle over a trash can, and the bottom pops open to drop out all the debris. It’s quick, clean, and easy.</p>


<h2>Hassle-free Hair Control</h2>
<p data-start="1758" data-end="2078">And if you’re dealing with pets (or just a lot of hair), the Dyson V9 Motorbar really shines. It includes a hair screw tool with a clever conical design that prevents long hairs from getting caught, wrapped up around the brush. That means less maintenance and more effective cleaning on pet beds, car seats, stairs, and couches.</p>
<p data-start="2080" data-end="2274" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">If you’ve been putting off cleaning because it feels like too much work, maybe it’s time to get a vacuum that actually makes it easy.. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, the Dyson V9 Motorbar is more than half off, sitting at just $270 for a limited time.</a></p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="586">If you’ve been thinking about hitting the gym more consistently or finally trying to get better sleep, there’s one simple secret to success… tracking your progress. Data doesn’t lie, and it’s one of the best ways to actually measure improvement and stay motivated. Whether you’re looking to crush your fitness goals or figure out what’s messing with your sleep, having a smartwatch that keeps tabs on your habits can make all the difference. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">Right now, Amazon’s running a deal on the Apple Watch SE (3rd Gen), making it a solid opportunity to upgrade your routine for less cash.</a></p>
<p data-start="588" data-end="925">Normally priced at $249, the 40mm Apple Watch SE is now 20% off, bringing the total down by $49 to just $200. If you prefer a slightly larger display, the 44mm model is also part of the sale. It’s usually $279, but the price has been slashed by $50, which means you can grab it for only $230 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="927" data-end="1260">For those who want to stay connected without carrying their phone everywhere, the cellular versions unfortunately not part of the discount. The 40mm cellular model is still sitting at $299, while the 44mm cellular model is hanging back at $329.</p>
<p data-start="1262" data-end="1568">The third-generation Apple Watch SE comes with an OLED Retina display that’s bright and clear, even under direct sunlight. With up to 1,000 nits of brightness, your screen stays easy to read whether you’re checking your pace when out on a run or glancing at notifications while getting a workout in at the gym.</p>


<h2>Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2068">When it comes to fitness, the SE acts like a personal trainer on your wrist. You can log workouts in the Health app, monitor your heart rate, and keep track of your daily steps. It’s genuinely satisfying to close those tri-colored activity rings each day. It’s kind of like keeping a streak alive on Duolingo or Wordle, but for your health. Plus, the watch includes safety features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and Emergency SOS, which could literally save your life in an accident.</p>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2068">The Apple Watch SE is also swimproof up to 50 meters, so it’s great for laps in the pool, open-water swims, or even a full-on triathlon.</p>
<p data-start="2070" data-end="2328">The Sleep app gives you detailed insights into your sleep stages, showing when you’re awake, in core sleep, or in REM. That data can help you tweak your nighttime routine and actually wake up feeling refreshed instead of groggy.</p>
<p data-start="2474" data-end="2733" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">You can snag the 3rd-gen Apple Watch SE in midnight black or starlight white, starting at just $200</a>. Whether you’re trying to push your workouts further or finally take control of your sleep, this deal is a pretty great reason to make the upgrade.</p>
