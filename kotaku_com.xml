Melee </em>Major tournament when both got caught in the fire forest phase of Pokémon Stadium. With both players separated by one of the obstacles, they twitched back and forth, biding their time to see who would make the first move. It ended up being Pratt, though perhaps not in the way he intended. A rare glitch saw <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/mang0/clip/DoubtfulBoringMushroomWOOP-EOx2mIS8XoYHgZ-R&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mang0/clip/DoubtfulBoringMushroomWOOP-EOx2mIS8XoYHgZ-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">him accidentally fall straight through the level</a></span>, cementing Schwab’s victory and the $2,000 first place prize. </p><p>The glitch is triggered by wavedashing, a physics exploit common in high-level <em>Melee</em> that lets players maneuver quickly without leaving them vulnerable. Doing so around the tree in the fire forest phase of the Pokémon Stadium stage, however, opens players up to an uncommon but well-known glitch that will send them falling through the level geometry. Guest commentator Juan “Hungrybox” Debiedma, who lost to Pratt earlier in the tournament, even mentioned the possibility on air, just moments before it unfolded on-screen.</p><p>“There’s just no way LMAO,” Pratt <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/moky_dokie/status/1924255114040402380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/moky_dokie/status/1924255114040402380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a></span> after the match. Not everyone is convinced it was an accident, however. How could a player as skilled and experienced as Pratt succumb to such a one-in-a-million bug? Did he lose that way on purpose because it would be funny, or to prove a point about why certain levels should be banned? Then again, is a briefly viral Twitch clip really worth $2,000? In this economy?</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
