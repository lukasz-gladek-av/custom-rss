              <p>The next <em>Skate</em> game from EA, which is often called <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-full-circle-free-to-play-microtransactions-1849179812"><em>Skate 4</em></a> online by fans, is set to arrive via an early access launch later this year. And in a new blog from the devs behind the reboot, we learned that music is a big part of the upcoming skateboarding game and that a whole lotta people will be able to play it together online.</p> <p>This new <em>Skate</em> game was first officially announced all the way back <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate-game-1844087679">in June 2020</a>. And over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">the game has leaked numerous times</a> while EA has also <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-pre-alpha-gameplay-video-full-circle-session-1849131150">released official early footage of it</a> and brought in fans to playtest it. The development of <em>Skate</em> (which is not called<em> Skate 4</em> for some reason) has been remarkably transparent, and as part of this, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle">developers Full Circle</a> have released regular blog posts sharing new details about the reboot. And in the latest one, the devs shared a bunch of information on how music‚Äìa very important part of any good skateboarding game‚Äìwill work in <em>Skate</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö®We will be inviting all registered skate. Insiders to come playtest in July. Check your emails.</p> <p>The latest build has improved textures and lighting, more challenges, and changes to our progression system. <a href="https://t.co/fyjxtOj3qi">pic.twitter.com/fyjxtOj3qi</a></p> <p>‚Äî skate. (@skate) <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1935027470480330760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five">In the most recent installment of ‚ÄúThe Grind,‚Äù</a> EA and Full Circle announced that <em>Skate</em> will launch with ‚Äúabout 100‚Äù songs. These songs will be grouped into different, themed playlists that will act like radio stations. Players will be free to like songs and create their own playlist of favorites. There will also be a playlist that will feature songs other players are listening to and liking, which will update over time. As for what kind of music to expect in <em>Skate</em>, Full Circle says the team is ‚Äúfocused on emerging artists‚Äù and that they included some ‚Äúdeep cuts‚Äù that the devs hope will help players ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù new favorites.</p>

 <p>EA and Full Circle also plan to add new songs to the game as it changes live-service seasons every three months. It also sounds like music that‚Äôs less popular with players might leave the game, but EA says it will make sure that the tracks you favorite and enjoy stick around in <em>Skate</em> ‚Äúfor longer.‚Äù</p> <p>While losing music is a bit of a shame, I‚Äôm excited to hear devs promising regular music updates. With live-service games that players are expected to play for months or years, new music being added over time can help reinvigorate things. There are only so many times you can hear the same tunes over and over before starting to hate them. As someone who has played <em>GTA Online</em> for over a decade, trust me on this.</p> <p>In the latest blog post, the devs also said that the team is aiming for about 150 players per server session. And yes, in case you forgot or weren‚Äôt aware, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-no-offline-mode-always-online-2025-1851777885"><em>Skate</em> is an always-online free-to-play skating game</a>, so multiplayer is a big part of the equation. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skate4/comments/1ln0xu4/comment/n0c50t1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Over on Reddit</a>, players who have been involved in playtesting have suggested that servers only supported 80 players during their time with the game, but that EA wanted to up that number to 150, which the blog confirms. 150 players is a lot, so hopefully <em>Skate</em>‚Äòs open world is large enough to support all those skateboarding hooligans listening to music and popping kick flips.</p> <p><em>Skate 4</em> aka the <em>Skate</em> reboot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-reboot-release-date-early-access-2025-pc-ps5-1851650367">doesn‚Äôt have a specific release date yet</a>, but EA says it will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via early access at the end of the summer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-reviews-wuchang-fallen-feather-china-language-filter-2000618249</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-makes-a-big-change-to-how-review-scores-are-calculated.1273134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Valve is overhauling how Steam reviews are displayed in a new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904529?l=english">it announced on Monday</a>. The percentage score usually assigned to games based on the number of positive and negative user reviews will now exclude reviews written in other languages. The change comes as Steam becomes an increasingly popular global PC storefront and routine review-bombing from players in specific regions can torpedo a game‚Äôs rating for everyone on the platform.</p> <p>‚ÄúSteam‚Äôs growth since then into an even larger global presence means customers in different regions of the world may have vastly different experiences from each other for the same game,‚Äù Valve explained <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904529?l=english">in a new blog post</a>. ‚ÄúThere are a variety of reasons this may happen for a particular game, including translation issues, cultural references, poor network connections, and many others; things that the Overall Review Scores haven‚Äôt been able to capture until now. Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distill the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups.‚Äù</p> <p>Not every game will be impacted by the changes. Valve said it will only start calculating ‚Äúlanguage-specific review scores‚Äù for games with at least 2,000 total publicly visible user reviews, and at least 200 written in a particular language. Players can now click through the review score section of a game‚Äôs Steam store page to get a breakdown of the scores across different languages. While this will now be the default mode for review scores on Steam, everyone will still have the option to toggle back to the old system.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúWe realize that whenever we make changes to User Reviews, we‚Äôre inviting some scrutiny into our motivations for making those changes,‚Äù Valve wrote. ‚ÄúMaintaining trust in the system is crucial to us, so we‚Äôve erred on the side of being as transparent as possible.‚Äù</p> <p>The move comes just days after one of Steam‚Äôs bigger releases of the season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-mod-censorship-1-4-2000618179"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a>, implemented controversial changes to the game following apparent pushback from some Chinese fans over historical references in the fictional Soulslike. While it‚Äôs unclear if that game factored into this new policy at all, games on Steam increasingly get review-bombed for all sorts of reasons that don‚Äôt always necessarily have to do with the underlying functionality or experience, from allegations of using generative AI to complaints of terms of service requirements in places like Europe.</p> <p>Data from <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/4-great-graphs-and-1-new-feature">Simon Carless‚Äô<em> Game Discover</em> newsletter</a> earlier this year showed that a plurality of Steam users in 2024 had ‚Äúsimplified Chinese‚Äù as their primary language on the platform, followed narrowly by English in second place. Over the summer, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eos-prosperity-china-steam-reviews-1851782983">briefly review-bombed</a> after an apparent translation error led Chinese players to feel cheated by one of the game‚Äôs weekly mission objectives. The latest changes to review scores seem like an attempt by Valve to keep those two audiences separate, at least when it comes to rating new games.</p>

              <p><span>The Marvel universe is so vast that games like hero shooter </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-eomm-steam-reviews-max-payne-remake-n64-2000617137"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span> and fighting game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-vs-capcom-state-of-play-ps5-1851783734"><i><span>Marvel T≈çkon: Fighting Souls</span></i></a> <span>already have a virtually endless bucket of characters to draw on for their growing rosters. Nevertheless, it sounds like NetEase is at least considering making its own original heroes for </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>at some point. You know, if that was something you ever thought about.</span></p> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals"><i><span>MP1st</span></i></a><span> asked </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>director Guangyun ‚ÄúGuangguang‚Äù Chen if NetEase had considered adding heroes of its own to fight alongside Marvel staples like the Avengers and the Fantastic Four in a future season. After all, other Marvel projects like the MCU movies have created new characters. Would it be out of the question for </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>to also indulge in making people up to capture an objective or push a payload? Well, Chen says that Marvel has given the team the green light to do that. While he told </span><i><span>MP1st </span></i><span>the team is ‚Äúallowed to introduce original characters,‚Äù Chen played coy when asked if any are coming down the pipeline, merely saying ‚Äústay tuned.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maybe my immediate aversion to this is just because </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>isn‚Äôt even a year old yet, and the thought that someone‚Äôs favorite comic book mainstay could get sidelined for some OC cooked up in the NetEase offices feels bad. However, Luna Snow, one of the most popular characters in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>,</span> <span>also started as an original character in the mobile game </span><i><span>Marvel Future Fight</span></i><span>, which has been a point of contention considering all the attention she gets in terms of cosmetics compared to fan-favorite heroes who originate from the comics. I don‚Äôt doubt some interesting heroes might come out of this, but you‚Äôre still covering the classics, NetEase, so I hope any original characters you might introduce come after you‚Äôve spent a bit more time filling out the roster with established heroes people are still waiting for.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For more on </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, check out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>‚Äôs review</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p><span>I like horror movies okay, but I need a good concept to draw me in. </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span> certainly has one of those, but the concept that makes it compelling is also one that taps into my most </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nickname-pet-name-go-black-white-legends-arceus-1850392164"><span>deep seated fears</span></a><span>, and I don‚Äôt know if I can handle it. As the name suggests, </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is a spooky movie whose events are viewed from the perspective of a dog. Aren‚Äôt we as humans subjected to the horrors enough? Do we need to bring our canine companions into the pain and suffering?</span></p> <p><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>premiered at South by Southwest way back in March, and the reception to the supernatural horror movie has been </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_boy_2025"><span>really strong so far</span></a><span>, with early reviews </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/good-boy-movie-horror-movie-review-dog-pov-1235102488/"><span>calling it one of the best in the genre this year</span></a><span>. Though I don‚Äôt know where it all ends up, several reviews call out that it‚Äôs very emotional and heartbreaking‚Äîwhich could mean anything, really‚Äîso if you‚Äôre looking for a straightforward scare, be aware that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>might have a bit more going on. The film stars Indy as a dog whose owner has suffered a death in the family and who moves into a haunted house. Ever the watchful companion, Indy notices that something is amiss and he and his owner are not alone. Now, he has to do what he can to save his owner from the dangers lurking in their new home.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Good Boy - Official Trailer | HD | IFC Films" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4-CRkd_74g?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Y‚Äôall, I‚Äômma throw up. There‚Äôs a reason Does the Dog Die?, an entire website dedicated to </span><a href="https://www.doesthedogdie.com/"><span>asking if a dog you see in movie trailers is going to die</span></a><span>, exists, and it‚Äôs for people like me who can‚Äôt handle that shit. There‚Äôs already a page for </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>on that website and I saw it as I was grabbing the link. I can barely handle seeing a dog be in distress under normal circumstances, much less supernatural ones. Whether Indy makes it out or not, he‚Äôs about to have a bad night. I guess I‚Äôve got some time to figure out if I want to see </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, as the movie is coming to theaters on October 3. </span></p>

              <p>The second season of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon Prime‚Äôs live-action <em>Fallout</em> show</a> arrives later this year, but before then, we have some new images of the post-apocalyptic series, and one in particular featuring a shot of Las Vegas before the bombs dropped and turned it into <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-series-prime-new-vegas-canon-1851410280">New Vegas</a> is very, very intriguing.</p> <p>On August 18, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/fallout-first-photos-season-2-1236489897/">Amazon shared seven new images</a>&nbsp;of the upcoming season of its hit <em>Fallout</em> TV show. The new screenshots show a variety of characters and locations, but the one that immediately caught my eye was a single shot of Howard Cooper (Walton Goggins) in a car driving down the Las Vegas Strip. (After the bombs fall, it becomes New Vegas.) In the window is a reflection of the Lucky 38‚Äôs large and iconic sign, first seen in <a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346">2010‚Äôs <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>.</a> In the show, Cooper survives the bombs falling and becomes the decaying bounty hunter known only as the Ghoul. But before that, he had a life pre-war that intersected with Vault-Tec and the company‚Äôs nefarious plans. And now it seems like he might have met Mr. House, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-tv-mr-house-new-vegas-1851559169">a villain from <em>New Vegas</em> who was teased back in season one</a>. Okay, <em>Fallout</em> season two, you have my attention.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618243"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618243">¬©Amazon / Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>The other teaser images released by Amazon include looks at Ella Purnell‚Äôs loveable Lucy and Aaron Morten‚Äôs Maximus. We also see Lucy‚Äôs dad, played by Kyle MacLachlan, who was revealed to be a pretty bad guy at the end of the show‚Äôs first season. He ran off in a power suit to New Vegas, and it seems we‚Äôll be catching up with him later this year. Of course, this isn‚Äôt <em>actually</em> the first time we‚Äôve seen some of this stuff, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-new-vegas-set-leaks-lucky-38-amazon-1851768855">as set leaks earlier this year</a> hinted at some pre-war flashbacks set in Las Vegas.</p>     <p>Last year, after premiering in April, the <em>Fallout</em> series received rave reviews, big ratings, and lots of award nominations, leading to a spike in people playing old <em>Fallout</em> games. Amazon quickly announced a second season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573">which wrapped up filming in May</a>. The highly anticipated new season of <em>Fallout</em> arrives on Amazon Prime this December, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-new-vegas-season-3-ghoul-lucy-1851780416">the show has already been picked up for a third season</a>. Here‚Äôs a teaser for the show‚Äôs second season:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fallout Season 2 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tu5EN8V35JM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>
