The SD cards the games were installed on were tiny while the plastic surrounding them was exponentially bigger. Most cases didn’t even come with anything else inside. I’ve enjoyed collecting them but they were a huge waste. According to a new leak, the Switch 2 cases might be even worse.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196181,196230" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The biggest takeaway <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">from the Switch 2 reveal last month</a></span> was that everything about the new console is bigger. Bigger Joy-Con controllers, bigger screen, bigger <em>Mario Kart</em> races. And it sounds like the game cases might be bigger too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.co/9p2UZtCGQI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.co/9p2UZtCGQI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Universo Nintendo</em></a></span> editor Felipe Lima <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1877464328762269832&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1877464328762269832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported in January</a></span> that French retailer FNAC had accidentally leaked the dimensions for a Take-Two Switch 2 game at 5.12 inches wide and 7.7 inches tall. </p><p>Then last week, Switch 2 subreddit user HertzBurst <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1icr469/switch_2_boxart_size_comparison_via_leaked/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1icr469/switch_2_boxart_size_comparison_via_leaked/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made an artistic rendering</a></span> to show just how much bigger this roughly 43-percent increase in case size would look. If these new dimensions are accurate, and not just an error or placeholder, they would make Switch 2 game cases even taller than PS5 cases, which are only 6.7 inches tall. Those cases hold Blu-ray discs, though. While they’re often similarly devoid of game manuals and other inserts, at least in that case the box is barely much bigger than the thing it’s holding.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, will presumably feature SD cartridges similar in size, if not identical to, the existing ones. What could Nintendo possibly need all of this extra space for? Is it really that afraid of people walking into GameStop or Walmart and accidentally buying a Switch 2 game for a Switch 1 or vice-versa? Or will the new console usher in a new golden age of game cases bursting with maps, posters, and other cool stuff?</p><p>I still remember buying games for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566">my original Switch on launch day</a></span>. I opened up <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and it was empty except for a small rectangular nugget of plastic. <em>The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+</em>, on the other hand, came with stickers and a beautiful little gold booklet directly inspired by the manual for the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em> on NES. It felt complete. My obsession with buying games physically was rewarded. </p><p>Somehow I don’t think the Switch 2 games will, on average at least, do the same. But if these really are the specs, then surely Nintendo has to shove something else in there, doesn’t it? The company wouldn’t just ship millions of bigger plastic shells all over the world with nothing but tiny cartridges inside? Right? Right??</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And that’s cool I guess, but why did they include a very overused  sound effect of kids laughing? And why does it pop up not just once, but <em>twice </em>in the 15-second clip? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106">As announced last February</a></span>, Marvel’s upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766">MCU</a></span> reboot of the Fantastic Four is set to hit theaters this July.

Since that announcement last year, we’ve not seen much else of <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>. But that changed today with a small teaser that also contains a really annoying sound effect. </p><p>On February 3, Marvel teased a trailer because it’s 2025 and that’s just a normal thing we have to deal with now. In the short teaser we see some kids running and laughing as they try to cram themselves in front of an array of TVs in the display window of a 1960's store. The televisions are preparing to show a rocket launch involving Marvel’s famous family. I hope nothing bad happens! We’ll see more in the full trailer tomorrow. </p><p>But instead of enjoying this little teaser for the new <em>Fantastic Four </em>movie, I was distracted immediately by a sound effect I’ve heard oh so many times before. You’ve undoubtedly heard this sound effect, too. It’s a group of kids laughing in a weird, somewhat unnatural way and it’s popped up in games, movies, TV shows, commercials, trailers, and songs. </p><p>This sound effect is known as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Group Kids Laug PE143601</a></span>" and was found on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Premiere Edition Volume 1</a></span> sound effects library produced by Hollywood Edge in 1990. This sound effect, which was originally recorded in 1983 for <em>Indiana Jones and the</em> <em>Temple of Doom</em>, has appeared in a very long list of movies, TV shows, and more since it was added to that sound effect library in the ‘90s. And weirdly, it keeps getting used decades later. Here’s a clip from the Netflix animated show <em>Wonderoos</em> that contains the laughing kids: </p><p>Apparently, this effect (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598">like the Wilhelm Scream</a></span>) has just become a standard option for sound engineers and designers in Hollywood. As someone who instantly recognizes this sound effect the moment it pops up in a movie or game, its continued use in 2025 is annoying. </p><p>And to bring this back to the <em>Fantastic Four</em> teaser, I’m honestly shocked and perplexed that the marketing folks behind it decided to include the effect twice in such a short clip. I’d bet money that in the full movie this sound effect won’t be used twice in such a short timespan (it might not even appear at all) as it’s really distracting and noticeable when it plays back to back like that. </p><p>Anyway, I guess I’ll listen out for this annoying sound effect when<em> Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> arrives in theaters on July 25, 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
