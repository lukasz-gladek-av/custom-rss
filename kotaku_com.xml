            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When first-party video game controllers finally cut the cord to embrace their wireless future in the PS3/Xbox 360 era, Sony chose the path of built-in rechargeable lithium batteries over Xbox’s AA-battery solution. While rechargeable battery kits would become available for 360 controllers and beyond, Sony stuck to its built-in solution. It looks like that may be changing soon, however, if some leaks are to be believed.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/384532/nowe-ps5-pro-i-kontrolery-dualsense-z-pozadana-funkcja-zdradzamy-szczegoly.html">Polish-language site <i>PPE</i></a>, credentialed leaker Graczdari has spilled the beans on an upcoming update to the DualSense controllers Sony plans to ship with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-new-ps5-pro-model-has-been-leaked-and-its-releasing-soon/">a new, more energy-efficient PS5 Pro that seems to be on the horizon</a>. Grains of salt and all, this same leaker accurately called <i>Flight Simulator</i>’s arrival on Sony hardware and the physical release of <i>Oblivion Remastered</i>.</p>

 <h2>What kinds of batteries will this thing take?</h2> <p>According to the leak, this revised DualSense controller is referred to internally as “V3.” What isn’t as clear is whether or not you’ll be able to shove some Duracells in here and call it a day. Our <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-is-reportedly-set-to-release-an-updated-ps5-dualsense-controller-with-a-removable-battery/">comrades over at <i>VGC</i></a> don’t seem to think so, as the language in the original report seems to suggest the batteries might be a separate product category of their own, perhaps not too dissimilar from Xbox’s rechargeable battery solution.</p> <p>PlayStation controller battery life has been a bit of a rollercoaster over the years. Veterans of the PS3 era will likely remember the DualShock 3 as being quite generous when it came to playtime. The DualShock 4, however? That battery would evaporate faster than water on Mars. The DualSense hasn’t been much of an improvement, especially with its more sophisticated rumble feature and triggers. Hopefully V3 of this otherwise very comfy controller will lengthen your time spent cordless.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As great as Apple’s products are in the performance department, a huge part of their appeal has always been, well, they’re&nbsp;<em>cool looking</em>. The latest models of the longtime favorite Mac Mini – the M4 Mac Mini and M4 Mac Mini Pro — are no exception. But it’s a third-party accessory — the amazing UGREEN dock and stand — that is the best fit possible for the M4 Mac Mini for performance and expanded capability, and it passes the good-looks test. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4387/">It’s also at an all-time low price of $61 (32% off) ahead of Amazon Prime Big Deal Days.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The UGREEN dock and stand blends in with the M4 Mac Mini so seamlessly it looks like it’s part of the Mini itself, or at least an accessory built by Apple. But as a UGREEN product, it gives you that elegant look and outstanding performance at a fraction of the price Apple would likely charge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4387/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Looks Aren’t Everything</h2>
<p>We’ve gone on long enough about the aesthetic superiority of the UGREEN Mac Mini Dock and Stand. Where it truly shines and massively overperforms its price is in what it brings to your Mini. Three additional USB-A ports at 10Gbps, two more at 5Gbps, two USB-C ports at 10Gbps, a SD and MicroSD card reader that reads and writes at a sizzling 170MB/s are instantly added to your M4 Mac Mini, all via just one unobtrusive USB-C connection to the Mini itself.</p>
<p>Then there’s the expansion opportunity — the UGREEN Mac Mini Dock and Stand has a “hidden” enclosure at the bottom of the unit that can hold an M2 NVMe SSD drive. The drive itself isn’t included (hello — $61!) but this gives you the option of adding as much as 8TB of storage to your Mini. PCI Express, NVM Express, and NVM3 M.2 drives are all compatible via an easy plug-and-play installation, and once it’s plugged in, the UGREEN dock moves data back and forth with the Mini at a staggeringly fast 10Gbps.</p>



<h2>Stand That Delivers</h2>
<p>The UGREEN covers details you wouldn’t normally consider, including conductive paint shielding for 5G avoidance and reducing Wi-Fi interference. There’s also a bottom groove in the stand for access to the power button, eliminating the only design flaw of the Mini itself — having to lift it up just to turn it on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4387/">M4 Mac Mini users are getting a pre-Prime Day bonanza with this hot 32% off deal on the UGREEN dock and stand.</a></p>

              <p>Physical editions aren’t completely dead on Xbox. Chatbots are way too alive, unfortunately. And be still my beating heart<em>, Brotato</em> is coming back from the dead after 12 months without an update. Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> is finally out today. <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040">Here’s my review from last week</a>. It’s excellent, and <a href="https://x.com/Food4Dogs/status/1972837272149233792">just like YouTuber Food4Dogs</a>, I’m in heaven this week.</p> <h2><em>Brotato</em> is coming back with new DLC</h2> <p><em>Brotato</em> is what you’d get if you combined<em> Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>. It’s a twin-stick roguelite shooter with lots of satisfying bullet hell action and a surprisingly satisfying buildcrafting journey. It came out of Early Access in 2023 and received two updates but has been radio silent for almost a year.</p>

 <p>Developer Blobfish has now handed the reins over to<em> The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> maker Evil Empire to continue <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/brotato-post-launch-development-moved-to-evil-empire">developing new content for it</a>, similar to what the latter did for<em> Dead Cells</em>. Its post-launch revival begins with a new update in October that will add, among other things, a new enemy called The Gobbler.</p>

 <h2><em>Shinobi&nbsp;: Art of Vengeance</em> is getting Dr. Robotnik in DLC</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The katana verses the axe.

The reveal comes soon after <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1971432623227666537">a patch</a> for the game fixed the blurry resolution issue on Switch 1 and 2. It’s also currently 20 percent off on Steam as part of the autumn sale.</p>

It’s also looking at <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1973005588016894122">establishing an entity in Thailand</a>.</p>

 <h2>The chatbots are taking over <em>Fortnite</em> and Windows gaming</h2> <p>Epic Games announced an <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972665777556955476">AI-powered agent</a> will be spearheading customer support for one percent of the battle royale’s players to test its capabilities. Will you be able to get it to curse like <em>Fortnite</em>‘s AI Darth Vader? Time will tell.</p>

 <p>Microsoft is also rolling out its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/29/xbox-september-update-2025/">Gaming Copilot experiment</a> to players on PC and mobile. The chatbot is supposed to be able to scan what’s on your screen as you’re playing and answer any questions. Will it actually be helpful or just tell me to “git gud” in ever more elaborate ways? The jury’s still out on that one, too.</p> <h2>The<em> Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> gets a cheaper physical release</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you've cleared two goblin caves, an underwater shipwreck, and the entire town of Hackdirt, and you still can't remember where you picked this item up. 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/9hRi8t76LG">pic.twitter.com/9hRi8t76LG</a></p> <p>— The Elder Scrolls (@ElderScrolls) <a href="https://twitter.com/ElderScrolls/status/1972668194033693093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>If you’re a fan of Bethesda RPGs and someone who prefers to collect games in boxes rather than on hard drives, you’re in luck.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As one of the longest-running survival horror series, <i>Resident Evil</i> has had somewhat of an identity struggle over its many years. Some entries have been more action-focused, while others prioritized the dread and horror many come to the genre for. The last entry, <i>Resident Evil Village</i>, arguably leaned toward the action side of the equation. But the upcoming ninth entry, <i>Requiem</i>, aims to double down on the series’ horror elements.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-they-cant-tell-if-the-games-actually-scary-anymore">Speaking with <i>IGN</i></a>, <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>’s director Koshi Nakanishi describes the series as existing on a sort of <i>Resident Evil 2</i> and <i>Resident Evil 4</i> continuum, with <i>2</i> demonstrating the series at the height of its terror as a horror franchise, and <i>4</i> representing its desire to indulge in giving you more action-based solutions to confronting cities full of the undead. “Firmly swinging the scale [for <i>Requiem</i>] toward the <i>Resident Evil 2</i> style was our intention,” Nakanishi said. “It’s almost an upgrade of that <i>Resident Evil 2</i> style.”</p>

 <h2><i>RE </i>devs on what makes a game scary: ‘we don’t even know anymore’</h2> <p>A return to horror is good news for those of us who love <i>RE</i> for the frights first and foremost, and the ability for the protagonists to aim a gun competently second. The only problem is that the devs have made so many of these games that they’re starting to lose a sense of what’s actually scary. “We can’t tell anymore,” Nakanisi said of the fright factor in <i>RE</i> games.</p> <blockquote><p>There was actually a bit of worry internally before we showed the [<i>Requiem</i>] hands-off at SGF and the first hands-on at Gamescom, was this actually scary? Because we don’t even know anymore. This is our bread and butter, what we make every day.</p></blockquote> <p>In efforts to make <i>Requiem</i> scarier, the team debated whether or not it was worth mutilating the game’s protagonist, Grace, like previous characters in the series: “What if [she] gets a big gash in her leg, or her leg gets cut off?” Nakanishi said. While we don’t exactly know what bodily harm awaits our girl, based on early footage of the game, it looks like Capcom has dialed in an appropriate amount of horror. I mean <a href="https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414">look at this friggin’ thing</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414">https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414</a></p>
