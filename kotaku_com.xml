              <p>Ubisoft has confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that it is still working on the long-in-development sci-fi sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-release-michel-ancel-1849992412"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em></a>. This follows previous reporting that the game survived Wednesday’s massive restructuring, which saw seven games canceled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">including a <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>&nbsp;remake</a>.</p> <p>On January 22, Ubisoft told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email that <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2,</em> which was first announced back in 2008 and has popped up multiple times since then, is still in development and wasn’t canceled. The company behind <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em> also reconfirmed that the<em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> franchise is still a part of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">newly restructured Ubisoft</a>. Here’s the company’s full statement:</p>

 <p>“As mentioned in yesterday’s press release,<em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> will be part of Creative House 4, dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes. <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> remains a priority for us in the context of our strategy centered around Open World Adventures,” said a Ubisoft spokesperson.</p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Uyw5x2TIuaQ"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> was first teased all the way back in 2008</a> via a trailer that seemed to feature some early gameplay. That version of the game is long gone. In 2017, <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-lives-and-its-a-prequel-1796032984?_gl=1*1dmrw0u*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcxMDMxMy4yMDYuMS4xNzI5NzEyODE5LjYwLjAuMA..">Ubisoft reannounced</a> <em>BG&amp;E2,</em> revealing that it was now a large-scale open-world sci-fi game and a prequel to the events of the 2003 action-platformer. Since then, the game has seemed trapped in development hell, <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-montpellier-assassins-creed-1850164420">losing its creative director in 2023</a>. But apparently the game is still happening. <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744">One day. Probably.</a></p>

 <p>Ubisoft didn’t share any information on when <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> will launch or what platforms to expect the open-world game on. So the wait continues.</p>

              <p>One of Nintendo’s “old guard” appears to be retiring.<em> Spare Marine 2</em>‘s new multiplayer class is almost here. And fans are expected to shell out $685 for a gaming chair that looks like it was made out of Pikachu’s skin. It’s another edition of Moring Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Hey, it’s morning somewhere, right? Here’s what an early, third-person prototype of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/2014370210115948828">supposedly looked like</a>.</p> <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was Kensuke Tanabe’s last game</h2> <p>That’s according to a new interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/">Japanese magazine <em>Nintendo Dream</em></a> that was uploaded to <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574">Weibo</a>. “Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward,” he said, according <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">to <em>VGC</em></a>. “Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms. Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.” “Ms. Tabata” refers to fellow veteran Risa Tabata, who will likely succeed him. Tanabe is 62 and his time at the <em>Mario</em> maker dates back to directing <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> escapes another round of cancellations</h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that it’s one of the ongoing projects at Ubisoft that remains safe, even if it still might not ship for a couple more years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Kotaku</em> previously reported</a> that the project had a new creative lead back in 2024. The <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> remake, meanwhile, might show up a year later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/">than previously planned</a>.</p> <h2><em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>‘s developer admits it’s confusing as hell</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">👉 Discover your ideal DLC with this flowchart and find what fits your playstyle best! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DBXV2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DBXV2</a> <a href="https://t.co/fvmPZcK2of">pic.twitter.com/fvmPZcK2of</a></p> <p>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2014260786068148303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“<em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em> has a massive selection of DLC, and choosing the right one can be overwhelming,” the game’s official X account acknowledged yesterday (via<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-dlc-overwhelming/"><em> TheGamer</em></a>). The post-launch content roadmap is so convoluted, publisher Bandai Namco even released a flowchart to guide fans on what to purchase based on what part of <em>Dragon Ball</em> they actually care about.</p>

 <h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em> reveals its next playable class</h2> <p>Techmarines will join the game in Patch 12 later this winter. “Like all classes, the Techmarine comes with a unique Combat Skill (an ‘ult,’ so to speak) and his own perk tree with 25 levels to unlock,” reads a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/21/space-marine-2-techmarine/">new post on <em>Xbox Wire</em></a>. “But more than anything, what makes him special are the mechanical arms and automatic turret bolted directly onto his Power Pack.”</p>

 <h2>The latest <em>Helldivers 2</em> update adds a new mission type</h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731129453?l=english">Patch 5.0.2 is live today</a> and brings Commando missions that place players “deep behind enemy lines where their normal reliance on air superiority is no longer an option.” The description notes that “reinforcements have to be deployed in advance and destroyer support is a risky business with limited time.” Other changes include an overhaul of suppressed weapons to make stealth more effective. There’s a new Warbond, too.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>‘s next set adds more Mega Evolution ex cards</h2> <p>After almost a year away I’m curious to come back. Maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cfNZ_qLeOc">the Fantastical Parade expansion</a> is what will make it happen. It goes live on January 29 alongside a new messaging feature and random battles mode.</p>

 <h2>Gamer chairs are so back</h2> <p>Speaking of Pokémon, Back Pain, Inc., otherwise known as Secret Lab, has revealed three <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJVbw?object_uuid=273a257b-602c-4933-a6e7-1e998d30970f&amp;t=article">new Pokémon-themed chairs</a> based on Pikachu, Gengar, and Eevee.

            <title><![CDATA[Fable Reboot Features ‘Seamless’ Open World And Is Launching This Fall]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over five years after it was first announced, we’ve finally learned a lot more about the next entry in the <em>Fable</em> series. Get ready for a big open world filled with jobs, relationships, monsters, and more. And it arrives this Fall.</p> <p>This new spin on&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, being developed by Playground Games—the same studio behind Xbox’s amazing<em>&nbsp;Forza Horizon</em>&nbsp;series—<a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-is-bringing-back-fable-1844482199">was first announced back in 2020</a>&nbsp;and is being built&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/huh-the-new-fable-runs-on-the-forza-engine-1846833080">using the same tech</a> that powered those open-world driving games. And <em>Fable</em> sounds and looks impressive as seen in Xbox’s new Developer Direct.</p> <p>Playground Games says <em>Fable</em> will feature a fully seamless open world, a first for the series. You’ll be able explore every corner of Albion at your own pace without loading screens. Well, once you get through the game’s opening tutorial, where you start as a kid and have to watch your village be attacked. It is a <em>Fable</em> game, after all. It’s just tradition.</p>

  <p>During the Dev Direct, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/">Playground Games confirmed you’ll be able to customize your character’s face and clothing</a>. And like in past games, you can interact with villagers and NPCs, even marrying them or kicking them out of houses you own. Yes, you can be a fantasy landlord in <em>Fable</em>. The worst villain of all! Don’t worry, there are jobs that you can do to earn gold and of course, heroic quests to go on via the Hero’s Guild.</p> <p>Apparently, every NPC villager is unique and will react to your wealth, past actions, style, and more. Playground is also promising that the world will react to you in big and small ways. They list one example where a character who uses magic to get massive can be killed or reasoned with, and if you decide to end the giant’s life, his massive corpse will litter the world for the rest of the game. It will even, apparently, lower the property value of nearby homes.</p>

 <p>You won’t just be marrying people, buying houses, and being a terrible landlord. <em>Fable</em> will feature combat that looks similar to other third-person action RPGs. Expect to fight familiar foes, like Balverines&nbsp;and Hobbes, while out exploring Albion. And yes, morality is a big feature in this new reboot of the RPG series, letting you be evil or good.</p>

 <p>This all sounds wild, and looks nice thanks to Playground’s <em>Forza</em>-tech powering the fantasy open world. But I won’t really believe it works until I get my hands on the <em>Fable</em> this Fall when it launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Game Pass, and PC. Though considering how many times it’s been delayed before, I’m also not convinced this RPG arrives before next year.</p>
