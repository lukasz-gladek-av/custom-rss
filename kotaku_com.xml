              <p>The latest of Steam’s creative weekly sales has just gone live, and this time it’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/detective">Detective Fest</a>. But rather than become entangled in red string as you try to pin all the available games to your enormous pinboard, we’ve inspected the selection through our microscope, whittled down the suspects, and then performed yet another detective cliche, to select the most suspicious(ly good) games for you to interrogate.</p>  <p>Investigative games have become a rather big deal in recent years, with many indie titles having broken through to the mainstream to enormous success. And, so of course, you’ve got the likes of&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em> and <em>Rise of the Golden Idol </em>in the sale, alongside less recent classics like <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> and&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. But you already know about all of those, so where’s the good in my suggesting those? Nope, let’s dive a little deeper with a selection of games that won’t be appearing at the top of all the store’s lists.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756940/The_Ratline/"><em>The Ratline</em></a></h2>  <p>You know who was making amazing family-tree-like detective games long before&nbsp;<em>The Roottrees Are</em> <em>Dead</em>? <a href="https://owlskip-games.itch.io/">Owlskip</a>. Titles like <a href="https://kotaku.com/riley-rochelle-musical-music-pc-steam-sheinman-games-1849676247"><em>Riley &amp; Rochelle</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/07/family/">Family,</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/09/rivals/"><em>Rivals</em></a> were years ahead on the format, and definitely deserve to be discovered in light of <em>Roottrees</em>‘ breakout success. Anything else is frankly unfair. <em>The Ratline</em> is the latest from the studio, due out in March, once again asking you to piece together a mystery from an array of clues and documents. This time things are set in 1971 and have you hunt down Nazi fugitives after the murder of a priest, and who doesn’t need a little Nazi hunting just now? There’s a demo out for Detective Fest.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781420/Surradia_An_Art_Retrospective/"><em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em></a></h2>  <p>There’s also a demo for the upcoming <em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em>, a detective game about investigating the disappearance of three magical artists who vanished during World War II. That means scouring photographs, reading letters, and of course paying close attention to artworks, all found in a museum, as you try to unpick the mystery. There’s no official release date for the game yet, but the demo’s here right now.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618570/The_Detectives_Apprentice/"><em>The Detective’s Apprentice</em></a></h2>  <p>This is a tremendous trailer! You’re Cleo, working for world-renowned detective Maya Lynch, learning the ropes in this unbelievably lovely-looking game. There’s a demo out for Detective Fest, which features Cleo’s first three cases, with the full game due later.</p>

 <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3627210/Mansion_of_a_Million_Monsters/">Mansion of a Million Monsters</a></em></h2>  <p><em>Mansion of a Million Monsters</em> takes a decidedly different approach to the detective genre, combining its investigative ways with dungeon-crawling action. It has the vibes of one of those classic Amiga games that everyone still raves about today. The developers say they’ll hopefully have a demo up for this one in the next day or so.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060960/Sleuth_Saga_Under_Starless_Skies/"><em>Sleuth Saga: Under Starless Skies</em></a></h2>  <p>This detective sim is based on all the right names, like&nbsp;<em>Phoenix Wright</em> and&nbsp;<em><i>Danganronpa</i></em>. Set in the year 780 Quattuoris 32nd (which I&nbsp;<em>cannot</em> find on my calendar), this is the tale of the daughter of investigative journalist Frederick Emery. Her father is found dead, a staged suicide, and she sets out to disprove the police’s claims. It’s to be five episodes long, with the first now playable via a free demo. Also, later this week developers Arboreal Interactive hopes to update with&nbsp;<em>another</em> free chapter, Chapter 0.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3485220/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Murder_Otaku/"><em>Murder Is Game Over: Murder Otaku</em></a></h2>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Murder Is Game Over</em> series of pixel point-n-clickers started in 2022, and&nbsp;<em>Murder Otaku</em> is already the fourth! It came out toward the end of last year, and if you click with its tale of solving the murder of a J-pop singer at an anime convention, that means you’ve now got another three games that are sure things. You can pick up the whole lot in the Cleo’s Complete Casefile bundle, on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/33733/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Cleos_Complete_Casefile/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://hitheryongames.itch.io/murder-is-game-over-cleos-complete-casefile">Itch</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2739630/of_the_Devil/"><em>of the Devil</em></a></h2>  <p><em>of the Devil </em>is a six-part episodic detective game inspired by the likes of <em>Ace Attorney</em> and <em>Danganronpa</em>. Its first free episode was released last year, and two more paid episodes have already been released since then! The game, which features amazing art, is set in the cyberpunk future of 2086 and has you playing a criminal defense attorney. So yeah, grab the first episode for nothing, and then see if you want to pick up the next two, with releases seeming to come nice and quickly.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131660/Call_of_the_Golden_Valley/"><em>Call of the Golden Valley</em></a></h2>  <p>Australian detective sim&nbsp;<em>Call of the Golden Valley</em> came out last October and still offers a free demo. You play Danielle, an American tourist who arrives in the country to visit a friend, Marisa, only to find she’s gone missing. So you begin investigating the small town, piecing together evidence, and finding out why Golden Valley is the sight of so many disappearing hikers.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919600/Paper_Perjury/"><em>Paper Perjury</em></a></h2>  <p>Another game you can play right now,&nbsp;<em>Paper Perjury</em> is a visual novel series from Paper Cat Games where new Azure City Police Department clerk Justina Smith begins investigating some peculiar crimes. Case 1 of the game is available as a free demo, and a sixth case is due to be added pretty soon.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689930/Detective_Instinct_Farewell_My_Beloved/"><em>Detective Instinct: Farewell, My Beloved</em></a></h2>  <p>A few of the games mentioned above were inspired to some degree by <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, but few wear it on their sleeve so much as&nbsp;<em>Detective Instinct</em>. It looks like it could have come from Capcom, and this is high praise. The mystery adventure is all about trying to track down a woman who disappears from a train, only no one on board but you can remember her. It came out late last year, and is celebrating Detective Fest with a discount and a free demo.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kojima Tries To Describe The Nightmare Fuel Haunting His Sleep, Including Creature Bites And ‘Voluptuous Nude Women’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-dream-sleep-death-stranding-2-2000658957</link>
            <guid>1403680</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Hideo Kojima dropped a new bit of lore over the weekend: the renowned designer has “always” suffered from nightmares. As he </span><a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2009914266024100002"><span>wrote</span></a><span> on Twitter, Kojima stumbled upon old dream logs in his phone’s notes while preparing to deliver </span><a href="https://gdconf.com/article/hideo-kojima-heads-to-the-festival-of-gaming-for-gdcs-first-keynote-in-5-years/"><span>the first keynote address in five years</span></a><span> at the upcoming GDC Festival of Gaming 2026.</span></p> <p><span>Suggested to him as a remedy, jotting down his dreams proved to be ineffective in relieving Kojima of his nightmares. However, the notes grant us some insight into the subconscious of one of the most influential game designers of his time, in the form of two snapshots from almost exactly nine years ago. </span><span>If you’ve ever tried to explain your own dreams, you can probably empathize with Kojima’s struggle to articulate the goings-on of his sleeping mindscape. Still, for memos that likely weren’t intended to be seen by others, they paint a surprisingly coherent picture.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2017/1/3 Memo<br>The dreams I have are always strange ones. I’ve never had what you’d call a “good dream.” Or maybe I just don’t remember them. Ok. My first dream of the year. It’s difficult to put a hazy dream into words, but I’ll try to turn it into text. Some foreign filmmakers… <a href="https://t.co/ryN1yleObC">https://t.co/ryN1yleObC</a></p> <p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2009915298602951012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The first log he shares is from January 3, 2017: In this dream, Kojima is invited to a film set where he is bitten in the arm by a flying, furry round creature. When he manages to pry the strange ball-like creature off his arm, it flies backward and morphs into an undisclosed new form. “A creature from outer space?” Kojima writes.&nbsp;</span><span>“An object from the fourth dimension? Whatever ‘it’ is, it keeps changing form in midair and returning again and again.” The film directors then point their cameras at Kojima, wordlessly capturing the struggle, which concludes with the creature transforming into a plastic card that lands in Kojima’s palm. </span><a href="https://x.com/DOrynbayev/status/2010025245919560025"><span>Fanart</span></a><span> has already been made.</span></p>

 <p><span>The second dream log comes from the following day, and takes place in a hot spring town. Kojima moves to a boarding house surrounded by narrow alleyways of packed dirt, and decides to clean the walkways. He hoses down the paths to keep the dust down, and on his journey encounters “voluptuous nude women who look as if they’ve stepped straight out of figure sketches or croquis drawings, [and] scar-covered elderly men who speak in foreign languages.”&nbsp;</span><span>The water uncovers corpses decomposing in the soil, posed as if they were swimming. Kojima returns to his rooms to call the police, but the corpses follow him and make themselves at home in his new residence. At the sound of the doorbell, the corpses transform into young men in relay racing gear. Their coach is at the door, and he’s furious.</span></p> <p><span>Any dream interpreters in the chat?</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oh, Thank Goodness Arc Raiders Isn’t A First-Person Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-first-person-mod-console-cheating-2000658944</link>
            <guid>1403677</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It is a tale as old as time itself: a hack gets a third-person game to run in first-person, or vice-versa, and the result is unspeakable horror. Sometimes that horror comes from <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-third-person-bug-reveals-v-is-a-shamblin-1845914278">the monstrosities that result</a>, but other times it can just be that the new perspective makes the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-mod-fps-first-person-pc-ea-remake-horror-1850186468">far more terrifying</a>. It’s the latter that appears to apply for&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, after someone managed to get the game running in first-person mode and discovered it became even more intense.</p> <p>Via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-first-person-view-reddit/"><em>Polygon</em></a>, Redditor Short_Satisfaction_9 showed off the results of his fiddling with&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ console settings to force the game into a first-person perspective, and while the results are very janky-looking, they also show a version of the game where fighting is a far more frightening endeavor.</p>

   <p><em>Arc Raiders’</em> combat is already very tough, even if you’re completely avoiding PvP antics. The game’s PvE bots and drones don’t go easy on you at the best of times, but in third-person you at least have the advantage of somewhat mystical vision of your surrounding area, able to see incoming enemies at a good distance. In first-person, however, that’s all gone. It sets you up for an awful lot more surprise attacks, and given how unbelievably worked up I get playing the game already, this really isn’t something I’d be clamoring for.</p>

 <p>It’s also not something anyone else can do now, as Embark has just removed access to the in-game console. That’s for a good reason too—over the weekend, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">following complaints of widespread player cheating</a>, many realized that the commands enabled PC players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q92qd4/embark_please_ban_everyone_who_use_that_console/">to switch off all fogging</a> and thus increase visibility by a wild amount. Something Xbox and PS5 players could not, giving PC cross players a ridiculous advantage over both them and their fellow PC players who weren’t doing this.</p>

   <p>On January 10, Embark’s community manager posted to the Discord to say that a hotfix was being rolled out to remove the “NewConsole” command, a vestige of its Unreal Engine basis that had accidentally been left in the game. That’s going to reduce an awful lot of cheating, but does mean the rest of us can’t experience the horror of a first-person view.</p>
