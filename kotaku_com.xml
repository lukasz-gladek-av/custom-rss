A pair of wildly impressive mods for the <em>Legendary Edition</em> remaster of everyone’s favorite Xbox 360-era space opera trilogy contains so many exciting tweaks and so much new material that even I, someone who thought I was probably never gonna play those games again, is now thinking about how I’m gonna clear hard-drive space to hit the stars once more. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,196299,197589" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For those who don’t have 17 minutes to check out the video, let me break down the highlights of what’s on offer in these super neat mods: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>4 new combat missions</li><li>1 new hub map</li><li>12 new cutscenes</li><li>8 altered cutscenes</li><li>3 new apartment decorations</li><li>6 updated character appearances</li></ul><p>And there’s more than just what’s in that list. From making subtle changes like replacing the textures on dead bodies to be more accurate to the lore of the world, to performing incredible feats of digital archaeology in restoring cutscenes that were only referred to in snippets of code in the original game’s beta, the mods are packed with tons of new things to see and explore. The mods also expand how you can take in the world. For example, at the Purgatory night club from <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, you can now order drinks that were featured in <em>Mass Effect: The Official Cocktail Book</em>. </p><p>Unfortunately, though it’s well-deserved after such hard work, modder Tydeos is going on a hiatus now that his work on these mods is complete. However, according to the deep dive video, should he return in the future, he hopes to expand the four brand new missions the mod adds to the game to match the scale found in official, BioWare-brewed quests.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-best-mods-le3-spectre-1851785265]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since we learned the Switch 2 would have an LCD screen instead of a fancier OLED panel, discourse around Nintendo’s latest console has often turned sour when it comes to its display. Of course, once folks were able to get the new hardware in their hands, the Switch 2 revealed itself to be packing an impressively bright and vibrant LCD. Those <em>do </em>exist; they’re still not as great as fancy as an OLED, but liquid crystal display tech is still more than capable of meeting and exceeding expectations for producing a quality image in 2025. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But now a new controversy over the Switch 2’s display has emerged, this time wielding scary terms like “ghosting” and “refresh rate,” as critiques spread asserting that fast-paced games look blurry in motion and concerns rise from some arguing that the HDR display packed in with Nintendo’s new hybrid console isn’t <em>really</em> HDR. Are they right? Kind of, yeah! Should you regret your decision to buy a Nintendo Switch 2? Probably not! Let’s talk. </p><h2 id="h259738"><a id=""></a>It’s really all just one picture at a time, but very fast</h2><p>I’m sorry to tell you that video games are an illusion. Mario isn’t actually moving when he jumps. As you probably already know, GPUs crunch out one image at a time and these images, when played very fast, create the illusion of motion. We’re seeing several images of Mario, with each image showing him in a slightly different location. And our screen needs to display those images cleanly, at a rapid, matching pace.</p><p>That’s a very brisk and incomplete explanation of how video games deliver the visuals we know and love, but it’s more or less how it all works. The way the image gets delivered to your eyes relies on coordination between how fast the GPU can pump out images and how often your monitor refreshes, which is measured in Hertz. Should those things be out of sync in some way, you’ll spot some screen tearing, which is when there’s a mismatch between how many images the GPU spits out per second and how many times the monitor refreshes too (in case you didn’t know, all monitors are actually turning on and off at very fast speeds that give the illusion of staying on).</p><p>But we can also measure the refresh rate in milliseconds, and that’s where we can really lock into some specificity and understand what’s going on. The lower the millisecond response time, the cleaner the motion of something moving across the screen looks. Ratchet that response time up and things start to look a little blurry in motion. </p><h2 id="h259739"><a id=""></a>Wait, the Switch 2 has a 120Hz refresh rate. That should be more than enough, right?</h2><p>120Hz is a swell refresh rate for a gaming display. The problem with the Switch 2, however, is that the millisecond response time of its screen is a bit slow compared to those of many other gaming displays on the market. Compounding the problem is that we actually can’t fully test the Switch 2’s screen as efficiently as we can other displays. </p><p>The Switch 2 doesn’t allow for external video input. So, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/nintendo-switch-2-screen-blur-hdr-analysis#&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/nintendo-switch-2-screen-blur-hdr-analysis#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>PC Mag</em>’s Will Greenwald discusses</a></span> in his breakdown of the latest Switch controversy, folks have been taking to measuring how quickly pixels change color on the Switch 2 screen using optical sensors and cameras, among other tools. This is technically not the same thing as measuring the refresh rate as mentioned above, but it does offer insight into how fast the screen performs. </p><p>The results of these tests revealed a 17.1 millisecond response time on the Switch 2 in a best case scenario, and a 33.3 ms response time at worst. As Greenwald mentions, gaming displays should ideally aim for below 10 ms. </p><p>So no, it’s not just in people’s heads. Maybe they’re being picky! But in reality, the Switch 2’s response time isn’t great compared to other gaming displays. Knowing that fact, though, shouldn’t keep you from having fun with your console. </p><h2 id="h259740"><a id=""></a>What about HDR?</h2><p>By 2025, many are likely familiar with what High Dynamic Range is: an expansion of how just how bright or dark a screen can display colors. An HDR display (with a signal to match) looks far more vivid and lifelike than an SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) screen does. And it’s awesome. To my eyes, HDR is more of an upgrade than 4K resolution could’ve ever dreamed of being. </p><p>But comparing the Switch 2’s HDR to a fancier HDR screen is sort of like comparing organic food to certified organic food. Technically speaking, the Switch 2’s brightness range at less than 1,000 nits falls short of what is needed to portray a true HDR image. So it’s got a High<em>er</em> Dynamic Range than SDR, but is arguably <em>not</em> true HDR. </p><h2 id="h259741"><a id=""></a>What are you saying here? Is my Switch 2 just a hunk-a-junk?</h2><p>Yeah, you know what? Nothing’s ever good enough for you. Let’s just burn the whole thing down—<em>sorry</em>, I dunno where that came from. Silly me. </p><p>No, as anyone who’s seen a Switch 2 in person can attest, the screen looks great! Games look bright and colorful as we’d expect them to. Sure, if you have a serious eye for detail and you’re a numbers nerd, you may feel the screen could’ve hit higher benchmarks. And sadly, hooking your Switch 2 up to a better display via the dock doesn’t seem to fix the problem as, according to <em>PC Mag</em>, external display output of the Switch 2 seems to stay true to what its internal screen can display. </p><p>Coming from someone who has formative, joyous memories of <em>GTA IV</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em>, and <em>BioShock</em> from my old Xbox 360 hooked up to an old, tiny, somewhat faulty CRT in the corner of a basement, inferior tech doesn’t always mean an inferior experience. Objectively, the Switch 2’s screen might have some shortcomings, but your experience with it is subjective. So tune all the noise out if it upsets you, enjoy another lap on <em>Mario Kart World</em> and stop thinking about all this ms-time and HDR nonsense.</p><p><br>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-screen-hdr-response-time-1851785261]]></content:encoded>

The final season debuted earlier today, and in a disturbing way I’ll address with my therapist in the future, I want more of those twisted mind games. And I know a lot of you do too.</p><p><em>Squid Game</em> was an elite depiction of how human morality becomes fluid in the face of self-preservation and greed. Gamifying survival is the basis of almost every video game, but it becomes terrifying to watch when real people are involved. In movies and shows like the <em>Saw</em> franchise and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891"><em>Black Mirror</em></a></span>, normal people will sacrifice children, vote for strangers to be killed, and rip people’s guts out—just to save themselves.</p><p>If you want more of the type of deadly competition that made <em>Squid Game</em> Netflix’s most popular non-English TV series ever, here are nine movies and TV shows to scratch that sick itch of yours.</p></div></div><div><p>Before dystopian mindfucks like <em>Black Mirror</em> and <em>Squid Game</em> turned survivalism into lethal games, <em>Saw</em> had people desperately ripping keys out of other victims’ stomachs to unlock bear traps poised to rip their own heads off. Created by the twisted minds of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the franchise mostly centers around sociopath Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), who kidnaps morally flawed people and forces them into deadly games to test their will to live. People have tried to gouge their own eye out to retrieve a lock combination, crawl through a furnace to recover a syringe with a nerve gas antidote, and even fill a bucket with their own blood to survive. <em>Squid Game</em> turned childhood games into nightmares. <em>Saw</em> turned nightmares into living hell.</p></div><div><p>In <em>Escape Room</em>, six strangers are tricked into a game of survival after being invited to participate in what they believe is a fun, immersive puzzle game for a cash prize. Each room is a deadly trap crafted sadistically around their past traumas. One person survived a plane crash, so one of the rooms heats up like a plane fire. Another person survived a car accident, so the room simulates a smoky, toxic crash environment. All of this is happening while they’re being watched and manipulated by a shadowy organization (sound familiar?). Similar to <em>Squid Game</em>, players have to balance common human decency with staying alive—and that usually leads to people sacrificing someone to save themselves in an icy cabin, or letting someone fall to their death in a zero-gravity room. If you miss the interpersonal turmoil of <em>Squid Game</em>, run to <em>Escape Room</em>.</p></div><div><p>The first time I watched <em>Funny Games</em>, I was 9. I’m now 37, and I had a nightmare about it last night. Put simply, <em>Funny Games</em> is <em>Squid Game</em> if the torture was more targeted and there was no cash prize to assuage the pain. In the film, a family’s vacation is terrorized by two young men who force them to play sadistic games—like a deadly round of “Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Moe” in which their lives hang in the balance.<em> </em>In Squid Game, the twisted logic that governs who lives and who dies sometimes gives way to no logic at all, as when remaining players are forced to sleep in the same quarters and even the time between “games” becomes a deadly free-for-all. Similarly, in <em>Funny Games</em>, the rules can shift on a whim, with bone-chilling consequences. Make sure you watch the 1997 version of the film after you’re done with the final season of <em>Squid Game</em> to enjoy one of the best psychological thrillers ever.</p></div><div><p>Not every <em>Black Mirror</em> episode is centered on a deadly test of human morality dressed up like a game. But, when the dark futurism of the Netflix series is conveyed in lethal competitions, it exposes unsettling truths about the humanity we all share. There’s the episode “Shut Up and Dance,” in which blackmailed people have to complete humiliating and illegal tasks like fight another blackmailed victim to the death or unknowingly be the getaway driver for bank robbers. Another episode has people ride stationary bikes to exhaustion in order to earn virtual currency to enter a televised talent competition. <em>Squid Game</em> gamified survivalism, while <em>Black Mirror</em> made it less of a competition and more of a sick test with no winners.</p></div><div><p>There’s workplace drama in corporate America, and then there’s <em>The Belko Experiment</em>. The Greg McLean-directed psychological thriller pits 80 American office workers against one another as they’re trapped in a corporate building and forced to kill each other—or be killed—before the end of numerous countdowns. All human decency goes out the window when four people’s heads explode after no one is killed before the first countdown is done. By the final countdown, the only person who can live is the one with the highest kill count, essentially transforming office workers into killers by manipulating their primal instincts to live. There’s no Red Light, Green Light kids’ game or sleeping quarters for socializing like in <em>Squid Game</em>. But <em>The Belko Experiment</em> does mirror the Netflix juggernaut in its depiction of the moral degradation that slowly happens as people realize their fellow man’s death directly affects the betterment of their own life.</p></div><div><p><em>Squid Game</em>’s perverse competition takes place on a secluded island hidden from the outside world. In <em>Alice in Borderland</em>, Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) and his friends fight for their survival in a parallel world called Borderland. That similarity alone illustrates how divorced from reality one must be in order to do the inhumane to win a game. In the series, people play deadly competitions to earn “visa days” that help them stay in Borderland. If their visa expires, a laser shoots from the sky and kills them instantly. People will lock others in a room to burn them alive, form alliances even though only one person can win, and voluntarily keep playing after being given a chance to escape—because they feel they have no life in the outside world. As we see in <em>Squid Game</em>, when societal norms are no longer around to keep people in line, their true selves roam free in the deadliest ways.</p></div><div><p>This Amazon Prime teen thriller series is one of the most underrated shows of the 2020s. Based on the Lauren Oliver novel of the same name, the show follows a group of graduating high school seniors so entitled, they engage in an illegal and, yes, deadly game to give themselves some excitement in their lives before they go off and become boring adults. These kids willingly get buried in a coffin, jump off a cliff into pitch-black water, and enter a cage full of venomous snakes—all for a chance at winning $50,000 in a competition no one knows who runs. And this is a yearly tradition. </p></div><div><p>As weird as it may sound, <em>The Prisoner</em> is one of my favorite comfort TV watches. Sure, it’s a psychological thriller about a former British Intelligence agent who is psychologically tortured on a creepy island. But Patrick McGoohan’s performance as Number Six has some of the greatest emotional range you’ll ever see on a screen. <em>The Prisoner</em> doesn’t have the deluge of blood and gore that accompanies the morality tests of <em>Squid Game</em>. It does, however, showcase a similar stripping of one’s mental stability as those in control work to expose their subjects’ true, carnal motivations in life. In one of the best episodes of the show, Number Six is placed in an Embryo Room where he’s forced to relive different stages of his life—or possibly die. Unfortunately for Patrick, there is no cash prize at the end of his torture, just an ambiguous future he may never escape from.</p></div><div><p><em>Circle</em> features the type of social experiment that would fit perfectly in <em>Squid Game</em>. In the film, 50 strangers are unable to move from their spots in the dark room they mysteriously wake up in, and are forced to collectively vote on who dies every two minutes. If they don’t, a sinister device in the center of the room randomly kills someone. They only have 120 seconds at a time to essentially play God. The most depraved aspect of the show is the logic they develop for determining who deserves to die. Some align on the thinking that children and the elderly should die because they’re weaker. Others choose people based on their race. They even turn on a pregnant woman. These mind games have real consequences—like they do in <em>Squid Game</em>—and it begs the question: Are you really a winner in a game where you lose your humanity?</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/squid-game-season-3-netflix-saw-black-mirror-circle-1851785257]]></content:encoded>

Note that if an area hasn’t been connected to the network yet and is offline, Sam will not be able to deploy a PCC.</p><figure id="" data-id="ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-recommend-id="image://ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-recommend-id="image://ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once an area is online, you’ll be able to see structures that other players have left behind. This form of asynchronous multiplayer plays into <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s themes of building connections and helping others out.</p><p>When you ping your immediate surroundings using Sam’s Odradek, you’ll receive a signal that’ll highlight any nearby structures as blue. These can be your own equipment, as well as others left behind by players.

You can also come across abandoned vehicles that can come in handy, especially if you’re in the middle of a delivery, lightening your load.</p><p>Other structures, like Timefall Shelters and Generators can come in clutch during your deliveries as well. As someone who relies heavily on vehicles when delivering cargo, coming across another person’s Generator always feels like a godsend, letting me recharge my vehicle’s battery to make the final mile to my destination without requiring me to pull out my own PCC to build a power source myself.</p><p>However, <strong>the best part of <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s online elements is that you’re able to complete unfinished structures that other players have left behind</strong>. All you have to do is contribute the proper materials. There have been times where I’ve seen giant bridges near rivers that were left incomplete, seemingly waiting for someone else to take over the reins and finish them. Other players have also elected to create their own roads, which you can utilize.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-recommend-id="image://0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-recommend-id="image://0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your own structures will show up in other peoples’ games too, so be sure to pay it forward and build as many useful ones as you can.</p><hr><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> is now available on PS5.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-chiral-network-multiplayer-connect-1851785246]]></content:encoded>

The loot-based boss rush adventure never ran particularly great there but managed to break franchise records on Steam despite the terrible user reviews. But issues have persisted, and alongside complaints about an unfinished end-game and the slow cadence of updates, the online action game is now sitting at a rating of “Overwhelmingly Negative” with just 13 percent of reviews in the past 30 days giving it a thumbs-up.

In July, players will get the Festival of Accord event and an Arch-tempered Uth Duna fight, with Title Update 3 coming in September followed by Title Update 4 sometime in the winter.</p><p>For PC players in particular, however, all eyes will be on the performance fixes listed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the Title 2 patch notes</a></span>. Capcom writes that it has “adjusted the amount of VRAM used with texture streaming, resulting in reduced overall VRAM usage.” That could help with resolution, framerate, and the amount of pop-in players encounter on PC while exploring the map. Other notable changes include new support for  DLSS4 and FSR4 for graphics upscaling, including multi-frame generation for new Nvidia cards. I’m not confident this is nearly sufficient to address what players are complaining about on PC, so we’ll have to wait and see just how much this improves game performance for the average <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fan. </p><p>While Capcom <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992">promised to address the poor state</a></span> of the PC version, major improvements have been slow to arrive. The game has been flooded with negative Steam reviews over the last month, with many players arguing that performance has actually gotten worse with each new update. “As of 5/28/2025, after 250+ hours of gameplay, the game will no longer boot up,” wrote one player on Steam. “<em>Monster Hunter Wilds?</em> Total disaster, folks. Frame rate drops harder than Biden on Air Force One,” wrote another. “Gameplay is fantastic, but the system requirements are a total lie fallacy, as is the benchmark,” wrote a third. “It’s not so bad at first until you get farther in, where weather effects really start taking effect and the framerate just tanks.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As players beat the drums of <em>Monster Hunter</em> discontent throughout June</a></span>, another major issue has been a sense that <em>Wilds</em>’<em>&nbsp;</em>endgame is too shallow, and there’s been renewed criticism arguing that playing it can feel like being on autopilot. Director Yuya Tokuda promised this week that Seregios will be the game’s most unpredictable boss fight yet, suggesting a fresh challenge for fans who feel like they’ve been sleepwalking the last few months. As teased by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese<em> Wilds </em>social media account</a></span>, September’s Title 3 update will include a new difficulty tier for quests, additional rewards, and RNG talismans, one of the core building blocks of every hunter build. </p><p>It’s good news that’s left some players scratching their heads. “So the actual endgame is going to come out 6 months after release date, huh?” one wrote on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the<em> Monster Hunter</em> subreddit</a></span>. <em>Wilds</em> is currently averaging 17,000 concurrent players on Steam, scarcely 1 percent of its debut back in late February. Perhaps even more notably, it’s less than what <em>Monster Hunter: World </em>averages, and that came out back in 2018. That entry’s first big expansion didn’t arrive until 18 months after its release. Some fans are worried it could take <em>Wilds</em> that long to become the game they hoped it would be. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248]]></content:encoded>
