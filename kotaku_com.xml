The asking prices for the stuffed Ultimate Lifeform range from $370 to a whopping $800. To put that into perspective, that’s more than a PlayStation 5 Pro. Will these dressable hedgehogs actually sell for that much? I certainly hope not, but Shadow fans are getting desperate and scalpers know it, because Build-a-Bear is being pretty public about how much demand it has for the plush, and that it has no plans to restock them in the future.</p><p>Right now, you can open Build-a-Bear’s website and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.buildabear.com/search?q=sonic&amp;search-button=&amp;lang=null&amp;brand=buildABear&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.buildabear.com/search?q=sonic&amp;search-button=&amp;lang=null&amp;brand=buildABear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look for the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>collection</a></span>, and Shadow and most of his associated accessories are no longer listed through the online store.

If you walk up this ladder and stand on the platform, the PS5's faceplate will slide up to reveal all of the parts you’ve found. Stand still for a few moments to discover that all of the parts begin to sing a cute song in celebration.</p><p>As a result of listening to the singing parts, you’ll earn yourself the <em>SingStars</em> trophy, getting you one step closer to the platinum trophy you’re after.

Both free <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> betas will take place on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) and include everything from the first beta test last year as well as a new Gypceros wyvern to hunt. </p><p>The additional free test weekends run February 6 to 9 and February 13 to 16 and run from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. each time. Like the first beta test, these won’t require PS Plus or Game Pass Core subscriptions to play online, either. Capcom said its running the additional betas to give more players a chance to try the game who might have missed the first test back in November.</p><p>But while the publisher said it learned a lot from that weekend in terms of player feedback and complaints, don’t expect anything different this time around. “Please bear in mind that these improvements, including performance, game balance, weapon mechanics, known issues and more will not be reflected in the OBT 2 build,” the company stated this week. </p><p>Those improvements, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlined by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>director Yuya Tokuda in a previous video</a></span>, will eventually include monsters moving to new areas less frequently, and making “hitstop” more noticeable so smacking enemies with giant swords and axes feels more satisfying. The team announced several balance tweaks to weapons as well. It’s unclear why these couldn’t be added to the game for the new betas, which would no doubt have given Capcom even more time to gauge community feedback ahead of the game’s full release. That is, after all, what betas are supposed to be for.</p><p>Instead, fans will have to wait until February 28 to see the changes in action. At that point, anyone who participated in one of the betas will get their bonus rewards like a decorative in-game pendant and a starter item pack of meat, traps, and other monster hunting necessities.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
