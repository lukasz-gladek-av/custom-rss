              <p><em>Avowed</em> was quietly <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">one of 2025’s best RPGs</a>. In fact, it even made <em>Kotaku</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161">best games of the year list</a>. But it was also one of the few remaining Microsoft games that was still exclusive to Xbox Series X/S. That changes next month. Obsidian Entertainment confirmed the <em>Skyrim</em>-like will hit PlayStation 5 on February 17 alongside a big anniversary update across all platforms.</p> <p>Despite bringing <em>Forza Horizon</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> to PS5 in 2025, <em>Avowed</em> remained an unusual island of exclusivity amid Microsoft’s new multiplatform push. It’ll now join Obsidian Entertainment’s other 2025 RPG, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, on Sony’s platform where millions more players will get a chance to try it. Here’s the developer interview from the New Game+ Showcase where the port was announced:</p>

  <p>Obsidian also revealed what the game’s next big update will entail. In addition to a photo mode and new game plus mode, players will also get access to new character races, including dwarves, and an additional weapon type. New game plus mode, meanwhile, will reset players’ level back to one but let them keep all of their gear from the previous playthrough as well as explore new enemy modifiers. The new races were the real heavy lift, however.</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="2 minutes, 15 seconds games had. It's a lot of work and a">“It’s a lot of work and a difficult thing to really nail down, especially in <em>Avowed</em> with its parkour systems and its combat mechanics and all the weapon types and stuff like that in the game,” Dimitri Berman said in the interview. “Our different races are different sizes, they’re different shapes, they’re a very unique game experience when you play as each one of them in a first-person game specifically. So it was something new to wrangle for <em>Avowed</em>.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="2 minutes, 15 seconds games had.

The first of those is also currently getting a major update to add a turn-based mode. We’ll see if Obsidian plans to make an eventual <em>Pillars 3</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-eternity-3-turn-based-mode-update-avowed-crpg-2000640875">that merges the best parts of both series</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-christmas-holiday-sales-down-europe-uk-us-nintendo-2000658223">Nintendo of America</a> is once again facing labor complaints from one or more of its workers. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-teksystems-labor-complaints"><em>Game File</em> reports</a> that new charges accuse the Switch 2 manufacturer of violating sections of the National Labor Relations Act dealing with worker organizing and related union activities. These come just a few years after the company settled <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-splatoon-3-mario-strikers-working-conditions-u-1848918777">a previous labor charge</a> with a former tester for $26,000.</p> <p>The charges were filed on December 17 and January 6 against both Nintendo and tech contracting services firm Teksystems. They both list the following alleged violations of the NLRA: “8(a)(4) Discharge (including Layoff and Refusal to Hire)” and “8(a)(1) Concerted Activities (Retaliation, Discharge, Discipline).” Here’s an explanation of section 8(a)(1) in more detail from <em>Game File</em>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>8(a)(1) bars employers from interfering with or restraining employees from their right to self-organize, “to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.”</p></blockquote> <p>While it’s unclear exactly what the nature of this particular labor dispute is over, it’s not the first time a Nintendo worker has taken the company to task over its labor practices with the NLRB. MacKenzie Clifton, who tested <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and other games at the company’s North American Headquarters, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/29/nintendo-tester-union-busting-whistleblower">told <em>Game File</em></a> in 2022 they believed their contract was cut short for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-smash-bros-ultimate-union-busting-1849652308">mentioning unionization</a> to ex-President Doug Bowser during an online meeting.</p>

 <p>Nintendo ultimately settled that case for damages and back-pay that amounted to $26,000, but it led many then-current and former contractors at the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-america-switch-employee-treatment-unionize-nlr-1848828975">to speak out about feeling underpaid and exploited</a>. The company has since shifted some of its contractors to full-time roles while cutting others. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> last fall that there were concerns among some at the company that Nintendo would be outsourcing more of its customer service work to overseas partners ahead of the Switch 2 holiday season.</p>
