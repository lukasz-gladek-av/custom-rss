              <p>Microsoft’s Windows 11 Pro is one of the most efficient and productivity-focused operating systems out there. It features several business-oriented features you won’t find in the Home version, which makes it great for professional use. However, as you’d expect, a subscription doesn’t come cheap.</p>
<p>It typically retails for closer to $200, but Stacksocial is making the upgrade easy. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Right now, you can grab a lifetime license for Windows 11 Pro for just $10 on the platform, which is a massive 94% off the usual retail price</a>. It’s a digital license, which means you will receive your redemption code via email immediately after purchase. You just need to redeem your code within 30 days of purchase. The only catch? The deal is selling out fast, so you might want to act fast to get your orders in. Once it’s gone, it’s unclear if (or when) it’ll be back at this price.</p>

<h2>Advanced Security and Productivity Features Right From the Get Go</h2>
<p>While the installation process is quite simple, your system and hardware need to meet certain requirements before you can get started. These include a 64-bit processor with at least 1GHz clock speed, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. The device you’re planning to install it on should also have TPM 2.0 enabled, a graphics card that’s compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver, a high-definition (720p) display that is greater than 9 inches diagonally, as well as should support UEFI firmware. Most modern devices already meet these standards, but it’s still a good idea to double-check compatibility using Microsoft’s own tool before proceeding with the purchase.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro includes everything from the Home version, plus it gets you a bunch of additional advanced features like BitLocker encryption and Hyper-V virtualization. Gamers will appreciate support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, which translates into better graphics performance and smoother gameplay. There’s also Remote Desktop for accessing your PC from anywhere, which is especially helpful for remote workers.</p>



<p>Productivity features come loaded in as well, like Snap Layouts to manage multiple windows on your screen, improved voice typing, and an overall better search experience. Copilot support also means you’ll have a smart AI assistant right at your fingertips at all times. You can use it to get answers to random questions, create summaries, craft replies, get code suggestions, and a lot more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">This deal saves $189 off a powerful, easy-to-use operating system, but it won’t be around for long. Grab it while you can.</a></p>

              <p><span>It shouldn’t be surprising that Disney, the company that has become willing to degrade its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-toy-story-3-4-perfect-wont-watch-1851632823"><span>boldest, most artistic endeavors</span></a><span> for profit by churning out unnecessary sequels and bland live-action remakes, is talking to AI companies about letting fans make endless user-generated slop of their properties on Disney+. And indeed, the company that has </span><a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/mickey/"><span>changed IP law</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mickey-mouse-infestation-88-origins-horror-game-1851134630"><span>keep Mickey Mouse</span></a><span> out of the hands of the masses is now apparently doing just that.</span></p> <p><span>According to </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-plus-gen-ai-user-generated-content-1236426135/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span>, Disney CEO Bob Iger said in the company’s latest earnings call that it is “in the midst of rolling out the biggest and the most significant changes — from a product perspective, from a technology perspective — since [Disney+] launched.” Part of this is a licensing agreement with </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>developer Epic Games to add “a number of game-like features” to the streaming service, and the other is working with unnamed AI companies to allow subscribers to create short-form video content based on Disney properties.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The other thing that we’re really excited about, that AI is going to give us the ability to do, is to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content and to consume user-generated content — mostly short-form — from others,” Iger said.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you hear that and immediately think of how such an opportunity would obviously be exploited by people who want to make explicit or crude videos featuring Mickey Mouse and the rest of Disney’s characters, Iger says that the company is seeking an arrangement that would “reflect [Disney’s] need to protect the IP.” Good luck, bub. I expect the </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>stans to make short work of whatever safeguards you try to put on this garbage, and we’ll see Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps making out within the first hour.</span></p> <p><span>It’s pretty damning that Iger uses the words “content” and “consume” when talking about these hypothetical AI slop videos, because that’s all AI-generated videos are: time-wasting, artless content meant to be consumed and discarded. For a company that has been so particular about how its characters are used in the past, this is such a bald-faced heel turn. Disney’s films and characters have been such a major part of pop culture for so long because the company has always been pretty stringent about how its characters were used or portrayed, which made the brand synonymous with quality control (just ask anyone who works at a Disney park about <a href="https://www.explore.com/1612677/bizarre-rules-disney-park-character-performers-follow/">the rules they have to follow in-character</a>), so just letting the reins loose for cheap slop is a real mask-off moment for the company’s priorities.</span></p>

              <p>PCs don’t have to be bulky power-hogs that take over your entire workspace or super expensive to be efficient. If you’re after something that saves space while keeping up with your everyday work and play needs, there are quite a few solid mini PCs on the market. And Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5557/">The retailer has dropped the price of the Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny M70q Gen 5 PC to just $800, after a massive 64% discount</a>. Even better, you’re not just getting the PC. This deal also includes a USB Calliope keyboard and mouse, plus Windows 11 pre-installed. That’s a full setup ready to go right out of the box. The deal, however, is selling fast, and there’s no telling how long the offer or the stock will stick around. If you’ve been waiting to upgrade your desktop situation for less, now is the time to act.</p>

<h2>Impressive Performance In a Lightweight Frame</h2>
<p>This is a mini PC, which means you’re getting impressive power packed in a compact, lightweight frame. It measures just about 7 x 7 inches with a slim 1.4-inch depth, so it can fit into any setup without demanding a lot of space. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can simply tuck it behind their monitor or under the table using the VESA mount support, but you will have to purchase the mount separately.</p>
<p>Power-wise, it’s equipped with Intel Core i5-14400T, which is a 14th Gen chip with 10 cores (6 performance, 4 efficiency) and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz when needed. There’s a massive 32GB RAM that keeps everything running smoothly, which can especially be helpful during multitasking. You can perform a bunch of different tasks at once without experiencing frustrating slowdowns that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>Storage is handled by a 1TB PCIe SSD. It offers enough space to store all that you own, from photos to videos, programs, a ton of work documents, backups, and more. You really won’t have to invest in another storage solution anytime soon. And since it’s a solid-state drive, you can also expect much faster load and boot times compared to the traditional options out there. Together, both memory and storage ensure that you’re able to access your system quickly, plus get through busy days with ease.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, and a wide port selection, including USB-C, multiple USB-A ports, Ethernet, and a headphone/mic combo jack. You can enjoy faster wireless connectivity, as well as expand your system by adding an external display or peripherals.</p>
