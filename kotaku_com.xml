The hail from all different genres and teams, and range from very good to absolutely terrible. Steam is normally a mess to browse, and Next Fest is the usual discoverability labyrinth on steroids. So we’ve been playing stuff to see what has that special spark. Here are some of the games we’ve been enjoying and mesmerized by from Steam’s latest free demo bonanza. </p></div><div><p>Kathy Rain is finally back, eight years after her last, fantastic adventure. She’s now working full-time as a PI, but it’s not going well, money is about to run out, and she’s betting everything on solving a series of local murders by a serial killer called The Soothsayer. The demo gives a good chunk of game, and some excellent puzzles. — John Walker </p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>If you thought Steamboat Willie’s entering the public domain was just going to secure you a few terrible horror movies, think again. It’s also going to score one of the most astonishingly disturbing games I’ve ever played. And I’m pretty sure it’s good? <em>Bad Cheese</em>’s demo is a monstrously upsetting first-person...something, in which you play a bloated, morbidly obese Mickey Mouse, desperately trying to find pills for his mutant dog-like father-creature. Oh god, even the sound effects make me curl up to remember. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>This twin-stick shooter does more interesting things in its demo than so many games offer in their entirety. It’s a game where your health bars are also your ammo, so attacking makes you vulnerable, and that’s a damned fine idea alone. Then it gets more complicated. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>Bad Cheese</em> isn’t the only disturbing black-and-white demo we’ve found this Next Fest. <em>Kiddo</em> is a monochrome point-and-click adventure in which you play a masked figure who lives in disgusting solitude, finally spurred to leave his couch by the disappearance of his dog. In the demo, you’re mostly focused on trying to clean the toilet. And it’s <em>so</em> good. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>Race around collecting golden gears and other stuff in a beautiful seaside world where you surf around with the flare and ease of an animated ‘90s cereal mascot. <em>Demon Tides</em> is a follow-up to<em> Demon Turf: Neon Splash</em>. There are only about five short levels in the demo so it’s only a taste, but I already want more. I’m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, I mean <em>Demon Tides</em>.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p>Set in Quito, Ecuador in 2001, <em>Despelote</em> is an urban walking sim where you learn about a neighborhood and its residents by kicking a soccer ball around. Its collage art-style is evocative, the music is beautiful, and the dream-like exploration of someone else’s mundane memories is affecting and hard to shake. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>May 1, 2025</p></div><div><p>Colorful, fast-paced parkour in a whimsical world that’s constantly falling apart around you. That’s <em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> in a nutshell, a very neat action platformer that can feel like a mashup of <em>Sonic</em> and a Studio Ghibli movie. I love it. One YouTube comment put it best. “They <em>actually</em> made the ‘Awesome Parkour Guy You Watched Out The Back Seat Car Window When You Were a Kid’ game.” — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD</p></div><div><p><em>Mashina </em>is a stop-motion strategy sim where you play a robot digging through the earth to harvest resources and repair the world around you using machines. Think stripped-down elements of <em>Minecraft</em> and<em> Factorio</em> wrapped around a cute, child-like adventure. The demo is super short and gave me <em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em> vibes (complimentary), and the mixed-media visual style is top-notch.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p><em>Is This Seat Taken</em> is the perfect kind of puzzle game. It has a simple setup—sort out differently-shaped people correctly—and so excellently and confidently nails that premise that playing it feels like someone injecting dopamine directly into your brain. I burned through the demo so fast that I was sad I have to now wait to play the full game. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p>The latest game from <em>XCOM </em>creator Julian Gollop isn’t what you might expect. <em>Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> is a third-person shooter tower defense strategy game that features colorful visuals and large open maps to explore. It’s like someone mixed together<em> Ratchet and Clank</em> with <em>Orcs Must Die</em> and added a tactical vision mode, too. Sounds a bit odd, but it’s really fun and feels great even in this unfinished state. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> is pitched as a turn-based beat’em up and while that sounded strange, after playing the new demo, I’m totally in. This new <em>TMNT </em>game is turn-based, sure, but moves fast thanks to the fact that every few turns part of the map falls away. So you are forced to keep moving through crowds of enemies and use each turtle’s unique abilities to fight while picking up pizza for health. It’s a little harder than I expected, but I think this is something special. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sadly, her character’s name is yet to be revealed. </p><p>My <em>Shrek</em> lore is a little rusty, but I believe Shrek<em> </em>had three kids in <em>Forever After</em>—released in 2010. So what happened to the other two? Will they be voiced by equally famous young actors? Or was there a terrible swamp accident and Zendaya’s character is the sole survivor all these years later?

The game is being positioned as the future of <em>Pokémon</em>’s competitive play, as evidenced by the teaser trailer showing players using items like Game Boy link cables to battle, all culminating in a modern-day battle between a Switch user and a mobile player in <em>Champions</em>. While the average trainer is probably most excited to return to Kalos in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, <em>Champions </em>could fundamentally change how competitive <em>Pokémon </em>operates, and by extension open up a design space for RPGs like <em>Z-A</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195618" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s start with what we know. <em>Pokémon Champions </em>is a battle simulation game that won’t be tied to a specific RPG. Right now, competitive players battle in whatever the current mainline <em>Pokémon </em>is, so the best trainers in the scene are battling in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> in official tournaments. This naturally limits the Pokémon players can use, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746">gimmick mechanics</a></span> they can utilize. <em>Champions</em>, meanwhile, will not be tied to a specific game and can import different Pokémon from the <em>Pokémon Home</em> storage app (though The Pokémon Company makes clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in its press release</a></span> that there will be some restrictions). The trailer also shows that <em>Champions</em> supports different gameplay mechanics like Mega Evolution and Terastallization, indicating that it might be possible to use different strategies that aren’t beholden to a game-specific rule set.</p><p>Just how freely we’ll be able to customize rules and party compositions remains to be seen, but The Pokémon Company creating an officially licensed battle simulator similar to the third-party ones used by competitive pros that aren’t limited to the current generation is a huge deal. This means professional players and the average fan will no longer be tied to one another. Official <em>Pokémon </em>tournaments won’t be limited to specific RPGs’ rosters, and mainline games could get more experimental without being chained to a competitive scene.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>is one of the most innovative games the series has released in the past decade. It has new battle mechanics like the agile and strong style moves that let you choose to prioritize speed or power, which would be considered “broken” in competitive play. But <em>Legends: Arceus </em>doesn’t have multiplayer battles and doesn’t have to design its turn-based gameplay around whether or not something is fair to a rival trainer. As a result, some of the game’s big story battles are among the most challenging and interesting the series has ever put out. As a non-competitive player, some of the most strategic plays I’ve ever had to make in a <em>Pokémon </em>game’s main story involved making decisions about whether or not to use agile attacks to try and get in a few extra hits, or put everything I had into a strong one in hopes of knocking an enemy out in one shot. </p><p>This was a simple tweak to long-established <em>Pokémon </em>mechanics, but if Game Freak can develop RPGs without having to account for a completely different way they might be played in tournaments, it could mean cool innovations like this in future games. <em>Legends: Z-A</em> even introduces its own spin on <em>Pokémon</em> battles by incorporating positioning and area-of-effect to make use of the walkable 3D combat zones. Cool changes like this are only possible if we stop worrying about competitive viability and make space for innovative RPG design.</p><p>Severing competitive tournaments from the RPGs is a good thing for everyone, and some of the biggest names in professional <em>Pokémon </em>battling have expressed that having their own space to play and experiment could be a game changer for the scene.</p><p>There are still a lot of questions for both competitive and casual players, but the potential possibilities <em>Pokémon Champions</em> could bring to all sides of the community make it the most exciting part of the Presents showcase. I’m stoked for <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but in the long run, I’m even more interested in how the <em>Pokémon </em>series could keep changing for the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a great virtual reality headset but an intimidating price. Now Sony is dropping it to $300 starting in March amid reports that sales have completely stalled.

Maybe it’s only recently that the manufacturing costs came down enough to make that viable. After all, why would Sony want to lose money on headsets for an ecosystem that’s barely growing? At the same time, games sell consoles, and without the clear backing of Sony the PS VR2 library never took off. How can others place big bets on the hardware if the company that made it doesn’t seem willing to do the same? </p><p> That doesn’t mean here are no games for PS VR2. Sony notes in today’s blog post that <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em>, <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, and<em> Metro Awakening VR</em> all recently arrived on the platform, with <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em>, and others still on the way. For now though, there still doesn’t seem to be a killer app coming down the road anytime soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While news of <em>Legends: Z-A</em> was very welcome, what was not mentioned—nor ever rumored to be mentioned—was Pokémon’s next mainline entry. And yet, based on the pattern of the last decade-and-a-half, this should have been the day we learned of a new core title in the world’s most popular franchise, and got our first few hints about a whole new generation of pocket monsters.

It was the start of nine months of nonstop reveals of the 120 new creatures being added to the Pokédex, alongside excitement about the Nintendo Switch’s second mainline entry, following 2019's <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield. </em>And while it <em>was</em> a surprise announcement in the sense that Nintendo had kept it under wraps until that point, it was also expected that a new game would be announced, because there’s a new game every three years, right?</p><p>That’s actually only been true since 2010, following the launch of <em>Black </em>and <em>White. </em>By 2013 we had <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>(as well as the bonus of the first and only sequels, <em>Black 2</em> and <em>White 2 </em>in 2012). Then, like clockwork, 2016 gave us <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>, before 2019's <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em>, and 2022's <em>S&amp;V.</em> That’s five mainline entries in a row, each three years apart, rather giving the impression that this was to be the norm. And it almost is; aside from  2006's <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>and 2010's <em>Black </em>and <em>White</em>, each coming out four years after the previous, it’s always been three years.</p><p>Seemingly, 2025 is to be another of those exceptions. What’s so odd is the complete quiet about it all. No one seems to have noticed?</p><h2 id="h494332"><a id=""></a>The Three-Year Itch</h2><p>As an observer, it really rather looked like Game Freak had little choice but to get a mainline game out every third year—to the point where the clearly unpolished <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> would surely have been given more time under any other circumstances. But there’s a <em>vast</em> industry built around those games, and missing its release date would have knocked over a row of dominos that could have cost Nintendo, Game Freak, Creatures and The Pokémon Company (a confusing collection of companies who all overlap in the middle) billions.</p><p>Think about the <em>Pokémon TCG</em>. Every three years for the last 15, a new era of cards is launched, themed around the name and region of the most recent game, and highlighting the Pokémon introduced in the new generation. Those cards have to be in production long before the game’s even released, given—for instance—Japan’s first set of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> era TCG cards were released in January 2023, just two months after the game came out. The artwork alone would have been commissioned months ahead, and the intricacies of the game design based on all the new monsters worked out well in advance, too. If the game slipped, the cards would either have to be enormously expensively delayed, or come out ahead of the game and ruin twists and surprises,  and in turn knock down the next domino: merchandise. </p><p>So to shift to a four-year development cycle (and let’s be clear, they absolutely should, or even a longer one, because Game Freak employees deserve the time and space to avoid crunch and make the best game possible) has enormous implications. Ones that must be planned for, presumably years in advance. Nintendo, Game Freak, et al, are all so notoriously tight-lipped about <em>everything</em>, and it’s wildly unlikely they’d ever tell anyone such intentions, so we’re left to just guess. And my guess would be that the reaction to <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>’s dubious (and ongoing) technical state caused decisions to be made within to do two different things:</p><p><strong>1)</strong> Take longer to make an open-world game that isn’t cracking at the seams</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Make it for the Switch 2 only</p><p>That latter one would have been very difficult to get away with in 2025. Sure, it’d have been an <em>amazing</em> way to sell Switch 2s over the 2025 holiday season, but the console would still be six months old at most, and most people would expect a game announced today to work on the console they own today. But next year? It’s an easier sell. In fact, it’s pretty much bog-standard for a new <em>Pokémon </em>game to release a year or two after the latest Nintendo hardware.</p><h2 id="h494333"><a id=""></a>Domino Rally</h2><p>The implications are still interesting, however. The <em>PTCG </em>is going to need to run <em>SV</em> for an extra year, and it’s already looking a bit worn out. The ex era is being revamped later this year with the addition of mega evolution cards, but while that’ll change up the meta a bit and obviously give them a chance to take advantage of the current ludicrous boom in sales to sell a gazillion Mega Charizard-themed boxes, it still leaves 2026 and the first half of 2027 to fill with Generation IX. That explains 2025's year-long release of Prismatic Evolution special sets, a year earlier than you’d have expected given how the <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era ended with a full year of Crown Zenith sets—it’s clearly a mid-point thing, rather than an ending. We can expect some sort of ex-celebrating bonanza next year, maybe?</p><p>Anyway, there you go. Just in case you too were thinking how weird it is that no one’s talking about this.</p><p>Unless of course they go and surprise-announce it in the April Nintendo Direct, and make me look like a complete fool.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
