              <p>Ask any gamer who travels or shares a living space: <strong>one screen is rarely enough</strong>. Whether you’re running a Switch on the go, playing Xbox in another room, or extending your gaming laptop setup, a secondary display changes everything. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor delivers that upgrade without the bulk or the cost. It’s slim, lightweight, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/">and now sitting at an all‑time low on Amazon at $69, down from $99.99</a>. At this price, it’s one of the most affordable full HD portable gaming monitors you can grab right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Convert Any Console or Laptop into a Dual-Screen System</h2>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> monitor <strong>houses a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) IPS panel with clear detail, deep color capture, and generous 178-degree viewing angles</strong>. In other words, sharp images regardless if you’re gaming on the Switch, connecting a PS5 or extending your PC setup for extra workspace. Its <strong>HDR</strong> technology ramps up contrast so things can feel more vivid, blacks get deeper, and motion remains fluid even in swift action scenes.</p>



<p>The screen boasts <strong>two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini-HDMI connector</strong> and you get plug-and-play convenience with laptops, game consoles and phones with video output. One cable more often than not does everything and you get power and display that is a big advantage if you’re flying light or hate dealing with multiple adapters. Plug it into your console and you’re good in an instant for big-screen console gaming in a hotel room.</p>
<p>Weighing a light 1.7 pounds and a slim 0.3 inches in thickness, the monitor can fit easily into any backpack or laptop sleeve. You’re able to game in landscape orientation for hardcore gaming, switch it up into portrait orientation for livestream conversations, coding sessions, or reading files. It’s the type of display that transitions from gaming into productivity and does so without losing anything. The <em>KYY</em> also features practical add-ons which add up in the long run: You get a high-grade PU leather smart protective cover which also functions as a collapsible stand.</p>



<p>The stereo speakers built into the display provide respectable audio for everyday use, though headphones or an external speaker can always be plugged in through the <strong>3.5mm jack if more complete audio is desired</strong>. Along with the matte anti-glare coating, the eye-care mode and blue light reduction, the screen itself seems comfortable enough to gaze at for extended periods.</p>
<p><span>With the price cut all the way down to $69 from Amazon, it’s in a clearance range that’s difficult to resist.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EcoFlow built its reputation on one device: the Delta 2. It became the go‑to power station for campers and anyone who needed quick and reliable energy without the fumes or noise of a gas generator. Now that the newer Delta 3 is out, EcoFlow is clearing out stock and Amazon has dropped the 1800W Delta 2 to its lowest price ever: This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">&nbsp;best‑seller is down to $429, from its original $699, a record low 39% discount that makes it hands‑down the smartest buy</a> of the season if you’ve been considering portable power for home backup or outdoor adventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Similar Performance Than Delta 3</h2>
<p>Although the Delta 3 has some improvements, the Delta 2 still meets the same sweet spot in terms of power, speed, and reliability all at a significantly lower price. With a<strong> 1024Wh capacity and peak output of 1800W</strong>, the station can power most household devices, tools, or entertainment equipment. Consider mini-fridges, coffee machines, gaming stations, and even hairdryers – <strong>this little hulk powers up to 90% of the things we all use daily</strong>.</p>



<p>The outdoors enthusiast also relishes the dual purpose of the Delta 2 as a solar generator with up to 500W solar input capability: You can pair it with matching panels (sold separately) and charge green while camping or off-grid. It’s the perfect configuration for RV power, work anywhere, or charging devices in an environmentally friendly manner. What’s more, its minimum base level 1kWh capacity can be increased easily with add‑on batteries up to 3kWh: That versatility converts the Delta 2 from a weekend camping friend into a serious residential backup solution.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting to commit to the EcoFlow ecosystem, this deal can’t be missed. The Delta 2 still houses the same high-end performance that brought the brand into the spotlight and for $429, it’s darn close to a steal. Once inventory dies off, the price isn’t returning this low at least for some time.</p>
