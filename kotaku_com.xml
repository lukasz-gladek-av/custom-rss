            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Last week, Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios held a big <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190?utm_source=kotaku.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=share">multiplayer reveal event in Los Angeles</a>. While there, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">I got to go hands-on with the online military shooter</a> for a few hours and learned a lot about the game. And since then, EA has done interviews and shared more information about the highly anticipated sequel, which is set to arrive in a few months. There’s also a big open beta launching later this week that will go for a few weekends.</p> <p>So yeah, there’s a lot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-guarantees-battlefield-6-will-run-at-60fps-or-more-on-all-platforms-2000614503"><em> Battlefield 6 </em>information flying around out there</a>. To help you out, I’ve grabbed seven pieces of info and cataloged them here for your convenience. All I ask in return is that if you see me on the battlefield, don’t snipe me right away. Please? Anyway, here are seven new pieces of info we’ve learned about <em>Battlefield 6</em> over the last few days.</p> <h2><strong>When does the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta start?</strong></h2> <p>EA has split the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta into three sessions. The first starts on Thursday, August 7, and runs until August 9. But you’ll need an early access code to play during this first window. Does that mean this is no longer an “open” beta? I’d say so, but whatever. Then, from August 9 until August 10, anyone who has downloaded the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta can start playing, with or without a code. The beta will wrap up early that Monday and then go live again on Thursday, August 14. This third session is also completely open and will end in the early morning hours on August 17.&nbsp; The <em>BF6</em> beta will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S and can be pre-loaded now.</p>

 <p>Here’s a full schedule courtesy of EA and Battlefield Studios:</p> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> early access beta</p> <ul> <li>From Thursday, Aug. 7 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Saturday, Aug. 9 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</li> </ul> </blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><em>BF6</em> Open beta – first weekend</p> <ul> <li>From Saturday, Aug. 9 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Monday, Aug. 10 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</li> </ul> </blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><em>BF6</em> Open beta – second (final) weekend</p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>From Thursday, Aug.14 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Sunday, Aug. 17 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> will feature bots to help fill servers</strong></h2> <p>Battlefield Studios and EA have confirmed that matches in <em>Battlefield 6</em> can include bots if there aren’t enough active players in the server. These bots will be replaced as more players join and will only return if people leave early. <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;development director <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987">Anna Narrevik explained in a recent interview</a> that they have designed the game to “allow as many players as possible to play the game at the same time.” But when there are gaps, the bots will show up to help out.</p> <p>I actually played against some bots during the <em>Battlefield 6</em> reveal event’s afterparty. They were pretty stupid, but could revive people and take points, so they weren’t completely worthless, and having them around did make the battle feel more alive and larger in scale. I’ll be curious to see how often I run into bots when playing certain modes in the game once it’s out.</p> <h2><strong>The game will use some skill-based matchmaking</strong></h2> <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-matchmaking-will-include-sbmm-among-other-things-like-ping-location-and-server-availability"><em>BF6</em> will partially use skill-based matchmaking</a> to place players into different servers and matches. But, before you grab a pitchfork and riot or throw a party in celebration, EA wants people to know that a player’s skill is just one of many variables used during <em>BF6</em>‘s matchmaking process. During a Q&amp;A at the event, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1952011658143924686">as further reported by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s devs confirmed that numerous factors play a role in matchmaking. These include a player’s ping, location, what servers are available at that moment, and yes, skill factor.</p>

 <p>You might not think much about that, but for some players, skill-based matchmaking has become a dirty word, as they believe it makes shooters less fun as you are always matched up with people as good or better than you. Others think it keeps things balanced and more enjoyable. To me, it sounds like EA isn’t going to keep experts playing experts exclusively, but instead will try to keep teams balanced, something the series has done for a long time. So, until <em>Battlefield 6</em> is out, I think people can chill.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Maps, Modes &amp; Portal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><strong>There won’t be a traditional server browser in <em>Battlefield 6</em></strong></h2> <p>EA has confirmed that when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches, it won’t include a traditional server browser. This is a feature that has been included in most <em>Battlefield</em> games and lets players search for specific servers running maps or modes they want to play while avoiding the stuff they don’t like. Server browsers can also run specific rules and use moderators to control griefing while developing a community around them.</p>

 <p>Instead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s server browser</a> will be included in Portal, a part of the game that will operate like Forge in <em>Halo</em> and let players make their own experiences, maps, and game modes. So it sounds like you’ll only be able to access community-created modes and experiences using this server browser and not official EA servers running vanilla maps and games.&nbsp; Alexia Christofi, a producer on <em>BF6</em>, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898828669395394">tweeted about the server browser</a> after the reveal event, saying that community-created modes can “award full XP” and confirming that the browser “will be front and center in our main menu, not hidden.” It’ll feature a filter, too. The question is how persistent servers will be and whether more traditional <em>BF</em> experiences will be a part of it, or if folks looking to play conquest have to rely solely on matchmaking. EA says more info is coming soon. Hopefully, that will clear things up.</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> on PC will require Secure Boot</h2> <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/secure-boot-information">Battlefield Studios has also confirmed that its upcoming military shooter will require Secure Boot on PC</a>. This is a newer way to try and stop cheaters from playing the game and malicious software from booting on your Windows 10 or 11 PC. While Secure Boot can be effective at stopping cheaters and bad actors, it can also cause a lot of headaches for users who have to upgrade older machines to support the feature. It is also prone to failure or causing other PC problems, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1mhpu0t/secure_boot_is_a_requirement_to_play_battlefield/">something you can spot in Reddit threads</a> with people asking for help getting the open beta launcher to load on their Windows PC.</p>

 <p>“Requiring Secure Boot provides us with features that we can leverage against cheats that attempt to infiltrate during the Windows boot process,” said EA in a blog about requiring the feature. “It also lets the Battlefield Positive Play team use its own features and related dependent security features like TPM to combat other forms of cheating, the most relevant of which include: kernel-level cheats and toolkits, memory manipulation, spoofing, hardware ID manipulation, virtual machines…” and other anti-cheat tools.&nbsp; While that’s all very true, its presence may still be a dealbreaker for some. And the worst part is that cheaters can still bypass Secure Boot. This won’t be a feature on consoles, which are closed systems with tighter platform control.</p> <h2><strong>All the maps that will be available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> at launch</strong></h2> <p>During the big reveal event, EA listed all nine maps that will be available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> when it launches later this year. Here’s the list:</p> <ul> <li>Siege of Cairo</li> <li>Iberian Offensive</li> <li>Liberation Peak</li> <li>Empire State</li> <li>Operation Firestorm</li> <li>Saints Quarter</li> <li>New Sobek City</li> <li>Mirak Valley</li> <li>Manhattan Bridge</li> </ul> <p>And yes, Operation Firestorm is a returning classic from <em>Battlefield 3</em>. EA has confirmed that it will bring back more classic maps in the future based on player feedback and requests. Also, EA confirmed that all modes are playable on all maps, as every level in <em>BF6</em> can scale up or down to better fit the selected mode. So if you play deathmatch on Empire State—a map set in NYC—you’ll play in a smaller section of the map designed for that mode. But if you return to the NYC-based map later and play conquest, you’ll get to explore the whole thing as it will be opened up more for modes that demand more real estate. So in a sense, you really have more than nine maps in <em>BF6</em>. What a deal!</p> <p><strong>When does <em>Battlefield 6</em> launch? How much is it? And what platforms?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>During last week’s <em>Battlefield 6</em> multiplayer reveal, EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed the launch date for the game, as well price and platforms. <em>Battlefield 6</em> will arrive on October 10. There is no paid early access window. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">The game will cost $70</a>, though you can buy a fancier version for $100.&nbsp; And <em>BF6</em> will be available on PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-are-the-best-jobs-for-each-bravely-default-hd-character.1263870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Bravely Default HD</i> offers nearly limitless team customization thanks to its take on the iconic <i>Final Fantasy </i>job system. Want to have a Monk who can cast healing magic to back up the party? You can. Need a dedicated tank to take the hits while wielding two shields? No problem. Maybe your Black Mage could use swords and heavy armor, it’s all up to you! And as it turns out, there’s a <i>very </i>subtle layer of customization underneath that robust job system which might influence the way you build your party.</p> <p><i>Bravely Default </i>follows four main characters throughout its runtime: Tiz, Agnes, Ringabel, and Edea. Each has slightly different base stats, which <i>technically </i>makes certain characters fit select jobs better than others. It doesn’t make a huge difference, as a character’s power will be predominantly determined by their job and their equipment. Still, stats are stats, and what is an RPG if not an exercise in taking every advantage to make your damage numbers as big as possible? Below you’ll find a breakdown of what stats each character excels in, and what that means for how you should build them.</p> <h2>Each characters’ base stats in Bravely Default</h2> <p>Both <i>Bravely Default </i>on the 3DS and the HD Remake on Switch 2 appear to follow the same rules when it comes to each characters’ stats. Here is what each character excels at:</p>

 <p><b>Edea</b>: Highest STR and VIT of the party.<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Highest DEX and AGI of the party, though his stats are well rounded. INT is also high.<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Highest INT and MND of the party.<br> <b>Tiz</b>: Highest HP of the party. Has high STR, VIT, and MND</p> <p>What do we make of this information? Well, let’s do another breakdown:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614614" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614614"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614614">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><b>1: Edea is a clear candidate for a physical attacker or tank role.<br> </b><b>2: Agnès is your best source of magic damage</b>. She has an edge as a healer too, though I’d personally say the best defense is a good offense.<br> <b>3: Ringabel is your best Thief or Ninja, but he can be a strong magic attacker as well.</b> Ringabel’s naturally high AGI means he’s slightly more likely to attack before your other party members, particularly in the early game.<br> <strong>4: </strong><b>Tiz can be best thought of as a Paladin, even if you don’t need to build him that way</b>. He’s your best healer if Agnes is already spoken for, and your best tank or physical attacker aside from Edea.</p> <p>Tiz only lags behind the party in INT and AGI, making him <i>almost </i>a near mirror image of Ringabel. Which is fitting, as Edea and Agnès are both also opposites in their stat distribution.</p>

 <h2>The best jobs for each character in Bravely Default (through Chapter 1)</h2> <p><b>Take this section with a grain of salt, for reasons we’ll get into below</b>. But if you’re still early enough in the game where these stat differences will be the most noticeable, consider giving each character any of the following jobs:</p> <p><b>Tiz</b>: White Mage, Knight, Merchant, Monk<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Black Mage, White Mage, Time Mage, Thief<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Thief, Monk, Black Mage, Spell Fencer<br> <b>Edea: </b>Knight, Spell Fencer, Monk, Merchant</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614615" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614615"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614615">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Caption: A screenshot of <i>Bravely Default </i>for the Nintendo Switch 2. Tiz, Agnès, and Edea are looking at a Black Knight who has boarded their ship.</p>

 <h2>After the opening hours, don’t limit your job choices to each characters’ role</h2> <p>When you’re still getting your feet wet with the game, your future job choices will likely be determined by the jobs a character has already used. For example, if Agnès is your magic attacker, you’ll likely keep her as a caster so she can seamlessly carry over her spell-slinging prowess to whatever job she equips next. A well balanced party will help a lot early on, but the more jobs you unlock, the more you’ll realize just how the game rewards you for thinking out of the box.</p> <p>Does a party of four black mages sound crazy? Maybe, until you realize the job’s innate Black Resonance ability boosts magic damage for every Black Mage in your party, setting yourself up to potentially nuke bosses into the moon in a single brave-boosted turn. Conversely, you might decide to level up everyone as a Knight so they can learn the Two-Handed ability and tear through random encounters. Heck, if a character masters <i>every </i>job, they can become absolute monsters as a lowly Freelancer thanks to the Late Bloomer ability!</p> <p>All of this is to say that there’s a <i>lot </i>to be gained by experimenting with jobs, even the ones that don’t fit a character’s role. And to restate what was said above, most of a characters’ power will come from their build and not their innate stats. Edea won’t be quite as good of a Black Mage as Agnes, but she won’t feel weak if you decide to build her as one either. So please, <i>please </i>experiment with your job choices as you progress, as you may be surprised by the combos you uncover. And considering just <a href="https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-flying-fairy-switch-2-hd-mini-games-1851784559">how long <i>Bravely Default</i> is</a>, you’ll have plenty of time to level up your party before your journey is over.</p> <hr> <p><i>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</i> is available on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-hd-switch-2-best-jobs-tiz-agnes-ringabel-edea-2000614612]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-company-pikachu-nintendo-america-breasts-design-2000616048</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Sometimes you hear about something and realize the trajectory of your life could have completely changed if one thing had happened differently. Or, I guess in this case, two things had happened differently. For years now, there’s been a story circulating online in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>spaces about Nintendo of America allegedly asking Game Freak to give Pikachu, the lovable little yellow guy who would go on to become one of the most prominent pop culture mascots of all time, human-like breasts when bringing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>over to the west. If that had happened, the world would be different, and I probably wouldn’t have a job here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>because I would have likely never been allowed near </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>as a child and gone on to become hyperfixated on the rest of nerd culture. This story has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1mbg8nc/til_that_when_pok%C3%A9mon_was_being_localised_for_the/"><span>been disputed</span></a><span> because of what some deemed a questionable translation, but Japanese outlet </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/29/155531.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span> went looking and found the original interview and it sounds like, yeah, someone at Nintendo wanted Pikachu to have giant bazongas to appeal to Americans.</span></p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-of-america-really-did-suggest-giving-pikachu-large-feminine-breasts-at-one-point-japanese-media-confirms/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> translation breaks down the findings and the translation disputes. The </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731153121/https:/www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/taidan1/page03.html"><span>25-year-old interview</span></a><span> with Pokémon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara includes a story about how Nintendo of America thought that Pikachu and company were “too cute” and might need a redesign to appeal to Americans’ edgy sensibilities. Pikachu’s redesign was described as “a tabby cat with huge breasts,” similar to what you might see in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical </span><i><span>Cats</span></i><span>, but the Japanese word “mune” is used here, which can be used to refer to either pronounced pecs or the presumed mommy milkers, which led to the aforementioned dispute. However, when the interviewer asked if this design was “like those girls who do Pikachu cosplays at anime conventions,” Ishihara said, “Yes, exactly.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Ishihara said that it was an interesting thought experiment and made him appreciate the cultural differences between the Eastern and Western audiences, but he thankfully turned down the design, we got the little yellow guy unchanged, and </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>still became a cultural phenomenon over here. That’s not to say that monster taming franchises can’t also have sexualized designs and be successful. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><i><span>Digimon</span></i></a> <span>has several humanoid monsters like Angemon and Angewomon that appeal to people looking for that, but </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s longevity is tied to how timeless its characters are and how every new generation of kids can jump into it from anywhere. That certainly hasn’t stopped them from creating humanoid Pokémon over the years, but the visual identity of those characters has remained child-appropriate.

              <p>What does it take to “beat” the single player Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes in <i>Mario Kart World</i>? For some, simply finishing Rainbow Road and rolling the credits is enough to call it a day. For others, maybe you want to get gold trophies in every cup on 150cc, or even <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-mirror-mode-unlock-free-roam-1851784857">Mirror Mode</a> if you know how to unlock it. But what if that’s not enough? What if you want bragging rights that well and truly signaled to the world “I’ve <i>conquered</i> this?” That’s what your Star Rank is for.</p> <p>In short, your Star Rank is the extra stars you might see next to your gold trophies in both the single-player Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. The better you did during that particular challenge, the more stars you’ll earn (up to a maximum of three). If it sounds straightforward, that’s because… it kind of is. Still, critical details about this system are never explained in-game, so if you’re looking to earn a three-star rank on every cup in single-player mode, here’s what you need to know.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614605"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614605">© Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>How do you get three stars in Grand Prix in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Similar to past <i>Mario Kart </i>games, your star rank in Grand Prix mode depends on your final point tally at the end of the final race. 54 points gets you one star, 57 points gets you two stars, and 60 points gets you the full three stars. To put that in straightforward terms, <b>getting three stars requires finishing first in all four races of a single cup</b>.</p>

 <h2>How do you get a three-star rank in Knockout Tour in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Since Knockout Tour is new to <i>Mario Kart World</i>, the rules here are a little different than the series’ standard Grand Prix mode. In lieu of a proper point system, your Star Rank is instead determined by your position when you pass through each of the checkpoints that kicks out the bottom four players from the race. <b>To get three stars in Knockout Tour, you have to be in first when you pass through each of these checkpoints</b>.</p> <p>Yes, that includes the first one, so you’ll have to dash from 24th to 1st fast!</p> <h2>Your Star Rank in a higher difficulty will count as completion for all previous difficulties as well</h2> <p>If you want to get three stars in every cup in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes, your first instinct may be to start from 50cc and work your way up from there. After all, you might as well save the hardest stuff for last, right? Well, if you’re confident enough in your skills to pump up the difficulty ASAP, all Star Ranks are retroactive across all previous difficulties. That is to say, if you get three stars in a cup in 150cc, you’ll see your 50cc and 100cc completion appear as three stars as well. Conversely, if you get three stars in 50cc and only one star in 150cc, your previous record won’t be overwritten.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-mirror-mode-unlock-free-roam-1851784857"><b>Mirror Mode</b></a><b> also grants retroactive star rankings</b>. This hasn’t been the case in past <i>Mario Kart </i>games, but a Mirror Mode max Star Rank in <i>Mario Kart World </i>will also carry over to 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc if you haven’t already done so. In other words, if you’re trying to get your bragging rights as fast as possible and you think you’re ready for it, you can immediately start in Mirror Mode.</p> <h2>What do you get for getting three stars in every cup in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Nothing! Absolutely nothing!</p> <p>I’ve been calling this a bragging right for a reason. Much like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">most tasks in Free Roam mode</a>, earning a max Star Rank is a challenge that exists for its own sake. This might be disappointing for longtime <i>Kart</i> fans, as previous games would often signify your accomplishment with some kind of reward. But here, you won’t even see a congratulations message for pulling off this feat.</p>

 <h2>Tips for getting three stars in <i>Mario Kart World</i></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614608"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614608">© Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’d like to press on to get a suite of maxed out Star Ranks despite knowing there is no reward attached, here are a few quick tips to propel yourself into first place (usually).</p> <p><b>1: Practice</b>. It sounds obvious, but the more you know which twists and turns are ahead of you on a track, the better equipped you’ll be to blow past the competition without slamming headfirst into a wall. The Time Trial mode comes equipped with ghosts for each track that you can study, and if you’re feeling adventurous <b>you can load the ghost data of whoever holds the world record in a track too.</b></p>

 <p><b>2: Focus on getting coins at the start. </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coins-vehicles-speed-power-up-unlock-1851785020">The more coins you have, the faster you’ll go</a>. And the faster you’ll go, you’ll… I don’t need to explain why going fast matters in a racing game, right? You can stop going out of your way for coins once you have 10-15, and by the final lap you should focus on cutting tight corners as you approach the finish line.</p> <p><b>3: Prioritize shortcuts</b>. This is especially important for Knockout Tour, as you’ll need to make up a lot of ground to go from 24th to 1st before hitting the first checkpoint. Fortunately, players in a lower place will get better items from item boxes, and the first item you’ll usually get in Knockout Tour is a Mushroom (or something else that boosts your speed). Look for any turns that you can speed right across, and don’t be afraid to hold your item if it means waiting for that right moment.</p>

 <p><b>4: Manage your items</b>. As mentioned above, racers further back will get better items. And if you’re on a tear blazing past the competition with three red shells around you, you might want to use them strategically to specifically target opponents you can’t catch. Alternatively, you might want to hold at second so you don’t get targeted by a Blue Shell. Conversely, once you’re in 1st, the name of the game is defense. Shells and feathers can prevent you from taking a hit from red shells, and the Superhorn can break Blue Shells before they hit you. Try to have at least one defensive item ready at all times.</p> <p><b>5: Be patient. </b>No matter how good you are or how well you race, you can and <i>will </i>fail to get a three-star rank simply because you got hit with the wrong items at the wrong time. After all, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mario-karted">there’s a reason the term “Mario Karted” is common internet slang</a>. It can be incredibly frustrating and defeating when it happens, so just accept that a few bouts of impossibly bad luck are just going to happen and give it a try another time.</p> <p>Remember, this challenge only exists for fun, and you should probably take a break if you’re not enjoying it. Take some time to <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">grind coins</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907">pull off some super cool stunts</a>, and come back to it when you feel ready. Getting three stars wouldn’t be a bragging right if there was nothing to brag about!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>InXile Entertainment’s next game is the first-person steampunk RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-xboxs-big-summer-2025-showcase-1851784007"><i>Clockwork Revolution</i></a>. Studio founder Brian Fargo, who’s leading the project, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4">sat down with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a> for a deep-dive interview about his long career and his take on current hot topics in the video game industry like generative AI and LLM technology, which the Xbox studio’s parent company is currently investing $80 billion in. Has InXile embraced it in a similar fashion? “For certain things, but but I’m very keen to what are the ethical uses of it?” he said. “I am worried about job loss.”</p> <p>Fargo, whose career in games dates back to the 1980s when he worked on influential role-playing games like&nbsp;<em>The Bard’s Tale&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wasteland</em>, laid out <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-nier-automata-ai-chatgpt-1851778257">a couple of different use cases</a> he foresees for tools like ChatGPT, but distinguished them from things like using generative AI to plagiarize the creative output of other artists. “These games…we’re close to about the same word count as the Bible, basically, and so that’s a lot of data no human can get in in its head,” he said. “So would I like an LLM to be able to query: ‘How many times did [inaudible] talk?’ ‘How many times have we used this skill?’ Like there’s some things that I would want to query the information to make sure so I see that.”</p> <p>The veteran studio head said he also uses generative AI for inspiration they way he might visit a museum or scroll through people’s Deviant Art pages, but that only commissioned work is used in the actual production process. Other uses Fargo pointed to were cleaning up motion capture footage and potentially voicing quick pickup lines added to a game at the last minute if the actor agrees to it and is paid extra but is otherwise unable to make it into the studio. That part sounds in line <a href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-game-darth-vader-1851784189">with what SAG-AFTRA members settled on</a> in a new contract after months on strike.</p> <p>“Can we use it for, like, mundane tasks that nobody wants to do so the human creativity can soar?” Fargo said. “Well, I think that’s kind of cool. I don’t think anybody wants to do some of these things. Do we really want humans going through checking for punctuation? You know, I mean, I don’t have it doing it right now, but that would seem like I’d rather have those same people going, ‘I have a great idea to to make this scene far better.’ Like that, I’d rather have the minds thinking about the good stuff.”</p>  <p>While the <em>Clockwork Revolution</em> director wasn’t as hypercritical of AI and the hype around it as some game developers have been, he also came off as more cautious than others within Microsoft, including CEO Satya Nadella. Nadella recently boasted that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html">30 percent</a> of Microsoft code is written by AI, and revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">he uses multiple AI assistants</a> to get him through his day. The company is pushing its use in gaming as well, rolling out models that can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/">hallucinate gameplay</a> or watch you play games and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/719668/microsoft-xbox-gaming-copilot-windows-game-bar-beta-test">Google tips for them</a>. A Copilot add-on for Xbox is already being tested on PC.</p>
