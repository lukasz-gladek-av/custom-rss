              <p>Being a dad is hard. You have to take care of your child. Protect it from dangers. Make sure it gets plenty of food, water, and sleep. Oh and yeah, not eat it. Unfortunately for juvenile Tyrannosaurs in<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-best-jurassic-park-game-ever-pc-park-sim-baby-dinosaurs-2000639737"><em> Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a>, dad was forgetting that last rule. But that’s been fixed in the game’s latest update, available now on all platforms.</p>

 <p>Released last month, <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3 i</em>s a fantastic dinosaur-park-building simulation that lets you live out the fantasy of opening your very own <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757">Jurassic Park</a> and hopefully not screwing it all up in the process, as seen in nearly every film. This latest entry in the series, which is also the best one yet, added a highly requested fan feature: juvenile dinos. But apparently, according to new patch notes from developer Frontier, male T. Rexes were being jerks and attacking their offspring.</p>

 <p>On November 10, <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/3/updates/1-1-0">in the lengthy patch notes for <em>JWE3</em> update 1.1.0</a>, there’s this odd bug fix:</p> <blockquote><p>&nbsp;– Adult male Tyrannosaurus Rex no longer attack their juvenile offspring</p></blockquote> <p>Yeah, it looks like T. Rex was being a shitty dad before the update and had a tendency to attack juvenile T-rexes. This doesn’t shock me, as in my experience with the large carnivorous dinos, they are quick to attack basically anything that enters their enclosure. At least now, baby Rexes won’t be attacked by their own fathers anymore.</p> <hr> <p><em>Here are the full patch notes for 1.1.0:&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Updates</h2> <ul> <li>Introduced a new family unit to the game – the Kentrosaurus</li> <li>Adjusted navigation rules so that dinosaurs can travel beneath and around scenery items more freely</li> <li>Added further keyboard shortcuts to in-game control hints when placing or moving scenery</li> <li>Improvements to LODs on PC: <ul> <li>Added ‘Very High’ setting to Foliage detail</li> <li>Updated the ‘Very High’ quality preset to correctly use the ‘Very High’ settings for foliage and geo detail</li> <li>Improved level of detail for feathered dinosaurs on lower spec hardware</li> </ul> </li> <li>Revised sandbox settings for preventing juveniles from being hunted in sandbox maps: <ul> <li>The ‘Aggressive Animals’ setting is now changed to ‘Vulnerable Juveniles’ (this new setting will inherit the setup from the previous ‘Aggressive Animal’ setting from current saves)</li> <li>It now disables all juvenile attacks instead of just disabling attacks against juveniles of the same species</li> <li>Setting the fight frequency sandbox setting to ‘None’ now prevents juveniles from being attacked</li> <li>Setting the cohabitation sandbox setting to ‘All Like’ now prevents juveniles from being attacked</li> </ul> </li> <li>Path and Fence building modes now default ‘Replace Mode’ to ‘Off’ when opened</li> <li>Pylons can now be placed between Islands on maps made with Island Generator</li> <li>Added guest food scattering animation for Dinosaur Encounter attraction</li> <li>Adjusted frequency of Dinosaurs present in Dinosaur Encounter attraction</li> <li>Added group edit shortcut when playing with mouse.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-team-behind-my-2021-game-of-the-year-is-back-and-i%E2%80%99m-conflicted.1349161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There aren’t many games I recommend as wholeheartedly as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><span>2021’s </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i></a><span>. GoodbyeWorld Games’ brisk, beautiful narrative adventure game is a devastating, cathartic, and clever project that rolls a lifetime’s worth of ups and downs into its quick 90-minute play time. Its eye-tracking control scheme is one of the most meaningfully frustrating ones I’ve experienced, as it skips through entire segments of its story every time your webcam sees you blink. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>, the follow-up from Nice Dream Games, extrapolates this idea into a 3-and-a-half-hour experience, and it feels like turning a really tight Pixar short into a feature film, for good and ill.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>has the same sentimentality running through its veins that made </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>an incredibly heartwarming story despite the tragedy at its center, but it’s far less introspective. The new release</span> <span>is the story of a baby named Isaac who, somehow, has adult-level intelligence, though he can’t communicate that to his frazzled mother, spritely sister, and suspiciously chill father. But because he has an adult’s intuition, he can observe all the chaos of their lives and try his best to be a helpful son and brother. Sometimes that takes the form of just being a chill baby who isn’t causing trouble; at other times, he gets a bit more hands-on. What can a baby who can barely crawl do as his family navigates all their adult bullshit? A lot, actually, because Isaac has psychic powers.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>was entirely built around eye-tracking tech as a bit of narrative design, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s implementation of a webcam is far more mechanical in the traditional sense. Blinking activates Isaac’s psychic abilities in a way that often changes depending on the situation. It can shut down machinery, help you clean up a mess in your bedroom, and if you close your eyes and turn your head, you can listen in on your family’s worried thoughts. In this game, blinking is basically an extra button that certainly still feels novel, but it’s not quite as effective in what it communicates. </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>made an entire mechanic out of “blink and you’ll miss it,” but when </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>uses the same webcam-based control scheme, it feels like something that could have just as easily been communicated by pressing a different button on your controller. In a way, it feels more like a reference to the team’s previous history than it does something truly integrated into everything </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>seeks to explore.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the later game sequences, in which </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>sheds some of its focus on its supernatural family story in favor of some surprisingly dark science fiction and espionage twists, have you blinking as Isaac navigates mazes of obstacles and threats to his safety, and the game registers these inputs based on where your cursor is if you’re playing with a mouse and keyboard. I played through all of </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>with headphones to listen in on my family’s thoughts and a webcam to blink my psychic will onto the world around me, but in its effort to stretch out </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>’ concise ideas into something longer,&nbsp; </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>fails to develop as strong of a grasp on why it’s implementing these ideas, beyond the team wanting this approach to gameplay to feel like a signature facet of their work.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642520"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642520">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to keep comparing </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, but the contrast between the two is one of the most interesting things about Isaac’s journey. It’s about twice as long, but doesn’t feel like it overstays its welcome, even if it’s lacking the same singular vision. The game’s psychic set pieces are more mechanical, but they’re doused in a childlike mischief and naivete that is delightful, and that makes the moments when reality intervenes as devastating as any slap on the wrist you received as a kid. Despite Isaac’s adult-level intellect and grown-ass voiceover from </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span>*</span> <span>actor Lewis Pullman, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>hits at childhood shame, embarrassment, and familial resentment like they’re all raw nerves. Then it gradually becomes about so many other things that even gesturing at its many twists and turns risks spoiling it entirely.</span></p> <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>runs with every idea it has with a childlike confidence, but it’s also such a different story by the end than it is at the start that I wouldn’t be surprised if people find that one half of its tale resonates with them, while the other falls flat. When it’s at its best, it feels like being cradled and read your favorite story; then come moments when it’s as if the reader got bored with one story and picked up an altogether different one. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for in a heartwarming message at the end, but it’s a bit of a rollercoaster getting there. At least it’s worth riding for the highs.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 9‘s Vivi Has Finally Been Banned From Magic: The Gathering]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/vivi-ornitier-cauldron-ban-mtg-final-fantasy-2000642504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9%E2%80%98s-vivi-has-finally-been-banned-from-magic-the-gathering.1349158/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vivi is a small and unassuming Black Mage caught in an existential crisis in<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy IX</em> and an absolute wrecking ball <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-more-gorgeous-final-fantasy-mtg-cards-are-coming-and-theyre-already-selling-out-again-2000630364">in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The clever, lovable riff on a classic RPG archetype was responsible for what many considered the most busted deck in the card game’s current format. Fans have been waiting for him to be banned from Edge of Eternities Standard for months. Today, it finally happened.</p>

 <p>Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-november-10-2025">revealed</a> its updated banned and restricted list on November 10 as promised and, sure enough, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</a> was on it. The 0/3 Wizard gets a +1/+1 counter and deals 1 damage to each opponent every time you cast a noncreature spell, but that’s not all. Once per turn, players also get to use Vivi to generate red and blue mana equal to his power.</p>

 <p>At just three mana to play, Vivi’s a very powerful, very versatile card. Pair it with <a href="https://aetherhub.com/Metagame/Traditional-Standard/Deck/ur-soul-cauldron-1348701">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>, which stacks more +1/+1 counters and gives creatures access to all exiled creatures’ abilities, and you have a recipe for the most dominant and annoying deck of the year.</p>

 <p>“God, Vivi-Cauldron decks make for miserable games,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1nbwgh6/rant_god_vivicauldron_decks_make_for_miserable/">wrote</a> one player months ago. “The worst part are repetitive, monotonous play patterns and waiting for my opponent to take 5-minute turns when they had lethal on board after 30 seconds.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3">https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3</a> <a href="https://t.co/bADvMaFx4u">pic.twitter.com/bADvMaFx4u</a></p> <p>— Dr. Perplexed (@drperplexed) <a href="https://twitter.com/drperplexed/status/1987959578399535473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As a result, Vivi Cauldron was dominating top-deck lists and driving up the prices of the relevant cards to ridiculous post-launch levels. Some players were looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1mj8va3/the_vivi_cauldron_deck_is_8001000_in_paper/">prices of over $400</a> to build competitive decks with Vivi Ornitier, only falling <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631015/magic-final-fantasy-vivi-ornitier?srsltid=AfmBOooPpIF-JpPxhFkm4z1dPrbgI3gTepv91SKyFS8973Cjz2PhqdFp">below $30 apiece</a> once the autumn hit. Things got so bad in competitive <em>MtG </em>that Wizards of the Coast stepped in back in September to try and quell frustrations.</p>

 <p>“With the results of the latest Spotlight Series arriving on the heels of several high-profile Standard events, the conversation around the cards <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span>, and speculations on ’emergency’&nbsp; bans in Standard, we thought now would be a good time to check in,” read a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/standard-and-moving-ban-announcement">blog post from September</a>.</p>

 <p>While Wizards didn’t act then, it took the unusual step of bumping up its normal ban date by two weeks and promised a stricter crackdown on broken cards in 2026. The saga of Vivi Ornitier, while great for <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans happy to see one of the series’ unsung heroes shine, reinforced skepticism that many <em>MtG</em> players have had for <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">the Beyond Universes sets,</a> which some feel prioritize flashy fan service at the expense of obvious power creep.</p> <p>“To open up the Standard format for innovation and a wider variety of decks, it’s clear we need to disrupt the <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span> combo,” Wizards wrote in today’s banned card update. “That interaction is too much stronger than the rest of the format. We are opting to ban Vivi Ornitier as it is the card that’s more likely to create future balance problems if allowed to remain in the format. We believe Standard will be more fun and diverse without Vivi Ornitier in it.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Company Used Fake Reddit Posts To Advertise Game, Then Deleted The Evidence]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/trap-plan-marketing-astroturf-warrobots-fake-reddit-accounts-posts-2000642503</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/company-used-fake-reddit-posts-to-advertise-game-then-deleted-the-evidence.1349122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Trap Plan, a large video game marketing company, admitted that it used multiple fake Reddit accounts to help promote a game called <em>WarRobots: Frontiers</em>, pretending to be “authentic” fans and players who just happened to discover the mech game and wanted to share it with others. Trap Plan has since deleted the post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ot0nvg/game_dev_admits_to_large_astroturfing_campaign_on/">but not before folks on Reddit spotted it.</a></p>

 <p>On November 9, <a href="https://www.trapplan.com/about-us">Trap Plan</a> CEO and “marketing expert” Pavel Beresnev posted a short article to the agency’s official website. The post, titled “How we promote <em>WarRobots: Frontiers</em> on Reddit,” goes into detail about how the agency used multiple Reddit accounts to create over 40 posts across multiple subreddits, including r/pcmasterrace and r/PlayStation5, to create “a wave of organic visibility before the next Twitch activation.”</p>

 <p>“The content varied from short clips and GIFs to&nbsp;‘I found this game…’ discovery-style posts,&nbsp;screenshot threads, and&nbsp;light discussion prompts about tactical mech combat and movement mechanics,” explained the CEO. “We avoided direct promotion and focused on&nbsp;native conversation formats. Players discussed the game naturally — asking questions, comparing it to&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MechWarrior</em>, and sharing opinions about tactical mechanics.”</p>

 <p>According to Beresnev, in order to make the posts feel “authentic,” the team played the game, recorded footage, and posted about what they had played. “This created a steady stream of credible, varied content that matched Reddit’s organic tone,” said Beresnev.&nbsp; After sharing some stats about the campaign’s effectiveness, the CEO concluded the post by saying, “Most players didn’t even realize they were part of a marketing effort.”</p>

 <p>At some point in the last 24 hours, the post was seemingly <a href="https://www.trapplan.com/studios-cases/promo-campaign-on-reddit-for-for-warrobots-frontier">deleted from Trap Plan’s website.</a> If you try to read the Reddit marketing article now, it just takes you to a 404 page. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251110014044/https://www.trapplan.com/studios-cases/promo-campaign-on-reddit-for-for-warrobots-frontier">However, it was saved by someone via the Internet Archive</a>, allowing us to see the post as it appeared on Sunday.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted both Trap Plan and <em>WarRobots</em> developer My.Games about the post and the Reddit marketing strategy.</p> <p>As many pointed out on Reddit, this is far from the first time we’ve heard about a marketing agency or publisher using fake accounts to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/">create an astroturf campaign for a video game</a>. But it is odd to see a marketing agency’s CEO so publicly and directly confirm what was done and how it was done. It makes you wonder how many social media posts on sites like Reddit and Twitter are actually written by real fans and how many were trying to trick you into becoming part of a larger marketing campaign.</p> <p><em><strong>Update; 11/10/2025, 3:00 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</strong></em>In an email to <em>Kotaku</em>, Trap Plan CEO Pavel Beresnev explained that while the company did work with My.Games on a marketing campaign, “any Reddit-related activities” were handled “independently” by the marketing agency without approval from My.Games.</p> <blockquote> <p>Our intention was to experiment with a more organic way of promoting games on Reddit — without using bots or fake accounts — and to build a new case study we could use in the future. Unfortunately, when publishing the case study on our website, we wrongfully mentioned MY.GAMES and <em>War Robots: Frontiers</em>, which created a misleading impression that these activities were done on their behalf.</p>  <p>This was entirely our initiative and not commissioned or endorsed by MY.GAMES in any way. We understand this was a mistake and have since removed the case study. We sincerely apologize to MY.GAMES and the<em> War Robots: Frontiers</em> team for the misunderstanding and any confusion it may have caused.</p> </blockquote>
