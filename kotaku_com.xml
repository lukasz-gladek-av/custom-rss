              <p>How come<a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> still isn’t on current-gen consoles? Why did Konami drop its lawsuit against the anime horse game? How many players will be humiliated by Ned Flanders before the <em>Simpsons Fortnite</em> season is over? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. <em>Call of Duty</em> is just a week away. We’ll find out how many people still care or if they’re still too busy recovering from their<em> Battlefield 6</em> and<em> Arc Raiders</em> hangovers.</p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is now the fourth best-selling game of all time</h2> <p>That’s another big win for meticulously rendered horse testicles and proof that painstaking craftmanship can propel your game to the top of the charts even if it’s long, often boring, and essentially feels like the Ken Burns documentary of open-world action games. Take-Two confirmed in its latest earnings report that <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has now sold over 79 million units, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-mk8-2000620694">pushing <em>Mario Kart 8</em> <em>Deluxe</em></a> into fifth place.</p>

 <p>But the game also goes on sale for just $20 a lot, whereas <em>Mario Kart 8</em> is rarely below full price. Take-Two says it’s still the top-selling game of the last seven years in the U.S. in terms of dollar sales. So, we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/read-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-port-rating-1850873886">that rumored Switch 2 and PS5 port</a> any day now, right? right??</p>

 <h2>Square Enix hit with mass layoffs</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688">The <em>Final Fantasy</em> publisher</a> has reportedly fired 140 people across its overseas publishing operations, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. The company says the move will save around $20 million as it continues overhauling its gaming business after years of misfires.</p>

 <h2>Ned Flanders has killed over 33,000 <em>Fortnite</em> players</h2> <p>The friendly <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868"><em>Simpsons</em> neighbor</a> is anything but when he’s roaming the map as a deadly NPC. Epic Games confirmed he’s a stone cold killer. Here’s a clip showing why you don’t want to get in a shootout by his house.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">just checked… Ned Flanders has over 33k global eliminations in Fortnite lol 🥸 <a href="https://t.co/zxLKvdinEL">https://t.co/zxLKvdinEL</a></p> <p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1986600289353515475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Friendship ended with <em>Skyrim</em> Grandma, now <em>Minecraft</em> Grandma is my best friend</h2> <p><em>Gamesradar</em> reports that a YouTuber who goes by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers" data-hl-processed="none" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-recirculation="[Gamesradar] Article - Inline Link" data-mrf-link="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers">GrammaCrackers</a> is delighting fans with her <em>Minecraft</em> playthroughs in which she discovers all of the twists and turns in the old survival crafting game like it’s brand-new.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-gorilla-tag-the-kids-have-moved-on-to-the-next-big-vr-phenomenon.1347088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>To you or me, VR gaming may have quietly died away a few years back, after everyone played&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> and had their fill of&nbsp;<em>Beat Saber</em>. But to the mysterious collective known as Gen Alpha, the format is alive and well and occupying everything. At the beginning of this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/gorilla-tag-vr-meta-quest-steamvr-free-ghosts-lucy-pbbv-1851741139">we told you about&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em></a> and its massive audience who were all simultaneously under the shared delusion that the game is haunted. But that’s old hat now, because now we have a new game you’ve almost certainly never heard of with a colossal audience: the mighty <em>UG</em>.</p> <p><em>UG</em>&nbsp;bears a lot of similarities with&nbsp;<em>G-Tag</em>, but it’s not nearly as brazen a copy as it might first appear. The older game is all about being a gorilla, and—well—playing tag. It’s a lot more involved than that, not least because of all the bloody in-app cosmetic purchases, but the key thing is that it’s a game that brilliantly understood how to make free first-person movement work in a VR game without causing nausea or discombobulating incongruence. The trick is to make the player avatar into a creature with two long arms, but no legs, propelled around by the instinctive action of pulling yourself along the ground. This works for climbing and bouncing too, resulting in a way to navigate the large, vertically interesting levels as an ape. <em>UG</em>, rather smartly, just copies this wholesale. Except here (even though everyone just looks like gorillas wearing thongs), you’re playing as a bizarro-world caveman, co-existing with dinosaurs who can be hatched from eggs, raised, saddled, and ridden upon. But most importantly: swapped.</p>

  <p>My window into this peculiar world is my now 11-year-old son, for whom we bought a Meta Quest 3A last Christmas. He’s an only child, and it seemed like a great way for him to play active games with his friends even when he’s at home. And it is! Damn, the muscles he’s built flinging his body around as he plays&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em> rather put pay to all those tiresome complaints about gaming making kids sedentary. After nearly a year of on-and-off phases of playing the game, about three weeks ago a <em>G-Tag</em> playing friend told him he needed to install something new, called <em>UG</em>, and to do it with some matter of urgency. However, because every electronic item he owns is locked down to the point of being brick-like without my permissions, he then came begging to me. I checked it over, thought it looked like yet another <em>Gorilla Tag</em> knock-off he’d bounce off in a couple of days like all the others, but given it was free, I said sure.</p>

 <p>Our lives are now very much about prying him free of his headset for brief moments in which he’s not attempting to feed chickens to an ever-growing menagerie of dinosaurs. For him and squillions of kids around the world, <em>UG</em> has become a big deal.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642107">© ContinuumXR / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Quite why is really very fascinating to me, a dad looking on in bemusement (often directly, via the mobile app, where I’m instructed to cast his game to my phone so I can see the new additions to his prehistoric collection). Because while <em>Gorilla Tag</em> has a central game around which everything else is built (tag),&nbsp;<em>UG</em> does not. It’s instead a similarly designed series of large, open spaces, where players can take dinos they’ve collected to help them level up by feeding them food. Right now this food is either comically prehistoric-looking chickens or pigs, which you hold in front of your dinosaur’s foot to have it magically pop into cooked ribs and drumsticks (yes, chicken ribs and pork drumsticks), which you then feed to the beast’s mouth. As it eats its gains XP, and at level 5 will have a sudden growth spurt and become large enough to “buy” a saddle for (with in-game Bones), and then you can ride it around as your mount. There are large dinosaur bosses to fight, with very small chances of a victory seeing an egg drop as loot, but that’s about it. This is, instead, all about the trading.</p>

 <p>I should mention, there very much are in-app purchases for both cosmetics and special versions of the imaginary dinosaurs that inhabit the game, and this sucks big-time. We’ve had full-on rows over my son’s belief that $30 is a very reasonable price for a bundle, because bought separately they’d cost so much more. “THEY’RE PICTURES THAT DON’T COST <em>ANYTHING </em>TO MAKE!” I’ve yelled in exasperation, waving my arms around and adding things like, “YOU’RE TRYING TO SPEND TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS ON DRAWINGS THAT DON’T EVEN EXIST!” I don’t understand. I’m an old fool who just doesn’t get it. And it’s his money, so how is it any of my business! And so on. But that aside, there are various ways to get your own dinosaurs without paying, primary among them swapping something you have for something someone else has.</p>

 <p>To this end, the game’s main hub area has trading tables on which players can place up to five creatures they’re willing to exchange, and then each pulls a lever to seal the deal. And watching this is&nbsp;<em>extraordinary</em>. Imagine the trading floor of a financial market, but with pre-pubescent voices. It’s frantic and furious, with stakes constantly being raised as multiple people on the server start trying to outbid a player for their especially interestingly patterned version of a Grugadon. And often, this is before the kid has even suggested they’re interested in trading, just happening to have stomped by while riding their proudest dino. My son has often had to escape to a private instance (you dial a random four-digit code into a machine to do this) to get away from marauding crowds trying to scream over each other for his electric-blue Triskeletops.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642108">© ContinuumXR / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game also demonstrates plenty of the peculiar conspiratorial nonsense that pervades&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em>. Because, guys, have you heard, Mammothors are getting deleted tomorrow? No, seriously, they’re pulling them from the game. You see, this admin leaked them before he was supposed to, and now they’re taking them all out of the game. This was the BIG story the week before last, and I’d hear kids talking about it (a weird thing about the Meta Quest headset is you can hear everything if you’re in the same room, but they can’t hear you when you mock them from the couch) no matter how many different servers my kid was on. Via the magic of checking the Discord (that just recently celebrated 100,000 members), I discovered that absolutely no dinosaurs are being deleted (clearly the rumors had spread far enough that there was a need to publicly respond), and then hilariously enough, come November’s post-Halloween update, Mammothors have become the focus. Every nonsensical memetic belief seems to be based around these spurious “admins,” not least the wild theories that everyone seems to believe about “duping,” based on a bug that was eliminated from the game over a month before. It’s fascinating to observe how these rumors evolve and spread, formed from nothing at all, and how hard it can be to dispel any one of these beliefs.</p> <p>But as inaccessibly weird as it all appears to me, there is a vast audience out there, and it’s growing fast. There have been an awful lot of attempts to muscle in on the success of <em>Gorilla Tag</em> in the three years since it released, perhaps most successfully by an extremely similar game called&nbsp;<em>Animal Company&nbsp;</em>that, earlier this year, became the most popular game on the Meta store. But most others come and go as the obvious knock-offs they are. <em>UG</em> is doing something different, however. It’s been sitting at the top of the Meta charts for weeks now, and while the perennial hit <em>Beat Saber</em> still sits in second, it’s&nbsp;<em>Animal Company</em> that’s third, while <em>Gorilla Tag</em> has been dethroned to fourth place. This really seems to suggest the caveman game is siphoning players directly from <em>G-Tag</em>‘s audience. It’s interesting to note that 2022’s gorilla game has amassed 164,000 ratings over the last three years, while <em>UG</em> already has acquired 163,000 in just the three months since it released.</p> <p>But these games have mercurial audiences, and at any moment&nbsp;<em>UG</em> could become last month’s thing, forgotten in the pile of free-to-play games inside the headset, as everyone moves on to the next near-identical game. And we, the people who think we’re the normal game players, will likely not even know any of it is happening.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Online PvPvE survival extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is very good</a>. But since launching last month, players have started to grow frustrated with the paid multiplayer game’s pricey cosmetics. And a silly helmet for a chicken is perhaps the best example of how paid skins and cosmetics can go oh so wrong, even in otherwise great games.</p> <p>On November 6, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/charging_10_for_a_chicken_helmet_that_you_only/">a post about a new cosmetic item for a chicken exploded in popularity on the <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ subreddit</a>. In the game, each player has a chicken named <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Scrappy">Scrappy</a> who periodically provides them with random resources between matches. This chicken can only be seen in one menu of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, and yet, developer Embark has already created at least two different paid cosmetic looks for Scrappy. The newest chicken skin for sale is an old-fashioned diving helmet. This helmet alone costs 700 Raider Tokens, which translates to about $7, though due to the way the currency is sold in bundles, you’ll have to spend $10 to get that many tokens. The post about the helmet reached over 7k upvotes by Friday.</p>

   <p>Reaction to the helmet is a bit all over the place. Some players think it’s very dumb, but don’t mind because it doesn’t affect the game. Others feel like Embark is being greedy for charging so much for something that players will rarely see. There’s also a lot of confusion over why the cosmetics in <em>Arc Raiders</em> are so expensive. Keep in mind this isn’t a free-to-play game like <em>Fortnite</em>. To play <em>Arc Raiders</em>, you gotta spend $40. Some players assumed the fact that it’s a game you buy would shield it from free-to-play cosmetic guff, but this chicken helmet has made it clear that won’t be the case.</p>

 <p>“I understand this is a live service game, being supported for 10 years. But this is a bit ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/comment/nnhcsdy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said one user.</a> “Considering half the skins aren’t even a different base model and are priced half the cost of the damn game. It’s okay to speak up about these things, because ultimately greed destroys companies — even if just silly cosmetics.”</p>

   <p>That’s the other problem with this new chicken helmet. While it can be bought separately, it is also included in a cosmetic bundle that features an outfit for your in-game character. However, a lot of players noticed that this “new” skin looks nearly identical to a previously sold cosmetic outfit. This has led to some players claiming that Embark has done a mere palette swap and is charging players roughly $15 for the privilege of buying a similar skin all over again.</p> <p>I doubt these pricey and somewhat ugly skins and items will sink<em> Arc Raiders</em> anytime soon. The game is one of the most-played titles on Steam right now and shows no sign of slowing down. But these expensive cosmetics are a reminder that, somehow, <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">we are truly in an era where a $15 to $20 skin is not just common</a>, but something most players seem to ignore or even accept. Just a few of these skins add up to the total price of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which is wild. But if people are buying them… well.</p>

              <p>Almost nobody buys $4,000 laptops. They’re amazing on paper, sure, but they’re also out of reach for most people. That’s why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/">when Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM) suddenly drops to $999 from its regular $3,999 price</a>, it makes noise. You’re getting a powerful machine at a quarter of its usual price which is why this deal (freshly posted on Amazon for Black Friday) isn’t likely to last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Serious Laptop for Real Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop isn’t a lightweight in any sense other than how easy it is to carry: It’s designed to <strong>crush productivity tasks</strong> while staying flexible enough for entertainment, content creation or business use. At its core, you’ll find <strong>Intel’s new Core 7 150U processor</strong> which runs up to 5.4GHz with 10 cores and 12 threads. That’s a lot of power for something you can carry around all day, and you can feel it in how it handles demanding workloads or 4K streaming with zero slowdown. Paired with integrated Intel graphics, it provides a smooth experience without draining your battery too fast.</p>



<p>Dell gave this model the specs to back up that performance promise: You get <strong>32GB of high-speed DDR5 RAM</strong> to keep things running smoothly like editing video, compiling data, and jumping on a video call-all at the same time. Plus,<strong> 1TB of lightning-fast SSD storage</strong> means your laptop boots instantly, and apps open in seconds. There’s no noise, no lag, and minimal heat.</p>
<p>For one, the design itself looks and feels premium. The <strong>screen is a 16-inch touchscreen with Full HD+ resolution</strong>, supported by IPS and WVA technology, meaning users will get more vivid colors and wider viewing angles ideal for either presentation work or creative sketching. With 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare protection, you can confidently work in bright cafes or by a window without any reflections getting in the way.</p>



<p>Connectivity is another area where this laptop doesn’t compromise. It comes with all the right modern ports — USB-C, HDMI, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 — which means pairing devices or hooking up monitors is fast and painless. The HD webcam and noise-canceling microphones make every virtual call sharper and more professional, while the backlit keyboard keeps late-night typing sessions comfortable.</p>
<p>For its class, battery life holds up solidly enough that getting through a full workday or cross-country flight without scrambling for an outlet is quite achievable. It comes with <strong>Windows 11 Pro installed by default</strong> and keeps the system stable and secure-a nice touch for those who rely on their machine daily for professional use.</p>
<p>It isn’t shy about discounts, though: Amazon has now dropped this Dell Laptop to an all-time low of $999 for Black Friday, a full 75% off its usual price. Black Friday deals this deep don’t stay live for long and this one might vanish as quickly as it appeared.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/echo-show-5-is-back-to-its-black-friday-record-low-amazons-smart-display-now-costs-pennies-2000642078</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/echo-show-5-is-back-to-its-black-friday-record-low-amazon%E2%80%99s-smart-display-now-costs-pennies.1346971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s something addictive about smart displays once you start using one: You can check the weather, set alarms, play your favorite playlists, video call friends or peek into your connected cameras-all with a quick voice command. The Amazon Echo Show 5 nails that balance between screen and speaker and makes it one of the easiest smart home upgrades you can get. Now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/"> it’s dropped to a record low of $59, down from its regular $89 price</a> which makes jumping into the Alexa ecosystem even more tempting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than a Smart Display</h2>
<p>Amazon designed the Echo Show 5 to do everything your old smart speaker can’t: The <strong>5.5-inch display may sound small, but it’s key to transforming how you interact with your assistant</strong>. You can glance at the time, watch your favorite Prime Video series, follow step-by-step recipes or see who’s at the door when paired with compatible cameras. It’s like having an assistant that also gives you context-perfect for those times when hearing isn’t enough.</p>



<p>This generation takes the experience up a notch: The sound is clearer, with twice the bass of older models, meaning your playlists and podcasts actually sound like something worth playing out loud. You can stream directly from Amazon Music, Spotify or any connected app with a nice balance between rich low tones and crisp vocals. And when it’s sitting idle, the screen doubles as a digital photo frame. You can set it to display your favorite pictures or even invite family members to share their own directly to your device. It includes <strong>unlimited cloud photo storage for Prime members</strong>, so it’s as much of a family hub as it is a gadget.</p>



<p>Then there is the way it doubles as your <strong>smart home control center</strong>: You can dim the lights, turn up the thermostat, or get a glimpse of what’s happening on the security feed-all with your voice or a tap. If you have compatible Ring doorbells and cameras, you’ll be able to view real-time footage right from the display. Alexa routines can automate your mornings, too: wake up to gradual light, a daily news briefing, and a playlist softly fading in before breakfast.</p>
<p>With Amazon, privacy remains front and center here. The Echo Show 5 incorporates several layers of protection such as a physical camera shutter and a microphone/camera off button. It is up to you when it’s listening and when it is not. The 2MP camera keeps you in touch through video calls using the Alexa app or another Echo device. It serves as a quick way to check up on family or roommates without opening up your phone.</p>
<p>Amazon is officially returning the Echo Show 5 to its all-time low price of $59 for this early Black Friday deal.</p>

              <p>We’re all now used to every big-name game coming out in five differently priced versions, each containing more in-game stuff than the last, but no matter which you choose you will still be buying the <em>same game</em>. That’s never been the case for the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>series, starting even with its very first English-language release in 1998 with <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em>, each version subtly (but to fans, crucially) different. But have you ever stopped to wonder why? The reason is wonderfully silly.</p> <p>Creating two versions of what mostly boils down to the same game is certainly not an obvious choice. It introduces a huge amount of confusion to an unaware audience, not sure which is the most recent game or whether they’re making a mistake by buying one over the other. To those familiar with the series, it’s a huge feature and selling point, and deciding which version of the game you’re going to buy and why is a big part of the experience. But given the fear of alienation and confusion, it’s hard to imagine most marketing executives would ever allow such a conceit to survive its first boardroom whisper. Yet one of the best-selling game series of all time suggests it can work out OK.</p>

 <p>But why? Well, as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-says-one-of-the-reasons-pokemon-red-and-green-were-made-was-because-creator-satoshi-tajiri-joked-mario-couldnt-be-surpassed-unless-fans-were-sold-2-copies-of-a-game/">GamesRadar</a>&nbsp;</em>spotted via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097">Genki_JPN’s X account</a>, in a recent shareholders meeting Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto was asked if anything could ever outsell <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This caused him to recall a conversation with the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> franchise, Satoshi Tajiri, about how the monster-catching games could ever outdo the success of the <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games. Via machine translation, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf">Miyamoto told investors</a>, “A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of <em>Pokémon</em>, joked with me that if you want to surpass Nintendo’s <em>Mario </em>you’ll have to sell two copies of the game to each customer.”</p>

As phenomenally successful as the <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games have been,&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> tends to beat them on each system. The two wins for <em>Pokémon</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in this match-up have been <em>Pokémon Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Silver</em> on Game Boy Color and <em>Pokémon</em> Ruby and&nbsp;<em>Sapphire</em> on Game Boy Advance. On the DS, 3DS and Switch, <em>Mario</em> has taken the lead each time. (There were no mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games on Wii or Wii U.) But it certainly hasn’t hurt, either, with&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em> selling 26.84 million copies, and&nbsp;<em>Scarlet </em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em> hitting 27.15 million. It’s just that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em> has rather rudely sold 69.56 million, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. <em>Ultimate</em> 36.93 million, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> 29.84 million.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony is filing a lawsuit against an eBay seller who it accuses of selling fake PlayStation 5 accessories, such as carrying cases for the console and its various peripherals, claiming that it has made unauthorized use of the company’s trademarks.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-lawsuit-ebay-counterfeit-playstation-5-accessories-2-million/"><i><span>The Game Post</span></i></a><span> lays out, Sony’s lawsuit against eBay user “zaocuand-002” has the company seeking potentially millions of dollars in damages as it continues to target counterfeit PlayStation products being sold around the internet. eBay is but one of several platforms Sony has been combing through in its search for fake PS5 accessories, as it has also gotten into legal scraps with sellers on Amazon, Walmart, and other sites.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has previously targeted “dozens” of anonymous marketplace sellers in its lawsuits targeting counterfeit PS5 accessories, but this latest eBay lawsuit specifically homes in on the zaocuand-002 account which has, according to </span><i><span>The Game Post</span></i><span>, sold over 9000 items on the platform. A PS5 carrying case is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit, but this listing has seemingly been taken down after the lawsuit was filed in October. Sony’s suit demands that platforms such as eBay “shall disable and cease displaying any advertisements used by or associated with Defendant in connection with the sale of counterfeit and infringing goods using the PlayStation Trademarks</span><span>.” </span><span>Alternatively, the company requests up to $2 million “for each and every use” of the counterfeit trademark, as well as compensation for its legal fees.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Defendant created an e-commerce store operating under at least the Seller Alias that is advertising, offering for sale, and selling Unauthorized Products to unknowing consumers,” the complaint reads. “Defendant attempts to avoid and mitigate liability by operating under at least the Seller Alias to conceal both its identity and the full scope and interworking of its counterfeiting operation.”</span></p> <p><span>Sony’s been getting pretty lawsuit-happy these past few months, as the PlayStation company is also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163"><span>suing Tencent over a pretty blatant </span><i><span>Horizon Zero Dawn </span></i><span>knock-off</span></a><span>. However, the Chinese publisher claims Sony is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858"><span>trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions</span></a><span> with the suit.</span></p>
