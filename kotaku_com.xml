              <p>The current YouTube thumbnail meta requires people to pose extravagant claims or make dramatic declarations alongside exaggerated facial expressions of shock or skepticism. It’s <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/mind-the-curiosity-gap-how-can-upworthy-be-noble-and-right-when-its-clickbait-headlines-feel-so-wrong">curiosity gap</a> farming on steroids, increasingly aided by genAI to flood the platform with absurd content. BabyTuber thumbnails are the antidote.</p> <p>An artist who goes by Jamie on Bluesky shared the first one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social/post/3md7egs5bus2l">earlier this week</a>. It was titled “Why I’m Switching” and showed an infant furrowing its brow while pondering upgrading from toy blocks to a bead maze. There’s a thought bubble, a greater than sign, and a question mark. It’s perfect.</p>   <p>Jamie encouraged others to get in on the fun and share their own Babytuber thumbnails. Some people did. They are also perfect.</p>   <figure id="attachment_2000663921" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663921"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663921">pikuselu.gay</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663922"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663922">‪@wimbostratus.bsky.social‬Follow</figcaption></figure>   <figure id="attachment_2000663923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663923"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663923">misguidedlavender.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663924">athenap.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663925" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663925"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663925">nishbae.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663926" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663926"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663926">kinbassar.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <p>“At the end of the day it’s been fun to see people enjoying it, especially in a time where [every] headline online has been miserable,” Jamie <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-new-baby-youtuber-thumbnail-meta-changes-everything/">told <em>Aftermath</em></a>. “If this silly thing was able to brighten people’s day at all then I’m happy. I’m glad my mutuals seem to be having a laugh instead of being annoyed, haha.”</p>

 <p>Now I need someone to make Baby LinkedIn posts. “Here’s what my 2-year sleep regression taught me about B2B sales.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The decline in Xbox hardware revenue has become so predictable you could <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-bethesda-xbox-game-pass-watch-special-edition-1850527638">set your <em>Starfield</em> watch to it</a>. Microsoft reported its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and, yes, console sales are down yet again. But the rest of the gaming division didn’t have a such a hot holiday either. The company is blaming year-over-year declines on the lack of strong releases near the end of 2025. Hmmm.</p> <p>“Xbox content and services revenue declined 5 percent (down 6 percent CC) on a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party content performance,” reads the company’s <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/Document/DownloadDocument/141/SlidesFY26Q2.pptx">latest earnings presentation</a>. “Xbox hardware revenue declined 32 percent.”</p>

 <p>But last year’s numbers weren’t exactly stellar. The gaming division <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-revenue-fell-7-in-q2-as-hardware-sales-dropped-29/">saw a 7 percent decline</a> overall in the second quarter. Xbox hardware was down 29 percent this time in 2025, while content and services were only up 2 percent. Holiday 2024 had <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> but was otherwise quiet.</p> <p>Holiday 2025, on the other hand, saw the release of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, while<em> Flight Sim</em> came to PS5. Also the underperforming <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which, combined with a major Game Pass price hike, might have led to a spike in churn. We don’t know, though, because Microsoft still isn’t releasing new subscriber numbers.</p>

 <p>All we know for sure is that the Xbox Series X/S is an ever-shrinking part of the equation for Microsoft Gaming and the company in general. And it’s been that way <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-sales-microsoft-next-gen-exclusives-1850375665">almost every year</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ps5-sales-exclusivity-starfield-microsoft-1851436748">since the consoles launched</a>. The company has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-backwards-compatibility-microsoft-pc-2000644836">new hardware</a> but the priorities of the evolving Xbox platform seem to increasingly lie beyond it.</p>

 <p>With the AI arms race led by Microsoft and others spiking <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">gaming hardware costs in the near term</a>, maybe that’s for the best.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former 2K Boss Leaves Amazon Game Studios As It Pivots To Party Slop]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/2k-christoph-hartmann-amazon-studios-crucible-2000663900</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boss of Amazon Game Studios is out. VP Christoph Hartmann is leaving the company according to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdisznjdh22x"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier</a>. It’s another big blow to another tech giant that once had <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-mmo-servers-rust-facepunch-amazon-2000660558">big ambitions for gaming</a>.</p> <p>Hartmann was a cofounder of 2K Games and served as the <em>BioShock</em> and <em>Borderlands</em> publisher’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">president up until he left in 2017</a>. He joined Amazon a year later to lead a range of studios working on games like the MMO <em>New World</em>, which is now set to go offline in January 2027.</p> <p>“Gaming, today’s favorite form of entertainment in the world, is connecting hundreds of millions of people,” Hartmann said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-2k-games-president-christoph-hartmann-joins-amazon-games">when joining Amazon back in 2018</a>. “Between the teams at AGS, the incredible tools and technology from AWS, the global communities of Twitch and Twitch Prime, and all of the other assets around Amazon, there are few companies in the world set up to take gaming to the next level.”</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, Amazon never managed to bring those tools together, or the other resources at its disposal, to deliver a lasting hit in the ultra-competitive gaming space. One of its projects was a 2020 hero shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazons-crucible-flopped-so-hard-its-being-un-released-1844222299">by Relentless Studios called<em> Crucible</em></a>. If you don’t remember it, that’s because a few months after its release it was “unreleased,” and eventually canceled.</p> <p>Amazon signaled it was shifting away from AAA game development last fall amid massive cuts across the company. It still hasn’t confirmed the status of a previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620"><em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO</a>, though one of its developers said <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-lord-rings-mmo-resident-evil-switch-2-pro-controller-2000640104">the team working on it was also laid off</a>, and remains slated to publish the upcoming<em> Tomb Raider</em> games, including this year’s reboot of the original.</p>

 <p>But to the extent that Amazon is still meaningfully invested in gaming, it seems to be mostly focused on its cloud gaming platform Luna. It shifted gears last fall to focus on party games like a courtroom comedy <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-failed-game-streaming-service-luna-pivots-snoop-dogg-ai-2000630696">featuring an AI Snoop Dogg</a>. Hartmann and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
