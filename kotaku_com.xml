But through all those changes, there remain a few things I need in a <em>Doom</em> game to feel satisfied with it. A <em>Doom </em>game checklist, if you will. It’s not long, but it does make up the core of <em>Doom</em>.</p><p>You need lots of monsters and demons to kill. Levels with secrets. A badass shotgun. And you gotta go to Hell at some point. That’s it. Those are the core pillars of <em>Doom</em>. As long as you have that, you can do anything you want. For example, you could make a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-all-the-doom-games-from-worst-to-best-1846753672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-all-the-doom-games-from-worst-to-best-1846753672"><em>Doom </em>game</a></span> set in a techno-medieval fantasy world filled with <em>Game of Thrones</em>-like factions facing off against a demon prince and old gods using guns, swords, and robots. And well, that’s exactly what Id Software has done with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-the-dark-ages-multiplayer-open-world-dev-interview-1851746527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-the-dark-ages-multiplayer-open-world-dev-interview-1851746527"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a></span><em>.</em> But if you were worried that this more open-world spin on the series wouldn’t feel like <em>Doom</em>, don’t be concerned. This is still a kickass and exciting <em>Doom </em>game through and through. It’s just that this time around, the Doomguy gets to punch, kick, and bash more of the demons than usual.</p><h2 id="h481498"><a id=""></a><strong>What is<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a prequel set before the events of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801?_gl=1*beeggg*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY3MzMzNjIkbzM2NyRnMSR0MTc0Njc0MTY4NiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801?_gl=1*beeggg*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY3MzMzNjIkbzM2NyRnMSR0MTc0Njc0MTY4NiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.">Doom</a></span><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801"> 2016</a></span> and its sequel, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a></span><em>. </em>In those two games, we learned a lot about the Doomguy, his history fighting Hell, and the great wars between demons, robot angels, and humans that happened across dimensions long ago. It was all a bit much in a franchise that usually has narratives that can be summed up in a single sentence. “Doomguy is on Mars and fights demons to save the day.” Done. But with the newer games and now <em>Dark Ages,</em> Id is trying to tell a bigger, more complicated story and sadly, it’s the weakest part of <em>Dark Ages.</em></p><p>There are some cool moments sprinkled throughout the numerous (and sometimes lengthy) cutscenes. The Doomguy only says one word and does so in a very action-movie way that I liked. There’s also a great moment in which he’s asked to pay a toll in some underworld by a creepy figure, and just shoots him instead. Love that stuff. But most of the story in<em> Doom: The Dark Ages </em>concerns itself with people hunting for macguffins or for powerful artifacts to get the macguffins, and you’ll likely forget most of it by the time you reach the credits.</p><p>This is a <em>Doom </em>game! I should be killing stuff! Not watching people chat about power, war, and family. Thankfully, the gameplay in <em>Dark Ages</em> overcomes the floppy narrative and mostly forgettable characters.</p><h2 id="h481499"><a id=""></a><strong>Big battles and new toys</strong></h2><p>Because the story involves a big invasion of demons, combat in <em>Dark Ages</em>—unlike in the 2016 reboot and <em>Eternal</em>—often takes place in large, open battlefields and big rooms. The game fills these places with dozens and dozens of demons and lets you slaughter them all using a collection of mostly new and gnarly medieval-inspired weapons. All of them are powerful, loud, and a joy to use, like a cannon that shoots rusty nails and a gun that fires giant cannonballs attached to chains. One of my personal favorites is a machine gun that shreds up skulls and spits them out in a wide cone of death that can clear 100 weak demons in just a few seconds as you sprint around the 22 levels found in <em>Dark Ages</em>.</p><p>More familiar guns are here, too, like a plasma rifle and the BFG, which is now a giant crossbow that can clear an entire battlefield in one big green flash. And yes, there is also a shotgun. <em>Two</em>,<em> </em>actually. The standard semi-auto combat shotgun, which is a solid workhorse I used throughout my 18-hour playthrough, and the returning Super Shotgun, which might be the strongest shotgun ever in a <em>Doom</em> game. This two-barrel death-dealing shotty is able to rip mini-bosses apart in two shots or less. It’s wonderful. So, shotguns; that’s checked off the checklist.</p><figure id="" data-id="00235ece94699021bd22db53dd83f0d0" data-recommend-id="image://00235ece94699021bd22db53dd83f0d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Id Software / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00235ece94699021bd22db53dd83f0d0" data-recommend-id="image://00235ece94699021bd22db53dd83f0d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The big new addition to <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is Doomguy’s shield. You have this thing from the jump, and it stays with you for the entire game. And it rules. Being a shield, you can use it to block gunfire and fireballs, but you can also throw it at demons like a nightmarish Captain America. And because this is <em>Doom</em>, the shield is covered in saw blades, so it rips demons apart or sticks in the bigger ones. The shield can also be used to parry powerful demon attacks and energy blasts. This becomes a big part of combat as you get swarmed by massive demons during later fights.</p><p>Being able to counter their attacks and stun them opens them up for counterattacks with your melee weapon, also new to the franchise, and that loop never gets old in <em>Dark Ages. </em>I smiled every single time I blocked a big hell knight’s attack and then slammed him in the face three times with my spiked mace.</p><p>All of this isn’t just fun, but also important to the combat loop in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. Melee attacks against demons generate ammo, letting you use your guns on tougher foes or far-away targets. Shield tosses can stun bigger foes while you focus on fodder. And the shield charge ability lets you zip across the battlefield and close the distance on demons, letting you more easily punch them for more ammo. Or blast them away with a gun for health and armor. It all works together, and with an hour or so of playing<em> Dark Ages</em>, I found myself getting into a bloody ballet-like flow of blocking, dodging, shield tossing, punching, and shooting. And I was more aggressive than usual as the game rewarded me with health, armor, and bullets for doing so.</p><p>Unlike in <em>Eternal</em>, most enemies can be defeated with most weapons, so you are freer to kill how you want and not forced to use specific guns on specific demons all the time. That is, until one of the few super tough demons arrives and forces you to change things up a bit. But in those moments, I wasn’t annoyed as I was in <em>Eternal </em>when facing baddies like the Marauder, as these battles against minibosses with powerful shields and more health helped break up the pace of <em>Dark Ages </em>and they could still be defeated using most of my tools. I just had to focus a bit more and be careful.</p><h2 id="h481500"><a id=""></a><strong>A whole new world…filled with dragons and mechs</strong></h2><p>Beyond a new focus on melee combat and your shield, the other big change in <em>Dark Ages</em> is the size of levels. To be clear: <em>Dark Ages </em>isn’t an open-world game. It is still a series of levels you run through. But some of these levels are massive and filled with optional secrets and demon bosses to kill.</p><p>Most of the time, these secrets aren’t too involved. You might have to toss your shield at a hidden gear to open a door or break down a wall to find some hidden gold and armor. You aren’t doing side quests for random NPCs like in most open-world games. The Doomguy isn’t killing five rats for some leather or whatever. The open-world-ish levels are just filled with more optional opportunities to enjoy the excellent combat and movement in <em>Dark Ages</em> while earning some rewards. And these rewards will let you upgrade, improve, and modify your armor, health, guns, shield, and melee weapons. You can make the Super Shotgun even more powerful, carry more ammo, or add an augment to your shield that electrifies enemies around you every time you counter an attack. This upgrade system feels more streamlined than the one in <em>Doom Eternal</em>, which I’m thankful for, but I still feel that upgrade trees shouldn’t be a thing in <em>Doom</em>. It ain’t on my checklist, that’s for sure.</p><p>Speaking of things not on my checklist, let’s talk about big mechs and dragons. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> sprinkles in a few moments throughout the campaign that see the Doom Slayer ride a cybernetic dragon or operate a giant kaiju-killing mech. These aren’t a massive part of the game and are instead used to help add some variety between bigger maps and boss fights. I’ll admit that I was nervous about the addition of vehicle segments to the franchise, but Id has done a fantastic job of incorporating both dragon flying and mech fighting into the world of <em>Doom</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="14b8a515f5c68deb0b02d9420d7c7ae8" data-recommend-id="image://14b8a515f5c68deb0b02d9420d7c7ae8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Id Software / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14b8a515f5c68deb0b02d9420d7c7ae8" data-recommend-id="image://14b8a515f5c68deb0b02d9420d7c7ae8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two reasons these segments work are simple: they’re easy to understand and wonderful to play. In <em>Dark Ages</em>, flying a dragon or controlling a massive robot was straightforward enough that, within a few minutes, I completely understood the controls for each. And Id has made sure that swooping around on the back of a dragon feels just as smooth as running and killing as the Doom Slayer on foot. Likewise, the mech feels powerful but not slow and clunky. And I must say, getting to uppercut a skyscraper-sized demon lord with a mech is one of the coolest things I’ve done in a video game in some time.</p><p>Another great thing about these segments: they don’t last too long, so if you don’t like ‘em, don’t worry, you’ll be back to old-school running and gunning soon enough.</p><h2 id="h481501"><a id=""></a><strong>Endings are hard, huh?</strong></h2><p>Something that does last too long in <em>Dark Ages</em> is the ending. For some reason,<em> Dark Age</em>s basically ends twice. There’s a big boss finale that builds in difficulty and tension near the end of the game. There’s a moment which I won’t spoil that made me hate the bad guy so much and fired up the Doom Slayer even more. It was wonderful. I dug my fingers into my keyboard. I was ready to fucking kill this big bad final boss after what he did. And I had a blast fighting him and ripping him apart.</p><p>And then, instead of ending the game there, the devs at Id Software added <em>one more </em>very massive level and two more boss fights. It’s not that the level or the boss fights at the very end are bad; it just feels poorly paced. And cramming a lengthy cutscene in the midst of it all didn’t help.</p><p>For a game that built momentum so perfectly throughout its entire run, it’s unfortunate that it ends with a whimper. Note for the future: When you reach the finale, end the story. Don’t do a second finale. Considering the fact that this game will get some DLC in the future, it will one day have the equivalent of three climaxes. I need more shotguns in <em>Doom</em>, not more finales.</p><p>Regardless of that mistake, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is still a standout example of how to take an old franchise and do something with it that feels fresh while still being true to the lineage of the series. And while <em>Dark Ages</em> has one too many cutscenes and endings, none of that ruins the frenetic and ultra-smooth combat, not even some bits in which you ride a dragon and pilot a mech. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a brilliant, bloody, and hyper-aggressive remix of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-running-on-pdf-weird-port-id-software-fps-pc-mod-1851739634&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-on-pdf-weird-port-id-software-fps-pc-mod-1851739634"><em>Doom </em>formula</a></span> that works in more ways than it doesn’t. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is <em>the</em> rivalry of a generation, and it will be rekindled again—perhaps for the final time—at WWE Backlash.</p><p>Born out of the Ruthless Aggression Era, their feud has spanned decades, titles, and turning points in the industry. Cena became the Hulk Hogan-esque face of the company, wearing bright colors, coining memorable catchphrases, always doing the right thing, and securing impossible underdog victories night in and night out.</p><p>Orton, meanwhile, embodied pure evil. Aptly nicknamed the WWE’s “Apex Predator,” his violent move set and remorseless attitude made him one of the most dangerous, despicable heels in the history of professional wrestling.</p><p>In the 2000s and early 2010s, they were two sides of WWE’s main-event coin: Cena the superhero, Orton the supervillain. They were meant for each other.</p><p>Now, in 2025, the roles are reversed, but the animosity remains. Ahead of the WWE Backlash pay-per-view, we examine the ins, outs, RKOs, and Attitude Adjustments of John Cena and Randy Orton’s historic rivalry.</p></div></div><div><p>John Cena and Randy Orton squared off long before the WWE Universe knew their names… and before Cena was literally “Cena.”</p><p>The Prototype, as he was dubbed in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), the WWE’s former developmental territory, met his future rival multiple times in the promotion. Most notably, he defeated “Cowboy” Bob Orton’s son for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw7SgbM7i5w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw7SgbM7i5w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OVW Championship</a></span> in the latter’s final match with the company. The WWE had plans for Mr. RKO.</p><p>Twenty-five years and 31 combined world championships later, Orton looks to return the favor. Orton may very well kill the legend of John Cena at Backlash by capturing the title and sending the GOAT into retirement empty-handed. The full-circle moment writes itself.</p></div><div><p>By this point, Cena had shed his Doctor of Thuganomics persona to be the superhero marine that embodied “Hustle, Loyalty, and Respect” and crashed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcvJV5F1HM4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcvJV5F1HM4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live sex celebrations</a></span>. Orton leveraged his success as the “Legend Killer” in wrestling stable Evolution to become the youngest world champion ever, and nearly decapitate <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xooL_QCFLI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xooL_QCFLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shawn Michaels</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtf8OcwFZ_0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtf8OcwFZ_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Van Dam</a></span>.</p><p>The stage was set for the WWE’s new face to cross paths with its most sinister heel.</p><p>Orton hit Cena with several patented “Outta nowhere!!” RKOs leading up to their bout at SummerSlam 2007, which Cena won thanks to a big comeback (shocker!). The following night on Raw, Orton ripped Cena’s father over the barricade and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GETeK8ptPA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GETeK8ptPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">punted the bejesus</a></span> out of him in a move that is still burned in every wrestling fan’s memory over 15 years later.</p><p>The two wrestled at Unforgiven a month later, which Orton won by disqualification seven minutes in when Cena ignored the ref’s calls to stop wailing on his opponent. A payoff match was set for No Mercy the following month, but Cena legitimately tore his pectoral muscle days before, and then was viciously attacked by the newly nicknamed “Viper.”</p><p>With Cena out, Orton won the title. While the feud teased the duo’s electric chemistry, it left a lot to be desired. Fortunately, it wouldn’t be long before the duo traded blows again in the squared circle.</p></div><div><p>In 2008, John Cena pulled off his most iconic Super-Cena feat. The same pectoral injury Cena suffered (thanks to Orton, in kayfabe) was supposed to put him on the shelf for at least 6 months. Instead, he shocked the world than 4 months later to win the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlObJjzoyk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlObJjzoyk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Rumble at Madison Square Garden</a></span>. If you ever want to know how deafening an audience pop can get, just listen to how the Madison Square Garden crowd roared when Super-Cena came from behind the curtains.</p><p>That meant Cena would face WWE Champion Randy Orton for the title he never lost. But, they didn’t wait until WrestleMania to pick up where they left off. The foes fought at No Way Out in an emotion-filled, physical contest that saw Orton eventually “throw in the towel” (or rather, a wet blanket) by slapping the ref and disqualifying himself to retain.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Cena, Orton, and Triple H met in a Triple Threat match at WrestleMania XXIV. “The Viper” slithered to an underhanded victory, punting Triple H after his former mentor pedigreed Cena, then covering Cena for the 1-2-3 to retain the title.</p><p>Less than a month later, Orton pulled off a similar tactic in a Fatal 4-Way match at Backlash. He eliminated Cena with a punt after Cena forced JBL to tap. If the second John Cena and Randy Orton feud helped establish “Big Match John” as Superman, then Orton’s opportunistic constricting was his kryptonite.</p></div><div><p>Bald-headed Randy was a MENACE!</p><p>Early in 2009, Orton and his Legacy pals (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) locked horns with the McMahons. He punted Vince and DDT’d, then kissed Stephanie while she lay unconscious next to her helpless, handcuffed husband Triple H. Talk about a bad day at the office.</p><p>Orton attributed his uncontrollable violence to IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder), claiming he wasn’t responsible for his actions… and you believed him. There truly seemed to be “voices” in his head; multiple personalities urging him to commit heinous act after heinous act. When the unforgivable deed of the day was done, he emoted both terror and exhilaration. He was deranged and may have deserved an Emmy for it.</p><p>By the time summer rolled around, Orton’s mental and physical transformation was complete. He shaved his head and became WWE’s Voldemort. VoldemOrton, if you will. Once handsome and charismatic, now sub-human and sadistic. He was pure evil, and the internet remembers.</p><p>Cue John Cena’s music. Cena and Orton renewed their rivalry, embarking on a five-matches-in-four-months odyssey for the WWE Championship, with Orton winning thrice and Cena winning twice.</p><p>Cena officially ended Orton’s reign in a 60-minute, anything-goes Iron Man bout at Bragging Rights. The feud solidified both men as inevitable.</p></div><div><p>Nothing brings WWE superstars together quite like a common enemy.</p><p>A tornado in the form of the Nexus ravaged through the WWE in the summer of 2010, destroying everyone and everything that stood in their path, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcUrh7xUcqM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcUrh7xUcqM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including John Cena</a></span>.</p><p>In his efforts to vanquish the group, Cena competed in a highly stipulated match with the faction’s leader Wade Barrett: if Cena won, the Nexus would disband. If Barrett won, Cena would join the “terrorist” organization. Barrett won and Cena became his lackey.</p><p>Barrett then embarked on a quest to capture the WWE title from Randy Orton, and enlisted Cena to be in his corner during their championship match at Bragging Rights. When that didn’t yield results, Barrett had Cena act as a special guest referee in his rematch against Orton with the understanding that if Barrett didn’t walk away champion, Cena would be fired.</p><p>The morally upstanding Cena counted the 1-2-3, giving Orton the win and costing himself his job. The next night on Raw, Cena made a farewell speech in the ring, and as he walked backstage out of the arena, Randy Orton shook his hand and they hugged. It was a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1OxTdN0JQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1OxTdN0JQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surreal Thor and Loki</a></span> brotherly love moment.</p></div><div><p>Three years post-Nexus invasion, the WWE looked different. CM Punk’s pipe bomb promo catapulted him to icon status, The Shield wreaked havoc, Daniel Bryan became the most beloved star since Stone Cold, and The Authority—led by Triple H and Stephanie McMahon—called the shots.</p><p>Despite a new wave of A+ talent and storylines, John Cena and Randy Orton, their generation’s Rock and Austin, fought in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to unify the WWE and World Heavyweight titles. Orton won the contest (and retained in a rematch at the Royal Rumble), but the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfkSrk1QuY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfkSrk1QuY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Championship Ascension Ceremony</a></span>” on the Raw prior to TLC remains the highlight of the feud.</p><p>As Cena and Orton stood face-to-face, former world champions packed the ring. Orton cheap-shotted Cena, sparking a domino effect brawl involving Triple H, Punk, Shawn Michaels, and Daniel Bryan. The melee ended with Orton accidentally knocking down Stephanie McMahon and Triple H retaliating with a Pedigree.</p><p>Like Daniel Bryan and the “YES” Movement hijacked Raw, they too will hijack this write-up, as the fans’ unrelenting desire for him to become the unified champ—strongly reinforced by this moment—eventually played out.

John Cena is a heel.</p><p>The self-proclaimed unseen 17-time champion alleges he’s the victim of a decades-long abusive relationship with fans. He low-blowed Cody Rhodes to win the WWE title at WrestleMania and eclipse Ric Flair’s record. He says he’s raised the WWE Universe’s kids better than their own parents.

Somehow, it works. It’s two veterans with new outlooks clashing once again.</p><p>When Randy Orton and John Cena square off at Backlash, it may very well be the last time they do. The time is now to live in the moment and enjoy. We’ve only got a few of those left with Cena.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
