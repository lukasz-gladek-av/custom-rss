It promised new booster packs by the end of the year, so likely sometime in December, as well as trading in January 2025. </p><p>How exactly will trading work? We still don’t quite know that part. It seems highly unlikely that it will be a straight 1:1 mechanic for all cards currently in the game. Instead, it’s possible trading will be restricted to certain categories, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181">more common non-star cards</a></span> or cards you already own at least one copy of. “We are planning to gradually expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded,” <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s devs write. </p><p>In the meantime, new booster packs could mean one of two things: a whole new set of cards to follow Genetic Apex, or new promo packs for the same set, as we’ve seen in the Lapras ex drop event.

The question that still remains is whether these will be variants of Pokémon that are already in the game, or if these new booster packs might add an entirely new section to the Pokédex. </p><p>The <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> devs also teased “new features in development outside of the trade feature introduced here.” Many players, including myself, already have plenty of requests for what these should be.
