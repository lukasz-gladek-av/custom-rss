            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-the-iphone%E2%80%AF17-amazon-is-offloading-the-new-pixel%E2%80%AF10-for-2x-cheaper-this-prime-day.1318492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The new Google Pixel 10 just landed, and if you’ve been eyeing a phone that can keep up with your daily chaos while delivering pro-level photos without the pro-level hassle, this deal is hard to ignore. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/">just dropped the price of the 128GB model to $649 for Prime members, down from $799</a>. That’s a rare discount on a flagship device that literally came out weeks ago and is already going toe-to-toe with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Pixel 10 is Different</h2>
<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Actua display is a major strength</strong>: With a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, you actually get to see what’s on your display when you’re outdoors under direct sunlight, no longer squinting or covering the phone with your hand to view a text message. The display is covered by Corning’s scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the phone boasts an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>The camera system is where Google shows off: That improved triple rear camera array now boasts a 5x telephoto lens, driving its Super Res Zoom to a whopping 20x, so you can snap clear, sharp shots of your child’s soccer goal from across the sideline, for example, or of that street musician across the courtyard without your picture ending up a grainy mess. Night Sight, meanwhile, still wows by delivering clean, clear images even when lighting is awful, say, indoors at a poorly lit restaurant or after a sunset walk. A new feature called <em>Camera Coach</em> also provides real-time advice to assist with nailing your composition and exposures so it’s not a guessing game of being on manual mode nor pure auto mode.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life sits at 24-plus hours</strong> on a single charge with fast-charging support, so you’re not tethered to an outlet by mid-afternoon. This is an unlocked Android phone, giving you full freedom to switch carriers whenever you want and choose your own data plan. It works seamlessly with Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and other major carriers, so you’re not locked into one ecosystem or stuck with a device that only plays nice with a single network.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini AI integration is where the Pixel 10 moves ahead of the pack</strong>. Instead of having to type out every question or task, you’re free to speak naturally via Gemini Live. Point your camera at something interesting, like an unknown plant on a hike or a sea creature at the aquarium, and Gemini will identify it and give you context. You’re also free to chat with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, compose an email, schedule your day, or have things done across multiple apps without having to manually switch between each one. It’s an assistant kind of feature that is useful as opposed to gimmicky.</p>
<p>This obsidian version of the 128GB model is just offered at this market for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and as new as the Pixel 10 is, a discount like this is rare. Make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-is-offloading-the-delta-2-amazon-lists-the-1800w-power-station-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000632497</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-is-offloading-the-delta%E2%80%AF2-amazon-lists-the-1800w-power-station-at-its-lowest-price-ever.1318486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages don’t send you a warning text before they strike and the last thing you want is to be scrambling in the dark wondering how long your fridge will stay cold or how you’ll charge your phone. That’s exactly why portable power stations have become essential backup gear for people who want peace of mind during emergencies, camping trips or off-grid adventures.</p>
<p>EcoFlow initially kicked off Prime Day with their Delta 2 priced at $449 for this 1800W portable power station, but then Jackery dropped their 1500W model to $349. EcoFlow responded by matching that price, even though their unit delivers more power. Right now, exclusively for Prime members during Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">you can grab this EcoFlow Delta 2 beast for $349, down from its original $699 price tag</a>. This<strong> marks an all-time low for an 1800W portable power station</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lightning-Charge That Outpaces Other Brands</h2>
<p>The <strong>1800W continuous output</strong> is where things get really practical: This power station is capable of powering your fridge, microwave, coffee maker, portable air conditioner, power tools and just about any household appliance you’d want to run during an outage. With <strong>15 varying outlets built across the unit</strong>, you don’t have to worry about running multiple devices simultaneously by playing musical chairs with your electronics. There are six AC outlets for standard plugs, two 100W USB-C for laptops and tablets to be quickly charged, several USB-A for phones and smaller devices and DC outlets for your 12V devices.</p>



<p>The <strong>capacity sits at 1024Wh thanks to a LiFePO4 battery</strong>&nbsp;which is chemistry shorthand for lithium iron phosphate. This battery type is tougher and safer than standard lithium-ion batteries you find in cheaper units. More importantly, it <strong>can handle over 3000 charge cycles</strong> before capacity starts dropping, which translates to roughly six times longer lifespan than older battery technology. You could charge and drain this thing once per week for over 50 years before hitting that 3000-cycle mark.</p>
<p>The game-changer here is the charging speed: The Delta 2 goes <strong>from</strong> <strong>completely dead to 80% charged in just 50 minutes</strong> using a standard wall outlet, and hits 100% in 80 minutes. That’s seven times faster than most portable power stations on the market. This rapid charging capability means you can quickly juice up before heading out on a weekend camping trip or get your backup power ready in a hurry when storm warnings hit your area.</p>



<p>What sweetens the pot even more is expandable capacity: The base unit offers 1kWh of storage, but additional battery packs can be added to triple it to 3kWh. The modular configuration means you start small but expand your system as needed, ideal for serious RV owners or individuals outfitting off-grid systems. The ability to charge by solar adds even more independence. The Delta 2 takes a whopping 500W of solar panel (sold separately) input so it stays topped off during longer camping forays or serve as a truly renewable backup at home.</p>
<p>For $349, you’re getting a high-end 1800W portable power unit for less money than many companies are asking for their mid-range 1000W models. Make sure you don’t miss that Prime Day deal.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-samsung-990-evo-plus-1tb-ssd-prime-day-deal-feels-practically-free-at-0-06-per-gb-2000631871</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you’re upgrading your storage, you also need to take care of speed and reliability. You don’t just want to add more space; you want something that doesn’t slow you down even when dealing with heavier files. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">The Samsung 990 Evo Pro SSD does a great job at that, and the 1TB model can be yours for less this Prime Day.</a></p>
<p>We’ve often seen it go for $70 – a $35 discount – but, right now, it’s dropped even further to just $60 on Amazon, marking a steep 43% off. This is one of the best prices we’ve ever seen on this drive, and it’s available for both Prime and non-Prime members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Capacity, Exceptional Speeds</h2>
<p>The 1TB capacity is more than enough to store all your essentials and then some. Think a ton of high-resolution photos, all your favorite videos, a bunch of movies, and even a few TV series to watch on the go when you don’t have a stable internet connection. There’s also a 2TB and 4TB version of this drive available, but we think the 1TB capacity should be enough for most work professionals and creatives out there.</p>
<p>Speed-wise, you’re looking at up to 7,250 MB/s read and 6,300 MB/s write speeds – ideal for large files and heavier apps. You can expect instant boot times and ultra-fast transfers that keep you productive without any slowdowns. Even the basic day-to-day tasks get a significant boost!</p>



<p>The SSD supports PCIe Gen 4×4, with forward compatibility for Gen 5×2, so it’s going to support all your future upgrades just as well. Magician Software keeps everything optimized and up-to-date, plus you will enjoy features like drive health monitoring and extra encryption in one place. And even with all this, you really don’t have to worry about overheating and battery life. There’s an efficiency-boosting nickel-coated controller that ensures it uses less power while still delivering excellent performance under pressure.</p>
<p>Installation is pretty straightforward. Just pop it into any compatible M.2 2280 slot, and you’re good to go. All in all, this is an efficient upgrade that gets you both solid storage and exceptional speeds.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/"> This Prime Day makes it possible to grab it for just $60, down from $105. For more capacity, you can consider getting the 2TB or the 4TB version.</a> Just note that the discount is only around for a short time, so it’s better to hurry.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock CurvX with 22,000 Pa Suction and AI Obstacle Recognition Is $600 Off, Amazon Is Clearing Out Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-curvx-with-22000-pa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-2000632479</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-curvx-with-22-000%E2%80%AFpa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock.1318438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums promise to handle your cleaning chores automatically but most fall short in frustrating ways. They get stuck on furniture, miss obvious dirt patches, tangle on cables or require constant babysitting that defeats their entire purpose. The <strong>Roborock Qrevo CurvX</strong> sits comfortably in our top three favorite robot vacuums because it actually delivers on the promise of true hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, the standard $1,499 price tag is steep but this is one of the rare models that really replaces you rather than just assisting. It cleans to perfection, navigates your home intelligently and handles the messiest scenarios without complaint or intervention. Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/">Prime members on Amazon can grab it for $899, down from that $1,499 list price</a>. This <strong>40 percent discount</strong> represents an all-time low and makes premium robotic cleaning accessible at a price point where the investment actually makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Qrevo CurvX Addresses Day-to-Day Cleaning Needs</h2>
<p>The <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction is among the strongest available in a robot vacuum</strong>, and it directly equates to cleaning performance you can see. Pet hair and debris trapped deep down in carpet fibers are cleaned thoroughly instead of being surface-swept. Areas of floor and grout lines where dirt tends to build up aren’t glossed over.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dual Anti-Tangle system</strong> of Roborock eliminates one of the leading failure modes of robot vacuums. Pet fur and human hair as long as 40 centimeters are dealt with by the system not wrapping around the brush roller and forming a knotted mess, which causes a halt to the vacuum mid-cycle. It is a huge issue if your family members are long-haired or if your pets shed, as other robot vacuums must be continually manually corrected by cutting hair off of the brush by hand.</p>



<p>Coming in at a mere 7.98 centimeters / 3.14 inches in height, <strong>the Qrevo CurvX is also the thinnest Roborock model yet</strong>. Its ultra-low profile gives it a way to slide under couches, beds, and cupboards where dust bunnies are a fact of life and regular vacuums are unable to reach.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift Chassis represents genuine innovation in robot vacuum design. Roborock pioneered this technology as the first manufacturer to mass-produce a robot vacuum with a liftable chassis system featuring three-wheel control, launching in Q3 2024. The<strong> chassis can lift up to 4 centimeters to clear high thresholds between rooms</strong> or it can adjust individual sections independently to navigate around furniture legs and uneven surfaces.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle detection employs structured light sensors and an RGB camera for <strong>detecting and evading 108 types of objects</strong>. It can work during bright sunlight and complete darkness, its sensors navigating it to safely navigate around objects such as shoes, cords, pet toys, etc., without your pre-cleaning your floors.</p>
<p>The <strong>mopping function uses 80°C warm water to clean its own mop pads</strong> and looses grease and embedded dirt deposited by cold water. It keeps your mop clean and actually cleans your floors rather than spreading dirty water. The Thermo+, <strong>Multifunction Dock 3.0 does it all for zero cost</strong>, automatically: cleaning your mop with warm water, drying off at 113°F to prevent mildew, emptying your dustbin, refilling your water tank, and even cleaning itself with warm water.</p>
<p>At $899 for Prime members, the Qrevo CurvX really provides professional-grade auto cleaning. It’s definitely one of our favorite ones.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-gopro-dji-osmo-action-4-camera-returns-to-its-lowest-price-in-months-for-prime-big-deal-days-2000632120</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here it is, folks. Prime Big Deals Day is upon us finally. October 7 and October 8, you can save big across almost every product category on Amazon. The giant online retailer has sales on PC gaming parts, Bluetooth speakers, and even cameras. The DJI Osmo Action 4 has three different bundles which are each seeing sales. Right now, you can save as much as 23%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Let’s break down each bundle. The essential combo is the most barebones of the three. It includes the Osmo action 4 camera alongside a horizontal-vertical protective frame, a locking screw, lens hood, battery, quick release adapter mount, anti-slip pad, and a USB-C cable for charging and data transfer. This essential combo is usually $289, but has come down to $219 for the sale.</p>

<p>Next we have the standard combo. This includes everything you get with the essential set plus an adhesive curved base mount to pair with the quick release adapter mount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">This set was $299, but has dropped to just $229.</a></p>
<p>Lastly, the adventure combo features all of that and you also get two more batteries so you always have a charged spare at the ready, a multi-functional battery case, a 1.5-meter extension rod or selfie stick as they are colloquially known, and a extra quick-release adapter mount except this one is mini. Normally priced at $399, the adventure combo is now down to just $327.</p>



<h2>Why DJI?</h2>
<p>GoPro is no longer the only name in the action camera business.&nbsp;The DJI Osmo Action 4 produces premium image quality with low-light clarity thanks to the 1/1.3-inch sensor. Capture every detail from dawn to dusk in stunning 4K resolution at 120 frames per second. The high framerate means you can render slow-motion shots without losing detail.</p>
<p>The ultrawide FOV keeps every bit of action in view whether you’re rushing down the side of a mountain on a snowboard or riding waved on water skis. The DJI Osmo Action 4 employs three different stabilization modes to ensure steady footage across rugged terrains of all kind. HorzionSteady is a DJI feature which keeps the horizon of your shots flat and level at all times.</p>
<p>The frame that comes with each of the bundles has a magnetic quick-release. The camera can be shot either in portrait or landscape so you can swap easily on the fly between the two while shooting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">If you’re looking for a big opportunity to save of some cool gadget to take on your next trip, consider saving yourself up to $72 on the DJI Osmo 4 action camera.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-is-quietly-offloading-its-mini-4k-drones-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-price-on-amazon-2000632469</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-is-quietly-offloading-its-mini-4k-drones-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-price-on-amazon.1318429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Getting into aerial photography used to mean dealing with FAA registration paperwork, fees and regulatory headaches. DJI changed that equation with the Mini series, and the Mini 4K sits right at 249 grams, j<strong>ust under the 250-gram threshold that triggers FAA registration requirements</strong> for recreational use in the United States. This weight advantage has made it one of DJI’s best-selling drones, and gives casual users the freedom to fly without bureaucratic barriers.</p>
<p>Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/">can snag this drone for an unprecedented $239, down from its usual $299 price</a>. This is<strong> an all-time low for a drone that shoots genuine 4K Ultra HD video</strong> with professional stabilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Results in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD camera captures video at 3840 x 2160 resolution</strong> which means you’re getting four times the detail of standard 1080p footage. This resolution matters when you want to crop or zoom into your footage during editing without losing quality, or when you’re capturing landscapes where fine details like distant mountains or intricate coastlines make the shot. The camera performs across different lighting conditions and handles everything from <strong>golden hour sunrises to moody sunset scenes</strong> and even challenging night environments.</p>
<p>What differentiates the Mini 4K from cheaper drones is its <strong>mechanical 3-axis gimbal stabilization</strong>. While electronic image stabilization on a lot of budget-priced drones crops into the scene and still shows jitter, a mechanical gimbal truly compensates for motion by physically balancing it on three axes: tilt, roll, and pan. That guarantees your video stays smooth even when your drone encounters a puff of wind or a sharp directional change.</p>



<p>Flight performance is formidable with<strong> Level 5 wind resistance, i.e., wind speeds of up to 38 kilometers per hour</strong> (around 24 miles per hour). Brushless motors provide the horsepower needed for stable flight at these speeds, and they are also more efficient and longer-lasting than the brushed motors found in toy-grade quadcopters. The same motors enable the Mini 4K to <strong>lift off at altitudes of up to 4,000 meters (around 13,100 feet)</strong> which opens mountain and high-altitude shooting potentia.</p>
<p><strong>10-kilometer video transmission distance</strong> gives you tremendous mobility to roam about and position shots. For all intents and purposes, you rarely take advantage of this limit due to line-of-sight limitations and battery life yet having that longer distance as a minimum guarantee ensures your operator gets a rock-solid connection with no dropouts or pixelation even if flying a few kilometers off.</p>



<p>Battery life provides <strong>31 minutes of best-in-class flight time</strong> per single supplied battery, although real-world flying with camera recording usually enabled normally produces about 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Safety features make Mini 4K accessible to total newcomers. <strong>GPS Return to Home returns the drone to its starting point if it runs low on battery</strong>, loses signal, or if you initiate a return yourself. One-tap takeoff/landing eliminates stress of manual throttle management during most critical flight stages.</p>
<p>Coming in at $239 for Prime members during Prime Day, the DJI Mini 4K offers true 4K quality, mechanical stabilization and intelligent modes at a price low enough to make aerial creativity accessible. It slashes its drone to an all-time-low during this Prime Big Deal Days sale, and it’s a great way to start your journey into aerial photography.</p>

              <p>This week is Prime Big Deals Day. Despite the name, it’s actually two days. On both October 7 and October 8, you can save huge swaths of cash on a bunch of cool tech or home goods, and that included PC gaming accessories. If you’ve been on the hunt for a new gaming monitor, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">now might be the time to pull the Hall Effect trigger you have mapped to “Add to Cart.” Samsung’s curved Odyssey G5 gaming monitor has dropped in price by $100.</a> The 27-inch model is down from $300 to $200, while the 32-inch has gone from $330 to $230.</p>

<h2>Why Go Curved?</h2>
<p>The way we perceive the world around us is not on a flat plain. Heck, we even describe it as the world around us, not in front of us. So when we simulate worlds through the games we play, why not aim for a more immersive experience? Monitors like this are awesome to play pretty much anything on but where they really shine is anything that’s first-person. When I initially got my curved monitor, first thing I played was the updated version of <em>Portal </em>with RTX and oh boy was that thing a beaut.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor comes in either a moderate 27-inch or large 32-inch screen, each with a curvature of 1000R to help fill your peripheral vision with the visuals from your game. Enjoy a better-than-HD resolution of 1440p which packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of 1080p HD displays. HDR10 allows for vibrant colors with deep blacks and luminous whites, portray a wide depth of color and brightness.</p>



<p>The screen has a refresh rate of 165Hz to help maintain smooth gameplay with fast frame rates and the 1ms response time will keep your character feeling snappy. Seriously. I’d been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> through Game Pass and my Xbox on a TV from 2017 then switched over recently to my PC and a similarly-specced monitor and wow what a difference. Input lag I had thought was just normally going completely away. I felt like I was cheating. It was just like that episode of <em>Samurai Jack</em> when Jack is training with the rocks strapped to his wrists and ankles. You know the one I’m talking about.</p>
