              <p><i>Escape from Tarkov</i>’s efforts to move on from its early access period and become a full release have not gone smoothly. Steam users lament a variety of concerns with the new 1.0 release, from gripes over the pricing of different versions to complaints that just launching the game is a laborious and frustrating process.</p> <p>On November 15, hardcore extraction shooter <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> saw two notable events occur. Firstly, it emerged from a beta status, which it was in for over eight years, into the full, official 1.0 release. And secondly, it arrived on Steam. Unfortunately, as the game’s director <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/steam-launch-user-reviews">Nikita Buyanov seems to have anticipated</a>, user reviews on the platform have met the game with scorn, dragging the overall rating into “Mixed” status for its English reviews.</p>

 <p>“[It’s] one of the most premium pieces of launcher software I have ever purchased,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198157204571/recommended/3932890/">reads one</a> of the top “Most Helpful” negative reviews on Steam. “Great hardcore experience, it already starts with trying to launch the game – 10/10” reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035754009/recommended/3932890/">a cleverly disguised “positive” review</a> in the same category. That critique doesn’t seem to be an overreaction either, as several other reviews cite an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/snoygg/recommended/3932890/">hours-long struggle</a> just to get into the game.</p>

 <p>These launch issues follow recent turmoil within the game’s community over the fact that the Steam version would <a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-arena-steam-epic-unheard-edition-2000626063">require a separate purchase</a> for those who already owned the game. And <i>that </i>controversy came fresh after developer Battlestate Games faced tough criticism over <a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-refund-voucher-1851490315">a controversial $250 version of the game</a>. Like your average game of <i>EFT</i>, it’s messy.</p> <p><i>Tarkov</i>’s tough-as-nails gameplay will probably always appeal to a select and discriminating group of shooter aficionados. Still, this poor reception arrives with some unfortunate timing as the extraction shooter genre has seemingly never been more popular; <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ persistent status in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">top three most-played games</a> on Steam and the wide appeal of <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588"><i>Escape from Duckov</i></a> speak to a rise in popularity, one in which genre pioneer <i>EFT</i> feels notably left out of the conversation.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-survey-most-players-around-world-prefer-singleplayer-games-solo-2000644895</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-survey-says-most-players-around-the-world-prefer-single-player-games.1356211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Data from a new global survey involving over 30,000 gamers spread across 20+ markets shows that, overall, people who play games prefer single-player over multiplayer. However, digging into the data reveals some interesting differences between countries like Germany and China, as well as how age plays a factor.</p> <p>On November 17, Ampere Analysis published the results of a large-scale video game survey focusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/look-single-player-people-are-just-better-5826946">single-player vs. multiplayer games</a>. The research and marketing firm asked 34,428 people who have played a video game in the last year if they agreed with this statement: “I prefer single-player games over multiplayer games.” And the newly released data shows that gamers in most countries do.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644930"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644930">©Ampere Analysis</figcaption></figure> <p>In the United States, Ampere’s data revealed that 65 percent of gamers prefer single-player, making it the country with the highest number of solo-leaning players. Right behind the United States is Japan at 63 percent, Thailand at 62 percent, and Germany at 60 percent. Meanwhile, a slightly lower number of United Kingdom gamers, 58 percent, prefer single-player over online gaming.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, China and Sweden are the two countries that don’t prefer single-player, according to this survey. 47 percent of players in China and 49 percent in Sweden prefer single-player, meaning more than half would rather log on and play with friends or randos.</p>

 <h2>Multiplayer is more popular with younger gamers</h2> <p>Digging into the data more, Ampere says that gender didn’t play much of a factor, with 55 percent of men and women preferring single-player over multiplayer. On the other hand, age did play a major factor in the survey.</p> <p>According to the firm’s data, only 49 percent of 16-to 24-year-olds prefer playing by themselves. Preference for single-player adventures jumps up to 56 percent when you reach the 25-to-34-year-old range. Meanwhile, 64 percent of gamers aged 55 or older prefer single-player titles.</p>

 <p>This isn’t very shocking to hear, as free games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474"><em>Roblox </em>and <em>Fortnite</em> have become extremely popular</a> with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352">kids and teens who might not be able to afford playing $70+ single-player games</a>. They also likely have more free time to coordinate online sessions with pals, whereas anyone over the age of 30 will be able to share stories of how damn hard it is to get a few friends online to play anything.</p> <p>One thing to keep in mind: Just because this survey and <a href="https://kotaku.com/survey-data-study-53-percent-gamers-singleplayer-pvp-1851665722">others show that a lot of gamers want single-player games</a>, that doesn’t mean publishers are going to stop making live-service titles. The reality is that publishers want to nickel and dime people with one game rather than make a few very expensive single-player adventures that could flop and can’t support years of seasonal updates and battle passes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s story missions <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">never arrived</a>, but the original had a few <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177">cooperative missions</a> that further explored the hero shooter’s world and heroes. One of these was called </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-pve-event-is-its-best-yet-1825183663">Retribution</a>,</span></i><span> and it starred Reaper, Cassidy, Genji, and Moira as members of Blackwatch, Overwatch’s covert operatives arm. At the beginning of the mission, Reaper kills a man named Antonio Bartalotti, a criminal and member of the chaos-seeding Talon organization. This assassination sets up the mission players fight through, as well as the eventual downfall of the Overwatch organization, but as we learned today, over seven years later, it was also a canon event for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next hero, Vendetta.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard has released a new animated trailer titled La Lupa which shows Vendetta, a new, sword-wielding hero, fighting a massive Omnic in Colosseo to the tune of hundreds of less-than-adoring fans. In her voiceover, she’s talking to her Papa who taught her how to outsmart her opponents, whether that be in Chess or in a coliseum. Then the trailer reveals that her father was none other than Antonio. So now, after all those years, Vendetta has…a vendetta against the members of Blackwatch. That organization is defunct, though, so I guess she’s taking out all her frustrations on robots in the coliseum.</span></p> <p><span>We don’t see any gameplay of Vendetta in action, but she does seem to be one of the rare melee heroes in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s roster. She’s built like a tank, so she might fall into that role, but we’ll know for sure soon since Blizzard is holding a trial run for the character from November 6 to December 1. Vendetta will officially join the roster in Season 20 on December 9.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The CEO of the studio behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i></a><span>, the wildly successful third-person shooter that recently came to Xbox, weighed in on the video game industry’s increasing use of AI and how he believes it “actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <p><span>As reported by </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-boss-argues-arc-raiders-ai-use-actually-makes-gaming-better-and-that-people-jump-to-extreme-takes-about-the-tech-surely-theres-a-middle-ground-here/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani was on an episode of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AyVTlQR__ZU?si=JJHjmoQPGIj-Fb5v&amp;t=1561"><span>The Game Business Show</span></a><span> when the conversation shifted to the use of AI in game development. The host, Christopher Dring, brought up the “industry moment” around </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, the recently released extraction shooter that’s been a breakout hit for developer Embark Studios, and the center of a conversation around using AI in game development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For Jorjani, opinions on the controversial topic are too black and white. “Maybe, could it be, that reality is somewhere in the middle? Could it be?” he asked. He believes that, rather than developers using AI to “remove the stuff we don’t want to do,” people jump to “let’s never actually use AI, all AI is bad AI.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We don’t put any AI in the games,” Jorjani says. “But if it can allow me to do my receipts faster, that’s more </span><i><span>Helldivers</span></i><span> for everyone.”</span></p> <p><span>It was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436"><span>recently revealed that Embark hired voice actors for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, then used AI to flesh out in-game voice lines rather than having “someone come in every time we create a new line for the game,” according to an </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"><span>interview with </span><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>. This sparked a heated debate about the use of AI in game development and even negatively </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><span>affected </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>’s review of the game</span></a><span> (which awarded it two out of five stars).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“I find that people jump to extreme takes,” Jorjani says of the response to </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>’ AI use. “I think it’s a very interesting use case that actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <h2><b>The AI game development controversy continues</b></h2> <p><span>But as Dring brings up during the interview, Square Enix recently revealed it wants to eventually have 70 percent of its quality assurance work done by AI. QA work often serves as an entry-level role in game development, and this could be a huge hit to the industry’s workforce, which is one of the main points of contention people have with implementing AI.</span></p>

 <p><span>Junghun Lee, the CEO of Nexton Co. Ltd (which published </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>), said in a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/"><span>November 12 interview</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><span>Japanese gaming site </span><i><span>Gamespark</span></i></a> <span>that “</span><span>it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” But with the video game industry plagued with layoffs and studio closures, what does that mean for the future of its workforce?</span></p>

 <p><span>The ideological split is only widening. Brendan Green, the creator of the wildly successful battle royale </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span>, told </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span> he was “really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff.” </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span> is published by South Korean company Krafton, which </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation"><span>recently announced a massive “AI-first” mandate</span></a><span> for the entire company while also announcing the option for employees to voluntarily resign if they felt they were not in line with its “direction of change.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Elsewhere, </span><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>publisher Activision </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>recently came under fire for using AI-generated content</span></a><span> for some of its artwork. “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios,” Activision told</span><i><span> Kotaku</span></i><span> on November 14.</span></p> <p><span>AI in game development seems to be here to stay, but just how it will be utilized going forward, and how developers, voice actors, and players will feel about it, remains to be seen.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Less than a decade after the original animated <em>Moana</em> hit theaters, Disney has released the first real trailer for its upcoming live-action remake, and folks, it doesn’t look great.</p> <p>On November 17, Disney released the first official teaser trailer for its live-action remake of <em>Moana</em>. Starring Catherine Lagaʻaia as the titular Moana and Dwayne Johnson reprising his role as demigod Maui, the remake appears to be a nearly shot-for-shot recreation of the original 2016 animated movie. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>I know this isn’t an original complaint, but it continues to be wild how many of <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-lion-king-the-little-mermaid-cinderella-1851767126">these live-action Disney remakes</a> barely look like live-action films at all. <em>Moana</em> might not be completely CG like the “live-action” <em>Lion King</em> remake, but boy howdy does a lot of this movie look like an Unreal Engine fan-game based on the original movie and not a film starring real people in real places. And when we do see real people, they almost look out of place.</p>

 <p>One scene in particular, involving Maui jumping off a cliff, looks so artificial and crappy that if you showed that to me without any context and said it was created by some AI tool, I’d probably believe you. And while some shots, like the one involving a whale and some boats, look better, I’m still not convinced this won’t be a mess. And making the chicken fully CG is boring and strange. Give me a real chicken, damn it!</p> <p>It was around this time last year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney fully revealed the <em>Snow White</em> remake and its horrific-looking dwarves.</a> That movie ended up being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films#:~:text=nb%201%5D-,22,%5B22%5D,-23">a very expensive flop</a> for the Mickey Mouse company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tangled-remake-canceled-paused-snow-white-disney-flop-1851774677">reportedly leading to at least one live-action film being shelved</a>. However, this year’s <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> remake was <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">a massive hit</a> for Disney, so I don’t expect the company to stop plundering its treasure trove of famous animated movies and <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-and-stitch-2-sequel-announced-teaser-disney-626-1851785144">turning them into live-action slop anytime soon</a>.&nbsp;We’ll see how well this new version of <em>Moana</em> does at the box office when it arrives in theaters on July 10, 2026.</p>

              <p><em>Call of Duty</em> players are seeing SBMM ghosts in<em> Black Ops 7</em>. Capcom reassures investors about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s day-one performance on PC. And Stalker 2 is getting a big upgrades on the eve of its one-year anniversary and arrival on PlayStation 5. Welcome to the latest edition of <del>Morning</del> Afternoon Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Game Awards 2025 nominees <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">have dropped</a> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is leading the way, including in the Best Indie Game category. It deserves a ton of accolades but <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">probably not that one</a>.</p> <h2>The next Xbox will take players’ game libraries beyond the console</h2> <p>That’s what Xbox president Sarah Bond indicated in a new interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4">with <em>Fortune</em></a>. Here’s what she said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>We are working on our next-generation hardware. It’s going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that’s what’s really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud.</span> <span>And so the Xbox experience starts with the console but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</span></p></blockquote> <p>Does that mean the next Xbox will be a handheld? Will this portability come from a unified account across console and PC? Or is Microsoft relying on cloud computing and AI to make this all into a seamless experience? Whatever the solution, it will need to bring generations of backwards-compatible Xbox games along with it. Is this a big bet on Microsoft’s gaming future, or the last gasp as it pivots away from consumer tech more broadly?</p>

 <p>Bond <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822">previously promised</a> the next-gen Xbox would be the biggest technological leap for its consoles yet.</p>  <h2>Capcom promises <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> won’t be as busted as <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on PC</h2> <p>The question came up during the company’s <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1990370536753447333">latest investor briefing</a>, and the company&nbsp;explained why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ ongoing PC troubles shouldn’t be a problem for its next big blockbuster. “<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> differs from <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features,” the company <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">said</a>. “At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications.”</p>

 <h2>It took zero days for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> players to start complaining about SBMM again</h2> <p>Treyarch has tried to confirm, for what feels <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-blops-7-sbmm-muiltiplayer-matchmaking-2000633695">like the dozenth time</a>, how matchmaking works in the latest entry. “Quick Play uses the same Open Matchmaking, where skill is minimally considered,” the studio announced over the weekend. That’s led fans to focus on what exactly “minimally considered” means. Some feel the matchmaking isn’t as “open” as it felt during the beta. Others argue that’s because the beta was free and now the skill floor for launch, where people actually paid for the game, is higher. SBMM trutherism lives on.</p>

 <h2><em>City: Skylines 2</em> gets new developer with console port still MIA</h2> <p>“After more than a decade of successful collaboration across numerous titles that we’re both immensely proud of, Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order have mutually decided to pursue independent paths,” the publisher <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">announced</a> on Monday. “The decision was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams – ensuring the strongest possible future for the <em>Cities: Skylines</em> franchise.”</p>

 <p>Colossal Order will handle a few more updates before the franchise is fully moved over to internal Paradox team Iceflake Studios. The shift comes after a terrible launch period for the sequel and has left fans wondering what the city builder’s future will be, from new expansions to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/cities-skylines-2-bloodlines-2-prison-architect-2-delay-1851668058">long-delayed arrival</a> of the console port. The game still sits at a rating of mixed on Steam.</p>

The result should be fewer dumb moments and more clever, emergent storytelling. Factions should also feel more lifelike.

              <p>If you’re planning to start a podcast, improve your livestreams, or just want to sound decent on Zoom calls, you need a high-quality microphone in your setup. Most high-end options on the market often sit above $100, but thanks to early Black Friday deals, that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">You can currently grab the Logitech for Creators Blue Yeti USB microphone for just $85 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice $55 discount on its retail price of $140. This offer applies to the silver model, but the pink and blue versions are also discounted, going for $100 and $105, respectively.</p>

<h2>Custom Patterns for Different Recording Needs</h2>
<p>This mic delivers Blue’s signature broadcast-quality sound with a custom three-capsule array. It delivers clear, powerful, yet balanced sound for gaming, streaming podcasts, and even your calls. You can choose between four preset patterns (cardioid, omni, bidirectional, and stereo) to record exactly the way you need for any setup. Filming a heart-to-heart for your YouTube family? Go with cardioid for focused audio. Hosting an interview? The bidirectional pattern should do the job well!</p>
<p>The mic also comes with onboard controls that let you quickly adjust the volume, pick a pattern, mute, and more right there from the microphone itself. This is especially great for when you need to take a quick break between recordings and don’t want to bother with complicated software settings. Just hit a button and you’re all set. To further fine-tune your recordings, you can use the Blue VO!CE program for editing them. This platform lets you add vocal effects, modulation, and sound samples, but you will need to install the Logitech G Hub to access it.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started is simple. The plug-and-play setup means you can just hook it up to your PC or laptop via USB and start recording right away. Best of all, the desktop stand itself is adjustable, so you can always find the right angle to record without needing any extra accessories.</p>
<p>All-in-all, if you’ve been looking for a way to improve the sound quality of your recordings, this microphone can be a great addition to your setup. It’s not just easy to use, but also offers impressive sound and plenty of customization options without making things unnecessarily complicated. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">Thanks to early Black Friday deals, you can grab it without paying the full $140 price.</a></p>
