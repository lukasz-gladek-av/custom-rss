If that sounds up your alley, here’s what you can expect from this newly released slice of gameplay.</p><h2 id="h116155"><a id="length"></a>How Long Is The Dynasty Warriors Origins Demo?</h2><figure id="" data-id="b73adb4a51bd582be0e7d8925c96eaa7" data-recommend-id="image://b73adb4a51bd582be0e7d8925c96eaa7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist uses a wind-based special move against an overwhelming onslaught of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist uses a wind-based special move against an overwhelming onslaught of enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b73adb4a51bd582be0e7d8925c96eaa7" data-recommend-id="image://b73adb4a51bd582be0e7d8925c96eaa7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist uses a wind-based special move against an overwhelming onslaught of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>About an hour.</p><p>The demo is relatively short, all told. After a few short cutscenes and some battle preparation, the demo will take place entirely in the “Battle of Sishui Gate” mission. <strong>A single run through all the demo content shouldn’t take longer than an hour</strong>, but this may extend longer for reasons we’ll get to later.</p><p>That said, <strong>the demo does have some replay value</strong>. You can equip your protagonist with different weapons and special moves before going into battle, so hardcore fans may get some mileage out of trying different playstyles ahead of the game’s launch.</p><h2 id="h116156"><a id="progress"></a>Does The Demo Carry Over To The Full Game?</h2><p>No. </p><p>The demo is its own standalone experience, and there’s no prompt to save since it consists of a single mission. The demo also contains a disclaimer that “some scenes and elements may differ from the final game.” In other words, the way events unfold in the demo may not actually reflect the full game.</p><h2 id="h116157"><a id="playedbefore"></a>Can You Enjoy The Dynasty Warriors Origins Demo If You’ve Never Played Dynasty Warriors Before?</h2><figure id="" data-id="de5ccc1bcf4e985ec28da746f2b72da0" data-recommend-id="image://de5ccc1bcf4e985ec28da746f2b72da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist is in a duel with Hua Xiong, his sword is approaching the enemy’s legs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist is in a duel with Hua Xiong, his sword is approaching the enemy’s legs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de5ccc1bcf4e985ec28da746f2b72da0" data-recommend-id="image://de5ccc1bcf4e985ec28da746f2b72da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist is in a duel with Hua Xiong, his sword is approaching the enemy’s legs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kind of. </p><p>For someone who has <em>never</em> played a Musou before, you may feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information this demo throws at you. But the game isn’t impossible to understand, especially if you stick with your default setup and follow the onscreen warnings and tutorials as you play. But if you’ve never played a <em>Warriors</em> game before, you might find the <em>Zelda</em> spinoff <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> to be a better introduction to the series.</p><p>If this <em>is</em> your first <em>Warriors</em> experience, I’d recommend starting on the easier “Historian” difficulty and trying the demo again on a higher difficulty once you’ve got a handle on the core game mechanics.</p><p>While the demo will run you through all the mechanics and systems you need to know, there is one moment at the end of the demo that we do need to talk about. While it’s not a huge plot twist or anything, consider this a spoiler warning if you’d prefer to experience this moment firsthand yourself.</p><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h116158"><a id="lubu"></a>Okay, Is that Lu Bu Fight For Real?</h2><figure id="" data-id="8062b899a6194e895edda8648552ff5b" data-recommend-id="image://8062b899a6194e895edda8648552ff5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The infamous Lu Bu is seen riding a horse while wearing heavy armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The infamous Lu Bu is seen riding a horse while wearing heavy armor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8062b899a6194e895edda8648552ff5b" data-recommend-id="image://8062b899a6194e895edda8648552ff5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The infamous Lu Bu is seen riding a horse while wearing heavy armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It sure is.</p><p>Lu Bu is the final boss of the demo, and you need to approach him like he’s a boss in a soulslike. He can easily drain your health from full in two hits, and what remains of your army will be ground to dust if Lu Bu so much as brushes their shoulders. He’s quite hard.</p><p>That said, there’s no secret reward or hidden cutscene for defeating Lu Bu. You get to see your fight time against him on the results screen, but that’s about it. So <strong>if you get to this point of the demo and decide you don’t want to deal with him, you aren’t missing anything</strong>. The only reason to defeat Lu Bu is your own satisfaction.</p><h3 id="h116159"><a id=""></a>How To Defeat Lu Bu</h3><p>Given this is <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>, there may be some strategies to cheese Lu Bu fans will undoubtedly unearth in due time. That aside, your only real recourse is to learn Lu Bu’s attack patterns and time your dodges just right so you can pull off perfect evades. By default, your protagonist will use a sword that makes perfect evades easier to pull off, which should help you learn Lu Bu’s attacks. Otherwise, my advice for you would be as follows.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The boss fight begins right after you clear the large force on the northwest side of the map. The better condition you’re in before this encounter, the better off you’ll be against Lu Bu. Before you challenge that aforementioned large force, <strong>take some time to clear out the enemy bases around the map so you can break pots and replenish your stock of Meat Buns</strong>. Ideally, save the pots inside the two bases closest to the northwest side of the map.</li><li>Try to put up as strong of a fight as you can to Lu Bu right out the gate. Your allies will probably get wiped out in a single hit, but they can at least serve as distractions while you score some hits. If you immediately retreat, your allies will probably bite the dust before they can offer you any benefit.</li><li>When (or, optimistically, <em>if</em>) your nearby allies get wiped out and you find yourself low on health, retreat to one of the nearby bases. You can get some emergency healing under your belt, and if you have command over the bases, you’ll gain some new troops to help you out as well.</li><li>Have patience! <strong>You probably won’t clear this fight on your first or second try</strong>, but as long as you prioritize evasion and score hits when you have clean openings, you can whittle Lu Bu’s health down. It’s a tough fight, but the glory of victory is worth the struggle.</li></ul><hr><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> releases on January 17, 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Why such a big deal? Because not only will this be the very first time the game has been made available on <em>any</em> platform since its original release, but it’s <em>the </em>version of <em>Tetris</em> when it comes to the thriving eSports scene.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,194328,196626" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The history of <em>Tetris</em> is such an extraordinary tale, so much so that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 saw the release of a hit movie based on the events</a></span>. Its earliest years are a tangled confusion of rights and ownership disputes, culminating in its breakthrough Nintendo versions released for the NES and Game Boy in 1989. (The NES release itself is an astonishing tale, with Atari and Nintendo making rival versions, that somehow saw the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://moneyweek.com/505757/great-frauds-in-history-robert-maxwell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://moneyweek.com/505757/great-frauds-in-history-robert-maxwell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vile, pension-stealing human stain, Robert Maxwell</a></span>, trying to convince Mikhail Gorbachev to cancel Nintendo’s contract!)</p><p>Anyhow, that NES version has since never been re-released or made available on any of Nintendo’s subsequent e-stores. Come December 12, that’s going to change, as the game is added to the teetering pile of emulated classics in the Switch Online subscription service.</p><p>The NES version has become enormously popular thanks to its recent prominence in eSports, especially following 2023's extraordinary series of broken world records, as players saw scores previously thought impossible, and the game’s killscreen was reached for the very first time. All of this is exquisitely documented in a YouTube documentary by Summoning Salt, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-wild-story-of-tetris-world-records-has-to-be-seen-t-1851484690?_gl=1*8zaqwt*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzI0MDM4MS40MDkuMS4xNzMzMjQwMzk1LjQ2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-wild-story-of-tetris-world-records-has-to-be-seen-t-1851484690?_gl=1*8zaqwt*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzI0MDM4MS40MDkuMS4xNzMzMjQwMzk1LjQ2LjAuMA..">Carolyn Petit wrote about last year</a></span>.</p><p>I swear, I’ve only ever been the most casual <em>Tetris</em> player (although, weirdly, I did once get to have a coffee with Alexey Pajitnov and Henk Rogers), and I found this two-hour doc utterly compelling from start to finish. There are <em>so </em>many twists and turns.</p><p>It’ll be fascinating to see how the Switch Online version fares. Presumably, the scene will judge it very closely, given how competitive players have more recently insisted on playing on an original NES cart for the best results. Or they’ll ignore it entirely because everything they’ve built is based on playing with the original NES controller and the nuances of drumming on its rear. Or, you know, regular people might just enjoy a nice game of one of the best versions of <em>Tetris</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
