You can grab one for yourself right now without having to spend a ridiculous amount of money,</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/">Amazon is currently offering the Anker 737 Power Bank for $90, which is a $20 reduction from the regular price of $110</a>. That’s also a savings of 18%.

<h2>A portable power bank that’s perfect for all charging situations</h2>
<p>This type of power bank isn’t just a small emergency top-up for your phone. It’s a large-capacity battery that can charge multiple devices and even have some energy remaining after doing so.</p>

Therefore, this product provides a great shared power source for families, couples, or friends traveling together. Since no one needs to fight over who gets to use the charger first, it should give you a much smoother experience.</p>



<p>Even though this power bank has a lot of power (as it should, it’s in the name), it’s small compact enough to be carried on a daily basis without taking up too much space in your bag, luggage, or whatever you carry with you. Additionally, the design is clean and simple. The simple indicator lights on the power bank will show you how much charge remains, so you’ll never have to guess if there is enough power to last you until you arrive at your destination.</p>
<p>If you’ve had to search for available outlets, constantly check your battery level, or share a single wall charger with each of your various devices, then this is a convenient upgrade. You can just plug in everything and go without having to wonder how you’re going to find an outlet or function without extra battery.</p>
<p>With an abundance of power, multiple ports, and fast charging capabilities, the Anker 737 Power Bank integrates seamlessly into your travels, commutes and daily routine. You’ll be glad that you went ahead and scooped one up since it’s finally available at its lowest price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Computer components are getting pretty pricey. So if you’re looking to buy any or a whole computer, you’re going to have to be pretty selective. And when you spot a deal, it’s a good idea to grab it while you can. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor was designed specifically for people who want a fast and responsive computer. If that’s you, you can snag a serious deal on it right now, because we’ve found one you won’t want to miss out on.</p>
<p>You can currently purchase the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/">AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor on Amazon.com for $252 (down from $399) which represents a savings of $147 and 37% off of the original retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful processor with a significant discount</h2>
<p>The processor features eight performance cores and sixteen threads so that it can process high refresh rate gaming, streaming, and content creation without your entire computer slowing down. If you’re building a new PC or updating your existing computer with a new processor, then the Ryzen 7 7700X would be a solid option to ensure that your computer stays as fast as possible as it can while components continue to evolve and improve over the years.</p>
<p>You can enter high-end games, have voice chat and/or a browser active, and even begin recording/streaming your gameplay without losing FPS. These additional threads prove to be valuable when your system is operating the logic of a game, as well as background applications and capture software all at one time. This processor provides you with the room needed to perform these tasks without constantly adjusting settings.</p>



<p>In addition to gaming, if you use various creative applications, then the number of cores and speeds found within the Ryzen 7 7700X will greatly benefit those applications. For example, tasks such as video editing, converting video files, batch photo processing, and working in 3D applications, all function much quicker than processors with fewer cores. Your exports will complete faster, your timeline will scrub faster, and you will not be forced to stare at the “progress bar” when you would rather be creating your next project. This type of upgrade will pay for itself daily if you spend time in creative applications.</p>
<p>You can couple this processor with current graphics cards, high-speed storage, and multiple monitors without your CPU becoming the bottleneck before you know it. This processor is an excellent option for a system that you intend to keep and possibly expand upon over the course of several years.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/">Overall, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor is an easy recommendation if you want a fast, versatile PC</a>. At this lowest price, you really can’t go wrong with grabbing this deal while it’s still available. Be sure you don’t miss it, and get ready for enjoying all your favorite games as the year kicks off.</p>

              <p>A monitor can make or break your gaming experience. It’s where your favorite characters come to life, and if your screen is lagging or just failing to deliver the visuals your games deserve, it’s time to look for a better option.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this upgrade doesn’t have to blow your budget today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/">You can currently grab the 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G50D gaming monitor for $250 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 42% off its usual (and not-so-friendly) $430 price.</a> This is the lowest we have seen this display drop to, ever. Just note that offers this good tend to wrap up fast. It’s best to place your orders before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smooth Gameplay</h2>
<p>The screen features QHD resolution that packs in roughly 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for an exceptional picture quality. The IPS panel keeps the visuals bright and vibrant, while the wide 178-degree viewing angle ensures clarity from any viewpoint. It’s especially helpful when you’re playing with friends, since not everyone needs to sit directly in front of the screen to see what’s happening. Additionally, VESA DisplayHDR 400 focuses on delivering better contrast with deeper blacks and prominent whites. You will be able to spot bad guys hiding in the shadows, plus explore cool in-game environments more clearly in daylight scenes. This level of depth also helps titles feel closer to reality for an immersive experience that makes you feel a part of the game.</p>
<p>The visuals are nicely paired with an impressive 180Hz refresh rate that eliminates lag for smoother action. A 1ms response time also reduces motion blur, helping you jump into action without waiting.</p>



<p>The gaming monitor is G-Sync compatible, which means it is designed to work well with NVIDIA GPUs by matching its refresh rate to the frame output of the GPU. Even better, it supports AMD FreeSync to keep complex scenes stable. What does this mean for you? Low input lag and smoother gameplay that gives you a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Those planning to game for long hours will appreciate the Eye Saver Mode, which minimizes blue light to keep your eyes comfortable throughout your sessions. As for the build, the monitor flaunts an ergonomic stand that comfortably swivels, tilts, and adjusts to help you find the right viewing position. You can even rotate it vertically when you need to read or take quick video calls!</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your current monitor to enjoy better visuals and smoother gameplay, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/">This 32-inch Samsung gaming monitor offers all that and more, and the current 42% discount makes the display far more affordable.</a> If the 32-inch size feels like too much, there’s a 27-inch version of the same model available for $230, down from $350.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nintendo, a company that </span><a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/70994/nintendo-releases-2024-25-fiscal-earnings-and-projections-for-first-year-of-switch-2"><span>regularly brings in billions of dollars each year</span></a><span>, could have easily afforded to set up a real photoshoot to promote its upcoming line of </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/"><span>My Mario</span> <span>toys</span></a><span> coming to its New York City and San Francisco stores in February, but it looks like it might have used genAI instead. At least, that’s what people think after looking at the photos of parents playing with their kids and the </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>toys.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I admit, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-season-7-gen-ai-tim-sweeney-latata-2000649103"><span>AI witch hunt</span></a><span> has gotten out of hand, so when I looked at the supposed AI images, I had several moments of doubt. Maybe some people’s hands and fingers just look like that, and the growing fear that AI art is infecting everything around me has completely distorted my idea of what hands look like? Maybe it’s possible for a thumb to twist like that, or for a child’s hand to squish into their mother’s like we see here.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658445">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I caught myself looking at my own hands multiple times while writing this just to make sure I know what hands actually look like, just to test the limits of my mind as I wondered if an image of a woman’s fingers looking almost twice as long as her palms to hold a tablet was out of the realm of reality. I’ve got tiny hands, so maybe I’m not the best judge.</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case, fans have already run with the assumption that these images are AI-generated in the replies to Nintendo’s social media posts on </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NintendoAmerica/posts/pfbid02fPQ2Jr4GHpvW19uvHJgrWejxt3XMRWWF3yAjMtvi18VQsL8HjMiCgiTtp3rfQpVJl"><span>Facebook</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/NintendoStoreUS/status/2009280600608268620"><span>X</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing My Mario, a collection of products, games, and experiences inspired by Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom friends, designed for young children and their parents.
