              <p>Smart lighting transforms bland rooms into dynamic spaces that adapt to mood and activity. <em>Govee</em> just dropped an <strong>exclusive Prime member deal</strong> on its RGBIC Floor Lamp, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">slashing the price down to $64 from its usual $99.</a> This Black Friday discount is a record low that no one other than a Prime member gets, and if you subscribe, now’s the perfect time to upgrade your lighting game. With <strong>16 million color options and music sync capabilities</strong>, the lamp does away with dead corners and bland ambient lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The RGBIC designation means<strong> this lamp displays multiple colors simultaneously across different segments</strong>. Traditional RGB lamps can only show one color at a time across the entire fixture, limiting your creative options. The Govee lamp divides the light strip into independent zones that each display different colors, creating flowing gradients and multi-color effects. You can set the bottom to glow blue while the top fades into purple or create rainbow effects that flow up and down the lamp.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1000 lumen output provides serious brightness</strong> that actually works as primary lighting, not accent mood lighting. You can light up an entire corner of a room or use it as your main light source when you want softer, interesting lighting than overhead fixtures provide. The brightness smoothly adjusts from dim ambient glow to full brightness, allowing for granular control over the light intensity.</p>



<h2>Syncs With Music</h2>
<p><strong>Music sync capability</strong> turns the lamp into a reactive light show, pulsing and changing with whatever you’re playing. Equipped with a built-in microphone, the lamp picks up the audio from your room and analyzes the beat, tempo, and intensity. Colors shift and pulse in rhythm to your music, creating an immersive experience that beats static lighting. Sensitivity can be changed depending on volumes of playing music, so it will be as relevant for background jazz as for electronic dance music played at full volume. The <strong>sync works with any audio source in the room</strong>, from TV shows to Spotify to live instruments.</p>
<p>Alexa integration means that when it’s all connected to your Amazon Echo devices, the lamp is completely voice-controllable. Without needing to open the app or touch physical controls, saying, “Alexa, turn on the floor lamp” powers it up. You can change colors with your voice, adjust brightness, turn the lamp on or off, and trigger preset scenes. This voice control becomes key when you are caught up on the couch and do not want to reach for your phone.</p>



<p>The <strong>Govee app unlocks the full potential of the lamp’s 16 million color options</strong>. You can save custom color combinations as presets, browse community-created scenes, and fine-tune every aspect of the lighting. The app <strong>includes dozens of pre-programmed scenes</strong> like “Sunset,” “Ocean,” “Forest,” and “Party” that change the lamp’s appearance with one tap. DIY mode lets you pick specific colors for each segment of the lamp, creating personalized combinations that match your room’s color scheme.</p>
<p>From unboxing to first use, the lamp takes about five minutes to set up. Plug in the lamp, download the Govee app, connect it to your WiFi network, and go. The WiFi connection is a standard 2.4GHz network which most homes are already set up with-no special router configurations are required. The lamp remembers your last settings even in the event of power outages, so it will immediately go back to those settings upon being turned back on. Energy consumption stays very low despite the brightness of the output; it <strong>uses about as much electricity as a regular LED bulb</strong> while offering much more functionality.</p>
<p>This Govee RGBIC Floor Lamp provides smart lighting features that other brands sell at double the price, down to $64 from its usual $99, for Prime members only.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lgs-ultrafine-27-inch-4k-monitor-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-dumps-stock-with-zero-margin-2000645574</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-ultrafine-27-inch-4k-monitor-sells-for-peanuts-amazon-dumps-stock-with-zero-margin.1358698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Professional monitors make everything look better but the price tags usually sting. Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5718/">torched its profit margins on the LG <em>Ultrafine</em> 27-inch 4K monitor, dropping it to $177 from the usual $249 price</a>. This move screams inventory clearance which means you’re getting a <strong>legitimate 4K display for less than many 1080p monitors cost</strong>. The LG <em>Ultrafine</em> monitor delivers true<strong> 4K resolution with HDR10 support and 90% DCI-P3 color coverage</strong> that creative pros actually need. This record-low Black Friday price makes upgrading from your aging 1080p screen a no-brainer decision.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True 4K Resolution Changes How You Work</h2>
<p>With a <strong>native resolution of 3840×2160</strong>, it packs four times the pixels of standard 1080p into the same-sized 27-inch display. You can easily set multiple windows side by side without straining to read tiny text or giving up readability. Spreadsheets show more rows and columns at once, code editors display more lines simultaneously, and photo editing reveals details that 1080p screens completely miss.</p>
<p>IPS panel technology offers accurate colors and wide viewing angles that TN panels simply can’t touch. Colors remain consistent even when you’re viewing the screen from extreme angles, which matters a great deal when you work with clients or show content to others. The 1000:1 contrast ratio creates deeper blacks than typical budget monitors, which makes dark movie and game scenes richer. IPS response times have dramatically improved over the last few years, so you won’t see ghosting or motion blur from this display like you did on older IPS displays</p>



<p><strong>HDR10 support</strong> brings compatible content to life with enhanced brightness and contrast. The likes of Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video stream HDR content that looks significantly better on this monitor compared to standard dynamic range displays. This monitor automatically jumps into HDR mode when it detects compatible content, then seamlessly flips back to SDR at all other times. Peak brightness reaches levels that will make the highlights pop without washing out the rest of the image.</p>



<p>Minimized bezels around display edges means maximum utilization of screen real estate. Thin bezels create a cleaner aesthetic, adding to the modern, professional look of any desk. Borderless designs are great for multi-monitor setups since the gap between screens will be almost invisible. The white finish will match perfectly with Apple aesthetics if you’re building a cohesive workspace; it works well with any setup, though. The matte screen coating helps reduce screen glare from windows and overhead lights, maintaining clarity of image in bright rooms.</p>
<p>Reader Mode reduces blue light emission for extended reading sessions that don’t strain your eyes. The mode shifts colors toward warmer tones that feel easier on your eyes during long workdays or late-night work sessions. Flicker Safe technology eliminates the invisible screen flickering that causes eye fatigue and headaches after hours of use. Put together, these create a display you can stare at for eight-plus hours without the burning, tired eyes that cheap monitors cause. Within the first week of using it,<strong> the reduction in eye strain is indeed noticeable</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs</strong> are available for maximum compatibility. Modern laptops, gaming consoles, desktop computers, and media devices can be connected directly with no need for an adapter. DisplayPort is capable of higher refresh rates and bandwidth than HDMI, though both inputs provide full 4K resolution at 60Hz. A pair of inputs allows the connection of two devices at once and switching with the onscreen menu. USB-C displays are significantly more expensive, so the use of traditional connectivity here keeps the price accessible while still providing full functionality.</p>
<p>At $177 down from $249, this LG Ultrafine 27″ 4K monitor delivers professional specs at a price that undercuts basic 1080p displays. You’re getting true 4K resolution, HDR10 support, 90% DCI-P3 color coverage, and IPS panel quality for 29% off the regular price.</p>

              <p>LEGO display sets represent a creative outlet for adults that melds nostalgia with serious building satisfaction. Amazon is flooded with LEGO deals this Black Friday, but the <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> set stands well above the crowd as the most iconic Harry Potter build on offer. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">2,660-piece masterpiece drops to $140 from its usual $169 price, making it the perfect time to grab</a> what many collectors consider the <strong>definitive Hogwarts model in existence</strong>. Due to its massive scale and incredible detail, this set costs well more than average LEGO builds even at full price, but this discount makes it more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Most Intricate Hogwarts Creation LEGO has Ever Built</h2>
<p>Detail is captured with this scale model of Hogwarts Castle in ways that no LEGO attempts have ever quite achieved: the build of the Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards and connecting bridges, functional greenhouses, Boathouse, and even the surrounding Black Lake at the castle grounds. Architecture faithfully adheres to the movie depictions, giving you a displayable replica any Harry Potter fan can easily recognize. The<strong> baseplate is 13.5 inches wide and 10 inches deep</strong>, and creates a large footprint that commands attention on any shelf or desk. The <strong>castle itself rises over 8.5 inches high</strong>&nbsp;which makes it a fantastic centerpiece that won’t require a microscope to appreciate.</p>
<p>The interior details reveal the hidden rooms and iconic locations that defined the Harry Potter series. You can build the Chamber of Secrets complete with the basilisk’s lair, the Winged Key room from the first film, Snape’s Potions Classroom in the dungeons, and the life-sized Chessboard Chamber. These interior spaces add much depth to what might have been just an exterior shell, giving reasons for investigating the model from all angles.</p>



<p>The grounds around it feature components that complete the Hogwarts experience rather than a mere castle structure. The Durmstrang Ship sits in the Black Lake, recreating one of the dramatic entrances featured in Goblet of Fire. The Beauxbatons Carriage sits ready near the castle gates, recreating an entrance to the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow stands with its characteristic twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia rests nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>The<strong> 2,660-piece count gives you hours of engaging building</strong> which breaks down into sections. LEGO designed the instructions to guide you through one area at a time, preventing the overwhelming feeling that massive sets sometimes create. You can build the castle over several evenings and make it a relaxing activity rather than a marathon building session. The variety of bricks includes special pieces for architectural details, transparent pieces for windows, and textured pieces adding depth aesthetically to walls and roofs.</p>



<p>Adding a really premium feel to the display is the inclusion of the gold-colored mini-figure of the statue of the Hogwarts architect. You can place this statue next to the included <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate or place it at any corner of the baseplate for balance. The nameplate gives the display a museum-quality finish that makes it clear this set targets adult collectors rather than kids.</p>
<p>At $140 off from $169, this LEGO <em>Hogwarts castle and grounds</em> is incredible value for a 2,660-piece licensed set. You get the most detailed, comprehensive Hogwarts recreation LEGO has made-complete with iconic locations, surrounding grounds, and display-ready presentation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Dumps 13-Inch iPad Pro M4 at New Record Low, Now More Tempting Than Pricey M5 Models]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-dumps-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-at-new-record-low-now-more-tempting-than-pricey-m5-models-2000645564</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-dumps-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-at-new-record-low-now-more-tempting-than-pricey-m5-models.1358677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium tablets bridge the gap between laptops and phones and give you serious computing power in a portable package. Apple just unveiled its new iPad Pro M5 lineup a few weeks ago with the 13-inch model launching at $1,299, which <strong>makes the M4 version suddenly look like a steal</strong>. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5717/">dropped the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 to $1,049 from its original $1,299 price and matches what you’d pay for a smaller, less capable tablet</a>. The M4 and M5 models share so many similarities that spending $250 more for the newer chip makes zero sense for most people.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5717/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Tablet</h2>
<p>The <strong>M4 chip inside this iPad Pro brings desktop-grade performance</strong> that makes the upgrade to M5 seem superfluous for real-world work. What’s more, the 10-core CPU tackles tasks like video editing, 3D rendering, music production and multitasking without breaking a sweat. Apple built the M4 on a 3nm process that balances raw power with incredible efficiency, giving you all-day battery life even under intensive tasks. A 10-core GPU further pushes graphics performance to levels comparable to serious gaming machines, making this tablet ideal both for creative work and entertainment. The difference between M4 and M5 mainly exists in benchmark scores which most people never notice in real use.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ultra Retina XDR display represents one of the best screens ever put on a tablet</strong>. This 13-inch panel gives truly extreme brightness that remains readable in direct sunlight, while also offering deep blacks to make the OLED screens jealous. ProMotion technology adjusts the refresh rate to up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and responsive input from Apple Pencil, then drops right down to conserve battery when the on-screen content has become static. P3 wide color gamut reproduces colors more accurately than standard displays, something that makes a big difference with photo editing and creative work. <strong>True Tone adjusts color temperature</strong> according to ambient lighting to reduce eye strain with extended use.</p>



<p>The impossibly thin design makes this 13-inch tablet feel lighter than its size suggests: <strong>Apple shaved the thickness down to just 5.1mm</strong>&nbsp;and created a profile that slips into bags easily with no extra bulk. A Space Black finish does a better job of resisting fingerprints than past aluminum finishes on Apple’s tablets, so the device stays clean throughout the day. The weight reduction means that you can hold the iPad Pro comfortably through marathon reading sessions or video calls without your arm tiring. The overall structural rigidity is impressive for such a slim frame, and the tablet doesn’t flex or creak at all if you press hard.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration</strong> changes how you’ll interact with the iPad Pro using AI-infused features: It helps write emails, summarize information, create images, and organize material all through natural language. It also includes privacy protections that mean all of this AI processing happens locally on your device rather than by sending sensitive information to cloud servers. The AI features seamlessly connect apps by suggesting what should be done next based on context, and the more you use them, the better they learn your preferences.</p>



<p>The <strong>new landscape 12MP Ultra Wide front camera finally puts the camera where it belongs for video calls</strong>. Center Stage automatically keeps you in frame as you move around, making video conferences feel more natural and professional. The 12MP Wide back camera captures stunning photos and 4K video with ProRes support for professional editing workflows. Four studio-quality microphones record clear audio from any direction while the four-speaker system delivers rich, immersive sound.</p>
<p>This iPad Pro M4 provides flagship performance for $250 less than the nearly identical M5 model down from $1,299 to $1,049. For your money, you’re getting the same Ultra Retina XDR display, similar processing power, an identical design, and full Apple Intelligence support, making the upgrade to an M5 unit a pretty questionable decision. The fact that <strong>this Amazon-exclusive discount</strong> combines with those cutting-edge specs to create value that’s out of reach for Apple’s official store is rather fascinating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign is bad</a>. So it’s a shame that the coolest bit of <em>Black Ops 7</em>, a new co-op RPG-meets-extraction-shooter mode called Endgame, is locked behind completing said not-very-good campaign. But that’s changing very soon, according to the game’s developer, Treyarch.</p> <p>The latest entry in Activision’s long-running FPS franchise,<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"> <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, launched earlier this week to mixed reviews from fans and critics. While many praised the game’s visuals and zombies mode, its multiplayer feels long in the tooth, and its campaign is a wild, incomprehensible mess that is only fun to play through if you like experiencing expensive trainwrecks. And for some odd reason, Treyarch decided to lock perhaps the best, coolest mode in<em> Black Ops 7,</em> Endgame, behind completion of the campaign.</p>

 <p>Currently, you have to complete the campaign to play Endgame <em>or</em> get invited to a lobby created by someone who has already finished the story. It feels like a bad decision, and many players have likely not touched Endgame yet because they don’t want to play (or finish) this year’s terrible campaign. And Treyarch seems to get that it was a regrettable design choice, and will be removing the restriction on November 21.</p>

 <p><span>“We’ve seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who’ve already been dropping in,” <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519">tweeted Treyarch.</a> “So we’re making it available to everyone in </span><em><span>Black Ops 7</span></em><span>.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who've already been dropping in, so we're making it available to everyone in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> starting Friday, Nov. 21.</p> <p>Team up with other players to complete objectives, increase your power, earn unique Weapon Camos, and take on… <a href="https://t.co/2igahTPHv6">pic.twitter.com/2igahTPHv6</a></p> <p>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p>Endgame is set on the same open-world island map that is found in the campaign. But this time around, you land with nothing and have to complete various challenges, missions, and quests dotted around the large island, either alone or with a few pals.</p>

 <p>As you kill enemies, find new loot, and complete activities, you get more powerful and can explore more of the island, with the end goal being to reach the most challenging enemies and powerful loot and then extract before time runs out. Do so, and you can return with all your stuff. Die or fail to leave, and you start over. It’s a very fun mode that takes the excellent and snappy combat of <em>Black Ops 7</em> and transplants it into a new experience inspired by extraction shooters like <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, but which doesn’t feel as punishing as those games tend to be.</p> <p>As a bonus reward, Treyarch will send out a bunch of XP boosters and Gobblegum packs to players who beat the campaign and started playing Endgame before this change. And that’s cool; I think it’s just nice to give players who suffered through the campaign some sort of gift for their trouble. Regardless, I’m excited to play more Endgame with more people later this week and check out more of the island and what it has to offer.</p>
