Given an audience willing to fork out eye-watering amounts for its laptops and phones, it’s perhaps not surprising that the company assumed it could do the same in the cursed world of VR with the $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles. Except, according to sourced reports, it couldn’t. The Vision Pro is said to no longer be in production.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196012" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Goes Hands-On At The Apple Developer Showcase" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="86" data-playlist="196012,195371,197298" data-current="196012"><div><p>Kotaku Goes Hands-On At The Apple Developer Showcase</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21534.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is all based on a report from October 2024 on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Information</em></a></span><em> </em>(a site that, appositely, charges $300 to $1,000 a year to read its articles) which claimed, based on multiple sources, that Apple would be winding down production on the Vision Pro as the year ended, given the backlog of unsold devices. There was also rumor of a cheaper model going into production instead of a previously planned second version of the Pro, potentially for an end-of-year 2025 release.</p><p>The Vision Pro’s failure to set the world aflame is perhaps somewhat predictable. Not only does absolutely no one actually want mixed-reality headsets for their work life, but they especially don’t want to pay the price of a second-hand car for the honor. At $3.5k, you’d have to hope the Vision Pro came with a suite of absolutely essential apps and uses, and, er, it didn’t do that either.</p><p>Back in October, <em>The Information</em> said its sources at component manufacturers told the site they’d supplied enough parts for over half a million headsets, with “tens of thousands of undelivered parts” filling the suppliers’ warehouses. It was claimed at the time that Apple had sold 370,000 Vision Pros—a figure that seems enormously optimistic, but one that allegedly represents only two-thirds of the stock that had been made. Compare that to the millions of units Meta has shifted of its Meta Quest VR headsets, at a seventh of the price of Apple’s tech.</p><p>If all this proves to be accurate, that means that as of now Apple is no longer making new Vision Pros, because just not enough people saw a reason to pay such a whacking fee for such an entirely superfluous piece of tech. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MacRumors</em> points out</a></span>, Apple had reportedly originally asked its Chinese manufacturer to expect to make eight million Vision Pros, meaning it’s likely sold a twentieth of its initial expectations. The reports claim Apple has told the manufacturer to expect to make half that many for its next, cheaper version of the AR headset which, while suggesting a massive drop in expectation even at a cheaper price, still seems ludicrously unlikely.</p><p>Meta’s relative success with the Quest VR headsets in 2024 is likely due to its finding that sweet price point of $300 to $500, where people are more willing to take a gamble on a piece of unproven tech. Arguably, Apple could still find its niche in this space, if it can get things down to $1,000 and capture the business market that feels obliged to jump on gimmicks, leading to overworked people in hot suits being forced to look at virtual Power Point demonstrations until they quit their jobs and take up macrame.</p><p>We’ve contacted Apple for a comment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a creation by Doctor Gerald Robotnik, who went on to create Shadow as the “true” product of his research into creating an immortal being. Since Gerald doesn’t create Shadow in the movies, as he’s an alien from another planet like all the anthropomorphic animals are, there was no need to include the Biolizard in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. However, it turns out the movie does feature a brief reference to the creature during Shadow’s flashbacks. 50 years prior to the events of the movie, Shadow lived in a government facility with Maria Robotnik, Gerald’s granddaughter. The two became close like siblings, and are shown playing together while scientists attempt to perform experiments on the speedy hedgehog. One of these moments sees the pair watching a kaiju movie that, at a glance, appears to be an homage to early <em>Godzilla </em>films. But upon further inspection, it’s also a clever reference to the Biolizard. The giant reptile shown terrorizing civilians in the movie bears a striking resemblance to the character, from its slender mechanical eyes to the cables that extend from its jaws down its body. The movie the two watch is in black-and-white, but I imagine if it had been in color more people would have immediately caught onto this reference seeing its orange-brown skin.</p><p>On one hand, it is cool to see the movie pay homage to an important figure in Shadow’s game story, but given the way the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe has previously treated one of the big monster-like enemies of the games as a comic relief prop, some fans aren’t thrilled with how <em>Sonic 3</em> references the Biolizard, fearing that it’s becoming a pattern for these movies.

Despite its innocuous roots, DEI has become a loaded term in online debates, not because of what it actually means but for what it symbolizes to certain reactionary groups.</p><p>Pilestedt, who has a reputation among the sprawling <em>Helldivers 2</em> community for speaking often and openly on social media, replied with a more general and ambiguous proclamation about development. “If it doesn’t add to the game experience, it detracts,” he tweeted back. “And games should be a pure pursuit of amazing moments.”</p><p>“How would DEI have benefited <em>Helldivers 2</em>?” asked another user. Pilestedt responded, “I don’t like labels. But mankind is united in its extreme xenophobia on Super Earth. #Inclusion so, maybe that’s DEI?  I really don’t care. Make good games, don’t make a contemporary political statement.”</p><p>The irony of the tight-rope being walked—distancing <em>Helldivers 2</em> from the current online culture wars while not outright rejecting them—is that the sci-fi shooter is loaded with political allegories, satire, and parodies of fascist propaganda.

That might offer enough distance to inoculate the game from certain modern political controversies, but it also might be a distinction without a difference when it comes to people who consider any game that makes a point they disagree with to be unnecessarily political. </p><p>For others, “DEI” is just code for criticizing any game that doesn’t star white guys, as the idiotic reaction by some to Naughty Dog’s <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet </em>reveal trailer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/naughtydog/comments/1hdxuq9/why_are_people_calling_intergalactic_dei/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/naughtydog/comments/1hdxuq9/why_are_people_calling_intergalactic_dei/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has made nauseatingly clear</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So now you can try to belt Cynthia Erivo’s “Defying Gravity” battle cry from the comfort of your own home. The digital version of the movie includes some special features like commentary from Erivo and co-lead Ariana Grande, behind-the-scenes interviews, and a handful of deleted scenes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-movie-barbie-porn-site-mattel-1851694637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-movie-barbie-porn-site-mattel-1851694637"><em>Wicked</em></a></span><em> </em>is already a long movie, running at two hours and 40 minutes, but after seeing some of the moments that were cut fans are asking if it would really have been so bad if the film had been a few minutes longer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Some of these deleted scenes were fine to cut. One includes Grande’s character, Glinda the Good Witch, meeting her cronies Pfannee and ShenShen, and while it’s nice to give those characters a little more screen time, they’re mostly bit players in the grand scheme of things. The ones that feel like they would have added a lot of meat to the film include Erivo as Elphaba taking just a few minutes to flesh out her ties to Glinda and her sister’s boyfriend Boq.</p><p>Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship is the lifeblood of both the film and stage versions of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-mattel-porn-lawsuit-news-1851713647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-mattel-porn-lawsuit-news-1851713647"><em>Wicked</em></a></span>, and while there’s a lot of time spent on their enemies-to-friends arc, a few gaps could’ve been filled. The deleted scene “Elphaba’s Promise” is only two minutes long but adds a great deal to the characters’ complicated relationship. This small interaction between the two as they study magic addresses the weird lack of acknowledging the point earlier in the film when Elphaba slips away with Glinda’s boyfriend Fiyero to save a captured lion cub. Here, we see Glinda ask why Elphaba didn’t ask her for help, to which Elphaba apologizes and says she won’t leave her behind again. In the final film, the two never really have a conversation about what happened. This would have also punctuated the moment later when Elphaba brings Glinda along with her to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Seeing that this scene was shot and ready to go makes it a puzzling omission. Yes, yes, you’ve gotta cut some things for time, but you’re telling me the duo fucking about with a busted hot air balloon in the last 20 minutes was more valuable than them fleshing out their relationship?</p><p>Another cut interaction that would have added a lot to the movie is one between Elphaba and Ethan Slater’s Boq. The munchkin is the boyfriend of Elphaba’s sister Nessarose, but he secretly harbors feelings for Glinda. Well, it’s a secret to Nessarose, at least. In “Boq &amp; Elphaba talk,” the Witch of the West talks with Boq about their hopes and dreams and how they’re both hopelessly in love with two unavailable people. When Elphaba is unwilling to admit she has feelings for Fiyero, Boq ends the chat with a banger of a line: “I’m sorry, I misunderstood. I thought we were being honest.” Tea clocked.</p><p>Without spoiling anything for those who don’t know anything about <em>Wicked</em>’s second act—which will make up the sequel movie <em>Wicked: For Good </em>on November 21—Boq is a pretty important character in what’s to come. Though the first film rightfully focuses on Elphaba and Glinda, its ensemble cast is about to go through some transformative experiences in the second film, and giving them just a little bit more time could have gone a long way. At least we have these scenes available to view in the special features. Even if they weren’t in the final cut, you can pretty much consider them canon because they slot nicely into the movie we got.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
