              <p>He’s taken on comic books, black holes, and the making of the atom bomb. Now director Christopher Nolan has turned his sights to one of the oldest works of literature in the Western canon. How does the man who brought us <em>The Dark Knight</em> imagine Homer’s<em> The Odyssey</em>? The movie’s first trailer is finally here to give us some initial clues.</p> <p>Sitting at just under two minutes and encompassing plenty of brooding fadeouts set to ominous drums and flutes, the first trailer for <em>The Odyssey</em> briefly shows us Odysseus (Matt Damon) and King Agamemnon (Benny Safdie) after the battle of Troy has finished, and sets the stage for the former’s long and perilous journey home now that the war has ended. From there we get glimpses of the Trojan Horse, the cyclops, the underworld, and other notable elements of the ancient Greek poem.</p>

  <p>Damon as Odysseus speaks about the determination of his men, after years of war, to make it back home. We also catch glimpses of Tom Holland as Telemachus (his son) and Anne Hathaway as Penelope (his wife). Damon speaks with a weary exhaustion that would be captured perfectly by the character-aging-in-real-time meme from the end of <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>.</p>

 <p>And this version of <em>The Odyssey</em> very much feels like it could be Nolan’s version of that <em>WWII</em> epic, but with a twist. While most great war films focus on the destruction, tragedy, and bravery in the midst of battle, <em>The Odyssey</em> is about what happens when the bloodshed is over, the cost of victory, the price of legacy, and whether those who left can ever truly come home. Nolan’s take on one of literature’s quintessential quest narratives releases July 17, 2026, and it’s probably going to be one worth seeing in IMAX.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-no-margin-on-the-odyssey-g3-gaming-monitor-at-a-record-low-offloading-a-best-seller-for-year-end-2000655044</link>
            <guid>1390138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A $130 gaming monitor is going to create more skepticism than confidence if you don’t look further than the price. A number that low will make people assume it’s a knockoff brand with middling resolution, poor response time, and a short lifespan. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">This $130 gaming monitor on sale at Amazon, however, is a Samsung Odyssey G3</a>, one of the best models from one of the very best manufacturers. All of Samsung’s advanced features designed for peak gaming performance are packed into this compact 24-inch display that’s perfect for a bedroom or dorm room desk setup.</p>
<p>Normally a $200 monitor that’s worth every bit of that original price, the Samsung Odyssey G3 is a total steal at $130. The 27-inch model of the same display might be an even better deal now that it’s marked down to just $140, but this 24-inch model has all of the performance in a slightly smaller size that could be a better fit in a tight area or small gaming station.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6549/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 27″ at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Peak Performance</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G3 checks off every box possible for anyone shopping for a peak compact gaming monitor. The obvious perks are the 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, both competitive-gamer level metrics that are virtually impossible to find in a $130 display. There’s no lag, no tearing, and no glitching out to stop you from getting the drop on the enemy in a shooter or battle royal.</p>
<p>Also bolstering the Odyssey G3’s elite gaming performance is AMD Radeon FreeSync technology, which locks the monitor and the graphics card of your console or PC into perfect refresh rate sync. Having one outperform the other is how image tearing and blur happen, but with FreeSync even the fastest action comes across flawlessly smooth.</p>
<p>A bonus feature for shooters and action games is the Odyssey G3’s Black Equalizer feature. When turned on, dark areas on the screen get a definite boost of brightness and contrast, eliminating your enemies’ hiding places and averting ambush attacks.</p>



<h2>Flip the Script</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G3 can swivel, tilt, pivot, and fine-adjust for height, so you can position it in the perfect location for your setup. It can even be turned from landscape to portrait orientation and back whenever you like. If you have a space that’s long on width but short on height, the 3-sided borderless design of the Odyssey G3 allows you to line two of them up side by side to create a seamless, uninterrupted horizontal playing field, or a multi-monitor setup for streaming or work. At just $130 during this Amazon deal, you can buy 2 of the Odyssey G3 displays to create this awesome setup.</p>
<p>The average Amazon reviewer gives the Samsung Odyssey G3 a 4.6-star rating, and it’s no wonder why when you run down the list of specs and perks. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The Amazon deal that’s still up and still able to get you the Odyssey G3 in time for Christmas transforms an excellent $200 gaming monitor into a truly unbeatable $130 one.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ryzen-5-pro-mini-pc-crashes-to-a-record-low-in-a-year-end-clearance-after-staying-full-price-on-black-friday-2000655004</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not a fan of big desktop setups? A mini PC can be a perfect alternative. These offer the performance you need, just in a more compact, space-saving form factor. If your workstation is in need of an upgrade, now is a great time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6548/">The GMKtec mini PC M8 just dropped by 25% at Amazon, which brings its price down to $360.</a> You’re saving a nice $120 on this powerful option that can support both your work and play needs easily. The deal is only around for a short time, though. We’re not expecting it to make it past the weekend, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6548/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs Considerable Power</h2>
<p>Starting off with the size – it’s truly compact. It fits into tighter, cluttered spaces without demanding a lot of space, and can even be mounted on a flat surface (under the table, behind the monitor, on the wall) if you’re not a fan of having too many things on your desk.</p>
<p>Performance is nothing short of incredible. M8 runs on an AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 6650H with 6 cores and 12 threads, hitting base speeds of 3.30GHz and Turbo up to 4.5GHz. It’s made to handle all your everyday tasks – browsing the web, checking emails, streaming shows – plus a few light creative ones without slowing down. Paired with the processor is a powerful AMD Radeon 660M 12 Cores Graphics Card that delivers lag-free performance for moderate gaming, as well as editing and creating. There are three BIOS performance modes to choose from; Quiet 28W, Balance 35W, or Performance 40W.</p>



<p>The modest, yet fast 1<strong>6GB LPDDR5 6400MT/S RAM</strong> keeps things running smoothly on the backend as you push through busy days. It’s not exactly made for heavy-duty multitasking, but holds up well for regular use. You won’t experience noticeable slowdowns when working with a couple of different applications or using a bunch of tabs at the same time. The same goes for back-to-back video calls on busy office days, and some late-night play sessions with friends. Storing everything won’t be a problem, either, thanks to the included <strong>512GB SSD</strong>. Again, it’s not massive, but should be enough to house your important documents, media content, and other files with ease. Additionally, the dual M.2 2280 slots support up to 4TB each, meaning you can expand the space up to 8TB if your storage needs grow in the future.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include a versatile USB4 port (40Gbps, PD Charging, Video), USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (10Gbps), dual 2.5GbE LAN ports, HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, and more. The HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, and USB4/DP ports let you connect up to three displays at the same time for a bigger, more productive work setup. It’s great for creatives who want to have multiple references open side-by-side, plus gamers looking to stream as they play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6548/">This deal brings the price of this mini PC down to $360, after taking a nice 25% off its usual $480 tag.</a> The PC comes packed with all the helpful features you might need for a productive workstation, and the current discount makes it easier than ever to pick one. Don’t wait too long, though. The offer could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-teases-for-nintendos-next-zelda-game-have-begun-2000655122</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2’s first year did come with a new <em>Zelda</em> game, though it’s not necessarily the one diehard fans are waiting for. <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> ties directly into the storyline of <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, but it’s a musou-style hack-and-slash game rather than a traditional <em>Legend of Zelda</em> adventure. Still, the franchise’s producer says some of that action flavor could influence the direction of the next mainline entry.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-switch-2-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-reviews-metacritic-2000641055"><em>Age of Imprisonment</em></a> was a collaboration between Koei Tecmo’s AAA Games Studio and the <em>Zelda</em> team at Nintendo, including long-time producer Eiji Aonuma. While AAA Games Studio would lead on designing features and gameplay, the<em> Zelda</em> team would test and give feedback.&nbsp;“We aimed to combine these two approaches; the<em> Zelda</em>-like, strategic back-and-forth of using Zonai gear and varied techniques against powerful foes with the exhilaration of&nbsp;<em>musou&nbsp;</em>(i.e. feeling mighty powerful as you cut down waves of weaker foes),” AAA Games Studio head Yusuke Hayashi said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eiji-aonuma-hints-that-next-zelda-game-will-be-inspired-by-elements-of-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">translated by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p>

 <p>When Nintendo would raise concerns about something, the Koei Tecmo team would come back with “proposals that elevated it into something even better,” <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> director Hidemaro Fujibayashi said. “The inspiration we received from this collaboration with Koei Tecmo may be reflected in the (next)<em> Zelda</em> we create,” Aonuma added. “Please picture this while playing <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>, and look forward to our <em>Zelda</em>.”</p>

 <p>Is this laying the groundwork for a <em>Devil May Cry</em>-like evolution of the franchise, or is it just Aonuma being cheeky? He noted elsewhere in the interview that his team was hoping to be the first to release a <em>Zelda</em> game for Nintendo’s new hardware but were beaten to it by Koei Tecmo. “<em>The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment</em> is the first <em>Zelda</em> title released for the Nintendo Switch 2. To be honest, we wanted to bring out the ‘first’ (<em>Zelda</em> game on the new console),” he reportedly chuckled.</p>

 <p>In his mind, at least, it’s clear<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> is a true<em> Zelda</em> game and not just another <em>Warriors</em> spin-off. From a story point of view, it’s understandable why. Anyone wanting to get the full picture of the events from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> would need to have experienced it and the previous <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&nbsp;</em>as well. Will the next<em> Zelda</em> game return to that world, or break the mold and start off someplace new in the <em>Zelda</em> timeline? <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> didn’t get any DLC so hopefully that means we’ll find out the answer sooner than expected.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/">The Indie Game Awards</a>, a usually delightful and low-controversy annual celebration of the best of indie games in a given year, has found itself having to retract three different awards handed out in last week’s event, including its Game of the Year prize. That originally went to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, which also won Best Debut Indie, both already controversial choices given <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">the game is not “indie” by pretty much every understanding of the term</a>, but was withdrawn on the allegation that the developers, Sandfall Interactive, were not honest about the game’s use of AI when it was submitted. The other retraction is for an Indie Vanguard recognition of a Game Boy-like game that is only available on weapons dealer Palmer Luckey’s ModRetro devices.</p> <p>A big part of the IGAs, organized by Six One Indie, are its progressive values and its desire to support the indie scene in a positive way, making its intentions and selections potentially different from those of other award ceremonies out there. One of those values is to not endorse games made using so-called “generative AI” tools. In a video posted to BlueSky over the weekend, Six One’s Mike Towndrow stated that Sandfall told the IGAs that no gen-AI had been used in the creation of <em>Clair Obscur</em>, only admitting that in fact it had been on the day of the awards. (We have reached out to Sandfall and owners Kepler to ask for their side of events.)</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti/app.bsky.feed.post/3magufzccy22i" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigwdw5iwm2iojwzodusm5l6taqldvuqpnuyrc2miidgks6zhwflz4"> <p lang="en">The IGAs Nomination Committee is officially retracting Debut Game and Game of the Year, awarding both categories to new recipients. Additionally, we are retracting one of the Indie Vanguard recipients.</p> <p>Full details can be found in our FAQ under Game Eligibility: www.indiegameawards.gg/faq</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti?ref_src=embed">The Indie Game Awards (@indiegameawards.gg)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hbkraazgwbkh2fmbptgr3yti/post/3magufzccy22i?ref_src=embed">2025-12-20T18:45:10.232Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>In a statement posted to the IGA’s FAQ, the point is reiterated.</p> <blockquote><p><span>The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself. When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> from its nomination. While the assets in question were patched out and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place. As a result, the IGAs nomination committee has agreed to officially retract both the Debut Game and Game of the Year awards.</span></p></blockquote> <p>As a result,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-metacritic-game-pass-ps-plus-switch-1851775306"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> has been given the Game of the Year award, while Debut Game goes to à la mode games’ <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796580/Sorry_Were_Closed/">Sorry We’re Closed</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>The other rescinded award is one of the IGA’s Indie Vanguard selections, <a href="https://gortyncode.itch.io/">Gortyn Code</a>,<span>&nbsp;a Greek indie developer which made a Game Boy game called&nbsp;<em>Chantey</em>. However, since the announcement, the IGA team learned that the game’s physical card is only being produced and sold by ModRetro, a retro gaming company owned by Oculus-founding billionaire Palmer Luckey, who also runs the arms-dealing Anduril Industries. And to make sure there was no ambiguity left, <a href="https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868">it announced the Anduril Chromatic</a>, a retro gaming device made from the same metal used to build the company’s military drones.</span></p>

 <p>In the IGA’s FAQ it’s stated, “<span>The IGAs nomination committee were unfortunately made aware of ModRetro’s nature and principles the day after the 2025 premiere with the news of their upcoming handheld console. As the company strictly goes against the values of the IGAs. [sic] Due to the ties with ModRetro, Indie Vanguard has also been retracted as we do not want to provide the company with a platform.”</span></p>

 <p>However, it goes on to add that “<span>the decision does not reflect Gortyn Code, but ModRetro alone. Chantey remains a wonderful throwback to the Game Boy era,” encouraging people to seek out the game via its <a href="https://gortyncode.itch.io/">Itch.io page</a>, where it can be played.</span></p>

 <p>Some might argue they would prefer their award organizers not allow ideological positions to determine their criteria, and those people will be able to take comfort in the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">this is the case</a> for almost every other ceremony out there, while recognizing that the IGAs are independently owned and run by Six One Indie, which can do whatever it pleases. You can watch all the original announcements for the IGAs in the video below, for which replacement acceptance speeches will be recorded by the new winners.</p>

Normally priced at $100, you can grab it for just $79, making it an ideal gift option this season.</p>

              <p>Why are the stocking stuffers always the last thing on everybody’s holiday list? Small gifts can be the best ones, especially when they’re amazingly useful and at near-all-time low prices,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> like this 4-pack of Apple AirTags that’s on sale at Amazon for 34% off and will still arrive in time for Christmas if you order now.</a></p>
<p>Being stocking-sized is only a small part of the appeal for this deal. Normally a $99 buy, a 4-pack of AirTags for just $65 is a major score, and if you’re a devoted Apple fan or even just an iPhone user, the AirTags are by far the best Bluetooth trackers. They’re compact, exceptionally easy to set up, are powered by an easy-to-find replaceable battery, and help you find lost items with amazing precision.</p>

<h2>4-Pack Covers It All</h2>
<p>One 4-pack of Apple AirTags can cover a huge swath of the items you need to keep tabs on. There is a huge range of inexpensive AirTag holders that fit keychains, along with holders for wallets and even wallets and money clips that have built-in AirTag holders. Backpacks and other bags are even easier — just drop in an AirTag and let it do the work for you. With your iPhone or iPad handy, you’ll have a location on your valuables at all times.</p>
<p>AirTags have become indispensable travel accessories too. Most major airlines have some form of luggage tracking app or service, but to be&nbsp;<em>really</em> sure of where your bags are, an AirTag slipped into an inner compartment is the best method. Distance is no issue, since the AirTags connect to Apple’s massive Find My network, which is able to ping off of nearby Apple devices — without compromising your privacy or safety — to locate your item whether it’s tens or thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Finding far closer objects — the wallet or keys that slid between couch cushions or slipped under a car seat — is fast and easy with the Find My app. The app gives you directions and distances down to the inch, and you can also make the AirTag play a chime to help you narrow down the search.</p>



<h2>Tough Little Tracker</h2>
<p>The AirTag is IP67-rated for dust and water exposure, and the outer shell is tough enough to endure the knocks and drops that come with being attached to a keychain or the outside of a backpack. The battery is good for roughly a year, and the FindMy app on your iOS device will let you know when it’s time to get a fresh battery. When that time comes, the CR2032 disc battery is one of the most common and easy to find batteries, and the AirTag is easy to open. A quick few seconds later, your AirTag is ready to go for another year.</p>
<p>Not many people are going to put AirTags on their holiday gift list, but anyone who finds a 4-pack of these top-tier Bluetooth trackers in their stocking will be very pleasantly surprised. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">The 4-pack of Apple AirTags on sale at Amazon for just $65 is a thoughful and exceptionally useful gift idea</a>, and if you order now they’ll still make it in time for Christmas.</p>

              <p>Building a desktop PC from scratch, or upgrading your CPU? We’ve found a deal that lets you pick a strong motherboard without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">The Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II – an option that offers exceptional power and great gaming features – is currently available for just $120 at Amazon, down from its usual $180 price.</a> This is one of the lowest we have seen this motherboard drop to, but as you’d expect, the offer wraps up soon. It’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later, before that happens. Note that the package is likely going to arrive after Christmas. If you were planning to surprise a gamer or a creative in your life with it, keep the shipping timeline in mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Feature-Rich</h2>
<p>This motherboard is an excellent option for AMD Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series, as well as 5000 and 4000 G-series desktop processors. The thoughtful 14-phase VRM design (12 main and 2 auxiliary) lets it handle the powerful options well without overheating, making it great for anyone looking to work with resource-intensive programs and heavier projects frequently. It supports Windows 11, plus allows for up to 128GB of RAM, which is more than enough to handle serious multitasking.</p>
<p>Build quality is just as exceptional, with RGB lighting adding a nice aesthetic touch to the setup. The feature-rich board is also PCIe 4.0-ready, which translates into faster data transfer speeds, especially when paired with a high-end NVMe SSD. You will be able to load games, launch apps, and move files (even the larger ones) around without waiting long. What’s more, WiFi 6E (802.11ax) and Intel 2.5 Gb Ethernet with ASUS LANGuard come together to ensure smooth networking. On the other hand, ports like dual M.2 slots, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, plus HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.2 outputs make it convenient to connect other devices for a fuller, more productive setup.</p>



<p>The box includes the motherboard itself, an ASUS 2×2 dual Wi-Fi antenna, an addressable RGB extension cable, a user manual, a support CD, and an ROG sticker pack. The bundle also includes a 60-day subscription to AIDA64 Extreme.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a solid motherboard to add to your setup without breaking the bank, the Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II is one of the best options to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">We’d highly recommend it at its full $180 price, but the current 33% discount makes it much more affordable and, honestly, a no-brainer.</a> The $120 asking is nothing compared to all the features it’s packed with. Just be sure to snap it up quickly, because the deal is selling out fast. Place your orders before it expires, or before the stock runs out for good.</p>
