            <title><![CDATA[Darth Jar Jar Is Real (Sort Of): LEGO’s Dark Falcon Brings the Wildest Star Wars Fan Theory to Life and Now at Its Lowest Price]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the years preceding the release of the sequel trilogy, a quite infamous and entertaining Star Wars fan theory began circulating online. The idea was simple: Jar Jar is Evil. The delightfully wacky Gungan was never meant to be comic relief, but rather the true villain of the prequel trilogy. According to the theory, George Lucas had originally planned to reveal Jar Jar as the saga’s ultimate puppet master, only to abandon the twist after audiences reacted poorly to the character following <em>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em>. Some fans treated the theory as a genuine missed opportunity, others as a long-running joke—but nearly everyone agreed it was fun to imagine an alternate Star Wars timeline where “Darth Jar Jar” was real.</p>
<p>That alternate timeline now appears to be alive and well—at least in brick form. LEGO has wholeheartedly embraced this playful “what if” scenario with its LEGO Star Wars The Dark Falcon set.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/"> As we kick off the new year, Amazon is offering the set at a 17% discount, dropping the price from its usual $180 down to $148,</a> a $32 savings on one of the more unusual and conversation-starting Star Wars builds in recent memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Dark Falcon exists in a twisted mirror version of the Star Wars universe, where heroes and villains have swapped moral alignments. The iconic Millennium Falcon design is reimagined in sleek jet black with striking red accents, immediately evoking Sith aesthetics rather than Rebel scrappiness. That theme extends to the minifigures as well, each offering a role reversal that ranges from clever to downright absurd.</p>

<h2>Your Favorite Star Wars Characters, But Wrong</h2>
<p>Front and center is the figure fans have joked about for years: Darth Jar Jar. The Naboo native finally gets his moment as a full-fledged Sith, complete with a menacing double-bladed red lightsaber reminiscent of Darth Maul’s. Rey joins him on the dark side, also wielding a double-bladed red saber—though this one runs parallel, like a tuning fork. C-3PO reappears as a bounty hunter, keeping much of his familiar silhouette but taking on a far tougher persona and red-glowing eyes.</p>
<p>On the flip side, classic villains get heroic makeovers. Darth Vader becomes Jedi Vader, dressed in a clean white outfit and wielding a blue lightsaber like he did in his Anakin Skywalker days. Then there’s the most unsettling transformation of all: Luke Skywalker. No longer the noble Jedi, but also not a villain the way you’d expect with this pattern going. Instead, Luke has embraced a bizarre, laid-back beach lifestyle. LEGO’s design makes him look less like a galactic hero and more like The Dude from The Big Lebowski, blue milk in hand and vibes fully off.</p>



<p>Beyond the minifigures, The Dark Falcon is packed with interactive features. The 1,579-piece set measures over 5 inches tall, 7 inches long, and 12.5 inches wide. Flip-up panels reveal a detailed interior, while spring-loaded shooters let you fire off lasers. There’s a removable throne for Darth Jar Jar, a jail cell for Beach Luke, and an opening cockpit that seats two minifigures.</p>
<p>This strange reimagining isn’t tied to traditional Star Wars canon, but instead to LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy, a four-episode animated series that debuted on Disney+ in 2024. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the Darth Jar Jar theory or simply enjoy seeing Star Wars turned upside down, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">The Dark Falcon LEGO set is a standout collector’s piece—especially at $32 off for a limited time.</a></p>
