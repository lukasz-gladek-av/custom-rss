              <p>Some of the developers who worked on (and are still working on)<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-no-animal-killing-zoo-1851781328"><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> hopped into a Reddit AMA to answer fan questions about Ubisoft’s latest entry in its stabby historical fiction franchise. Not all of the questions and answers were revealing, but buried in the AMA were some interesting pieces of information about the lore of <em>Assassin’s Creed,</em> upcoming games in the series, more updates coming for <em>Shadows</em>, and a confirmation on some features that <em>won’t</em> be added in future updates.</p> <p>Here are 10(ish) things we learned about<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/">August 12 AMA on the Assassin’s Creed subreddit</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The war between Assassins and Templars will continue</strong></h2> <p>When a fan asked if players can expect more content about the franchise’s classic conflict between Assassins and Templars, <em>AC Shadows</em> level design director Luc had this to say:</p> <blockquote><p>“The Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of <em>Assassin’s Creed.</em> With <em>Shadows</em>, we wanted to properly set our protagonist in the setting before expanding on the Assassins vs. Templars. Now that it’s done on the main game, we scratched the surface with <a href="https://youtu.be/FUrqLJdXO7E?si=u7RxcL6GmFSvoomX">the <em>Critical Role</em> story drop</a>, and you can expect more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Why Ubisoft Didn’t Include The Modern-Day Storyline</strong></h2> <p>Another user asked where Basim was and if his modern-day storyline, which began in <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, will ever return or if Ubisoft had moved on. Once again, Luc replied to this question and explained why it was missing and teased more to come in the future:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We have complex new characters that were introduced in <em>Shadows</em> that we didn’t feel there would have been enough spotlight for Basim as well. With <em>AC Shadows</em> we are putting in place the first stone of new means to deliver the Modern Day story line with the Animus HUB. That is not the end of it, and we are listening to your feedback. While Modern Day is not the main focus of the story we tell with <em>Shadows</em>, it remains important for our community, so you can expect it to be expanded at some point, in some fashion…”</p></blockquote> <h2><b>The Team Isn’t Retconning<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> Lore</b></h2> <p>A seeming expert in<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> lore asked a bunch of long questions about the franchise’s universe and how they were worried that parts of it from older games, such as Isu artifacts, were being ignored or even retconned completely. Again, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/comment/n8bab6m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Luc swooped in to provide an extended answer you can read here,</a> but this bit is his confirmation that the team isn’t erasing <em>AC</em> lore; they just aren’t always including it in games unless it makes sense.</p> <blockquote><p>“The <em>AC</em> lore is very complex and keeps expanding as we are creating new games. We are not retconning what we have done in the past, but we do not necessarily mention everything in every game if it doesn’t directly support the narrative we are building. In our timeline Japan wasn’t unified yet, and not mentioning Shao Jun and her apprentice doesn’t mean that they couldn’t have co-existed.</p> <p>“Similar to this, the fact that there is no Isu artifact in the main game of <em>Shadows</em> doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist in the world of <em>Shadows</em>; it just wasn’t a story device that we needed for the story we wanted to tell.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>More Story Updates Will Be Added To <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></strong></h2> <p>One last answer about <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> and its narrative. This time, someone asked about whether any new story updates or additional expansions will be forthcoming. Simon, associate game director on <em>Shadows</em>, replied:</p> <blockquote><p>“We are hard at work [on] more free story drops that will come in the future – nothing we can announce yet though! We’ll let you sink your teeth into the<em> Claws of Awaji</em> [expansion] first, and you tell us if you want more!”</p></blockquote> <figure id="attachment_2000001632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001632"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001632">Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>Making Yasuke Or Naoe Your In-Game Companion</strong></h2> <p>One really interesting question that resulted in an equally interesting response was about Ubisoft adding a feature to <em>Shadows</em> that would let players call the other main character as a companion.<em> AC Shadows</em> live producer André said that the feature would be “cool” but admitted that its unlikely to happen because it would involve a lot of work.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“That would be a cool feature for sure!! We would love to do this also but at the moment it is not in development but I can tell you we have discussed about this internally but a lot of technicalities as to be overcome so we can’t deliver such a feature.”</p> <p>“For example, the quality of our main character is so high we would need to spawn them in a much lower quality to not explode the memory. Another element would be to develop an AI for them that is fitting with our balancing. No technical problems can’t be overcome, but it would require a lot of effort. More than we are willing to spend on this feature without compromising every other features our players are waiting for. In short, it is not planned at the moment. If it changes, we will let you know.”</p></blockquote> <h2><b>Changing Seasons From <em>Shadows</em> Will Likely Show Up In Future <em>AC</em> Games</b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">One of the coolest parts of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> is how, over time, the seasons change across the map. This affects not only the look of the world, but also how you explore it. For example, it can make rivers freeze up and offer new paths to the player. It’s a nifty feature, and when asked if it will be included in future <em>AC</em> games, André implied that the tech will be shared with other Ubisoft teams and that he wouldn’t be surprised to see seasons in a future installment.</p> <blockquote><p>“I’m super happy to see you enjoyed that improvement in our world-building. We can’t promise anything for the future <em>Assassin’s Creed,</em> but what I can tell you is that our development team is sharing the tech and knowledge for future installments, so they can decide if they want to integrate the dynamic seasons. Developing those seasons required a lot of effort to put together, so every game will need decide if it’s important enough to invest all the time needed to deliver it compared to other features. I can tell you that internally everyone finds it amazing, also, so I would not be surprised to see it again in the future!”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Social Stealth Could Return In The Franchise</strong></h2> <p>Speaking of features that could return, someone asked why social stealth was missing from <em>Shadows</em> after playing such a big role in <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">2023’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a>. And Ubisoft confirmed that hiding in crowds and on benches is still a part of the series.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“For <em>Shadows</em>, our stealth team chose to put 100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience, which left no space for Social Stealth… That does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, though!”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong><em>Mirage’s</em> Parkour Helped Improve Naoe’s Moves In <em>Shadows</em></strong></h2> <p>When a player asked if <em>Mirage</em> had an impact on <em>Shadows</em>, specifically the game’s parkour, André admitted that due to how buildings are built in Japan and the team’s desire to keep the action grounded, they rebuilt parkour and didn’t reuse <em>Mirage</em> star Basim’s move set. That said, the parkour in <em>Mirage</em> did affect the post-launch updates that improved and expanded Naoe’s move set. Here’s part of André’s answer:</p> <blockquote><p>“The <em>Mirage</em> team’s dedication to parkour is what inspired us to do more post-launch parkour updates, and we use a lot of their work as stepping stones for Naoe’s improvements in post-launch and to involve some experts from the community in those discussions.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>No Discovery mode coming&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Some bad news: There won’t be a non-combat-focused educational mode added to <em>Shadows</em> as we have seen in past games like <em>Valhalla</em> and <em>Origins</em>. With André delivering the disappointing news bluntly: “But to get to the core of your question, we do not currently have a ‘Japan Discovery Tour’ like we had for ‘Viking Age’ in the works.”</p> <h2><strong>Also, No New Hair Options Are Being Added In Any Updates</strong></h2> <p>And some more bad news: Ubisoft doesn’t plan on adding new hair customization options for either of the main characters in <em>Shadows</em>. Here’s André’s transparent answer to someone asking about more hair choices:</p> <blockquote><p>“We will not add more different type of hair for our character because, to be blunt, it is extremely costly. The complexity is to have the physic works appropriately in all scenarios we have.”</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-online-trailer-players-growth-release-date-2000616669">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</a> feels very confident that <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368">Grand Theft Auto 6</a></em> will launch on schedule in May 2026. Of course, this isn’t the first time he’s said he’s confident in the game releasing on time.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://youtu.be/XC5BVh0IaOg?t=269">in a new interview with <em>CNBC</em></a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>GameSpot</em></a>, the head of Rockstar Games’ parent company was asked about<em> Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, the hype around the game, and, of course, whether it will launch on time. Specifically, the host asked Zelnick what his “level of conviction” was that <em>GTA 6</em> would launch on May 26, 2026. Zelnick replied that his “level of conviction is very, very high, obviously.” The host then asked about high expectations for the game and how Rockstar and Take-Two are dealing with that.</p> <p>“We try not to pump expectations, right?” said Zelnick. “I think Rockstar’s whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still to beat them. I know that’s their goal. I know it’s going to be an amazing game. The rest we’ll see in the fullness of time.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Take-Two Interactive CEO on Q2 earnings, gamer growth and GTA 6" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XC5BVh0IaOg?start=269&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Some online took this as gospel that <em>GTA 6</em> won’t be delayed again. But the reality is that while Zelnick is aware of the game’s development status, what he says publicly is never going to be a completely transparent answer. He also isn’t a game developer, and making games is hard. Landing a release date is challenging, even when not working on a massive game like <em>GTA 6</em>. And Zelnick has been wrong before.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">In February</a>, he told <em>IGN</em> that while there’s always a “risk” of a game being delayed, he still felt “really good about” it launching as planned in 2025. Less than two months later, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> was delayed until May 2026</a>.</p> <p>I don’t think Zelnick is lying or trying to deceive. But as the head of a large, publicly traded company, he has to exude confidence about the future. Everything is going great, until it’s not. Personally, I’m convinced<em> GTA 6</em> won’t be delayed again. But I also have no idea. The only people who really might have that information are the folks working on <em>GTA 6</em> right now, and even they probably can’t be sure whether it will or won’t nail its date. Games are messy things to create and often come together at the very end. So don’t put much stock into what the suit-wearing number cruncher at the top thinks will happen.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, set in sunny Vice City</a>, will (probably) launch on May 26, 2026 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>
