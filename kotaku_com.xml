              <p>Health tracking usually means strapping a bulky smartwatch onto your wrist and then remembering to charge it every few days. The <strong>Oura Ring 4 takes a completely different approach by putting comprehensive health monitoring into a sleek ring</strong> that disappears on your finger. You forget you’re wearing it within minutes which can’t be said about even the smallest smartwatches on the market.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/">all colors and sizes to $249 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>, and marks a record low that makes this discreet fitness tracker genuinely accessible. The<strong> 29% discount applies across silver, black, gold, and stealth</strong> finishes in every ring size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Finger-Based Sensors</h2>
<p>The position of a ring on your finger gives<strong> cleaner biometric signals</strong> than is possible with wrist-based devices. The arteries in your fingers sit closer to the surface, with less interference from tendons, bones, and movement artifacts. This placement captures heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen levels with improved accuracy compared to the traditional fitness trackers.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep tracking represents the Oura Ring’s greatest strength</strong>: an analysis of your rest in granular detail that actually displays patterns invisible to casual observation. It tracks the stages of sleep, movement, temperature variation, and calculates sleep efficiency scores. When you wake up, you get a detailed picture of how well you actually slept, rather than how many hours you spent in bed.</p>



<p>It takes a variety of health metrics and puts them into one daily number that shows if your body is ready for intense activity, or if you need to recover. <strong>Sleep quality, heart rate variability, body temperature, and recent activity levels</strong> are factored in to give an estimate. A high score would suggest that you can push hard in workouts, while lower scores recommend taking it easy.</p>
<p>Temperature tracking reveals small variations in your body’s baseline that are indicative of various states of health. It is used by women for cycle tracking, where body temperature changes predictably across menstrual phases. The ring spots illness before you feel any symptoms, often showing a rise in temperature a day or two before the worst cold symptoms set in.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches about a week on a single charge,</strong> and dramatically outlasts smartwatches that need daily charging. The wireless charger tops up the ring in about an hour, and you’re even able to charge while working at your desk. That extended runtime means you capture sleep data every night without needing to charge before bed.</p>
<p><strong>Activity tracking counts steps, active calories, and movement</strong> throughout the day. It doesn’t require workout logging, as the ring automatically detects activities and categorizes them accordingly. Heart rate monitoring during exercise shows intensity levels and recovery patterns. The main focus remains on daily activity rather than detailed workout metrics which suits users who want health insights without obsessive exercise tracking.</p>
<p>The <strong>Oura app presents all this data in clean visualizations</strong>, highlighting trends and actionable insights. Daily scores for sleep, readiness, and activity provide easy status checks without the need to deep-dive into charts. The app can identify patterns across weeks and months, showing how changes to lifestyle decisions impact health metrics. Personalized recommendations based on your own data help one improve scores rather than just broad, generic advice. The cost for the subscription model, after the first month is free, is $5.99 a month, which grants access to full features and historical data.</p>
<p>At $249, you’re getting premium health tracking in a form factor that traditional fitness trackers can’t match. Apple Watch and Fitbit devices cost similar amounts, but require wrist real estate and daily charging. This Black Friday pricing opens up the Oura Ring to users who want in-depth health data without the commitment to the wrist.</p>

              <p>Mini PCs pack full desktop functionality into compact cases that disappear behind monitors or tuck into tight spaces where traditional towers won’t fit. The Mac Mini made this form factor popular, but Apple charges premium prices that put compact computing out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Kamrui GK3 Plus</strong> provides a similar set of everyday capabilities at a fraction of the cost and performs well at web browsing, office work, streaming and even light photo editing. Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the 16GB/512GB model to $189 for Black Friday, and applying the 10% promo code gets it down to $170 from the usual $229</a>&nbsp;which is a record low that makes desktop computing absurdly affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intel N95 Processor Handles Daily Tasks With Ease</h2>
<p>The 12th generation <strong>Intel Alder Lake N95 processor</strong> runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz and boosts up to 3.4GHz when tasks require extra power. Four cores take care of multitasking scenarios like running a browser with multiple tabs while streaming music and working in documents. This chip delivers 35% better CPU performance and 78% improved graphics compared to older N100 and N5105 processors found in competing budget mini PCs.</p>
<p>The integrated Intel UHD Graphics runs 4K video playback, casual photo editing and general desktop work with ease. You will not be editing 4K video timelines or playing demanding games, but everyday computing feels responsive and capable. The graphics output supports three displays simultaneously through dual HDMI ports and a VGA connection.</p>



<p>This 16GB of DDR4 RAM is enough to supply modern computing without slowdowns that plague systems with less capacity. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple applications side by side, and jump between tasks without waiting for content to reload. This amount of memory matches what many premium laptops include and is well above what budget systems often offer. You notice the difference immediately in daily use, where 8GB systems start to struggle with basic multitasking.</p>
<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD stores your operating system and files on fast solid-state storage. Boot times measure in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch quickly without the delays hard drives cause. <strong>Storage expands through an additional 2.5-inch drive bay that accepts SSDs up to 2TB</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s compact,<strong> measuring only 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.96 inches</strong> and it is small enough to mount behind a monitor via an included VESA bracket. This mounting option creates a pseudo all-in-one setup that keeps your desk clean and hides the computer from view. The size makes it perfect for entertainment centers where it connects to TVs for streaming without the bulk of a traditional PC. You escape the limited app selection of smart TVs by running a full Windows installation with access to any streaming service or application.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes Gigabit Ethernet for fast wired networking and dual-band WiFi for wireless flexibility. Bluetooth 4.2 interfaces connect wireless peripherals like keyboards, mice, and headphones. The port selection has USB connections for external devices and storage in addition to the video outputs. This connectivity handles typical home and office setups without requiring adapters or hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Windows is ready to go, right out of the box</strong>.</p>
<p>At $170 with the promo code, you’re getting a complete desktop computer with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD for less than most people spend on accessories. Performance won’t be of the same caliber as Apple Silicon, but general computing tasks run smoothly without the premium price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has dominated portable gaming with the Switch 2, but Sony finally offers a compelling alternative for PlayStation owners who want their games on the go. The company built an empire around the PS5 as a living room powerhouse and the <strong>PS Portal extends that experience beyond the couch and into your hands</strong>.</p>
<p>This device <strong>streams your entire PS5 library to a beautiful 8-inch screen</strong>, and lets you play God of War or Spider-Man anywhere in your home or via cloud gaming on the move. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">dropped it to $179 for Black Friday, down from $199</a>. That’s a record low, one which already moved over 8,000 units and counting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>PS5 Games to Your Hands</h2>
<p>The <strong>full HD 1080p display stretches across 8 inches of screen</strong> real estate, creating an immersive portable gaming experience. You see game details clearly with vibrant colors and sharp text, making even busy action sequences easy to keep track of. Screen brightness handles a wide range of lighting conditions, from dimly lit bedrooms to bright living rooms.</p>
<p>The<strong> 60fps capability</strong> ensures smooth gameplay that matches what you experience on your TV. Frame rates stay locked during intense action sequences, maintaining the responsive feel that PS5 games deliver on the console itself. The visual quality impresses given the streaming nature of the device, with minimal compression artifacts during stable WiFi connections.</p>



<p><em>Remote Play</em> <strong>connects directly to your PS5 console over WiFi</strong>, and streams games installed on your system to the portable device. You play your whole digital and disc library without buying games a second time or waiting for separate downloads. The PS5 does all the processing while the Portal displays the video output and transmits your controller inputs back. The upside of this is that you get complete PS5 graphics instead of downgraded portable versions.</p>
<p>The <strong>cloud streaming through Playstation Plus Premium</strong> unlocks gaming without needing your PS5 powered on: you access hundreds of titles from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog streamed directly to the device. Select PS5 games from your digital library stream sans downloads, affording instant access to big titles wherever decent internet is found.</p>



<p>The<strong> features of the DualSense controller integrate</strong> directly into the Portal’s design: haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are built into the grips. You feel immersive sensations, from terrain textures to weapon recoil, the same as the standard PS5 controller. A familiar button layout means PlayStation players don’t need an adjustment period. The ergonomic design spreads the weight comfortably during long play sessions.</p>
<p>Tempest 3D AudioTech provides for spatial sound through the headphone jack or wirelessly via Playstation Link compatible devices. You really hear enemies coming from specific directions and environmental audio placed precisely in three-dimensional space. This audio quality adds a layer of immersion that most portable gaming devices lack. The experience approaches what you’d get through a proper home theater setup, compressed into a personal audio bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches several hours</strong> of continuous play and sees you through extended gaming sessions without the need for a charge. USB-C charging makes use of standard cables you already own, ensuring that topping up from portable batteries or wall chargers is a breeze. The device goes into sleep mode fast when you pause a game to conserve battery life for when you return.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting a premium portable streaming device with DualSense features and an 8-inch display for 10% off. The Switch 2 costs significantly more while running native games at lower graphical fidelity than streamed PS5 titles.</p>

              <p>Amazon loves to push its own brands during Black Friday, and the Echo Dot always gets the deepest cuts. By selling these smart speakers at razor-thin margins-or even at a loss-Amazons ensures Alexa finds her way into as many American homes as possible. The strategy works brilliantly for the company, but it also gives shoppers some incredible deals. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">newest Echo Dot now drops from $49 to just $31</a> which is a record low price found only on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Best Sounding Echo Dot Ever Made</h2>
<p>Amazon says this is the <strong>best-sounding Echo Dot they’ve ever made</strong>, and the difference is actually appreciable: clearer vocals, deeper bass, and altogether punchier sound well above its weight class. Music fills a bedroom or office surprisingly well for something this small. Previous Echo Dot generations sounded thin and tinny in comparison. The audio upgrade alone justifies replacing older models you might have scattered around the house.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration</strong> makes this speaker a genuinely useful daily assistant: ask for the weather while you get dressed, set timers while you cook, or get quick answers to random questions throughout the day. The voice recognition works reliably from across the room, even with music playing. You can even tap the top to snooze your morning alarm when you need a few extra minutes.</p>
<p>Music streaming connects to all of the services you probably already use. <strong>Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, among others, all work seamlessly through voice commands</strong>. Bluetooth connectivity lets you stream from any device when you want manual control. You can fill your entire home with synchronized music by pairing multiple Echo devices in different rooms. The ecosystem grows naturally as you add more speakers over time.</p>
<p>Smart home control makes the Echo Dot a<strong> central hub for any connected device</strong>: lights, thermostats, plugs, and many more accessories follow your every simple command. With its built-in motion sensor, routines can be automatically invoked as soon as you turn up in a room. The indoor temperature sensor allows you to create comfort-based automation, where you start the fan once it gets too hot.</p>



<p>Privacy controls certainly help mitigate these concerns about always-listening devices. The dedicated microphone off button physically disconnects the mics when you need guaranteed privacy. Amazon has built layers of protection into the system, stating explicitly that they do not sell your personal information. You can review and delete voice recordings at any time through the Alexa app, a big improvement over previous models in terms of data transparency.</p>
<p>Pairing options extend the functionality well beyond basic speaker duties. Pair with Fire TV devices for a home theater-like audio experience, link with compatible Eero mesh systems to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout the house, and create speaker groups that play synchronized audio across multiple rooms. The Echo Dot works great on its own but really shines as part of a larger system.</p>
<p>At $31, the Echo Dot introduces smart home capability for a near-disposable price. In one small package, you’re getting better audio quality, Alexa integration, smart home control, and integrated sensors. This Black Friday deal brings the newest model to its lowest recorded price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-woke-up-and-chose-chaos-now-selling-the-galaxy-buds-3-pro-for-mere-pennies-2000646333</link>

              <p>Apple’s AirPods Pro have dominated the premium earbud conversation for years, but Samsung finally built a serious challenger. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro pack AI-powered noise cancellation, adaptive sound optimization, and a completely redesigned fit</strong> into a sleek package. The kicker is the price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">At $159 instead of $249 on Amazon, these earbuds now cost almost half what Apple charges for the AirPods Pro</a>. This Black Friday deal exists only on Amazon since Samsung isn’t running this discount on its own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Powered Audio That Learns How You Listen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro put AI right inside your ears</strong>, exactly where it needs to be, in ways that matter most. Adaptive Equalizer in Samsung’s earbuds analyzes the shape of your ear canal and adjusts the audio output for the best sound delivery. What you get is a kind of personalized listening that automatically improves from how the earbuds are fitted in your ears. You don’t have to fiddle with EQ settings or guess which preset sounds best as the AI does everything for you and gets it just right.</p>



<p><strong>Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation</strong> is another strong suit for Galaxy AI. It continuously monitors your environment and adjusts the cancellation intensity in real time. Louder subway noise will trigger maximum blocking, while a quiet office gets lighter treatment. The transition happens seamlessly without any need for you to manually change it. You can stay immersed in your music while remaining aware of important sounds with ease.</p>
<p>The redesigned fit addresses one of the biggest complaints about previous Galaxy Buds generations: Samsung <strong>reworked the shape and materials for long-lasting comfort</strong> during extended listening sessions. The earbuds stay secure during workouts and commutes without creating pressure points. You can wear them for hours without that fatigue from cheaper earbuds.</p>



<p>Sound quality is top-notch and delivers on the promise of this premium tier. Rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs seamlessly come together in immersive audio across each genre. The dual drivers take everything from podcasts to orchestral music with amazing accuracy. Supporting spatial audio adds three-dimensional depth to compatible content. Movies and games feel more immersive when the sounds seem to be coming from every direction.</p>
<p><strong>Touch controls are responsive</strong> and allow you to customize actions to your liking. Tap or swipe to pause playback, skip tracks, adjust volume, take calls, and more. You can program different gestures on each earbud to make the most of the functionality. Controls reliably work, even when you are working out and your fingers are a bit sweaty. Voice assistants are just one tap away if you need hands-free assistance.</p>
<p>Battery life keeps the music going through long days without anxiety.: The earbuds give you hours of playback with ANC enabled, and the case offers multiple additional charges. Quick charging gets you back to listening fast when you’re running low. Wireless charging support means that you can drop the case onto any compatible pad. USB-C handles wired charging when you need it.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro go for $159 and offers flagship features at a mid-segment price tag. You’re getting AI-powered ANC, adaptive sound optimization, premium comfort, and striking design all rolled into one. This Black Friday deal on Amazon saves you $90 off regular pricing, but more importantly, cuts the AirPods Pro by a significant margin.</p>

              <p>Amazon started <em>Black Friday Week</em> off with a bang on Thursday by knocking the AirPods 4 with ANC down from its usual $179 to $109. Shoppers jumped on it immediately, but Amazon decided to go even harder on Friday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">Now the price is at an unbelievable $99 (44% off)</a>, a record low for earbuds that are barely into their first year. The standard <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">AirPods 4 without ANC also hit a new low at $79, down from $129</a>. Neither of these deals exists on Apple’s website because it will not run Black Friday promotions. Amazon clearly has different plans.</p>

<h2>Premium ANC Earbuds Finally at an Accessible Price</h2>
<p>Until Apple figured it out, active noise cancellation seemed impossible on open-ear earbuds with the H2 chip. The <strong>ANC model of AirPods 4 blocks out the ambient noise without the sealed feeling of traditional in-ear designs</strong>. Airplane engines, office chatter, and street noise fade into the background so you can focus on your music or calls. The technology adapts continuously to your environment, adjusting cancellation levels in real time.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode flips the script</strong> when you need to hear your surroundings. A quick press lets in ambient sound so you can have a conversation or listen for announcements without removing the earbuds. The transition between ANC and Transparency is genuinely instant and seamless. It’s this flexibility that makes the AirPods 4 truly useful for everyday life, rather than just an isolated listening session.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Audio goes even further:</strong> it automatically blends noise cancellation and transparency, depending on your environment. Walk down a busy street, and it ramps up awareness of your surroundings. Sit at your desk, and stronger noise cancellation kicks in to help you focus. In essence, the earbuds read the room and adapt-without any input from you. It feels almost magical once you experience how seamlessly it works.</p>
<p>With <strong>Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, an immersive three-dimensional soundstage is built around your uniquely shaped ears. Technology utilizes the TrueDepth camera on your iPhone to scan your ears and optimize audio delivery. Movies and music acquire depth and dimension that standard stereo simply cannot match. It feels like the sounds are around you, not inside of your head. Immersive audio will enormously improve the gaming and video content.</p>



<p>All these advanced features are powered by the <strong>H2 chip</strong>, and it does so with great battery efficiency. You get up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case, ample for a week of commutes and workouts. The earbuds themselves will last around 6 hours on a single charge with ANC turned on. When you’re in a real hurry, a quick 5-minute charge gives you about an hour of playback.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort remains a strong suit for the open-ear design</strong> that Apple has refined generation after generation. The earbuds sit securely without creating pressure or fatigue during extended listening sessions. No silicone tips means no irritation in the ear canal, no plugged-up feeling. And most people can wear them hours on end without discomfort. The fit works for workouts, commutes, and everything in between.</p>
<p>For $99, the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC deliver flagship audio features at a mid-range price point. You are getting active noise cancelation, adaptive audio, spatial audio, and the H2 chip in comfortable open-ear earbuds.</p>
