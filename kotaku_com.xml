              <p>Even Black Friday and Cyber Week deals tend to give the greatest discounts to the one-gen-behind tech devices while keeping the markdowns on the newest releases far more modest. And when a brand-new device does get a big splashy deal, it’s almost always shortlived.</p>
<p>Yet here we are nearly a week after Black Friday, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">one of Apple’s newest smartwatches is still sitting under $200 at Amazon</a>. That’s the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3, which is still $50 below its usual price despite being barely three months old. There’s no catch, no hidden “refurbished” language, or anything else that would give you pause before cashing in and upgrading your exercise tracking, sleep monitoring, and overall smartwatch game for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Upgrade or Starter</h2>
<p>At $200 and with the sturdy construction that Apple puts into all of its smartwatches, the Apple Watch SE 3 is in a unique position where it can be either an upgraded watch for someone with an older model, or an ideal first smartwatch for a younger user. The Apple Watch For Your Kids feature is easily set up on the SE 3, and it lets the wearer call, text, and share their location even if they don’t have an iPhone. They’ll benefit from the all-day 18-hour battery life and rapid recharging just as much as adult wearers, if not more.</p>
<p>As an upgrade on an older smartwatch, the SE 3 brings a wide array of advanced features, most notably in the health and sleep monitoring and tracking departments. The SE 3 monitors the quality and duration of your sleep and gives you an overall sleep score so you can work to maintain or improve it. The smartwatch also gives you alerts if it detects possible sleep apnea, which could give you early detection of a potentially life-threatening condition and allow you to seek treatment.</p>
<p>All of the workout tracking, activity rings, seamless sync of data with an iPhone, and other advanced features that have established the Apple Watch as one of the preeminent health-oriented smartwatches on the market, are present in the SE 3, and in their most recent and advanced forms.</p>



<h2>Easy to See</h2>
<p>The many great features and visuals of the Apple Watch SE 3 are always at the ready, thanks to the 1,000 nits of brightness that come from the OLED Retina display. It also now features Always-On display mode, so you can look down at any time during your workout or run and see your running pace or heart rate, or your text messages and incoming calls.</p>
<p>The 40mm GPS model of the Apple Watch SE 3 continues to defy convention during the holiday shopping season, first by getting a fat $50 price break, and now by keeping it well past Black Friday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">This 20% off deal at Amazon is still going strong, but who knows for how long?</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech Failed to Clear Racing Wheel at Black Friday, Now Liquidating Stock at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-failed-to-clear-racing-wheel-at-black-friday-now-liquidating-stock-at-record-low-2000650485</link>
            <guid>1372783</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday ended three days ago, and Black Friday seems like a long time ago but Amazon still has this bundle at its lowest price ever: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/">Logitech G923 racing wheel with pedals and the separate shifter usually costs $459, but right now it’s only $333</a>.</p>
<p>This is a g<strong>reat gift for people who love racing games</strong> or who are tired of playing Gran Turismo and Forza with a regular controller that doesn’t feel like real driving. The <em>TrueForce</em> force feedback system connects directly to game audio engines to make vibrations and resistance that match what’s happening on screen and it fixes the problem of not being able to feel what you’re seeing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How TrueForce Makes Sim Racing More Fun</h2>
<p>The<strong> G923’s force feedback technology processes game sound up to 4000 times per second</strong> to make the wheel vibrate: You can feel the texture of different road surfaces, the rumble of engine vibrations, and the effect of hitting curbs or going off-track through steering resistance that changes all the time. This is different from older force feedback systems that only reacted to directional forces like crashes or understeer as they missed the small things that make driving feel like you’re in control of the car. The dual-motor system has enough torque to make it feel like you’re steering a heavy load when you’re going fast around a corner, but it still lets you turn smoothly when you’re going slowly.</p>



<p>The <strong>wheel can turn 900 degrees</strong> which is the same amount that real car steering does which means that you are turning the wheel the same amount that you would in a real car, not making big movements. The rim is wrapped in real leather for grip and durability that lasts through long marathon races and the hand-stitching gives it a high-end look that cheap rubber or synthetic materials can’t match. Steel paddle shifters behind the wheel make a satisfying click when you change gears. They are also in a place where your fingers naturally rest while racing. The steel shaft that runs through the center of the wheel hides the force feedback motors which makes a strong connection that sends feedback exactly without any dead zones or flex.</p>
<p>The <strong>pedal set has a progressive brake spring</strong> that makes it harder to push down on the brake pedal, just like real hydraulic brakes that need more pressure to stop faster. This progressive resistance makes it easier to control how hard you brake, which is very important when you want to brake as late as possible without locking the wheels. The throttle and clutch pedals have lighter springs to make them easier to use, and all three pedals have rubber faces with texture that keep your feet from slipping when you drive aggressively.</p>



<p>The <strong>separate shifter makes the experience go from good to great</strong> by giving you a real H-pattern with six speeds and reverse: You can put the shifter exactly where it feels right for you in relation to your wheel and seat because it mounts separately with a desk clamp or screws. The metal shaft and gear mechanism make mechanical clicks and resistance that feel good to use. The whole thing is strong enough to handle rough shifting during competitive racing.</p>
<p>You can <strong>use this with PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Mac</strong> so you don’t have to stick with one platform if you upgrade your hardware or switch between systems. The wheel connects to your computer or console through USB and gets its power from them and you don’t need any extra power supplies or complicated setup beyond putting it on your desk.</p>
<p>This $126 off the bundle is a big savings compared to buying the wheel and shifter separately, where you’d usually pay full price for each part. For less than the cost of the wheel alone at regular price, you get professional-grade sim racing hardware that real racers use in competitive leagues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 2025 B-Series Soundbar Is Now Cheaper Than Budget Earbuds as It Still Holds Its Black Friday Low Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-b-series-soundbar-2025-black-friday-low-cheaper-than-budget-earbuds-2000650185</link>
            <guid>1372777</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your TV’s internal speakers don’t offer an immersive sound experience and you’re done rewinding content just to hear what was said, it’s high time you invest in a solid soundbar. The best options out there push audio that surrounds you, plus offer multiple listening modes for different needs, and now is a great time to nab one without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/">The latest Samsung B-Series soundbar, which comes with a built-in subwoofer, is currently down to just $100 at Amazon, after a nice 29% discount.</a> You’re saving a nice $40 on it, and it’s also the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while. Pick yours up fast, because such discounts don’t last forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>This compact soundbar sits nicely on the console of your TV and is minimal enough to blend into any entertainment setup. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can mount it on the wall just as well. It connects to your display (or other devices) using Bluetooth, so there are no cables or complicated steps to worry about. Once connected, it pushes bold, room-filling sound that surrounds you. It won’t feel like the audio is just being blasted from the speaker, but instead, coming from all corners and every direction. The included subwoofer takes care of the bass, bringing action-packed scenes and even your favorite tunes to life. Watching a classic action movie? You’ll feel like the fights are happening right there in your living room. Planning a horror show night? Be ready for footsteps creeping up from behind, and don’t blame us if the entire thing feels a lot more spookier!</p>
<p>Dialogues get a boost, too. It does a good job of picking up on everything that’s being said, from screams in the Real Housewives to subtle whispers in the Stranger Things. You won’t have to rewind a scene repeatedly anymore. Moreover, sound doesn’t distort at higher levels, which is great for when you’re using the soundbar to vibe to your favorite songs. There’s also a Do Not Disturb mode built right in, which automatically reduces the volume. This is one ideal for those late-night streaming sessions where you don’t want to wake the entire house up.</p>



<p>Setting things up is straightforward, and managing everything is even simpler. The soundbar can be used with your Samsung TV remote, letting you adjust power, volume, and sound effects easily. To get started, put the soundbar in the pairing mode using the input button on it. Then, turn your TV on and head to Settings &gt; Sound &gt; Sound Output &gt; Bluetooth Speaker List. Look for your soundbar in the list, and press Pair and Connect. It should be ready to use within a few minutes! All in all, if you’ve been wanting to grab a solid Bluetooth soundbar to enjoy better sound during your favorite movies and series but couldn’t pick one up during Black Friday, now is a good time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/">This option would normally run you around $140, but you can grab it for just $100 today</a>. You’ll also enjoy free delivery with your purchase. Just note that it’s selling out fast, so the discount, as well as the stock, won’t be around for long. Snap it up quick, because once the deal is gone, it might not come back anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[DJI Clears Out Its Mic Mini Combo at 50% Off, Even Cheaper Than Black Friday and Cyber Monday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-mic-mini-combo-50-off-cheaper-than-black-friday-2000650220</link>
            <guid>1372732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="129" data-end="916">If you’re creating content for TikTok or Instagram Reels, there’s one small tweak you can add to your workflow that will dramatically elevate your results: get a microphone. Seriously. Many creators overlook how crucial solid audio is. Whether you’re shooting laid-back vlogs from your couch or doing those man-on-the-street style interviews, viewers will pick up on your sound quality. They might not consciously notice it, but something about your video will just feel a bit lackluster. In most cases, it’s the audio. Fix that immediately with a high-quality lavalier mic that’s currently discounted. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">At the moment, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is 50% off, cutting the price from $119 to just $59. Personally, saving $60 sounds pretty great to me.</a></p>
<p data-start="918" data-end="1144">These wireless mics are low-profile yet don’t compromise on performance. They’re ultralight, weighing only 10 grams. They stay discreet and look clean on camera, plus they’re simple to get working and comfortable to wear.</p>
<p data-start="1146" data-end="1306">Each microphone can deliver crisp audio to the receiver at a maximum transmission distance of up to 400 meters. That’s a quarter mile range.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1146" data-end="1306">Powerful Noise Cancelling</h2>
<p data-start="1308" data-end="1749">The DJI Mic Minis are excellent for recording in energetic outdoor settings like crowded conventions or busy streets. This is thanks to their pro-level noise cancellation. You can choose between two intensity modes. Basic works well for quiet indoor spaces, while the strong mode is ideal for loud outdoor areas. They can also automatically limit audio levels when sound gets too loud. This prevents clipping and can be a huge help once you begin editing.</p>
<p data-start="1308" data-end="1749">Switching up these settings is simple enough. Just tap the power button to enable or disable noise cancellation. In order to swap between the two modes of Strong or Basic can be done using the DJI Mimo app (supported on iPhone and Android).</p>
<p data-start="1751" data-end="1905">The DJI Mic Minis integrate seamlessly with your wider DJI OsmoAudio setup. You can pair them with an Osmo Action 5 Pro without even needing the receiver.</p>


<p data-start="1907" data-end="2139">Each transmitter and receiver has a long-lasting battery so you can film all day if needed. The DJI Mic Minis provide up to 10 hours of operation on a single charge, making them great for livestreams or long interviews. If your content only has one speaker, then you effectively have 20 hours of operation since you can always swap to the other. Heck, you can get even more than that since realistically you can start charging your first after it dies while using the second.</p>
<p data-start="1907" data-end="2139">As an additional add-on, you can pick up the DJI Mic Mini charging case. This can house both transmitters and the receiver, providing you with up to 48 hours of operation.</p>
<p data-start="2141" data-end="2261" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">Right now, you can grab this bundle with two DJI Mic Mini microphones and the DJI receiver for only $59, saving you $60.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-jbl-go-4-tiny-bluetooth-speaker-leftover-cyber-monday-stock-goes-to-record-low-2000650147</link>
            <guid>1372723</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kept some Cyber Monday deals running on select items including this JBL Go 4 that punches way above its weight class in the sound department. The speaker <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/">is currently down to $39 from its regular $49 price, which is an all-time low</a> that makes it an easy pick for personal use or as a <strong>holiday gift at a reasonable budget</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How JBL Made a Small Package Sound Big</h2>
<p>The sound engineering that went into this small speaker is all about<strong> getting bass response that usually needs much bigger drivers and enclosures</strong>. JBL tuned the parts inside to make what they call <em>“punchy bass”</em> which means that you can feel the low-end frequencies instead of just hearing the tinny mids and highs. A single driver and passive radiators in the speaker boost the bass without needing extra power or space. This means you get fuller sound from something that weighs less than half a pound. The JBL Go 4 is great for times when you want to hear real music instead of the thin, high-pitched sound that most ultra-portable speakers make.</p>



<p>With moderate volumes,<strong> the battery lasts up to seven hours of continuous playback</strong>&nbsp;which is enough for most day trips or outdoor activities without having to find an outlet. The <em>Playtime Boost</em> feature adds two more hours by changing the audio processing to use less power. However, you will lose some volume and bass depth in exchange for longer battery life. This is helpful when you’re at the beach or camping and remember you forgot to charge it the night before and it gives you enough power to keep the music going until sunset.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP67 certification</strong> means that the speaker can stay submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and is also completely dustproof. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the tap, use it in the shower, or leave it by the pool without worrying about splashes ruining the electronics. The tough outside is made of recycled plastic and has a fabric grille that protects the driver while letting sound through clearly. This environmentally friendly construction doesn’t make the speakers less durable; the materials can handle drops and bumps that would break less sturdy speakers.</p>



<p>With the $10 off, this speaker is now cheap enough that you might buy it on a whim instead of thinking about it first. For less than the price of good wired headphones, you get IP67 protection, surprisingly strong bass, and a battery that lasts all day. JBL built their name on providing high-quality sound at reasonable prices. This is the lowest price ever for a portable speaker that doesn’t sound like a toy and it’s easy to grab one and try it out for yourself.</p>
