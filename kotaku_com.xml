While <em>Mario Kart World</em> isn’t coming out the gate with the 96 courses its predecessor received over the course of the decade, <strong>it still features a standard roster of 30 courses</strong>. This is <em>almost </em>on par with most <em>Mario Kart </em>games, though <em>Mario Kart World</em> will repeat two courses throughout the Gran Prix mode to make up the difference.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Of course, that doesn’t quite tell the whole story. <em>Mario Kart World </em>also features an interconnected world, featuring over 100 “intermission tracks” that you’ll drive on between tracks. There are also collectibles and optional challenges to complete in each stage if you explore them in the Free Roam mode, so it’s not exactly like the <em>Mario Kart </em>games that came before. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-closed-circuit-play-vs-time-trial-1851785731&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-closed-circuit-play-vs-time-trial-1851785731">Every <em>Mario Kart World</em> Track Has A Closed-Circuit Version, But It’s Not Easy To Play Them</a></span></p><p>One thing we can compare, though, is that <strong><em>Mario Kart World </em>doesn’t differentiate between new and returning courses the way past <em>Mario Kart </em>games did</strong>. New and retro courses are instead interspersed between all eight cups, and the returning locales often have new elements that differentiate them from their original counterparts.</p><p>If you’d like to take a gander at the full course list yourself, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-kart-best-stats-weight-vehicle-1851785613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-kart-best-stats-weight-vehicle-1851785613">as well as which racer’s stats are most conducive to winning each track</a></span>, here’s every standard cup in <em>Mario Kart World.</em></p><figure id="" data-id="706d0bc907c8abf26d23433cdab52240" data-recommend-id="image://706d0bc907c8abf26d23433cdab52240" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Mario Kart World.

That said, the last lap is <em>always </em>the most important in <em>Mario Kart </em>due to how items can disrupt the race. These characters should let you finish each race strong, regardless of the intermission track you take to get there.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-kart-best-stats-weight-vehicle-1851785613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-kart-best-stats-weight-vehicle-1851785613">Your Kart’s Stats Are As Important As Ever In <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span></p><p>Do keep in mind that, since these times are based on the time trial environment, these racers may not necessarily be the “best” when contending with fierce racers online. You may need to play racers with higher acceleration to contend with the barrage of items you’ll have to endure, but these are solid choices to start.</p><h2 id="h1620"><a id="1"></a>Mushroom Cup</h2><p><strong>Mario Bros. Circuit: </strong>Ultra-lightweight characters like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-baby-outfits-mario-peach-rosalina-luig-1851785553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-baby-outfits-mario-peach-rosalina-luig-1851785553"><strong>Baby Daisy</strong></a></span><strong> </strong>fare well here, particularly on lightweight bikes.</p><p><strong>Crown City: Wario</strong>’s heavy stats kill it here; the top runners for this track favor the Hot Rod kart.</p><p><strong>Whistlestop Summit: </strong>Super lightweights like <strong>Baby Daisy </strong>perform well here, once again with a preference towards bikes.</p><p><strong>DK Spaceport: Wario </strong>once again dominates, especially paired with balanced karts like the B Dasher. That said, shoutout to the current 5th place record holder for using Wiggler.</p><hr><h2 id="h1621"><a id="2"></a>Flower Cup</h2><p><strong>Desert Hills: Bowser</strong>’s super heavy stats dominate here. The Reel Racer will help you contend with the sandy terrain.</p><p><strong>Shy Guy Bazaar: </strong>Lightweights reign supreme through these winding tight corridors, with most record holders opting for <strong>Baby Mario</strong>. The Baby Blooper kart is popular here.</p><p><strong>Wario Stadium: </strong>Another showcase for lightweight characters, with <strong>Baby Daisy </strong>being the popular pick here. That said, the Reel Racer is currently a popular pick here too.</p><p><strong>Airship Fortress: </strong>Not to sound like a broken record, but lightweight characters once again win out here. <strong>Baby Mario </strong>dominates on bikes like the Mach Rocket, though Goomba is a surprisingly competitive pick here too.</p><hr><h2 id="h1622"><a id="3"></a>Star Cup</h2><p><strong>DK Pass: </strong>Super lightweights once again reign supreme here, but interesting enough, the dominant character here is <strong>Para-Biddybud</strong>. Baby Daisy also works here, and bikes like the R.O.B H.O.G fare well on these snowy peaks.</p><p><strong>Starview Pea: </strong>It’s another peak, but a different optimal character. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552"><strong>Bowser</strong></a></span><strong> </strong>on the Reel Racer occupies nearly every fastest time recorded here.</p><p><strong>Sky-High Sundae: Wario </strong>is your go-to if you’re doing laps around these treats. The Baby Blooper vehicle is most popular here.</p><p><strong>Wario Shipyard: </strong>Despite the aquatic terrain, <strong>Bowser </strong>on the Reel Racer is the popular choice here once again.</p><h2 id="h1623"><a id="4"></a>Shell Cup</h2><p><strong>Koopa Troopa Beach: </strong>Koopa Troopa Beach? More like King Koopa Troopa Beach, because <strong>Bowser </strong>holds all the fastest times here. Interestingly enough, trucks like the Chargin’ Truck perform well.</p><p><strong>Faraway Oasis: </strong>Funny enough, this course doesn’t have a clear “best” combo. The current record holder uses <strong>Penguin </strong>atop the W-Twin Chopper bike, but Bowser, Mario, and even Birdo are all used in close runner-up rankings.</p><p><strong>Crown City: </strong>Yes, this is the second time Crown City has appeared in a cup. To refresh your memory, <strong>Wario</strong> in the Hot Rod is the top pick.</p><p><strong>Peach Stadium: </strong>Current record holders predominately use <strong>Wiggler</strong>, typically paired with the Big Horn truck.</p><hr><h2 id="h1624"><a id=""></a></h2><h2 id="h1625"><a id="5"></a>Banana Cup</h2><p><strong>Peach Beach: </strong>Peach Beach, similar to the Koopa Troopa Beach, favors <strong>Bowser</strong>. However, the popular vehicle of choice is the Reel Racer.</p><p><strong>Salty Salty Speedway: </strong>There’s no clear dominant character, as Wiggler, Wario, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-npc-spike-swoop-dolphin-peepa-pianta-1851785560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-npc-spike-swoop-dolphin-peepa-pianta-1851785560">even Pianta</a></span> have achieved top times here. However, all of them have used the Reel Racer to get there.</p><p><strong>Dino Dino Jungle: </strong>Now please hold your excitement, because I know how widely beloved this racer is, but <strong>Cow </strong>is the top pick for this course. What’s more, the best racers use the Li’l Dumpy truck here too. There couldn’t be a more deserving combo to succeed.</p><p><strong>Great ? Block Ruins: </strong>As you might expect from a track with so many tight corners, the super lightweights reign supreme. The likes of Para-Biddybud and Baby Daisy have achieved the fastest times, all while using relatively balanced bikes like the R.O.B H.O.G.</p><hr><h2 id="h1626"><a id="6"></a>Leaf Cup</h2><p><strong>Cheep Cheep Falls; </strong>It’s lightweight time again, except we’re not going for the lightest of the light characters this time around. <strong>Nabbit </strong>currently rules the falls while using the Reel Racer.</p><p><strong>Dandelion Depths: </strong>The heavyweights will plunge you furthest into the depths, as <strong>Wario </strong>using the Reel Racer is the dominant pick.</p><p><strong>Boo Cinema: </strong>In a huge change of pace, the best racer on Boo Cinema is none other than King-... nah I’m just playing, <strong>Wario</strong> using the Baby Blooper has all the top times here.</p><p><strong>Dry Bones Burnout: Wario </strong>and the Baby Blooper. Everywhere I go I see his face.</p><hr><h2 id="h1627"><a id="7"></a>Lightning Cup</h2><p><strong>Moo Moo Meadows: </strong>No fakeouts this time: <strong>Cow </strong>very appropriately is the top pick for Moo Moo Meadows. Surprisingly, the top vehicle choice here is the Dread Sled. I couldn’t think of a less appropriate kart to drive around a farm, let alone at top speed, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745">let’s not apply logic to the Nintendo universe</a></span>.</p><p><strong>Choco Mountain: Bowser </strong>with the Reel Racer chews through this mountain the fastest.</p><p><strong>Toad’s Factory: </strong>Interestingly, the top times for this track are a tossup between our usual heavyweight champions: <strong>Wario </strong>and <strong>Bowser</strong>. That said, both of them use the Baby Blooper kart.</p><p><strong>Bowser’s Castle: </strong>This fearsome fiery world is a rare track where characters of all weight classes are in close contention. <strong>Wiggler </strong>does have the top spot, though. The B Dasher vehicle is a popular choice here.</p><hr><h2 id="h1628"><a id="8"></a>How to unlock Special Cup and Rainbow Road</h2><figure id="" data-id="c6532faba4da4d4aa894811ec57cd96e" data-recommend-id="image://c6532faba4da4d4aa894811ec57cd96e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Mario Kart World.

Getting first place in every race or playing on 150cc isn’t necessary.</p><hr><h2 id="h1629"><a id="9"></a>All courses in Special Cup</h2><p><strong>Acorn Heights: </strong>It’s another ultra lightweight extravaganza here! <strong>Swoop </strong>is interestingly the record holder, though Baby Daisy isn’t far behind. Both use the W-Twin Chopper.</p><p><strong>Mario Circuit: </strong>It’s another fan favorite’s time to shine, because <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-outfits-mario-peach-luigi-yoshi-toad-1851785556&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-outfits-mario-peach-luigi-yoshi-toad-1851785556"><strong>Toadette </strong>holds the majority of record times</a></span> for the standard Mario Circuit. The Baby Blooper appears once more as the ride of choice.</p><p><strong>Peach Stadium: </strong>Yes, Peach Stadium does indeed appear in two separate cups as well. As you’d expect, <strong>Wiggler</strong> with the Big Horn still succeeds.</p><p><strong>Rainbow Road: </strong>Last but <em>certainly </em>not least, we have the majestic rainbow road. <strong>Wiggler</strong> is the king here, either using the Billdozer or the ever reliable Reel Racer.</p><hr><p>Those are all the tracks in <em>Mario Kart World</em>!

They were nice side dishes but no grilled steak. Everyone appreciates a good potato salad or baked mac, but that’s not why they show up to the BBQ. It has been this way with Xbox for over a decade now. </p><p>There’s no shortage of great games but few are exclusive and none of them—not <em>Forza</em>, not <em>Halo</em>, not <em>Starfield</em>—have popped like the biggest exclusive blockbusters on PS5. Unable to conjure a killer app, it’s tried to buy them, starting with <em>Minecraft</em>, but the result is now that the most compelling parts of Microsoft’s portfolio are all available elsewhere.</p><p>If a family member, friend, or some stranger at GameStop asked me if they should get an Xbox, my answer would look like a spreadsheet full of if/then functions. The value proposition of Game Pass remains strong but increasingly mired in asterisks. Genre diversity abounds and there’s early console access to some of the biggest Steam hits around. There is something for everyone on Xbox if they know how, where, and when to look. My answer for whether to get a PS5 would be much simpler: <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>,<em> God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2, </em>a dozen remasters of <em>The Last Of Us</em>. </p><p>These are not the types of games everyone buys a $500 machine for, but they are definitely the types of games a particular kind of person might buy a $500 machine for. The type of person who buys relatively few games—a yearly <em>Madden</em> update and the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>—but doesn’t really discriminate between genres and has no franchise loyalty. They want the big, cinematic blockbuster with a gameplay hook just meaty enough to be fun but not so complex it starts to feel like work. These are the types of games that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often win Game of the Year at Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards</a></span>, and they just happen to be the type Sony spent the PS4 generation specializing in. </p><figure id="" data-id="23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-recommend-id="image://23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-format="png" data-width="1269" data-height="706" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Phil Spencer appears on stage at E3 2018.

A new <em>Fable</em>, first revealed before the Xbox Series X/S launched, remains a year out.</p><p>The Xbox 360 surged to prominence thanks in part to Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> and Epic Games’ <em>Gears of War</em>. Neither franchise has been the same under Microsoft’s in-house teams. That might be part of why the company keeps acquiring new ones rather than trying to build them itself. But the results have been just as uneven. “If that were the only reason for this wave of cancellations and layoffs, it would be a terrible shame, but a rational reality,” <em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote last week</a></span>. “But the darker cloud hanging over the story is that Microsoft has—consistently and repeatedly, over decades—shown it has no aptitude for running the creative industry it just bought half of.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">A year before he began laying off thousands of staff</a></span> across Xbox’s now-sprawling empire of studios and publishers, Phil Spencer suggested Xbox’s fate was set in stone. The Xbox One generation was too disastrous to recover from. Players were now locked in. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446">He called it “[the] worst generation to lose.”</a></span> That logic paved the way for Microsoft’s pivot away from hardware and toward becoming a third-party publishing platform hitched to subscription and cloud gaming. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he said in 2023.  “That’s not going to happen.” But <em>Starfield</em> wasn’t an 11/10 or even a 9/10, so we’ll never quite know. It was a convenient time for the quality of exclusives to stop mattering. </p><p>Having watched the Switch cruise to being the second best-selling console of all time purely on the back of first-party exclusives like<em> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, I’m not convinced that the games don’t matter. When Google shut down its first-party studios in 2021, the developers there asked their boss at the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961?_gl=1*1agp3y0*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5MDc4NzMkbzYyJGcxJHQxNzUxOTEyMjg2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961?_gl=1*1agp3y0*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5MDc4NzMkbzYyJGcxJHQxNzUxOTEyMjg2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">Jade Raymond</a></span>, what that meant for the rest of Stadia, the company’s cloud gaming platform. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stadia-leadership-praised-development-studios-for-great-1846281384&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-leadership-praised-development-studios-for-great-1846281384">According to sources present at the time</a></span>, she said something along the lines of “no gaming platform has ever succeed without strong first-party games.” If you build it, they might come. If you stop, they definitely won’t. </p><p>“I’m proud to introduce the creation of a brand new Microsoft studio, The Initiative, led by Darrell Gallagher, a visionary storyteller who has worked across some of the most iconic franchises for over 20 years,” Spencer said back at E3 2018. “This new Santa Monica studio is building a team of world-class talent to create groundbreaking new game experiences.” It was a play for GOTY blockbusters right in PlayStation’s first-party backyard. The Initiative would have “the resources, the platform, and the creative independence to take bigger risks and create  even bolder worlds.” Apparently the risks were too big and the worlds were taking too long. <br></p><p><em>Correction 7/7/2025 3:04 p.m.: </em>Psychonauts 2<em> came day-and-date to PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732]]></content:encoded>

I’ve only seen it offer one unconnected track at most among the listed choices. Picking Random in an online lobby <em>before</em> the recent update always resulted in a three-lap experience. After the update went live, picking Random now incorporates the chances of getting a connecting track from your current location. We don’t know what the odds are for anything, but most people are seeing the intermission tracks a lot more often.</p><p>I’m of the mindset that the function was likely bugged before. Choosing “Random” to limit the choices down to specifically closed-lap races doesn’t sound right when you think about it. This might be a case of something being fixed at the expense of being less fun. Then again, this game gives you vague settings labeled “Connected” and “Open” so who can say how the hell any of this is meant to work. <strong>For now, your safest bet for racing some simple laps online is to select an unconnected track whenever it’s a choice.</strong> If you don’t like the track or maybe don’t even get an unconnected option, go with random and pray for the best.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552">Here’s Every <em>Mario </em>Villain Outfit You Can Collect In <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span></p><p>Here’s hoping that <em>Mario Kart World</em> is updated in the future to make this easier and not more difficult…again.

Sure, before that, Duke had starred in some genuinely good games in the ‘90s, like <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>. Since then, the famous (?) character has mostly stayed dormant. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He did appear in a digital pinball table in 2023</a></span>.) But he’s finally back. Not in a new game, oh no, but instead as a sad crossover character in a free-to-play game featuring tanks. </p><p>Over the weekend, <em>World of Tanks</em> announced that Duke Nukem was going to be part of the game’s latest battle pass. They did so with a reveal trailer that harkens back to<em> Duke Nukem 3D</em>. It also features John St. John voicing Duke once more, a role he’s had since 1996. But this time, John barely sounds interested in what he’s reading. It’s the same lines again. At one point, Duke Nukem shouts “Shake it, baby!” at a tank. Mr. Nukem, are you okay? </p><p>Anyway, the new Battle Pass Special: Heroes’ Paths event starts on July 10 in <em>World of Tanks</em> and runs until July 21. Actual video game icon Lara Croft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is also part of the new pass</a></span>. Maybe one day her new game from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949">Amazon will actually launch</a></span>? </p><p>Neither character makes a physical appearance in the game, as <em>World of Tanks</em> is about giant tanks fighting each other. So don’t expect Duke Nukem running around killing pig cops. Instead, the devs have picked two real-world tanks and modified them to better reflect Duke and Lara. Here’s how the developers describe Duke’s tank:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[Duke’s tank is] the <strong>TS-6</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. A powerhouse of destruction, this tank mirrors Duke’s “all guns blazing” approach. It boasts a custom nuclear reactor, enhanced weapon systems, and aesthetic nods to Duke’s arsenal, including laser machine guns and grenade launchers. The tank’s design draws inspiration from classic Duke Nukem weapons such as the incinerator and fire extinguisher.</p></blockquote><p>No pricing information was included in the press release I received. The Heroes’ Paths battle pass is split into two chapters. One will provide 30 stages for Lara Croft, and the other will feature 40 stages for Duke Nukem. You’ll be able to unlock various cosmetics inspired by each character and their franchises. Hopefully, one of those is a good <em>Duke Nukem</em> game.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-world-of-tanks-battle-pass-lara-croft-sad-1851785719]]></content:encoded>
