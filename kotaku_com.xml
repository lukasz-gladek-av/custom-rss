            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-game-freak-switch-2-upgrade-fee-kalos-1851782651<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, the much-anticipated sequel to 2022's <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> and the first new full-scale <em>Pokémon</em> game since late 2022’s <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, finally has an official release date. It’s due to be with us on October 16, with pre-orders starting as early as June 5.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195752,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Coming to both the original Switch and the Switch 2, the new game from Game Freak will offer an upgraded version for the newer Nintendo console, which will boast a higher resolution and improved framerates. However, this will come at the cost of an upgrade fee—likely $10, based on the Japanese announcement of 1,000 yen.</p><p>  <em>Z-A</em>, set exclusively in Lumiose City within the Kalos region, is essentially a follow-up to 2013's <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Y</em>, while also the second in the <em>Legends</em> franchise. Which is to say,  it will play differently from the mainline series, especially when it comes to combat. <em>Z-A</em> will use real-time fighting between your Pokémon, rather than the traditional turn-based battles, and will include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521">Mega Evolution</a></span> as a core mechanic. It also looks unlikely to have the same open feel as <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, given the game is entirely set in one city.</p><p>In Lumoise City, Pokémon co-exist with humans, rather than being considered pets/captives. The city—originally based on Paris—is undergoing urban redevelopment by a company called Quasartico, which appears to be a pivotal aspect of the as-yet undetailed story. What we do know, however, is that play will be split into day and night. During the day, you’ll explore, chat with the locals, and progress through the story. During the night, the local Wild Zones become Battle Zones, where you take part in the Z-A Battle, attempting to climb your way up through the ranks from, well, Z to A. Here you’ll battle other trainers in real-time combat with your current collection of Poké pals.</p><p>If you’re not planning to upgrade your Switch just yet, don’t worry. <em>Z-A</em> seems to have been primarily developed for the original hybrid console, with the Switch 2 upgraded version tweaking things to run more smoothly with the extra horsepower. We don’t have prices yet, although given pre-ordering starts as soon as next week, we don’t have long to wait. $60 for the Switch version and $70 for the Switch 2 seems extremely likely, however.</p><p>It’s interesting that <em>Z-A</em> is releasing in the slot we’d usually expect to see a new mainline game in the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise. It likely speaks well of Game Freak, which was clearly overworked in its efforts to release two full-size games in 2022—hopefully the developers will be&nbsp;given more time and space to work on these projects from here on out.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here at <em>Kotaku</em>, I’ve been recapping each episode of the show, and I have not been having a good time. Frankly, I find it to be a mostly irredeemable attempt at adapting the narrative of the PS4 game. But what about the rest of the internet? Surely not everyone is as disappointed as I am and plenty of them enjoyed the show, right? Well, yeah. But they’re not quite as loud as the folks who weren’t thrilled with the finale and season at large.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197576" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="PlayStation’s Days of Play Brings Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, NBA 2K25 &amp; More To PS Plus" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197576,197567,197565" data-current="197576"><div><p>PlayStation’s Days of Play Brings Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, NBA 2K25 &amp; More To PS Plus</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23099.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>To start on a positive note, despite fans being divided over Bella Ramsey’s performance as Ellie, with some criticizing it for its more immature approach to the character compared to Ashley Johnson’s in the game, several fans sang their praises of Ramsey’s work in the finale. Personally, I appreciated that the show pulled off Ellie’s disillusionment with the people of Jackson despite what I felt was poor writing, and Ramsey’s execution of this tension finally boiling over received some praise.</p><p>However, with the show reaching one of its most climactic moments in the finale, many game fans are growing increasingly frustrated with the embellishments HBO has made. Some take issue with how certain characters’ personalities have been altered, like Jesse being an asshole instead of the golden retriever we once knew, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-kaitlyn-dever-buff-ripped-gym-1851754822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-kaitlyn-dever-buff-ripped-gym-1851754822">Abby lacking the muscle</a></span> that once signified her obsession with killing her father’s murderer. Despite some praise for Ramsey’s performance, many longtime fans remain critical of Ellie’s newfound sadism and how she seems far less confident than her game counterpart. This is on top of weeks of criticism from fans who think that Ellie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-dina-ellie-romance-sex-scene-pregnant-episode-4-1851779166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-dina-ellie-romance-sex-scene-pregnant-episode-4-1851779166">feels infantilized</a></span> in the show, especially when compared to her girlfriend Dina, who is carrying the angry, vengeful torch in her stead.</p><p>Character traits are one deviation from the source material fans are up in arms about, but perhaps the most controversial change in the finale involves the death of Mel. As in the game Ellie kills Mel, one of Abby’s friends who was with her on the expedition to kill Joel, but unlike in the game, here it’s an accident. Ellie fires a bullet at Mel‘s partner Owen and she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the shot goes right through him and into her. In the source material, this is one of the most impactful moments of Ellie’s revenge tour, as it also results in the death of Mel’s unborn child, making Ellie confront just how much collateral damage she’s caused in her myopic need for vengeance. Fans argue that by making this kill an accident, the show is undermining Ellie’s story which originally showed her undergoing a deliberate descent into violent rage, and instead lets her off the hook by shifting the blame.</p><p>Not everyone hates the change, though. Again, Ramsey’s skill at communicating Ellie’s devastation has received praise, and some view it as a moment of the character’s true compassion coming out.</p><p>A lot of this discourse can arguably be chalked up to “Game fans are just precious about the original scenes.” Some might believe the show should be judged on its own merits rather than compared to the game it’s adapting, but many, myself included, feel that even on its own terms, the show is a mess of tonal contradictions and confused characterization. To me, examining it through the lens of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiT2VFyOr-A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiT2VFyOr-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s attempts to further capitalize on the series, even to the detriment of its story and integrity,</a></span> is the only way that it’s even interesting to talk about. If you take those elements away from the discussion, in my opinion the show is just bad in a boring way, with amateurish writing and inconsistent performances. </p><p>A lot of those problems are rooted in what seems to be an attempt to sanitize the original text and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">avoid controversy</a></span>. However, the show’s inconsistent writing makes it feel like mash-up of competing stories in which Ellie’s motivations swap at the drop of a hat, which is frustrating to follow even without the context of playing the games. It’s easy to handwave criticisms as game fans simply not liking changes from the beloved source material, and if someone’s critique starts and ends with “the show is different than the games,” that’s not in and of itself making a qualitative point, it’s merely an observation. But as much as some people on both sides want to reduce the argument to dismissive extremes, the truth of the discussion exists somewhere in the middle, and right now it feels like some diehard game fans and show newcomers are ready to dismiss each other’s claims and praise on principle without hearing each other out. </p><p>Personally, I’ve found the show rewarding as a game fan because it’s been interesting to unpack <em>why</em> I think these changes are problems, rather than just being upset that it’s not recreating the game beat for beat. A lot of the show’s embellishments have felt like change for change’s sake. The <em>Last of Us </em>games felt very intentional in the story they wanted to tell, so taking a wrecking ball to so many characters and moments has made the show feel like a much less confident and coherent text. I don’t think it can be salvaged after this, but we’ll see if season three, which will primarily star Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, can turn things around.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
