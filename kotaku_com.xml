              <p><em>Avowed</em> was quietly <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">one of 2025’s best RPGs</a>. In fact, it even made <em>Kotaku</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161">best games of the year list</a>. But it was also one of the few remaining Microsoft games that was still exclusive to Xbox Series X/S. That changes next month. Obsidian Entertainment confirmed the <em>Skyrim</em>-like will hit PlayStation 5 on February 17 alongside a big anniversary update across all platforms.</p> <p>Despite bringing <em>Forza Horizon</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> to PS5 in 2025, <em>Avowed</em> remained an unusual island of exclusivity amid Microsoft’s new multiplatform push. It’ll now join Obsidian Entertainment’s other 2025 RPG, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, on Sony’s platform where millions more players will get a chance to try it. Here’s the developer interview from the New Game+ Showcase where the port was announced:</p>

  <p>Obsidian also revealed what the game’s next big update will entail. In addition to a photo mode and new game plus mode, players will also get access to new character races, including dwarves, and an additional weapon type. New game plus mode, meanwhile, will reset players’ level back to one but let them keep all of their gear from the previous playthrough as well as explore new enemy modifiers. The new races were the real heavy lift, however.</p>

It's a lot of work and a">“It’s a lot of work and a difficult thing to really nail down, especially in <em>Avowed</em> with its parkour systems and its combat mechanics and all the weapon types and stuff like that in the game,” Dimitri Berman said in the interview. “Our different races are different sizes, they’re different shapes, they’re a very unique game experience when you play as each one of them in a first-person game specifically. So it was something new to wrangle for <em>Avowed</em>.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="2 minutes, 15 seconds games had.

The first of those is also currently getting a major update to add a turn-based mode. We’ll see if Obsidian plans to make an eventual <em>Pillars 3</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-eternity-3-turn-based-mode-update-avowed-crpg-2000640875">that merges the best parts of both series</a>.</p>
