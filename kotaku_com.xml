              <p>Having an external SSD on hand to back up important documents or photos is a good idea. With the possibilities of theft or hacking, you can never be too careful. That is why companies such as <em>SanDisk</em> remain a top choice when it comes to reliable storage devices.</p>
<p>If you need an external SSD with excellent performance, the 1TB storage capacity places itself in the sweet spot for most users. And thanks to Amazon’s Back to School sale, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3731/">you can now grab the SanDisk 1TB Extreme Portable SSD at an all-time low of about $99 (down from $129)</a>. Larger models such as the 2TB and 4TB also receive price cuts in the neighborhood of 25/35%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3731/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High Speed Storage</h2>
<p>The SanDisk 1TB SSD <strong>boasts up to 1050MB/s read speeds and write speeds that are only a hair behind, at around 1000MB/s</strong>. That kind of speed is ideal for quick transfer of big files. With USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface via USB-C, you can plug this drive directly into newer laptops or even certain tablets and smartphones with ease. The speedy data transfer rate means less waiting about so you can get on with what matters.</p>
<p>This drive carries an IP65 rating so it’s <strong>water and dustproof</strong> to a reasonable extent. That gives you extra confidence if you’re carrying it around in a backpack or briefcase. It may become splashed or dusty but that will not prevent your data from remaining secure. It is also lightweight, measuring approximately 4 inches long and half an inch thick so it will not occupy much space when traveling.</p>



<p>The drive<strong> features 256-bit AES encryption</strong> with password protection which is easily manageable with free SanDisk software. It keeps your files locked down to unauthorized access even if your drive for some reason gets misplaced. All you need to keep in mind is that this security feature functions optimally with Windows and macOS; some phones might not support it totally.</p>
<p>It supports a wide range of operating systems, including Windows 10 and newer, macOS 10.13+, and plenty of USB Type-C capable devices. And in addition, the drive is powered by the bus, which means you won’t need an extra power cable — all you do is plug into the USB port and you’re ready to roll.</p>
<p>The construction is solid without being blocky and <strong>SanDisk offers a five-year limited warranty</strong>. That provides some added peace of mind if you’re planning on relying on this drive as your workday driver, school driver, or personal project driver. Speed, reliability, and resilience all coexist in neat package form in a easily pocketed or bagged form.</p>
<p>Don’t miss your chance to get it here:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo Laptop (12GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Office 365) Is 85% Off, Amazon Clears Inventory for Summer’s End]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-laptop-12gb-ram-512gb-ssd-office-365-is-85-off-amazon-clears-inventory-for-summers-end-2000620309</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-laptop-12gb-ram-512gb-ssd-office-365-is-85-off-amazon-clears-inventory-for-summer%E2%80%99s-end.1280595/</guid>

              <p>With Amazon’s <em>Back to School</em> discounts currently in full swing, there’s one notebook that looks almost too good to be true: the <strong>2025</strong> <strong>Lenovo IdeaPad 15.6″</strong> with a solid mid-range spec (12GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Celeron N4500, Office 365 for one year, Windows 11 Home) for a record low price. Amazon is likely clearing out old inventory, likely without making a single penny in profit, and that makes you the beneficiary of a deal that’s too great to pass up.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3723/">computer usually costs around $2,400 but today Amazon reduced its price to as low as $349</a>: That’s an 85% discount, and<strong> you’ll be saving around two thousand dollars on a brand-new computer</strong>. You’re spending less than most individuals spend on a smartphone at this price point, but you’re receiving a full Windows computer bundled with a one-year subscription of Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3723/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Student Laptop</h2>
<p>Specs do matter, even in a budget-friendly machine, and this Lenovo is far from stripped down: It’s <strong>powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor.</strong> Although it’s not for serious gaming, it’s perfectly suited to day-to-day productivity tasks such as word processing, spreadsheets and streaming television shows. The inclusion of 12GB of DDR4 RAM is a difference-maker: multitasking is so much more responsive than the 4GB or 8GB of memory you typically find in this price category.</p>
<p>A fast <strong>512GB PCIe SSD</strong> gives you speed and space which means Windows boots in a flash, programs load in a flash and still having space for a large collection of school work, work documents, or entertainment media. In addition to the SSD, there’s also a <strong>secondary 128GB eMMC</strong> that gives you additional space to work with light files or backups.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD display features anti-glare coating so your eyes don’t get as tired during extended study sessions. Paired with Dolby Audio dual speakers, you’ll enjoy more immersion when streaming or Zoom calls. You even receive a built-in HD 720p camera with a privacy shutter which is surprisingly rare on laptops in this price range.</p>
<p>Connectivity is also a plus point: <strong>USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, an SD card reader, and an audio combo jack</strong> are all present and give you all the ports you’ll need to have accessories and external storage easily attached. <strong>Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2</strong> are integrated within so wireless speed and dependability are on tap for both online classes and easy Netflix streaming.</p>
<p>Discounts this intense rarely stick, and since Amazon is clearly liquidating excess stock, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-bose-tv-soundbar-is-40-off-at-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-for-labor-day-2000620323</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-bose-tv-soundbar-is-40-off-at-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-for-labor-day.1280550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Soundbars are one of those products that tend to feel too expensive. Most models easily surpass the $500 threshold and even then the sound doesn’t always quite live up to expectations. That’s why Bose has built a lot of trust in this space: the company is able to get people affordable gear with an emphasis on immersive audio.</p>
<p>Right now, their popular Bose TV Speaker is available on Amazon at a price that’s actually a record-breaking one: The current <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">deal is bringing this model down from $279 to about $163 which is a 41% discount</a> and the cheapest it has ever been according to <em>CamelCamelCamel</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Soundbar and TV Speaker</h2>
<p>At slightly over 23 inches wide and just over 2 inches tall, this Bose soundbar is a compact addition that can sit in front of your TV without blocking the screen,or be mounted on a wall if you prefer a streamlined setup. Inside its compact body, it houses two angled full-range drivers that create a wider and more enveloping soundstage than the usual built-in TV speakers can offer.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever struggled to hear mumbling actors or drowned-out lines during action scenes, this speaker directly addresses that with specialized tuning. With the remote supplied, you can go even further and allow dialogue mode, cutting through words spoken even more sharply without boosting everything else. You also get a bass boost button thrown in for a little more low-end oomph when you need it.</p>



<p>Connectivity is simple, you’ll love it: You can pair it with your TV using an optical cable (included in the box) or an HDMI-ARC connection if your TV supports it. Set-up is just minutes without having to wrestle with complicated menus. Then there’s the Bose TV speaker having Bluetooth integrated so you can pair your phone or tablet to stream music and podcasts directly without needing to go near the TV. Three units are provided to be connected through optical, HDMI, and AUX inputs and the system auto-connects to the very first powered-on source.</p>
<p>For $163, this Bose soundbar provides anyone with an easy way to greatly improve TV. That’s why tracking Amazon sales is well worth it—because when something sets an all-time low price, it’s the perfect time to buy.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Shows a “Hidden Price” on These Headphones Since Sony Refused to Let It Sell Them This Cheap]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-shows-a-hidden-price-on-these-headphones-since-sony-refused-to-let-it-sell-them-this-cheap-2000620298</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-shows-a-%E2%80%9Chidden-price%E2%80%9D-on-these-headphones-since-sony-refused-to-let-it-sell-them-this-cheap.1280514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony and Amazon aren’t necessarily in sync when it comes to opinion on prices, and if they’re not, Amazon can’t officially display the discounted price to you upfront. What you’ll see instead is an enigmatic <em>“hidden price”</em> tag and you only get to know the bottom line after placing the product in your shopping cart. That’s exactly what is currently happening with the <strong>Sony WH-CH520 headphones</strong>.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3721/">they’re $38 rather than the normal $69, which is a respectable 46% discount</a>. This is one of Amazon’s <em>Labor Day</em> deals and it’s an easy win if you’re looking for a good pair of wireless headphones without shelling out top dollar. Yes, these are not the costly Sony WH-1000XM6 (that cost you ten times this amount) but for everyday listening, they have a lot of quality to make a jump at this price cut worthwhile.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3721/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cheap and Good Headphones</h2>
<p>Why these headphones are worth considering, apart from the discount, is their balance of features for the average listener: One of the first things I noticed about it is <strong>the battery life: 50 hours on one charge</strong>. That’s long enough to get through a whole week’s worth of commutes without even thinking about where to locate a charger. And if you must refuel, a quick charge option <strong>gives up to 90 minutes of playback from a 3-minute boost</strong>.</p>
<p>The sound itself is a bonus, too: The WH-CH520 has access to the Sony Headphones Connect App where<strong> you can play around with the EQ</strong> to your preference. More bass on dance tracks? You can tweak it with ease. Sony even throws in its <em>DSEE</em> technology which is meant to enhance compressed sound files from streaming services.</p>



<p>Comfort is just as essential as sound, and <strong>Sony has used light construction with swiveling earcups</strong> that are easy to wear and quick to remove between calls or tunes. The adjustable headband is also designed to make long listening sessions comfortable without that “ear fatigue” that cheaper headphones offer. Available in six colors including black, blue, white, pink, yellow and cappuccino (all are on sale at Amazon), these earphones also give you a bit of style choice rather than one appearance.</p>
<p>It’s worth circling back to the real hook here: the price. At $38, you’re getting a well-rounded Sony audio product for a bargain that felt unthinkable just a few years ago. Even with stronger competition in the headphone market, it’s rare to see this level of reliability and battery life paired with Sony’s audio heritage at such a budget-friendly cost.&nbsp;At this price, there’s every reason to grab a pair before Amazon’s “hidden price” disappears from view.</p>

<p>I love shooting things. In video games–not real life, I mean guns can be good fun, but I’ve got this whole cross-dominant right-hand/left eye thing that’s, whatever, not what you’re here for! You’re here because you like shooting things in video games as much as I do, and, lucky for us, Steam is running its “TPS Fest,” which has a ton of third-person shooters up for sale, so it’s a perfect time to snag something you’ve been putting off for some time, or grab a recent hit.</p> <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/action_tps">sale event runs from now until September 1</a>, so you have a week to figure out if any of the games strike your fancy. But there are a lot of games on sale, so what should you get? How about we break it down by price category?</p> <h2><span id="control,-max-payne,-the-division-2,-and-other-cool-shooters-under-10-bucks"></span><i>Control</i>, <i>Max Payne</i>, <i>The Division 2,</i> and other cool shooters under 10 bucks<span></span></h2> <p>You’re practically losing money if you don’t snag at least one of these. To start, Remedy’s incredible 2019 shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/870780/Control_Ultimate_Edition/"><i>Control</i> is available for $3.99</a>–and that’s with <i>all</i> of the DLC. But if you’re looking for something with multiplayer, maybe snag <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/"><i>The Division 2</i></a> for six bucks; the Gold Edition and Ultimate Editions, while not under 10 dollars, are also on sale too.</p>

 <p>Each of the games in the <i>Max Payne</i> trilogy is under 10 bucks individually; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12140/Max_Payne/">the first</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12150/Max_Payne_2_The_Fall_of_Max_Payne/">second</a> games are expected to get remakes soon. And while <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/204100/Max_Payne_3/">the third game</a> wasn’t made by Remedy, it’s still a fantastic third-person shooter that’s a steal for a mere six bucks.</p> <p>There’s another bunch of throwbacks I want to highlight if you haven’t played them: the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/667720/Red_Faction_Guerrilla_ReMarstered/">2018 remaster of <i>Red Faction Guerilla</i></a> is also a smashing good time (literally, as there’s an incredible variety of destructible environments you can smash) and only costs four dollars. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/460810/Vanquish/"><i>Vanquish</i></a> is also available for just six bucks. It’s a speedy, high-octane shooter developed by Platinum Games during the Xbox 360 era that you owe it to yourself to check out if you haven’t played. Oh, and Shinji Mikami (<i>Resident Evil</i>, <i>Dino Crisis</i>, <i>The Evil Within</i>) directed it, in case you didn’t know. If you want another offbeat third-person shooter from the era, you can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/203750/Binary_Domain?snr=1_49_4_actiontps_100722">grab <i>Binary Domain</i> for three dollars.</a></p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-enhanced-mod-pc-steam-deck-2000616399">This Incredible <i>Splinter Cell </i>Mod Offers The Definitive Experience Of A Stealth Classic</a></p>

 <p>If you haven’t already, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13560/Tom_Clancys_Splinter_Cell/">snag the first <i>Splinter Cell</i></a> for just $2.50, and then <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-enhanced-mod-pc-steam-deck-2000616399">download this awesome mod</a> I talked about a few weeks ago. It rocks.</p> <p>And if you want another retro throwback, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/11550/Second_Sight/">GameCube cult classic <i>Second Sight</i></a> is also a mere $2.50 right now.</p> <h2><span id="the-last-of-us-part-i,-uncharted,-remnant-ii,-and-other-games-under-30-bucks"></span><i>The Last of Us Part I</i>, <i>Uncharted</i>, <i>Remnant II</i>, and other games under 30 bucks<span></span></h2> <p>I may always think the story in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/"><i>The Last of Us</i></a> ain’t worth nearly the amount of digital ink spilled over it, but it sure as hell is an awesome stealthy, survival-themed shooter. You can grab that one right now for 30 bucks. And if you’re really on a Sony kick, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/"><i>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</i> is just 20 bucks</a>, which includes <i>Uncharted 4</i> and its spin-off, standalone expansion.</p>

 <p>It’s been a while since I’ve jumped into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/REMNANT_II/"><i>Remnant II</i></a>, but if you’re up for a pretty sweet cooperative, souls-like shooter, it’s just 20 bucks right now.</p> <p>And if you’re tired of doing all your shooting on the ground, might I recommend checking out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128920/EVERSPACE_2/"><i>Everspace 2</i> for 15 dollars</a>?</p> <p>Also, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1007040/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_5/"><i>Earth Defense Force 5</i> is just $14.99</a>. Why don’t <i>you</i>, yes you, own it already?</p> <h2><span id="solid-discounts-on-some-other-recent-shooters"></span>Solid discounts on some other recent shooters<span></span></h2> <p>Earlier this year, I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2169200/Sniper_Elite_Resistance/"><i>Sniper Elite: Resistance</i></a> is as both a stealth sim and a test of your accuracy. It’s just $37.49 right now.</p>

 <p>And remember how I said <i>TLOU</i> is an awesome third-person shooter (that might be a touch too dramatic for its own good)? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/"><i>TLOU2</i> is on sale for $40 right now</a> and features even <i>better</i> gameplay than the first one.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>Lastly, if you haven’t yet grabbed a copy of last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></a>, it’s on sale right now for $31.</p> <p>Anyway, that wraps up what caught my eye during this sale event, but there’s so, so much more.</p>
