Itch.io quietly updated its list of banned content over the weekend with the following section on adult games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks. We are unable to support the sale of any works containing these topics:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li><li>Underage or “barely legal” themes</li><li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li><li>Bestiality or animal-related</li><li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li><li>Sex trafficking implications</li><li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li><li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., “scat,” “vomit”)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Developers can appeal individual bans, but with thousands of listings removed and someone needing to actually play each individual title to adjudicate claims, that process seems all but unworkable in the short term. “It’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time,” Itchi.io writes on the site. “If an issue arises with your account that isn’t already covered by our policy, then we will contact you and share what options you may have.”<br></p><p>While Steam has also banned hundreds of games revolving around rape or incest in response to pressure from Visa, Mastercard, and other payment processors.

According to its creator, it includes the option for incestual relationships between characters but doesn’t not demand it. It remains available on Steam but was one of those games purged from Itch.io last week. </p><p>“This completely destroys me—so many games published with love on this platform, and now they won’t reach anyone new,” wrote<em> Love’s Heart</em> creator Capky Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a blog post</a></span> last week. “I don’t have an audience elsewhere; I depend on itch.io to grow.

This is the dangerous Ash Clan, who are led by Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, and who use fire as their main weapon.

As such, I chose to focus on the Longsword skill tree due to its strong potential for stunning enemies and dealing reasonably fast damage compared to heavier weapons you may discover in the first few areas. If you find that you prefer a different weapon a few hours into the game, rest assured there are comparable skills early in their skill trees, too. </p><h2 id="h1305"><a id=""></a>Skyborn Call I</h2><p>Skyborn Call I is the node located directly to the left of Illusive, which is unlocked by default. </p><p>This skill will increase your maximum Skyborn Might charges by one. Since Skyborn Might is among the most important parts of your kit, you’ll want to grab this one as soon as possible. With more Skyborn Might at your disposal, you can use magic more often (as well as wield stronger spells) or unleash multiple powerful melee skills in a row.</p><h2 id="h1306"><a id=""></a>Manna Capacity &amp; Manna Potency</h2><p>Manna Capacity and Manna Potency nodes are located directly above and below Skyborn Call I, respectively. </p><p>These skills do exactly what you’d expect: increase your Manna Vase’s number of uses and healing power. But they don’t require Red Mercury Essence to purchase. Instead, you’ll need special items found while exploring: Forgotten Remembrance and Lost Remains. You can find quite a few of these throughout your adventure, but I pointed out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-skills-birds-red-mercury-mana-1851787126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-skills-birds-red-mercury-mana-1851787126">two early locations in our beginning tips guide</a></span>. So, check that out if you haven’t found them yet.</p><figure id="" data-id="d8d6f11e66b6e6acbb929995123b9442" data-recommend-id="image://d8d6f11e66b6e6acbb929995123b9442" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a manna vessel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a manna vessel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d8d6f11e66b6e6acbb929995123b9442" data-recommend-id="image://d8d6f11e66b6e6acbb929995123b9442" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a manna vessel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll find multiple other Manna Capacity and Manna Potency nodes throughout the skill tree as well, each offering three tiers of upgrades (meaning three upgrades per node), so you’ll have plenty of opportunities to increase your capacity and healing power.</p><h2 id="h1307"><a id=""></a>Sword Saint</h2><p>Sword Saint is a node located in the Longsword tree located directly beneath Blink Kick.</p><p>This skill grants you a single stack of Skyborn Might after the second hit of your Longsword light attack combo. Since this combo is quick and easy to pull off, it makes for an excellent early pickup to ensure that you can keep stacks of Skyborn Might rolling in consistently. You’ll be especially happy to have this once you combine it with the skill below.</p><h2 id="h1308"><a id=""></a>Windforce</h2><p>Windforce is a node located in the Longsword tree purchaseable after buying Sword Saint and two Strength upgrades.</p><p>This skill allows you to use a charged heavy attack much more quickly if you have a stack of Skyborn Might. Thanks to Sword Saint helping you consistently build stacks alongside any you get from dodging well, you can pull off these charged heavy attacks with frequency. Doing so will let you stun enemies for critical attacks more quickly, with it being especially effective against small-to-medium-sized human foes. </p><h2 id="h1309"><a id=""></a>Strong Blade</h2><p>Strong Blade nodes are located in the Longsword tree that can be found on either side of Windforce after buying an adjacent node (either Vitality or Endurance).</p><figure id="" data-id="d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-recommend-id="image://d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-recommend-id="image://d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Regardless of which node you choose, this skill will level up the mastery of the Longsword and increase its damage. But it doesn’t require Red Mercury Essence to purchase. Instead, you’ll need Faint Red Feathers, which you’ll find by exploring thoroughly and defeating specific enemies. One example is a little creature in a jar that spits poison at you. They’re often found down optional pathways or lurking in corners among debris. </p><p>You’ll find more Strong Blade nodes throughout the skill tree as well, each offering three tiers of upgrades (meaning three upgrades per node), so you’ll get more chances to increase the damage of your weapon as you venture further into the game. As you level these higher, however, you’ll need more advanced upgrade materials (feathers). </p><hr><p><br><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series S/X, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-longsword-skills-strong-blade-windforce-1851787137]]></content:encoded>
