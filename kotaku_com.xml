This is the second time the company’s raised prices in recent years. In 2023, Netflix bumped the discontinued Basic plan from $10 to $12 and the Premium plan from $20 to $23. </p><p>Tuesday’s announcement, however, marks the first time Netflix has increased the price of the ad-supported tier since it was introduced in November 2022. The more streaming changes, the more it turns back into regular, pricey old cable TV. The price hikes come after the launch of <em>Squid Game</em> season 2 and a live boxing match between influencer Jake Paul and former heavy weight champion Mike Tyson. Season 5 of <em>Stranger Things</em>, meanwhile, is likely headed to Netflix sometime later in 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ll let you decide how romantic that last one is for yourself.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Point is, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> has many quirks for both series newbies and longtime fans to learn. And while I never felt that any of the game’s underlying mechanics were especially obtuse as a hyper-casual Musou fan, I did have to learn some basic lessons the hard way. So to help you out on your journey, here are five tips that I wish I knew when I started <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</em></p><h2 id="h708432"><a id="weapons"></a>Study your weapon’s moveset</h2><figure id="" data-id="f87798a87915ddeda07f2ac8b0e156fb" data-recommend-id="image://f87798a87915ddeda07f2ac8b0e156fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist is attacking a warrior in a snowy battleground. He is in the air spinning around with his sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve played older <em>Warriors </em>games, your muscle memory may default to the series’ classic combo system of mashing basic attacks and ending your series of blows with a unique heavy attack finisher. However, only a couple weapons really work like that here. Other weapons have unique gimmicks that radically change the way you play. You can button mash your way to victory in many battles, but you’ll leave a lot of power on the table if you don’t utilize your equipped weapon’s mechanics.</p><p>For this reason, I strongly recommend reviewing your weapon’s moveset description in your main menu throughout the gamer. You might not master each weapon immediately after trying them out, but with enough practice you can pull off some absolutely brutal combos against bosses and armies alike. You’ll also unlock new attacks as you level up your proficiency with each weapon, which can be easy to forget about as you breeze through the results screen of each battle. If you use Twin Pikes and you don’t run around flailing your pole-arms in front of you while you <em>KatamariDamacy</em> a ball of enemy soldiers in front of you, you’ve never really used Twin Pikes at all.</p><h2 id="h708433"><a id="fight"></a>Don’t bother fighting every skirmish</h2><figure id="" data-id="4cd77c2db385c2258096ae957fd69cb1" data-recommend-id="image://4cd77c2db385c2258096ae957fd69cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

These are typically short optional battles that award some extra experience points, but you shouldn’t stop and fight every Skirmish you see. These fights all respawn regularly, so you’re bound to see the same encounters pop up even after you’ve cleared them several times. You can get some nice rewards, but they primarily exist for grinding.</p><p>This isn’t to be confused with Missions, which look like Skirmishes on the map but feature an orange outline and a soldier standing atop them. These can give you valuable rewards and permanent upgrades, so they are absolutely worth completing ASAP. Also, some allies may specifically ask you to complete a battle that looks like a Skirmish on the map, which you shouldn’t ignore.</p><h2 id="h708434"><a id="allies"></a>Some allies aren’t worth saving</h2><figure id="" data-id="80023d46ce9b9a790e8e6ea0d420592c" data-recommend-id="image://80023d46ce9b9a790e8e6ea0d420592c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The main character is on a grey horse as he charges into battle alongside his army." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the throes of battle, you’ll inevitably see allied officers who ask for your assistance. They’ll immediately recover their health if you rush to them in time, and battles flow smoother the more allies you keep alive. Unfortunately, you’ll also come across instances in which an ally just isn’t worth saving, as morbid as that sounds. If an officer rushes into a huge army by himself, you’ll put the entire mission in jeopardy by rushing after him.</p><p>In battles where your allies are spread out across a huge battlefield, you can wind up doing more harm than good by wasting time rushing after everyone. In fact, sometimes the best thing you can do for your army is to conquer nearby bases and defeat enemy officers in front of you, which can raise your army’s morale and give them the strength to succeed on their own. There’s no hard science for when you should and shouldn’t play the savior, just know that sometimes the cold and calculating option is the most compassionate.</p><h2 id="h708435"><a id="upgrades"></a>Only spend money on essential weapon upgrades</h2><figure id="" data-id="5cc4a5eeb838f4dbbc8395c2f485d5bc" data-recommend-id="image://5cc4a5eeb838f4dbbc8395c2f485d5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the weapon menu in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

We’re talking upwards of 50-percent increases to your weapon’s attack stat, so how could you turn that down? </p><p>In actuality, you often don’t <em>need </em>those huge upgrades the moment you see them. You’ll typically find even better weapons as loot in combat, making those purchases largely wasteful. Even worse, money is surprisingly scarce unless you obsessively grind, so you’ll quickly run your cash reserves dry by overspending. Occasional weapon upgrades help if you’re struggling with a tough battle and you haven’t gotten lucky with your weapon drops, but otherwise you should save your money.</p><h2 id="h708436"><a id="point"></a>’Points-of-no-return’ are spelled out clearly</h2><figure id="" data-id="d023c40c6e58bab2ca2da2ca9b8a4cec" data-recommend-id="image://d023c40c6e58bab2ca2da2ca9b8a4cec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist walks up a grassy hill towards a tree with pink leaves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you progress in the main story, characters will start making a big to-do about how you’ll need to align yourself with one of the game’s three factions. You must inevitably romance one of the three kingdoms, if you will. This will come to head during Chapter Three, but even then, you’ll see a warning about any crucial decision point before it happens. Your points of no return can involve choosing which side of a battle you’ll fight for before you engage, which will break your relationship with whichever faction you oppose. In other words, it’s not going to take you by surprise.</p><p>Which allies should you align yourself with on your first playthrough? I’ll leave that decision up to you, though I will say that <strong>Sun Jian’s initial battles in chapter 3 are worth experiencing on your first run through, even if you ultimately don’t ally with them</strong>. Just know that you’ll eventually unlock the ability to check out the story paths you initially missed, so don’t stress your decisions here too much. Follow your heart, carve your own path, and enjoy stacking up a pile of a thousand enemy corpses in a matter of minutes. It’s all in good fun, I assure you. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From here, you can engage with the three factions on a freelance basis like you’re someone who writes online professionally. But unlike someone who writes online professionally, one of your employers will eventually want to hire you full time. This will lock you into a unique story path for the remainder of Chapter Three, and that will persist into chapters four and five.</p><p>Several unique stages are locked behind each branching story path. Following my first playthrough, my stats indicated that I had only completed 50% of the missions in the game. In other words, there’s a healthy amount of replay value here, which brings me to my final point.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb712e464c098f6ece23c8813466b9a3" data-recommend-id="image://eb712e464c098f6ece23c8813466b9a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The main character is holding what appears to be a polearm as rain falls upon him.</p><h2 id="h719291"><a id="postgame"></a> What’s the postgame like in <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>?</h2><p>True to series tradition, there’s a lot of game to play after you reach the first ending. You’ll surely want to see how those other story paths play out, and <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>gives you great tools to do just that. Here’s everything you’ll unlock once you start your postgame file.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>You’ll gain the ability to freely replay any battle in the game, including optional missions you might have seen and initially missed. Additionally, you can restart the game from the beginning of any chapter <em>and </em>before any battle that leads to a new story branch depending on how you complete it. Yes, there are branching paths in the branching paths!</li><li>Your level cap will get a permanent increase, adding extra levels to each weapon for you to gain.</li><li>An extra weapon type can be found in the postgame as well, which is so insanely strong that it’s worth the insane amount of cash it costs in the shop. I won’t reveal <em>exactly </em>what it is, but it’s a very fun piece of fan service.</li><li>On top of the new weapon type, a stronger grade of weapons enters the pool too. You can purchase these outright, or you can find them in basic story missions. </li><li>Also, you can upgrade your weapons! This should be familiar to <em>Warriors </em>fans, but you can use spare weapons to both pass on useful traits or bestow raw power upgrades to your favorite armament. This does cost money though, so make sure you don’t blow through your reserves right off the bat.</li><li>Finally, an all new difficulty level is unlocked in the postgame. This changes fundamental rules of the game to skew things in your foes’ favor, but your rewards after each battle will dramatically increase. Also, you’ll find new optional challenges in several battles on this difficulty that will grant powerful new equipment and items upon completion. Do note that this difficulty is <em>really </em>intended for high level players, to the point that you’ll be dramatically underleveled for it even after a full playthrough. You’ll likely need to level up by playing through the other story paths before you challenge the game on this difficulty.  </li></ol><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>could very well require a triple digit number of hours before you accomplish everything it has to offer. Do keep in mind that <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> games have a reputation for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-coming-early-next-year-1845194597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-coming-early-next-year-1845194597">re-releases</a></span> and/or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684147/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_9_Empires__Season_Pass/?curator_clanid=41525982&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684147/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_9_Empires__Season_Pass/?curator_clanid=41525982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLC</a></span>, so take that into consideration in case that affects your decision to purchase this one. But that aside, if we’re judging solely on how long a game can divert your attention away from doing your dishes, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is a solid package as-is.<br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
