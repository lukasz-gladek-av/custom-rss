            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Microsoft committed over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">$100 billion of new investment</a> toward AI. Part of that technological arms race has included training LLMs on <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/12/open-ai-microsoft-harvard-libraries-train-ai-models/">millions of books</a>, including some written 600 years ago. This year, Microsoft is paying back the favor by ditching its own employee library. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/862531/microsoft-library-closure-transition-changes-notepad"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a> that the company is closing it down and slashing news subscriptions in favor of “AI-powered learning experiences.”</p> <p>The onsite collection of books was allegedly so heavy, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200204-00/?p=103394">it once was blamed</a> for cracking the underground parking lot pillars that supported it. That library, now housed in building 92, will now be closed, according to <em>The Verge</em>. The company’s roughly 220,000 employees have also reportedly lost access to checking out digital copies of business books and accessing news publications like <em>The Information</em>.</p>

 <p>Instead of learning about the world through the considered words of other human beings, they will now be engaging with a “more modern, AI-powered learning experience through the Skilling Hub,” according to an FAQ sent to staff. “The Library closed as part of Microsoft’s move toward a more modern, connected learning experience through the Skilling Hub,” it reads. “We know this change affects a space many people valued.”</p>

 <p>Contrast that with what Microsoft recently said after it was revealed that UK police had <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/uk-police-apologise-to-parliament-after-admitting-a-major-and-controversial-policy-decision-was-based-on-ai-making-stuff-up/">relied on an AI hallucination</a> when making the controversial decision to ban fans from a certain soccer match. “Copilot combines information from multiple web sources into a single response with linked citations,” a spokesperson for the company told media outlets. “It informs users they are interacting with an AI system and encourages them to review the sources.” Remember, it’s not slop, it’s a “<a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473">bicycle for the mind</a>.”</p>

 <p>It’s unclear if Copilot will be the basis for these new “AI learning experiences” that employees are now being encouraged to utilize, or what other sources of information they will use to review them now that the library is shutting down. As the science fiction writer Ray Bradbury <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131103101724/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930312&amp;slug=1689996">once told the <em>Seattle Times</em></a> in Microsoft’s own backyard, “You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.”</p>

              <p>Anyone who has ever played&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> at any point in its 17 years of existence already has a head start when it comes to playing&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. The two games are so similar that familiarity with one mostly sets you up for the other. However, this also means it can be easier to get tripped up by the smaller details that <em>are</em> different, those aspects of the cuboid survival game that aren’t quite where you might expect them to be. So to prepare you for the transition, here are 10 things I wish I’d known before I started.</p> <hr> <h2>Don’t look for&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> on Steam</h2> <p>In a bold move, developer Hypixel has chosen not to release <em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>on Steam, nor indeed Epic or GOG. The early access game is only available to buy <a href="https://hytale.com/">via the game’s own site</a>, and then only loads through the game’s own installed loader. Why? Because of the fall of man? Or perhaps to avoid paying the 30-percent tithes? I dunno, but it’s annoying to have yet another bespoke loader to clutter up your desktop. The game’s also not yet on console, although that’s planned for the future.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Before anything else, head for the Forgotten Temple Gateway</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660212"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660212">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The smartest thing to do at the start of a new game of <em>Hytale</em> is make your way to the Forgotten Temple Gateway. This is a magic portal under a ruined temple that will teleport you to the Forgotten Temple hub, a peaceful location in which you can register all the mobs you’ve encountered so far with a central statue. (As the game develops, it’ll also be the hub for a lot of new content.) Its location is marked on your compass at the top of the screen, and it should be pretty nearby. Every creature you meet for the first time, whether hostile or ambivalent, will send a blue spark called a Memory your way. The more of these you gather, the more unlocks you’ll get via the statue, gaining access to new craftable items on your workstations.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You get sticks from trees and bushes</h2> <p>I realize, out of context, that sounds like the stupidest piece of advice ever. “What next, John? You get bear shit from woods?” But the point here is in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> sticks are crafted from wood blocks, and that’s&nbsp;<em>not</em> the case in&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. The ingredient, vital for crafting rudimentary tools, arrows and torches, instead falls when chopping down trees and whacking bushes. And they fall plentifully! However, given the speed with which crossbows go through arrows, you’re going to want stack after stack after stack of them, so get used to punching down every bush you walk past. And talking of which…</p>

 <hr> <h2>Trees are affected by gravity</h2> <p>“And Popes are affected by Catholicism?” Yes, cleverclogs, but if you’ve played&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> you’ll be familiar with the oddity that has blocks magically float in place if you remove those between them and the ground. Not so in <em>Hytale</em>, meaning chopping down trees for trunks, which are then crafted into wooden blocks, and then in turn into vast amounts of other items in the game, is a much faster affair. Chop down the very lowest bit of the trunk, and then rest of the tree will come cascading down around you in its various bits and blocks, complete with trunks, sticks, and the all-important sap which is used for crafting torches, candles and other lighting.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You’re going to need a BIG house for crafting tables</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660213"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660213">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When I built my first modest log cabin, it was with the expectation that I’d have a nice little crafting table, perhaps an anvil, and with enough room for some chests and eventually whatever&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>‘s equivalent of an enchanting table might be. Oh, poor sweet summer child that I am. I have since added two entire new&nbsp;<em>wings</em> to my home to fit in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-minecraft-hypixel-crafting-workbench-quests-2000660135">ridiculous array of different workbenches</a> you need to play the game. There are a total of eight workbenches that you’ll absolutely&nbsp;<em>need</em>, and then a further four more you can add, and most have a footprint three blocks wide and two blocks high. Why it’s like this is anyone’s guess, but plan ahead when building your starter home.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Put chests directly next to workbenches</h2> <p>One of the neatest elements of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> (and it’s somewhat damning that it’s a detail this granular) is that if you store items in a chest near to a workbench, the bench will source materials from the chests while you’re crafting. In <em>Minecraft</em> you need to have everything in your on-body inventory, which requires juggling items between chests before crafting. Here, you can keep the crafting materials you need the most often in nearby storage and do far less organizational drudgery. Those chests do need to be close, though. If they’re on the other side of the room the bench won’t recognize them.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Repair Kits let you fix tools and weapons on the fly</h2> <p><em>Hytale</em> doesn’t offer&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>‘s means of fixing a weakened weapon or tool via anvils, but instead through a bespoke Repair Kit. This is a craftable item that you can keep in your inventory, and then use to restore most of a tool’s durability while you’re out and about. This is especially helpful if your pickaxe breaks when you’re 40 blocks below ground and have lost the route you took to get down there. They don’t come cheap, however. While all you need to craft a Repair Kit is two Linen Scraps, one Light Leather, and one Iron Ingot, these are all items that you’ll only get from hard work. Leather comes from slain mobs, which must then be processed on your (very slow) Tanning Rack. Linen Scraps come from fallen enemies’ clothing. And Iron Ingots are iron you’ve put through your Furnace, and at this point are a bizarrely difficult resource to find. See the next tip for more on that.</p> <hr> <h2>Iron is hard to come by</h2> <p>You might think, given&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>‘s hierarchy of metals going Copper &gt; Iron &gt; Thorium &gt; Cobalt &gt; Adamantite &gt; Mithril, that iron would be reasonable simple to find. In&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, it’s pretty much the second ore you’ll ever find after coal, and sits pretty near the surface. Not so in&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>, where iron doesn’t start showing up until you’ve gone a&nbsp;<em>long</em> way underground, and then almost always in caverns packed with very tough enemies for such an early point in the game. I imagine this is something that will be balanced out in the near future, but for now know that you want to dig until you’re seeing lava, and then spot the silver glints in the ceiling and walls in areas that aren’t packed with foes. Grab as much as you can and get out fast.</p> <hr> <h2>You don’t drop&nbsp;<em>everything</em> when you die</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660217"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660217">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In another tweak to the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>formula, <em>Hytale</em> doesn’t strip your entire inventory when you die and respawn. Instead you keep about two-thirds of what you had when you conked it, which is pretty generous in comparison. (Only cowards play&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> with “Keep Inventory” toggled on.) The rest will drop where you died, and the game will put a death marker on the compass to direct you back there to scoop it all back up.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You can build teleporters to speed up travel</h2> <p>I wish this were possible a lot earlier, given the ordeal it is to craft. <em>Hytale</em>‘s world of Orbis is enormous, and while movement is pretty swift, if you’ve been out exploring other biomes it’ll still take you a fair amount of time to return to your current home without taking the death route. But there’s a way to make Teleporters, and leave as many as six of them in the world. (That number can reach 12 if you unlock enough Memories in the Forgotten Temple.)</p> <p>The first thing you need to do is upgrade your main workbench to level 2. That requires 20 Iron, which as mentioned above is the biggest obstacle, alongside 30 Copper (easily found everywhere) and 20 Linen Scrap (kill a bunch of humanoid enemies). That done, you can then craft the Arcanist’s Workbench, but this in turn is a hefty challenge. For this you’ll need 20 Essence of the Void (kill monsters at night for these), 30 Linen Scraps, and toughest of all, 10 Thorium Ingots. This requires you to travel to the Howling Sands biome (in what’s called Zone 2), so it’s not something you’ll be doing straight away.</p>

 <p>With&nbsp;<em>that</em> done, you then need the Teleporter ingredients too! For this you need Azure Logs, Azure Kelp and some regular stone. For that you need to find the blue Azure Forest biome and chop down some of those blue, blue trees.</p> <p>So yeah, quite the fuss. But once done, you’ve got a way to leap around Orbis like a mad wizard.</p>

              <p>Earlier this month, a group of masked thieves wearing anime backpacks and brandishing hammers and a gun ran into a New York City card shop and then smashed and grabbed over $100,000 worth of merchandise, including Pokémon cards, from the store.</p> <p><a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/pokmon-shop-robbed-100000-merchandise-armed-burglars-manhattan/18404893/">As reported by <em>ABC7</em></a>, police are currently investigating the armed robbery involving three masked individuals that took place at the Poke Court card shop in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District on January 7. An employee told the outlet that the thieves threatened everyone in the store as they smashed glass doors to access Pokémon cards and other related merch. According to the employee, the robbery happened suddenly and took only three minutes. Police arrived after someone called 911 and reported the robbery.</p>

  <p>There were around 40 customers in the store when the three armed robbers entered and started smashing up the place. They were there as part of the Poke Court’s first community event. The shop opened in November 2025.</p>

 <p>Poke Court owner Courtney Chin said that she has a detailed list of what was stolen and is hoping insurance will cover the loss. According to the owner, the store does have alarms, but she is unsure if they worked properly and plans to talk to her security company for more information. Chin is also contemplating hiring an armed guard to help protect the store.</p>

 <p>“That’s been the recommendation of the police and of other shops in the area to get an armed guard or like a doorman,” Chin told <em>ABC7.</em></p> <p>This isn’t the first armed robbery targeting Pokémon cards and merch. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666">We’ve seen many other card shops</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241">robbed by thieves</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-stolen-charizard-attack-crime-1851778231">over the last two</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-cards-theft-250-store-stolen-robbery-rare-minne-1848569785">years as Pokémon cards</a> continue to grow in value and the demand for them skyrockets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A strange countdown clock. Missing games and weird glitches on Steam. Cryptic comments from Todd Howard. The end of <em>Fallout</em> season two fast approaching. All of this is feeding into an ongoing belief among many <em>Fallout</em> fans that long-rumored remasters of <a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346"><em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em></a> are coming soon. But how much of this is true, and how much is just out-of-control hype from fans hungry for a new entry in the series?</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/a-steam-glitch-convinced-some-fallout-fans-a-new-vegas-remaster-was-imminent-only-to-have-the-rug-yanked-out-from-under-them-slowly-turning-into-r-halflife/">As reported by <em>PC Gamer</em> on January 14,</a> <em>Fallout</em> fans on Reddit noticed something odd with <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and <em>Fallout 3.</em> When trying to leave a review, Steam would block it and say the games weren’t out yet. Considering the games have been out on PC for closer to 20 years than I want to admit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1qcc9xg/both_fallout_new_vegas_and_3_are_experiencing/">this confused people</a>. It also fueled the ongoing belief that a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster, as well as a possible <em>New Vegas</em> remaster, are launching in the near future. People theorized that this was some backend snafu related to Bethesda getting ready to shadow-drop both remasters soon.</p>

 <p>And then someone noticed that if you search for <em>Fallout</em>, Steam lists 12 games, but there are actually only 10 games currently available. Curious! This further convinced a lot of people who frankly didn’t need much convincing to begin with that<em> Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vega</em>s remasters were coming in hot.</p>

 <h2>Debunking the<em> Fallout</em> remaster theories</h2> <p>But let’s slow down and throw some cold water on all of this.&nbsp; First, the issue with being unable to review games on Steam despite them already being released, while strange, isn’t related to any upcoming remaster. Instead, it was an issue that has affected various Steam games over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1qcb7ak/this_is_a_first_for_me/">past 72 hours or so, including <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>.</a> It also seems like it has been fixed. I was able to leave a review for<em> Fallout: New Vegas,</em> no problem.</p>

 <p>As for the 12 <em>Fallout</em> games listed but only 10 being actually available on Steam, this is a common quirk on Valve’s storefront and often happens as a result of various editions and versions of games being available or not available depending on your region. For example, looking up <em>Call of Duty,</em> Steam lists 25, but there are only 24 on the franchise page. So I wouldn’t read too much into this piece of evidence either.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660210">©Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, before Steam glitches and oddities got <em>Fallout</em> fans freaking out, there was all the hubbub about Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> countdown clock. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-new-vegas-remaster-3-amazon-s2-show-bethesda-announcement/">As explained by <em>Polygon</em></a>, Amazon recently activated <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">a website that features a <em>Fallout</em>-like map</a> with different locations. Clicking on them lets you explore these places via 3D and 2D tours. It’s neat, but what caught people’s attention is that one location is locked and won’t open until the season two finale of <em>Fallout</em> airs on February 4. It didn’t take long for people to connect the dots between this date and some past comments from Todd Howard explaining that Bethesda is working <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">on more <em>Fallout</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">that he thinks the shadow drop of <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>was a successful test.</a></p>

 <p>But once again, I’ve got some cold water to pour on all this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1q7ru1e/fallout_s2_interactive_website_final_location_and/">as according to one Redditor</a> who dug into the data of the Amazon site, the locked location is just the Lucky 38 Casino, and when the clock runs out, players will be able to explore it like the other spots on the map. That’s not to say that nothing else will be announced or revealed after the finale, but don’t expect that locked spot on the site to turn into a portal leading to <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em>.</p>

 <h2>All the evidence that <em>Fallout 3 </em>R<em>emastered</em> is happening</h2> <p>Okay, so is there any actual evidence of a <em>Fallout 3</em> or <em>New Vegas</em> remaster? Or is it all just fan hype and rumors? Well, there is some hard proof that at least a <em>Fallout 3 </em>remaster is in the works.</p> <p>First up, in 2023, a remastered version of Bethesda’s popular wasteland RPG was listed in a leaked court doc that got out during the <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">FTC vs Activision/Xbox hearing.</a> That doc listed other unannounced games, including <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> and a <em>Doom</em> prequel, both of which did launch, though later than planned. So it seems very likely that, yes, <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> is a thing, and it is being worked on as we speak.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fallout 3 Remaster, Ghostwire Tokyo Sequel, Dishonored 3, Oblivion Remaster, Doom Year Zero appear on a release schedule list<a href="https://t.co/xttFBM30wp">https://t.co/xttFBM30wp</a> <a href="https://t.co/A1sv7TAuL7">pic.twitter.com/A1sv7TAuL7</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1703996755560546707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette">In November 2025, <em>VGC</em> further corroborated</a> the leaked doc and confirmed it had heard that, yes, <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> was real and is currently being developed. The site didn’t share any other details, but did suggest this remastered version of the RPG will be similar to last year’s <em>Oblivion Remastered.</em> So I expect the original engine will still be running under some fancy new Unreal-powered visuals.</p>

 <p>As for a <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> remaster? Well, there’s not really much evidence for that beyond <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/fallout-3-is-getting-a-remaster-after-all-and-new-vegas-is-too-but-thats-not-what-the-tv-shows-countdown-timer-is-for">pure speculation and some supposed leakers and insiders teasing it.</a> And while I know a lot of people would love both <em>FNV</em> and <em>Fallout 3</em> to be remastered, I can’t imagine both happening at the same time and both launching on the same day. That just seems too outlandish and would have likely leaked by now, especially if it is happening sooner rather than later.</p> <p>So, that’s where we are at. <em>Fallout 3 Remastered</em> is basically a confirmed real game that is happening, but we don’t know when it will launch, though it could be this year. Meanwhile,<em> Fallout</em>: <em>New Vegas Remastered</em> is more of an internet-created rumor that could happen one day; in fact, it probably will happen, but for now, it remains a pipe dream. So in short, everybody calm down, stop checking Steam for weird bugs, and enjoy the last few episodes of <em>Fallout</em> season two.</p>

              <p><span>Even before its release in 2025,</span><i><span> Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</span></i><span> has faced controversy. The revival of the long-dormant </span><i><span>Fatal Fury</span></i><span> series came after publisher SNK was purchased by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, and it’s suffered from accusations of sportswashing ever since. Now, SNK and </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> are getting called out for releasing a trailer full of alleged AI slop.</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, SNK released a trailer for </span><i><span>Fatal Fury: CotW</span></i><span>’s upcoming second season, which launches on January 22. The trailer promises a pretty robust release schedule for the game’s anniversary with monthly character drops over a six-month period. Returning characters Kim Jae Hoon, Nightmare Geese, Blue Mary, and Wolfgang Krauser are slated to join the game’s roster, too. However, the excitement of fan-favorites returning has been almost entirely overshadowed by the game’s latest trailer incorporating apparent AI-generated clips.</span></p>

  <p><span>“I’m stepping down after this trailer, I’m thankful for what you guys did for us and all but this is too much for me to deal with, this is against what I stand for,” a moderator </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spicysauce.bsky.social/post/3mchxy2n7uc2d"><span>wrote in their parting message to the official Discord server</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s easy to see why. The AI stuff is just really, really ugly. The shots of cities feature skyscrapers with the most inconsistent windows I’ve ever seen, and something about the character introduction clips just looks…very off. (It’s almost like SNK knew the clips looked bad because half of them are overlaid with big walls of text and graffiti-like flourishes.)</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz/app.bsky.feed.post/3mchxy2n7uc2d" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiamudluymmnrigb3heteb3bgpjx2ajjvyjb5abgxtw34tfzpgipwa"> <p lang="en">i was a SNK moderator for 6 years and official Cotw Discord for a year, this trailer made me step down after all those years, i don't / i can't promote a product that i don't support,thanks for all of those years friends, it was fun 🫡 bsky.app/profile/wari…</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz?ref_src=embed">Spicy Sauce (@spicysauce.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rd6vccsc22rzvny6byc3o6yz/post/3mchxy2n7uc2d?ref_src=embed">2026-01-15T16:11:59.809Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>It also just seems wildly inconsistent with the game itself. </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> has a pretty vibrant cel-shaded art style, and the trailer’s AI shots ignore that entirely for a false sense of edginess that looks pretty corny when juxtaposed with clips of colorful, cartoonish gameplay. The studio didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>SNK was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/snk-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman-mbs-king-of-fighte-1848754233"><span>purchased by the Saudi Public Investment Fund in 2022</span></a><span>. Despite promises that the ownership change </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snk-saudi-arabias-96-ownership-doesnt-affect-us-in-any-way"><span>would have no impact</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>CotW</span></i><span> doesn’t seem to have been exempt from the effects of this. The country’s sovereign wealth fund also owns Al-Nassr FC, and its soccer star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cristiano-ronaldo-fatal-fury-city-wolves-saudi-arabia-1851772758"><span>Cristiano Ronaldo</span></a><span> was later added to <em>CotW</em> as a playable character. It’s a shame because the game itself is decent.&nbsp; It even took home the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>Best Fighting Game award</span></a><span> at this year’s Game Awards.</span></p>

 <p><span>SNK’s problematic ties to Saudi Arabia aren’t going anywhere in the future, but it could avoid making things worse by not piling gen AI junk on top of them. This also doesn’t bode well for Saudi Arabia’s other massive game purchase. It’s currently on track to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726"><span>own Electronic Arts by the end of the summer</span></a><span>. </span></p>

              <p><span>The </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> love hotel has shut down. Japanese </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> creator churip_ccc announced on X that their adults-only </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> island had been shut down by Nintendo, </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/"><span>according to a translation of the post on </span><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Actually, just a day before the update, the Dream Address for the Adult Island was deleted by Nintendo,” chrip_ccc wrote. “To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years. To everyone who visited the island, and to all the streamers who showcased it in their videos, thank you so much.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660193">© Nintendo via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX2_XeIBrEM">コアラ’s GAME SHOW on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Automaton</span></i><span> reported that the island was created just a few months after </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> was released in 2020. It was pretty popular with Japanese YouTubers and livestreamers, the publication said. It’s a high quality island; there’s a love hotel flanked by several of </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ Gallant statues—inspired by Michelangelo’s David—using neon palm trees for clever censorship. There’s a pachinko parlor and a luxury, uh, love suite with a rose-shaped bed, in-house jacuzzi, and dim lighting.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> players were able to visit the island using the Dream Island feature, which essentially made a public copy of an island. You could visit a player’s island without them being there. Alas, now it’s gone, and the adults only </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> island will live only in infamy, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX2_XeIBrEM"><span>on YouTube</span></a><span>.</span></p>
