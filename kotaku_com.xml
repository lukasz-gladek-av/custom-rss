              <p>I spent years playing games without ever thinking about the controller I was using. It was just the thing that came in the box with the system. If you wanted to play co-op, you’d buy a second. If it broke, you’d replace it. It wasn’t until the PS4 and Xbox One generation that <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-quest-to-make-a-better-video-game-controller-1818823822">it began to feel like there were options</a> and I started experimenting with alternatives.</p> <p>Now, in the summer of 2025, it feels like <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamesir-tarantula-pro-controller-pc-switch-mobile-1851754990">a new controller is getting announced every other week,</a> and the rising prices of first-party hardware, as well as, on Switch 2, the still unimpressive quality of the console’s Joy-Con, makes comparing your choices a necessity. Let’s take a quick look at some of the newest entrants into the ever-more-chaotic marketplace for third-party controllers.</p> <h2>EasySMX S10 is a cheap Switch 2 Pro alternative</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617564"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617564">EasySMX</figcaption></figure> <p>Announced back in May, the <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx-s10-gaming-controller-for-switch-2-tmr-sticks-hd-rumble-motion-control?variant=44813624246460">EasySMX S10</a> pitches itself as a budget Switch 2 Pro controller. It’ll be $60 compared to the Pro Controller’s $90 and ships before the end of August. Like Nintendo’s premium controller, it can read Amiibo and wake the console up from sleep. The big features are a 1,000Hz polling rate for minimal latency and drift-resistant TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) Hall Effect joysticks. It’ll also support backwards compatibility with Switch 1 as well as gaming on PC and mobile. It’s a decent package at a compelling price point and I like the RGB-lit white version a lot, even with the ugly branded insignia on the side. But we won’t know if it can actually deliver until the first pre-orders begin arriving later this summer.</p>

 <h2>GameSir G7 Pro offers precision with weird caveats</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617563"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617563">Gamesir</figcaption></figure> <p>Another controller sporting TMR sticks is the <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-g7-pro">GameSir G7 Pro</a>. Announced more recently, it’s an $80 mid-tier option for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Android. It sports a nice look overall and a customizable three-piece magnetic faceplate, but the real draw are the mechanical micro switches that let you fine-tune the sensitivity of the triggers. But there’s a massive downside: it only works wired on console. There’s a long USB-C cable to keep you connected but it really cuts against the power efficiency of the TMR stick if you’re always connected anyway.</p> <h3>8BitDo Pro 3 upgrades what was already great</h3> <figure id="attachment_2000617567" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617567"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617567">8BitDo</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-3">The Pro 3</a> was revealed back in July and just started shipping this week. It looks like a PlayStation DualSense but with Nintendo’s style sensibility. The newest iteration of 8BitDo’s Pro line also sports extra buttons and TMR sticks. Most importantly, there’s a 2.4G adapter this time around for lower wireless latency. But my favorite feature by far is the pair of arcade-style ball-top caps that come in the box and can be attached to the Pro 3’s joysticks. It all comes in at the decent price of $70 and supports Switch 1, Switch 2, PC, Android, and iOS.</p> <h2>Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K spares no expense on PC</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617565" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617565"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617565">Razer</figcaption></figure> <p>If the above options were all looking a bit too affordable for you, Razer has just the thing. The <a href="https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-8k-pc">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K</a> is an esports-centric upgrade to last year’s model that promises ultra-responsiveness with TMR sticks and an 8000 Hz polling speed so the controller can register inputs faster than you can even think about them. It might be overkill, especially for a wireless model that costs $200, but it essentially has all of the bells and whistles from a top gaming keyboard shoved into a gamepad. There’s also a wired version for just $120.</p>

 <h2>Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is a luxury option for console</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617568"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617568">Victrix</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S and still want to pay more than double the price of a standard controller, Turtle Beach revealed the <a href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/victrix-pro-bfg-reloaded-wireless-controller">Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded</a> earlier this month. It promises 20 hours on a full charge and an extended wireless range with the option to plug in. More importantly, in addition to all the drift-resistant jazz that’s become table stakes at this level, the Pro BFG Reloaded is aimed specifically at fighting game players, with an “ergonomically optimized” resting position if you want to treat it like a mini-arcade stick. The whole kit costs $210.</p> <h2>WX5+ Wireless RGB looks cheap but fun</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617566">WX5+</figcaption></figure> <p>Enough of these 1-percenter gamepads. Let’s get back to the economy end of things. <a href="https://www.gioteck.com/products/wx5-wireless-rgb-controller-switch-2-doodles">The WX5+ Wireless</a> is essentially an upgraded version of the WX4 for the Switch 2, though it also works on PC. The Doodle variant comes with playful colors and RGB lighting. There’s hall-effect sticks, a rechargeable battery, and a headphone jack for plugging in your headset. The real standout for the Switch 2 controller, however, is the promise of a dedicated GameChat button that will bypass a bunch of the console’s menus to take you directly to talking with friends. It’s unclear if it’s just replicating what the Switch 2 Pro Controller does or speeding it up, but it’s neat either way. If it’s anything like the WX4 it’ll do just fine, especially at the low, low price of just $35.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i> is a relaxing and unique entry in the <i>Mario </i>universe. This puzzle platformer is well worth checking out for genre fans or newcomers eager to see what all the treasure-hunting fuss is about. The game values your time while also being as quirky and adorable as you’d expect from anything featuring everyone’s favorite mushroom-headed pal. Even better, it features the option for two-player co-op, making it perfect for playing with kids or enjoying as a date-night activity.</p> <p>But whether you’re diving into this puzzle adventure alone or with a friend, you’re likely wondering how long it’ll take to beat <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i> and whether or not you’ll see any meaningful upgrades when playing on the Switch 2. Let’s take a look.</p> <h2>How does <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker </i>run on Switch 2?</h2> <p><i>Captain Toad</i> was one of several games to receive a much-appreciated <i>free</i> update to improve performance. Both portable and docked mode receive a bump up in resolution, resulting in a sharper image. There’s no improvement to the framerate, but the original already ran at a pretty reliable 60 frames-per-second. You can observe some direct differences between the OG Switch and Switch 2 <a href="https://youtu.be/0L8GMsUtl9k?t=1455">versions here</a>:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Switch 2 Free Upgrades For Switch 1 Games Tested: Link's Awakening, Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3 +More!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0L8GMsUtl9k?start=1455&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i>?</h2> <p>Due to the laid-back nature of <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i>, it’s tough to say just how long it’ll take each person to beat. There’s so much to do, after all. But the game doesn’t make you feel ina rush to get it all done. So, with that in mind, it can be a lot of fun to take your time and explore each level at your own pace, checking each nook and cranny for gems and completing challenges.</p> <p>If you’re not too interested in fully mastering each stage, however, <b>you’ll probably land at around 7-10 hours of playtime in </b><b><i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i></b>. That’s a decent amount of time for a puzzle platformer experience, and it ensures that it never outstays its welcome so that you don’t end up burned out before seeing the conclusion.</p> <p><b>If you </b><b><i>do</i></b><b> opt to 100% </b><b><i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i></b><b>, though, you can stretch things out to around 20 hours</b>, especially if you’re not rushing through stages. And if you miss anything along the way, you’re free to jump back into any stage and wrap up challenges or finish collecting missed items.</p> <p>That being said, I’d forgive you for overlooking hidden away behind things sometimes, but I’m not sure I could forgive you for overlooking this charming treasure hunt. <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mafia: The Old Country: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-the-kotaku-review.1269597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>The </span><i><span>Mafia</span></i><span> series of games has always benefitted from a strong sense of time and place. As a Chinese immigrant, I’d often find ways to connect to these games, even if I didn’t directly associate with the focus on Italian crime families. From the Chinatown area in the first </span><i><span>Mafia</span></i><span> to the Triads in </span><i><span>Mafia II</span></i><span>, I always felt a sense of authenticity running through the series. </span><i><span>Mafia III</span></i><span>’s shift away from Italian-American protagonists to focus on a Black man navigating the racism of the criminal underworld in late-1960s America was perhaps most authentic of all, holding forces that still shape our society today up to the light and examining the violence inherent in them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The latest entry, </span><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>, has neither the immigrant perspective nor the racial tensions that underscored the previous games. Instead, class dynamics and the plight of workers are at the heart of the story it tells about the mob in 1904 Sicily. It’s bolstered by memorable characters and wonderfully authentic performances, though it’s dragged down by dated gameplay mechanics.</span></p> <p><span>The story follows Enzo Favara, a worker who one day hopes to find a better life in America by saving up enough money to buy his freedom. One day, the sulfur mine he toils in collapses, causing the death of his friend Gaetano underneath rubble. Themes of revolution and working class rights are front and center during</span><i><span> Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>’s opening hours.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617522"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617522">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After slaving away for meager pennies his entire life up until that point and witnessing Gaetano’s demise, Enzo finally musters up the courage to confront the mine underboss, II Merlo of the Spadaro crime family. Finding himself overpowered, Enzo manages to escape and unwittingly crosses into the territory of the Torrisi crime family. Il Merlo gives chase but the crime family’s Don, Bernardo Torrisi, saves Enzo just as he’s about to be finished off. The Don tells a fearful Il Merlo off as he was caught in Torrisi territory and risks being the spark that ignites a war between the two crime families. Sensing the Don’s influence and power, Enzo eventually accepts his offer to join the Torrisi crime family, seeing it as the golden ticket he’s been searching for to get out of the poor working conditions he grew up in.</span></p> <h2><span>Welcome to the family</span></h2> <p><span>After joining the family, it’s not long before Enzo finds himself at the opposite end of the labor struggle. Acting as an enforcer, he breaks up a union’s strike to keep order for the Don. It’s a fascinating juxtaposition that foreshadows Enzo’s dark descent into mob life, but this aspect feels a bit underbaked. Whereas the recent animated film </span><i><span>Transformers One</span></i><span> carried its concerns about exploited workers through to its stirring climax in a more explicit manner, </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, by contrast, uses those themes as more of a subtext for Enzo’s eventual realization that his involvement with the Torrisi family comes with its own kind of exploitation. A noble aim, but the way it’s executed, it feels as if </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span> tosses these ideas and all their resonant power aside in favor of a more conventional, albeit well-told, crime story about trying to make it out and leave the life of crime behind for good.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Still, the story does eventually coalesce in a satisfactory way. As you progress, each of the Don’s requests get bloodier and more dangerous until Enzo realizes that he’s nothing but a means to an end, a tool just like any other worker. Ironically, before the end, Enzo learns that the path he’s chosen, which seemed one that might lead him to liberation and luxury, has only made his life much more limited than it likely would have been if he’d stayed in the mines.</span></p>

 <p><span>Enzo’s late friend Gaetano had a postcard his uncle had sent him from Empire Bay, </span><i><span>Mafia II</span></i><span>’s setting and a fictional recreation of East Coast metropolitan areas like New York City. In it, Gaetano’s uncle wrote that upon their arrival in the U.S., he’d feed them steak and eggs, a huge step up from the paltry bread rations they received while working in the mines. And as the years go by, Enzo still carries it with him, as a memento of his friend and the dream they shared, and as inspiration to achieve his goal of reaching America. It’s a powerful motivator for Enzo, and as he gets more and more pulled into the business, it takes on the poignant power of the unattainable. It also chips away at the hyper-masculine allure that mafia media tends to give its leading figures with shows of power, control, and dominance, allowing us to sympathize more with Enzo as the story progresses.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000617523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617523">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Ultimately, Enzo’s tale is a tragedy. Of course he has no knowledge that on the other side of the pond, Italian immigrants are also facing marginalization and poor economic conditions, driving some of them to join organized crime groups like the American mafia. Sure, a steak and eggs meal sounds nice, but not all that glitters is gold. Even if he did make it to American shores, Enzo could potentially find himself stuck in a similar situation in America, looking for a way out of organized crime again. No matter what path he takes or where he goes, he’ll always face insurmountable odds that keep him from living the carefree and rich life that he imagined. These strong narrative threads kept my interest in </span><i><span>The Old Country </span></i><span>from waning, turning its story into much more than just a series of cutscenes meant to support the middling gameplay moments in between. Through Enzo, we can see how he and so many others poured their blood, sweat, and tears into struggling to achieve a dream when it was really just a mere fantasy.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Though the story has its ups and downs, it benefits throughout from the fantastic supporting cast and the stellar performances from the voice actors. Among the Torrisi crime family, the bold attitude of Enzo’s best buddy Cesare brings out the bloodthirstiness within our protagonist, while mentor Luca imparts wisdom to Enzo to make sure he doesn’t get in way over his head. The Don is the most stereotypically mob-like of the bunch, with his focus on family and loyalty over everything, but the interactions between the characters make them feel like more than just typical organized crime members.</span></p> <p><span>In the English track, all of the voice actors speak in heavy Italian accents, but not in a way that feels insultingly stereotypical or harmful. In fact, it adds to the authenticity that the </span><i><span>Mafia </span></i><span>franchise is known for. The Sicilian dub is also excellent, and can heighten your immersion. Fair warning though, the characters’ lip-synching doesn’t match up nearly as well in that one as in the English dub.</span></p>

 <h2><span>Going back in time, in more ways than one</span></h2> <p><span>While the narrative and characters have their compelling qualities, when it comes to gameplay, every single aspect of </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span> feels like something from the late 2000s or early 2010s. There’s just not much depth to any of it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000617527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617527">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are bog-standard stealth sequences akin to those in </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>. You just sneak up behind your enemies and then choke them out. Enzo even has his obligatory “radar” mode, called instinct mode, that lets him see enemies through walls. The dumb enemy AI doesn’t do these sections any favors either, as they stupidly fall for the coins and bottles that Enzo can throw as distractions. For a game with revolutionary themes, the stealth mechanics are anything but. To make matters worse, there are a few stealth sections that result in an instant game over if you get caught, and those are never fun.</span></p>

 <p><span>Then, of course, there are all-out gunfights, and the guns you get to use are fine for what they are. Your pick of the litter includes pistols, rifles, and shotguns–naturally there are none of </span><i><span>Mafia III</span></i><span>’s rocket launchers and C4 chargers here to really make things explosive. The gunplay itself plays out like your run-of-the-mill cover shooter</span><span>—</span><i><span>Uncharted</span></i><span>, for instance. In that game, as in this one, I would just duck in and out of cover to pop enemies in the head and continue on. Occasionally here in </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, a lone enemy might approach me or a grenade might be thrown to flush me out of my cover, but these were hardly any challenge (even on Hard difficulty) and didn’t really result in invigorating shootouts.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, there are the knife fights, which are usually reserved for cinematic moments and pit you against major antagonists. Though meant to be pivotal dramatic confrontations, in practice they’re quite underwhelming and mostly involve waiting for the boss to strike so you can parry them and slash back. I often found myself repeating this same strategy to win. You can also break your opponent’s guard, but in my experience the spacing never felt quite right. During the final boss fight I’d have a sizable distance between us, but my guard break attack would somehow always connect, even though it didn’t look like it did. Still, I took those victories in stride as I just wanted to get the whole thing over with.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>BACK-OF-THE-BOX QUOTE</p>                 <p>“A deal you probably can refuse.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>TYPE OF GAME</p>                 <p>Third-person narrative-driven action-adventure.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>LIKED</p>                 <p>Good story, great characters, culturally authentic.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>DISLIKED</p>                 <p>Dated gameplay, half-assed open world.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>DEVELOPER</p>                 <p>Hangar 13</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>PLATFORMS</p>                 <p>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S (played)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>RELEASE DATE</p>                 <p>August 8, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>PLAYED</p>                 <p>About 18 hours.

The biggest issue with this option is that while there are some landmarks here and there that you can take photos of, there’s not much else to do besides go around and pick up collectibles. There are no side quests or mini-games to participate in. This is a weird thing to say given that </span><i><span>Mafia III</span></i><span> was criticized for its open-world bloat and </span><i><span>Mafia:</span></i> <i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>’s streamlined approach is welcome. The open world is an unnecessary half-measure; the game should have leaned even more fully into a linear structure similar to </span><i><span>Max Payne 3</span></i><span>-style mission design and done away with the option to tool around its lifeless, uninteresting world altogether.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>’s story was good enough to keep me engaged to the end with its authentic portrayal of 1900s Sicily and its superb characters. It’s too bad, however, that while the narrative traveled backwards in time for its new setting, the gameplay mechanics went along with them.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Reviews for <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-drag-x-drive-demo-joy-con-jeans-table-mouse-2000616850"><em>Drag x Drive</em>,</a> Nintendo’s newest first-party Switch 2 game, went live across the web earlier today, and the overall consensus seems to be: Meh. By itself, that wouldn’t be much of a story, but <em>Drag x Drive’</em>s low review scores mean that two out of the five lowest-rated Switch 2 games on Metacritic were published by Nintendo.</p> <p>On August 13, the embargo dropped for<em> Drag x Drive</em> reviews, and numerous outlets began posting their critical appraisals of the arcade-y wheelchair basketball game. <em>Drag x Drive</em>, which launches on Thursday, isn’t a big hit with critics. Many found it too complicated for casual players, but not deep enough to keep experienced players hooked. Others complained that the controls, which rely heavily on the new Joy-Cons’ mouse functionality, are tedious and a pain to use, and even once you’ve mastered them, the 3v3 sports game is just not very exciting to play or look at. So it’s not a surprise that, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/nintendo-switch-2/all/all-time/metascore/?releaseYearMin=1958&amp;releaseYearMax=2025&amp;platform=nintendo-switch-2&amp;page=2">as of 2:30 PM EST</a>, <em>Drag x Drive</em> has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/drag-x-drive/">lukewarm 62 out of 100 rating on Metacritic</a> and places it in close proximity to another Nintendo-published Switch 2 game.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828">That other game is Switch 2 launch title <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour,</em></a> a game that many critics called a glorified tutorial and tech demo hidden behind a paywall. And while it has some fans, it boasts a low overall Metacritic score of 54. Yikes. That score places it right next to <em>Drag x Drive</em> on the worst-reviewed Switch 2 games list on Metacritic. The only game with a worse aggregated score than those two titles is Bandai Namco’s <em>Tamagotchi Plaza.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>So what can we take from this? Well, first off, it should be noted that over the next few months and years, as more games flood the Switch 2, I expect these low-rated Nintendo games to float higher up the list as truly awful garbage lands on the console. But for now, I think it reinforces the fact that the Switch 2 is a great console with perhaps the worst launch line-up of exclusive games I’ve seen from Nintendo in a long time.</p> <p>It’s also interesting that both of these poorly received Nintendo games are new titles not connected to a franchise and focused heavily on the more gimmicky features of the Switch 2 hardware. In 2025, it seems a lot of critics and players are done waggling controllers or caring about weird features that very few games will use at all. That’s bad news for <em>Drag x Drive</em> and<em> Welcome Tour,</em> but it suggests that Nintendo made the right call with its new console. Instead of going for a new, weird gimmick like the Wii U, Virtual Boy, or 3DS, this time around Nintendo just made the same console again, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">but bigger, better, and faster.</a> Seeing how <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">well it has sold so far</a> and how poorly people are reacting to gimmicks, this was likely a smart move.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> emerged late last year as an unlikely winner amid a sea of failed live-service slop. What made the free-to-play hero shooter succeed where others hadn’t? Was it the well-oiled gameplay loop, the massive comic book IP behind it, or the steady flow of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1moiozw/its_the_details_for_me/">gooner skins</a> for iconic characters like Emma Frost? Following the recent addition of swimsuits, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>‘ creative director was finally asked what he thinks about the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1hwovkd/me_a_overwatch_gooner_seeing_marvel_rivals_get/"><em>Overwatch</em> for gooners”</a> discourse.</p> <p>“Because our design, as mentioned earlier, is inspired by classic comic themes, including some very outstanding skins, like Mantis, and also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1mb18r8/its_phenomenal_that_psylocke_is_the_only_hero_in/">Psylocke’s Vengeance</a>, these all come from classic comic designs,” Guangyun Chen told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RivalsAssembled">YouTube channel RivalsAssembled</a> at a recent tournament in China. “We take those classic comic designs and make some more fashionable designs based on them to gain players’ appreciation. I think this also reflects the broad recognition from our players.”</p> <p>While Chen is right that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is drawing upon <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-marvel-swimsuit-special-returns-friends-foes-rivals-july-2025">a well-established history of hyper-sexualized designs</a>, especially when it comes to female characters, every batch of skins usually includes at least a handful that suggest the NetEase studio knowns exactly what it’s doing. For example, fans instantly noticed when a pair of X-suit skins back in April buffed the butts of both Psylocke and Magik.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="EXCLUSIVE: Matchmaking Explained, Playable Villains ARE Coming, more Vanguards and Strategists" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-_8Qj3spOM?start=707&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“As mentioned earlier with the Squirrel Girl and the Krakoa Resort skin, these are actually designs based on real-world themes and the season’s storyline,” Chen continued without cracking a smile. “For designs like these, we try our best to integrate the storylines from the season, including elements from Krakoa, and also blend some popular elements from real life. We create new designs based on that, and I’m very grateful these designs have been well-received by the majority of players.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1m5ysiw/reminder_that_this_skin_is_not_part_of_the_marvel/">Sunshine Squirrel</a> is by far one of the tamer skins <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has released this summer, however. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-skins/2900-6764/#10">The first batch of swimsuit outfits</a> put both Psylocke and Luna Snow in tiny bikinis. Evening out the fan-service, however, was both Loki and The Punisher in speedos. Even The <em>Fantastic Four</em>‘s Thing was airing himself out. I’m sure all of these designs were implemented with only the highest ideals of fashion and authenticity to the source material top of mind.</p> <p>In the meantime, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has more pressing issues to attend to. The game’s rating on Steam is plummeting under an influx of complaints about allegedly manipulative matchmaking. The developers say that’s not the case, though, promising to brief players on all things related to matchmaking <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-eomm-steam-reviews-max-payne-remake-n64-2000617137">in an upcoming developer video</a>.</p>
