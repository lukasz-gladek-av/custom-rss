Maybe Pattinson will play Odysseus, the mastermind behind the Trojan Horse and the poem’s main character.

The result is movie studios being willing to give him lavish budgets to make whatever he wants, and top talent jockeying for the limited spots in his upcoming projects. </p><p>But what could really set Nolan’s take on <em>The Odyssey</em> apart is his penchant for non-linear storytelling, with out-of-order scenes, unreliable narrators, and occasional time dilation. <em>The Odyssey</em> has all of those things, and there’s potential for the epic poem, in Nolan’s hands, to be turned into more of a “What happened to Odysseus?” puzzle box thriller than a straightforward monster-slaying saga about the journey home. It’s also full of rich metaphoric language ripe for creative license and re-interpretation. The movie is set to begin filming next year. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you paid more, you got PC and streaming games, too.</p><p>But in the summer, Xbox announced a big price hike for all Xbox plans. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the plan that included everything, went from $17 to $20. Meanwhile, the console-only plan, which previously cost $11 a month, was being retired and replaced with a new “Game Pass Standard” tier that cost $15 a month and would no longer include day-one releases. Xbox explained that eventually some day-one releases would land on Standard, but didn’t specify a timetable. </p><p>To sum it up: Everyone is paying more for Game Pass, but not everyone gets access to big new games like <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> at launch. Not great! For as long as Game Pass has been a thing, the promise of day-one first-party titles like <em>Halo </em>has been its big selling point. But in 2024, seemingly to help cover the cost of spending nearly $70 billion on Activision, Xbox has ruined what was once the best deal in gaming.</p><h2 id="h36391"><a id=""></a><strong>Everything Is An Xbox, Including Your PS5 And Switch</strong></h2><p>Maybe the weirdest Microsoft storyline that unfolded in 2024 is the way the company tried to navigate its dwindling console sales numbers while telling Xbox fans not to worry. </p><p>I mean, if you look at everything that happened in 2024, it doesn’t paint a good picture for Xbox consoles.

That sounds less like a confident and well-developed blueprint for the future and more like a messy bundle of promises and individual plans meant to distract us from reality. </p><h2 id="h36392"><a id=""></a><strong>The Future Is Looking Weird For Xbox And Microsoft</strong></h2><p>As 2024 draws to a close, here is the reality of the situation: Xbox seems to be aimlessly moving forward as Microsoft focuses most of its money on AI. </p><p>Sure, Xbox has a huge stable of studios and publishers that will help it develop and release more games than ever before across more platforms in 2025 and beyond. It can’t seem to support all of these studios, however, and keeps closing them or laying people off. </p><p>Game Pass is now a questionable and expensive subscription plan that is a very shitty version of what we used to have, and which is only likely to get worse as Microsoft looks to keep numbers growing amid a lack of new users. </p><p>And if you’re looking to buy a new console, it almost seems like a gamble at this point to invest in an Xbox Series X/S. I’m not suggesting Microsoft will flip a switch and kill its consoles overnight. But as the company invests more and more into streaming and makes more of its exclusives multiplatform, there are fewer and fewer reasons to own an Xbox, whatever that even means in 2024.</p><p>2025 could also be a massive year for Xbox. It has new games coming from Bethesda, Activision, and its own many studios in the next few months, and will likely announce more as the year goes on. But 2024 was also a big year for Xbox; it’s just that the cost was massive job cuts, big price increases, and multiple studio closures. So while some Xbox fans might be excited for another big year, I’m truly concerned about how much more blood will be spilled to pay for it. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
