              <p>A tablet can come in handy when your phone feels too small, but you don’t want to carry your laptop around. These screens are great for being productive on the go, and even keeping your kids entertained (for a while at least). That said, you don’t always have to spend $300+ to get something that’s powerful enough to get through your busy days, yet easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Thankfully, early Black Friday deals are already rolling in, making it easy to grab a high-end option without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">Amazon has now dropped the price of the 11-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ to just $149, after a massive 32% off its regular price of $220.</a> This deal applies to the Graphite model, but if you prefer the Silver version, that one’s just a dollar more at $150. The only catch? It’s already selling fast, and stock might run out before the deal ends. It’s best to grab it while it’s still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Portable, Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>This sleek tablet comes with an 11-inch screen that’s big enough to open multiple windows side-by-side without feeling cramped. The WUXGA display (1920 x 1200) pushes vibrant, detailed visuals that bring content to life, whether you’re playing a game or watching a TV show. The 90Hz refresh rate keeps everything running smoothly, while the 480 nits of brightness ensure you experience exceptional clarity in both bright and dim settings.</p>
<p>Of course, good visuals are only half the experience. You will also enjoy quality sound with the tablet’s quad-speaker setup with Dolby Atmos support. Every movie dialog (even the whispers) will come through clearly, kids’ songs are going to sound better, and even video calls will feel more natural. Speaking of video calls, there’s a solid front camera as well, which makes you look your best while catching up with family and friends.</p>



<p>For power, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ packs a Snapdragon 695 processor, paired with <strong>4GB of RAM </strong>and<strong> 64GB of internal storage</strong>. That’s enough for some light multitasking, plus storing all your important files or media content in one place. If you ever need more space, you can always expand it up to 1TB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>It supports Smart View, which means you can cast your screen to a Samsung TV whenever you want to enjoy a bigger viewing experience, easily. And finally, the battery also lasts all day, plus charges back up quickly when you need it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a brief tease earlier this year, Nintendo and Illumination have finally released the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. We see a fair bit of returning characters, but we also get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosalina, who are debuting in the sequel.</p>

  <p>After the events of the first movie, Bowser is still tiny and a prisoner of Mario and company, and his son Bowser Jr. is taking on the major villain role to save his father from the Mushroom Kingdom’s clutches. Rosalina is voiced by <em>Captain Marvel </em>star Brie Larson, and Bowser Jr. will be played by <em>Uncut Gems </em>co-director Benny Safdie. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjMaKQskW8">During the Direct</a>, we heard both actors’ performances as Rosalina read bedtime stories, seemingly about Mario and Peach, to several Luma, and Bowser Jr. gave a villain monologue.</p>

 <p>Surprisingly, we didn’t hear anything today about Yoshi, who was teased in the first <em>Mario </em>movie’s post-credits scene. The character’s design was leaked earlier this week <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">by a cookie dough box</a>, and while it wasn’t anything surprising, it did make me think Yoshi might be making his grand debut during today’s Direct showcase. A lot of&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>fans are wondering if Yoshi will have a full speaking role like certain other characters in the films who don’t usually speak in the video games. Mario himself usually doesn’t utter more than a series of “wahoo!”s and the occasional “Let’s-a go!” But Chris Pratt’s voice is forming full sentences in the films, unfortunately, so it’s not out of the question that Yoshi might speak in <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>.</p> <p>The sequel will premiere in theaters on April 3. Pratt is one of several returning actors reprising their roles from the original film. Jack Black made an appearance in the Direct presentation introducing Safdie as Bowser Jr., and his voice can still be heard as Bowser in the trailer, though pitched up because the pathetic little simp has been shrunken down by a Mini Mushroom.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-popcorn-bucket-barbie-ghostbusters-best-worst-1851336690"><span>Novelty popcorn buckets</span></a><span> are a real hit-or-miss trend, with many being so clumsily aggressive as pure marketing for whatever film they’re themed around that the actual utility for holding the salty, buttery goodness of your favorite theater’s popcorn falls by the wayside. But now and then, something interesting pops up and you see why movie studios are investing in these buckets of popcorn. </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is heading to theaters this weekend, and the magic-based crime drama has one of the better popcorn buckets I’ve seen lately, both because it’s actually practical as a popcorn bucket, and because it manages to capture the spirit of the movie without just being a replica of a character or item in the film.</span></p>

 <p><span>At a glance, the bucket looks like a pretty standard box with the </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>poster on the sides. However, it also uses an optical illusion to make it look as if the popcorn disappears, like it would in a magic trick. There’s a hidden compartment that helps sell the trick, and if you’re looking at it from the right angle, it does truly look like the kind of illusion you’d see in a magician’s stage show.</span></p>   <p><span>Like most optical illusions, if you know the secret, your eyes will probably adapt and see the truth, but it is still a pretty cool popcorn bucket that doesn’t just feel like an elaborate collectible statue with a popcorn-shaped hole on the side. The next question is: Is it worth going to see </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</span></i><span> to get it? Eh. Despite the series’ stacked cast and neat premise of magic-based heists, they’ve never really gotten much critical acclaim. </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is sitting at a series high on review aggregate site </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_2025"><i><span>Rotten Tomatoes</span></i></a><span> with a 60 percent approval rating. So I guess they’re getting better? </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is a great game</a> with a complicated legacy thanks to its use of generative AI to voice NPCs. It’s the same strategy Embark Studios used with <em>The Finals</em>, and the CEO of publisher Nexon now says fans should get used to it.</p> <p>“First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” Junghun Lee told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><em>Game*Spark</em></a>, according to a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translation by <em>Automaton</em></a>. “But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.”</p>

 <p>He believes generative AI will increase the capabilities of game studios across the board, thus increasing the “average” quality of games.&nbsp; “AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations,” Lee said.</p>

 <p>His comments come after fellow South Korea game publisher Krafton revealed an “<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">AI first</a>” plan to invest roughly $70 million in GPU clusters and related resources to build out an infrastructure for deploying agentic AI across the company. Krafton happens to own the makers of <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and <em>Subnautica 2</em>.</p>

 <p>But the deployment of AI in games remains controversial and confusing, as proven by Nexon’s own <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p> <h2>No one agrees on what counts as generative AI</h2> <p>“<em>Arc Raiders</em>&nbsp;in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,” design director Virgil Watkins claimed during a new interview&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use">with&nbsp;<em>PCGamesN</em></a>. But in addition to using machine learning during the development process, the hit Steam extraction shooter also uses text-to-speech models to voice all of the NPC barks for every random item and situation.</p>

 <p>“[Text-to-speech] allows us to increase the scope of the game in some areas where we think it’s needed, or where there’s tedious repetition, in situations where the voice actors may not see it as valuable work,” Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer last month. “So it’s a wide umbrella, but the experience of the game doesn’t use any generative AI.”</p>

 <p>Others disagree, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><em>Eurogamer</em>, &nbsp;whose review</a> became a flash point on social media this week after it critiqued <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ use of AI voices. “[Machine learning] is an interesting technology, and the effects it produces during matches are undeniably convincing,” wrote Rick Lane. “The same cannot be said about Embark’s generated voice lines, which are aggressively mediocre and a stain on the experience.”</p> <p>There are also those who take issue with the assumption of Nexon’s CEO that everyone must be racing to embrace generative AI more generally. “Hello, not only do we not use AI, we would rather cut off our own arms than do so,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3m5fpw7lp7s2d">wrote</a> indie team <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong/">Necrosoft Games</a>. “<em>Demonschool</em> is 100% human made.”</p>
