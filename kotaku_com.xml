              <p><span>GameStop has been in hot water for some time now. </span><span>But the company’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, should come away relatively unscathed</span><span>, because, thanks to</span> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/business/gamestop-ceo-ryan-cohen-compensation-package"><span>CNN</span><span>,</span></a> <span>we now know he will score a $35 billion payout if the storefront hits a $100 billion market cap. One small issue: that’s about 10 times its current value.</span></p> <p><span>How is Cohen planning on getting it there? Thanks to a</span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/"> <i><span>Polygon</span></i><span> report</span></a><span>, we know that he intends to close hundreds of stores and to offer customers a 20 percent trade-in bonus via a QR code. Although we don’t have concrete numbers on exactly how many stores have been shut down, a</span><a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/2025/12/january-2026-reported-closings.html"> <span>post on a blog</span></a><span> that tracks GameStop closures</span><span> reports that close to 400 stores have either already been closed this month or are set to be closed before the month is over.</span></p>

 <p><span>The trade coupon, meanwhile, was shared on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/gamestop_really_put_a_trade_coupon_on_my_local/"><span>official GameStop Reddit</span></a><span> page by a user who posted their frustration about the closure of their local store, saying “GameStop really put a trade coupon on my local stores closing sign?” In that same thread, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/comment/nxhrn13/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>original poster voiced their frustrations by calling it</span></a><span> “a fucking joke,” while others stated that they have begun canceling pre-orders.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s also worth noting that GameStop closed 590 stores in 2024, according to a</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm"> <span>December 2025 SEC filing</span></a><span>. The filing goes on to state that the company plans on “closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.” This is important because the 2025 fiscal year ends on January 31, 2026, which means more stores could close sooner rather than later. GameStop has also been closing stories across various countries worldwide. The same SEC Filing states that the company has already “exited” operations in Austria, Ireland, and Switzerland. In 2024, it also closed down store operations in Germany while selling off its Italian subsidiary.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Even as it shuts down stores en masse, GameStop has been doing everything it can to get attention back on the storefront over the last few months, partnering with popular influencers such as Casey Neistat and Mega64, and even with</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DSIjPqvACxN/"> <span>Rilie Huntley</span></a><span>, a popular e-girl who originally went viral over a Best Buy ad. Just recently, the company had a </span><span>“</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/gamestop"><span>trade anything day</span></a><span>“</span><span> which saw people bringing in all sorts of things, including sex toys. Just a few days earlier, the</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582"> <span>GameStop card loot program led to a record-breaking $30,000 trade-in</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p>As PC components like RAM continue to be gobbled up by AI hyperscalers, leading to higher prices and limited supplies, a large electronics store in Japan is running out of computers and parts and is asking its customers to please sell them some old PCs.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">It has become more expensive to build or upgrade a PC</a> over the last few months. A big reason for that is <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">AI-focused tech companies gobbling up PC parts to build massive data&nbsp;centers</a>. It’s&nbsp;becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a> for your average person to buy PC RAM and graphics cards, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/after-nearly-30-years-crucial-will-stop-selling-ram-to-consumers/#:~:text=The%20fault%20lies,output%20through%202026.">as companies like Micron stop selling to consumers</a> and focus more and more on big companies that buy in bulk. Prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will likely see a price increase of 15 to 20 percent as well, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to&nbsp;<em>PC World.</em></a> All of this, plus tariffs causing other problems, has led to fewer PC parts and computers on shelves in some stores, forcing one shop to beg people to sell them some hardware.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ゲーミングPC、中古も本当に在庫なくて今これ</p> <p>あの、お願いなので買い替えたらぜひ弊社にゲーミングPCを売ってください…<br>結構高く買い取っていますので…<br>ゲーミングのデスクでもノートでも、もちろんゲーミングじゃない普通のでもPCなら大体買い取っているので… <a href="https://t.co/IinBuGgRV7">pic.twitter.com/IinBuGgRV7</a></p> <p>— ソフマップゲーミング (@sofmap_gaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/sofmap_gaming/status/2008871239096431070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 7, as spotted by <a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2076399.html"><em>PC-Watch</em></a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/pc-building/major-japanese-electronics-store-begs-customers-for-their-old-pcs-as-hardware-drought-continues-we-pretty-much-buy-any-pc-pleads-the-akihabara-outlet"><em>Tom’s Hardware,</em></a> Sofmap Gaming, a large electronics shop in the Akihabara district of Tokyo, <a href="https://x.com/sofmap_gaming/status/2008871239096431070">posted a somewhat desperate-sounding plea</a>. Here’s the tweet text via machine translation:</p>

 <p>“Um, as a favor, if you buy a new PC, please sell your gaming PC to our company. We buy them back at pretty high prices. Whether it’s a gaming desk or a laptop, or even a regular non-gaming one, we pretty much buy any PC.”</p> <p>Attached to the tweet was a photo of what appears to be a mostly empty shelf inside of Sofmap Gaming with only a few PCs and monitors left. “Gaming PCs, even used ones, are really out of stock right now. This is it,” claimed Sofmap Gaming. The account is also replying to nearly every user who responds with questions about what they can sell and how much it might be worth.</p>

 <p>With some experts saying the ongoing demand for memory and other PC components, like GPUs, will be a problem for 2026 and even 2027, it might be a good time to start looking around your house to see what random bits of hardware you have lying around somewhere collecting dust. If the parts aren’t too old, they might be worth a pretty penny soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486</link>
            <guid>1402018</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A week ago, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/02/elon-musk-grok-ai-children-photos"><em>Guardian</em>&nbsp;story</a> revealed the news that Elon Musk’s Grok AI was knowingly and willingly producing images of real-world people in various states of undress, and even more disturbingly, images of near-nude minors, in response to user requests. Further reporting from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/"><em>Wired</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> demonstrated the situation was on a scale larger than most could imagine, with “thousands” of such images produced an hour. Despite silence or denials from within X, this led to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5w0k99r1o">“urgent contact”</a> from various international regulators, and today X has responded by creating the impression that access to Grok’s image generation tools is now for X subscribers only. Another way of phrasing this could be: you now have to pay to use xAI’s tools to make nudes. Except, extraordinarily—despite Grok saying otherwise—it’s not true.</p> <p>The story of the last week has in fact been in two parts. The first is Grok’s readiness to create undressed images of real-world people and publish them to X, as well as create far more graphic and sexual videos on the Grok website and app, willingly offering deepfakes of celebrities and members of the public with few restrictions. The second is that Grok has been found to do the same with images of children. Musk and X’s responses so far have been to seemingly celebrate the former, but condemn the latter, while appearing not to do anything about either. It has taken until today, a week since world leaders and international regulatory bodies have been demanding responses from X and xAI, for there to be the appearance of any action at all, and it looks as if even this isn’t what it seems.</p> <h2>How we got here</h2> <p>The January 2 story from <i>The Guardian</i> reported that the Grok chatbot <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/2006618883055046758">posted</a> that lapses in safeguards had led to the generation of “images depicting minors in minimal clothing” in a reply to an X user. The user, on January 1, had responded to <a href="https://x.com/AnOpenSecret/status/2006491540848341408?s=20">a claim</a> made by an account for the documentary <em>An Open Secret</em> stating that Grok was being used to “depict minors on this platform in an extremely inappropriate, sexual fashion.” The allegation was that a user could post a picture of a fully dressed child and then ask Grok to re-render the image but wearing underwear or lingerie, and in sexual poses. The user asked Grok if it was true, and Grok responded that it was. “I’ve reviewed recent interactions,” the bot replied. “There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've reviewed recent interactions. There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced. xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely. (214 chars)</p> <p>— Grok (@grok) <a href="https://twitter.com/grok/status/2006618883055046758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>By January 7,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/"><em>Wired</em> published an investigation</a> that revealed Grok was willing to make images of a far more sexual nature when the results weren’t appearing on X. Using Grok’s website and app,&nbsp;<em>Wired</em> discovered it was possible to create “extremely graphic, sometimes violent, sexual imagery of adults that is vastly more explicit than images created by Grok on X.” The site added, “It may also have been used to create sexualized videos of apparent minors.” The generative-AI was willing and able to create videos of recognizable celebrities “engaging in sexual activities,” including a video of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, “having sex with two men on a bed.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s reporting</a> spoke to experts who talked about how Grok and xAI’s approach to image and video generation is materially different from that being done by other big names in generative-AI, stating that rivals offer a “good-faith effort to mitigate the creation of this content in the first place” and adding, “Obviously xAI is different. It’s more of a free-for-all.” Another expert said that the scale of deepfakes on X is “unprecedented,” noting, “We’ve never had a technology that’s made it so easy to generate new images.”</p> <h2>Where we are now</h2> <p>It is now being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/09/grok-image-generator-outcry-sexualised-ai-imagery">widely reported</a> that access to Grok’s image and video generation has been restricted to only paying subscribers to X. This is largely because when someone without a subscription asks Grok to make an image, it is responding with “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,” then adding a link so people can pay up for access.</p> <p>However, as discovered by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/859309/grok-undressing-limit-access-gaslighting"><em>The Verge</em></a>, this isn’t actually true at all. While you cannot currently simply @ Grok to ask it to make an image, absolutely everyone can still click on the “Edit image” button and access the software that way. You can also just visit Grok’s site or app and use it that way.</p> <p>This means that the technology is currently lying to users to suggest they need to subscribe to X’s various paid tiers if they wish to generate images of any nature, but still offering the option anyway if the user has the wherewithal to either click a button, or if they’re on the app version of X, to long-press an image and use the pop-up.</p> <h2>What does Elon Musk have to say?</h2> <p>Musk, as you might imagine, has truly been posting through it. Moments before the story of the images of minors broke, following days of people discovering Grok’s willingness to render anyone in a bikini, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2006868990287810750">Musk was laughing</a> at images of himself depicted in a two-piece, before a rapid reverse-ferret on January 3 as he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2007475612949102943">made great show of declaring</a> that anyone discovered using Grok for images of children would face consequences, in between endlessly claiming that his Nazi salute was the same as Mamdani doing a gentle wave to crowds. Since then (alongside <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2009546483054592185">posting</a> full-on white supremacist content), the X owner’s stance has switched to <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk">reposting</a> other people’s use of ChatGPT to demonstrate that it, too, will render adults in bikinis, seemingly forgetting that the core issue was Grok’s willingness to depict children, and declaring that this proves the hypocrisy of the press and world leaders.</p> <p>Regarding today’s developments, he has not uttered a peep. Instead his feed is primarily deeply upsetting lies about the murder of Renee Nicole Good and uncontrolled rage at the suggestion from Britain’s Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99kn52nx9do">that X might be banned in the UK</a> as a consequence of the issues discussed above.</p>
