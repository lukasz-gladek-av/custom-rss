            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today, </span><i><span>Bloomberg </span></i><span>posted an interview with Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke in which he explained that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>and </span><i><span>Divinity</span></i><span> developer has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850"><span>started integrating generative AI into its workflow</span></a><span>. This is being used for PowerPoint presentations, placeholder text, and concept art, and according to Vincke, “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way [Larian is] using it.” Despite Vincke’s best efforts to contextualize the ways in which the technology is being used and his promise that no genAI would make its way into the finished product, many fans are not happy, and the statements have generated a massive backlash on social media.</span></p> <p><span>In the past few years, Larian has made a name for itself as a staunchly pro-human game developer. </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>won Game of the Year at the Game Awards, and Vincke himself gave an impassioned speech at the 2024 ceremony about how future GOTY winners would be games that didn’t “treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet” and would be made by people who “knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow.” So, as you can expect, hearing that the studio has started using AI to generate concept art and ideas has felt to some like a mask drop moment for a studio that has been so publicly supportive of human creativity.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvRm4HKK4gQ"><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvRm4HKK4gQ</span></a></p> <p><span>Vincke went on to clarify his comments in a statement to </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, saying this technology is meant to be “</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912"><span>additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.”</span></a><span> He also doubled down on his assertion that Larian will not include generated assets in its upcoming turn-based RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><i><span>Divinity</span></i></a><span> when it launches in a few years. But even if Vincke says the final product won’t have anything produced by AI in it, the fact that this technology is being integrated at a studio whose greatest accomplishments have come from human creativity is worrying to many, and has brought some folks’ excitement for </span><i><span>Divinity </span></i><span>to a screeching halt just days after its announcement at last week’s Game Awards.</span></p>
