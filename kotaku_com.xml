              <p>With a reputation for being a closer, Rod Fergusson helped get the last troubled BioShock game out the door. Can he do it again? The outgoing head of the <em>Diablo</em> franchise at Blizzard revealed on Tuesday that he’s joined <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680">2K Games’ struggling Cloud Chamber studio,</a> as <em>BioShock 4</em> development stalls and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z">layoffs</a>&nbsp;hit the Montreal-based team.</p> <p>In an memo to staff shared with<em> Kotaku</em>, 2K Games president David Ismailer confirmed that Fergusson would be head of the BioShock franchise, including helping to oversea its movie spin-off that’s currently in production at Netflix. But he also said the team at Cloud Chamber would be downsized as <em>BioShock 4</em> is reworked.&nbsp;“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” he wrote.</p> <p>Fergusson announced earlier this month he was <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680">leaving Blizzard after five years</a>, having joined just prior to the launch of <em>Diablo 4</em> and before Microsoft, his old employer, purchased Activision Blizzard. He was similarly brought in to help ship <em>BioShock Infinite,</em> which suffered multiple delays under a chaotic development process led by series creator Ken Levine at Irrational Games over a decade ago.&nbsp;“I’m returning to 2K as Head of the BioShock Franchise, leading Cloud Chamber!” Fergusson wrote on Bluesky. “I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.”</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/app.bsky.feed.post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiae25sd7bmtqrb6sjljl5iqrc6oobscldxw6nr6af2hcjlcqmsi6m"> <p lang="en">Would you kindly allow me to share some news?</p> <p>I’m returning to 2K as Head of the BioShock Franchise, leading Cloud Chamber!</p> <p>I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta?ref_src=embed">Rod Fergusson (@rodfergusson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e?ref_src=embed">2025-08-19T15:20:29.637Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Not long after it launched, Levine left Irrational, and parent publisher 2K Games announced it was shutting the entire studio down. Years later, it was revealed that a new studio in Canada called Cloud Chamber would be making <em>BioShock 4</em> while Levine worked on Judas, a very BioShock-looking sci-fi immersive sim, at his Ghost Story Games startup. Despite both being revealed a while ago, each project is still MIA.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">reported earlier</a> this month that <em>BioShock 4</em> had suffered a setback and leadership change after a recent negative internal review. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-not-canceled-movie-judas-ken-levine-2000616424">claims the game won’t be canceled, however</a>. “It’s going to come out,” he said in a recent interview. “That I can say hand on heart, without question.”</p> <p>Fergusson, a long-time producer, is a known hater of the phrase “it’s ready when it’s ready.” “It takes the agency away from the team,” he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo/492060/diablo-4-rod-fergusson-ready-when-its-ready/">told <em>Polygon</em></a> last year. “Saying ‘it’s ready when it’s ready’ means the team doesn’t have control over what they’re building. Mind, I’m giving you one person’s philosophy. But you control the scope. You control the schedule. You control a bunch of things. The idea that the game has to reveal itself somehow, with some unknown amount of content…I just find ‘it’s ready when it’s ready’ to be so passive.”</p> <p>Here’s the full email Ismailer sent staff today about the changes:</p> <blockquote> <p>BioShock is woven deeply into the fabric of 2K. It’s one of our most beloved franchises and respecting its legacy and meeting our fans’ expectations is critical to its future success.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p> <p>Work on the next BioShock game has been underway for several years. While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I know this is tough news for everyone. If your role is being affected, you’ll hear from your manager or studio leadership today with details on severance, career services and support resources.&nbsp; There is no easy way to do this, but we hope to do whatever we can to support you through this.&nbsp; I want to thank each of you for your dedication and hard work.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I also want to share an important studio leadership update. After an extensive search, I’m excited to announce Rod Fergusson will be leading Cloud Chamber as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. Rod is an industry veteran with a proven history of critical and commercial success, including BioShock Infinite, Gears of War, and Diablo.&nbsp; Rod rejoins us from Blizzard, where he was GM of the Diablo franchise and launched Diablo IV – Blizzard’s fastest-selling game ever.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>As Head of the BioShock Franchise, Rod will lead Cloud Chamber and oversee the development of the next BioShock game, as well as franchise extensions including our film partnership with Netflix. We will share more about Rod’s onboarding and how these changes will take shape in the coming days and weeks.&nbsp; Rod and I worked together 10+ years ago and I am grateful he has chosen to return to lead our BioShock efforts.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I recognize that today is a day of mixed emotions. We’re excited to have Rod joining us, and are equally grateful to everyone at Cloud Chamber who has helped us get this far. These changes are rooted in 2K’s firm confidence in BioShock as one of the most beloved franchises, and our commitment to deliver the best game in franchise history.</p> </blockquote>

              <p>Xbox has just announced the new games arriving on Game Pass in the second half of August, and it contains a couple of enormous names. We already knew that&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> was going to be a day-one release on Microsoft’s subscription service, but we’ve now learned that <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will be joining it two days later. Along with a bunch of others.</p> <p>Added today for PC is <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack’s <em>Void/Breaker</em>, developed by Stubby Games. Another game launching directly onto Game Pass, this is from the same team that created 2022’s extremely good FPS puzzler <em>The Entropy Center</em>.&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker</em> is a roguelite FPS in which you’re trapped in endless loops by an evil AI, and is all about lightning-fast action.</p> <p>Also arriving on PC is an early access build of <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, a game that’s proven to be well-liked on Steam in which you…well, you already guessed from the title. It’s a blacksmith management sim.</p>

 <p>Arriving tomorrow, August 20, on consoles and PC is <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em>, the recent remake of the original&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-like spoof, and <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, the 2012 update to one of the most beloved entries in the murderous coming-of-age series. Then on August 21 there’s <em>Herdling</em>, the big-beast herding adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031/36#content">first announced at Gamescom last year</a>.</p> <p>Come August 26, the big hitter arrives. Stretch your crouching muscles because it’s <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, the anticipated remastering of the original <em>Gears of War</em> from 2006. Being published by Xbox Games Studios, it’s coming straight to Game Pass Ultimate, but in our new, strange future, it’s also being released for sale on PlayStation as well.</p> <p>Then there’s the big surprise for this month, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. While the game has developed some manner of infamy for allegedly being poorly treated by both <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">BioWare</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169">EA</a>, and was then caught in the tiresome culture wars, it remains a solid RPG and a great piece of storytelling in a well-loved universe. It already faced the ignominy of being <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-playstation-plus-march-sonic-tmnt-1851766608">free on PS Plus just a month after it was released</a>, but perhaps makes more sense to arrive on Game Pass now that it’s six months old.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of releases for August, and the various tiers of Game Pass on which they appear:</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Blacksmith Master </strong></em>– PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Void/Breaker</strong></em><em> –&nbsp;</em>PC&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<em><strong>Goat Simulator Remastered</strong>&nbsp;</em>– Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Standard)</p>

 <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<strong><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></strong> – Cloud, Console, PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</p> <p>Aug 21:&nbsp;<strong><em>Herdling</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 26:&nbsp;<strong><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 28:&nbsp;<strong><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p>

 <p>Then, because the universe must be balanced, a bunch of games are leaving. On August 31 you’ll no longer have:</p> <ul> <li><em>Ben 10 Power Trip&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 3&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>This War of Mine: Final Cut&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> </ul> <p>Presumably&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em> is being removed to entice you to pay for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> when it comes out in September.</p>

              <p>And, just like that, we’re back. Welcome once again to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, stories you might have missed, and more. This morning, we have bad news about PlayStation Plus, good news about<em> Helldivers 2,</em> strange news about that PlayDate console, and sad news about the state of video games as brainrot meme games continue to take over everything. But hey, at least that new <em>Conjuring</em> movie looks like it might be pretty good?</p> <h2><strong>A <em>Fortnite</em> clone of <em>Roblox’s</em> <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> is super popular</strong></h2> <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">Steal A Brainrot</a></em> has become one of the most popular games on <em>Roblox</em>, leading to kids throwing tantrums when someone…well, steals their brainrot. And now, someone has created a clone that’s become one of the most popular games on <em>Fortnite</em>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-brainrotted-roblox-clone-is-dominating-the-fortnite-charts/1100-6534047/">At one point, as reported by <em>GameSpot</em></a>, the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/island?code=3225-0366-8885"><em>Fortnite</em> knock-off had over 180,000 active players.</a> That would put it in the top five on the Steam charts.</p> <p>And all this popularity has led to a flood of brain-rotting slop. There are clones filling up <em>Fortnite’s</em> creative mode. And if you look around other storefronts and games with user-generated content, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">you’ll see that knockoff brain-rotting games are truly everywhere</a>. It’s totally awesome and not at all horrible that so much of the video game industry is now entirely based around random users chasing the algorithm and exploiting kids playing stuff on their iPad.</p>

 <h2><strong>Eight games are leaving PlayStation Plus in a few weeks</strong></h2> <p>Sony has announced that eight games are leaving PlayStation Plus Extra’s library on September 16. Sadly, one of the games going away is <em>Plucky Squir</em>e, a solid adventure with some impressive visual flair. Here’s the full list:</p> <ul> <li><em>UFC 5&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>The Plucky Squire</em></li> <li><em>Night in the Woods&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Road 96&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Pistol Whip&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir</em></li> <li><em>FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Dragon’s Crown Pro</em></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Game Boy emulation is now possible on the PlayDate</strong></h2>   <p>The PlayDate might not be the best-selling console around, but it is one of the coolest. And now the black-and-white handheld with a huge library of exclusive games (and a crank!) can do something very cool: Play original Game Boy games. Of course, not officially. Neither Nintendo nor the people behind the PlayDate are involved.&nbsp; But instead, a small group has created “<a href="https://github.com/CrankBoyHQ/crankboy-app">CrankBoy,” a free, fast, and high-performance Game Boy emulator</a> that works perfectly on the PlayDate and its sharp black-and-white screen.</p> <h2><strong>Some of <em>Halo’s</em> best guns will soon be available in <em>Helldivers 2</em></strong></h2> <p>We knew <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> content was coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em> as part of the game’s leap from PS5 to Xbox later this month. But now,<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-warbond-xbox-launch/"> Xbox has revealed more details about the crossover DLC</a>, and while I’m happy to see the iconic ODST armor arriving in<em> Helldivers 2</em>, the bigger news is that four guns from <em>Halo</em> are coming to the co-op sci-fi shooter, too. This includes the franchise’s famous assault rifle, but more importantly, it includes <em>ODST’s </em>wonderful&nbsp;SOCOM pistol, aka that cool silenced pistol that goes “pip pip pip” and drops Grunts cleanly. I’m hopping back into <em>Helldivers 2</em>, baby.</p> <h2>Valve is adding six new characters to its hero shooter thing known as <em>Deadlock</em></h2> <p>Remember <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadlock-valve-steam-hero-shooter-moba-release-date-1851631341"><em>Deadlock</em></a>? It was that secret hero-based MOBA-shooter Valve sort of released, but in a weird way. Well, <em>Deadlock</em> continues to grow, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/669466707009471267?l=english">game’s latest update is one of its biggest</a>. It adds a whole new lobby area for players to explore between matches and a new character, a deadly but stylish vampire. Plus, Valve plans to add five new characters to the game over the next few days. Perhaps it’s time I play some more <em>Deadlock</em>?</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-original-heroes-new-characters-2000618254">The devs behind <em>Marvel Rivals</em> might start adding original characters</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-2000618215">No,<em> God of War</em>‘s director didn’t tease a new game; it was all a hoax</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-servers-150-players-100-songs-seasons-summer-2000618257"><em>Skate 4</em> will support 150 players all skating at once</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Incredible Demo Scene - Making Art with Code" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIQ74_DRWEM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i></a> <span>fans, this is not a drill. We’re actually getting an update on </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>, the long-awaited sequel that has gone so long without an update that the act of anticipating it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-switch-2-screenshots-date-1851775219"><span>has become a meme</span></a><span> almost as common as making </span><i><span>Half-Life 3 </span></i><span>jokes in the chat section of every industry livestream. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>may appear at today’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-gamescom-2025-livestream-what-time-fallout-black-ops-7-2000618270"><span>Gamescom showcase</span></a><span>, but it looks like developer Team Cherry also has something else to share on Thursday.</span></p> <p><span>The studio has scheduled a YouTube video to go up on Thursday, August 21, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time titled “Special Announcement.” There’s really nothing else to go on here beyond a logo and a chat log of people already excitedly waiting for whatever the video is. However, given that the game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rog-ally-gamescom-demo-1851787121"><span>playable at Gamescom</span></a><span>, there’s enough reason to be cautiously optimistic that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is finally, after all this time, imminent, and coming to a console near you. Here’s the scheduled video if you want to save it for Thursday, or just hang out with the rest of the sickos waiting in the chat.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong </span></i><span>was first announced in 2019, just two years after the original game launched in 2017. Since then, the game’s absence from any and every video game showcase has been felt so deeply that hoping and praying for its arrival has become an ongoing joke for the series’ fans, as well as passersby who loved to clown on fans every time the game didn’t show up. Now, it seems, the drought is finally over. Hopefully, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is coming soon. If it is, you’ll be able to play it just about anywhere, as the game is coming to both current and last-gen consoles, as well as PC, Mac, and Linux devices. Strap in, folks. After six years of waiting, the ride is about to begin.</span></p>
