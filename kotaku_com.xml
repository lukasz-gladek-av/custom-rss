            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There were always three big possibilities for why <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-far-cry-stock-announcement-delayed-2000644091">Ubisoft had cryptically delayed</a> its latest earnings report just minutes after it was already supposed to go live. The first was a big injection of new cash, say from a sovereign wealth fund like Saudi Arabia’s. The second was an outright sale of a major portion of the company, maybe to its current backstop investor Tencent. The third was much more mundane: an accounting error. After a week of speculation, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> publisher confirmed that was indeed the reason for the delay.</p> <p>Ubisoft explained on its conference call before markets opened in France this morning that the accounting issue had to do with new auditors brought in earlier this year to review the company’s books. They determined money from various business partnerships (one last year and one this year) needed to be recognized differently in the company’s accounting. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/ubisofts-quarterly-bookings-beat-guidance-tencent-deal-helps-cut-debt-2025-11-21/">As <em>Reuters</em> reports</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results"><em>Game File</em></a>), this mattered because the new math put the publisher in breach of its “leverage covenant ratio” for various loans, i.e. too much debt and not enough money coming in.</p>

 <p>In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52w2Cas6xfQjegpCgP1SZC/b38c338a1bf6f365849a50d2f182d061/Ubisoft_FY26_H1_Earnings_PR_EN_vF.pdf">earnings press release</a>, the company says it will use the recent $1.35 billion bailout from Tencent to pay off some of this debt and get more generous financing terms in order to “support its strategic ambitions, in line with the broader transformation currently underway.” Ubisoft doesn’t say what the business deals that led to the accounting snafu were for, but does claim that it out-performed estimates last quarter in part due to “stronger-than-expected partnerships.” It could be anything from TV and licensing deals to Game Pass revenue (Microsoft paid to add a bunch of the company’s old games to the service for its recent price hike). TL;DR: Ubisoft didn’t get sold, at least not yet.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em> remake could be coming in March</h2> <p>Reports of the <em>Rabbids</em>‘ maker’s demise would seem greatly exaggerated. Ubisoft won’t provide actual sales figures for this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> but said the release was “overperforming.” It also pointed to <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>The Division 2</em>, and a bunch of older games for why it beat revenue estimates by over $50 million, with bookings up 39 percent year-on-year.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft has always been the <a href="https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-moneyball-memes-streaming-1851127017"><em>Moneyball</em> of the video game publishing world</a>. It has no single mega hit like <em>EA Sports FC</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em> that can print mountains of cash on demand every year, but it does try to recreate those effects in the aggregate with a sprawling library of massive games—<em>Far Cry 6</em>, <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, over a dozen <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games in almost as many years—that regularly go on sale for up to 90 percent off.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft also teased its upcoming slate of releases which include the <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake, <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em>, <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, and an “unannounced title” coming out before April 2026. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> the mystery release is the<em> Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em> remake we <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">first reported on back in 2023</a>. It will reportedly included some overhauled game systems and more of the open-world RPG feel of recent entries in the franchise. The company is probably looking at the recent monster success of<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> and hoping for even a fraction of the same nostalgic hype.</p>

 <p>But all of this is only filling a hole left by the fact that Ubisoft still can’t seem to get some of its biggest sequels out the door. That includes <em>Far Cry 7</em>, the new <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and the more-than-a-decade-in-the-making <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em></a>. Solving this development pipeline issue is seemingly at the heart of an operational overhaul Ubisoft promises to announce early next year. Long a spider-web of interoperable co-development studios scattered all over the world, the company is pledging to concentrate decision making in franchise-based “creative houses” for “stronger creative vision, greater focus, efficiency, autonomy and accountability.” Is that real change, or just a line from ChatGPT that some intern at McKinsey consulting thought sounded good?</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft embraces gen AI as gaming’s next ‘3D revolution’</h2> <p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wants investors to know he’s completely onboard <a href="https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-game-reddit-steam-reviews-2000645900">with AI</a>. Here’s what he said on today’s call <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results">per <em>Game File</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams…It’s as big as a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front.</p></blockquote> <p>He says the company is running full-tilt into the future of the controversial tech from two directions: “groundbreaking player-facing generative AI applications” like <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-writing-scriptwriting-ghostwriter-machine-1850250316">neo NPCs</a> that fill bespoke game worlds with LLM chatbots and, on the development side, with teams “in our studios and offices embracing this new technology and constantly exploring new use cases in programming, art and overall game quality.<em>”</em></p> <p>There are also two ways to interpret these commitments. The first is that Ubisoft has traditionally lagged behind competitors in market-leading breakthroughs and doesn’t want to be once again playing catch-up if, say, AI-made and operated MMORPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">slop-fests</a> are the future. The other is that the company is still very vulnerable; its stock price, while better after today’s news, is still in the toilet, and it needs to stick to the shareholder-approved script, unlike certain companies whose <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">CEOs&nbsp;may have more of a license to speak their minds</a> with a <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>-sized trump card sitting in their pocket.</p> <p>Either way, the AI stuff could all still be a dead end. Remember Scalar? It’s Ubisoft’s ambitious, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-scalar-cloud-assassins-creed-far-cry-open-world-1848680977">cloud-based development technology</a> meant to make game engines function like the internet. It <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-scalar-cloud-assassins-creed-far-cry-open-world-1848680977">threatened fans</a> with even more massive game maps filled with even more quest icons. It has yet to materialize into anything big outside of the company, and one of the major projects utilizing it within Ubisoft has been continually rebooted. Some of the big names espousing Scalar’s virtues years ago? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeropage?originalSubdomain=se">No longer with the company</a>.</p> <p>We’ll see if <em>Assassin’s ChatGPT</em> ends up having the same half-life.</p>

              <p><span>Well, that was fun while it lasted.

The design originates from a </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasakis-cursed-micro-bikini-look-from-banned-kirby-fangame-gets-revival-in-air-riders-custom-machine-market/"><span>banned fan game</span></a><span> and went on to become a meme in the Japanese </span><i><span>Kirby </span></i><span>community, so it’s entirely possible this is just an extension of Nintendo and </span><i><span>Kirby </span></i><span>developer HAL Laboratory trying to wipe the scantily clad chef from existence. However, as of this writing, there’s still a bikini-wearing Kawasaki on the </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>’ marketplace, though it’s not quite as revealing.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-pro-m4-pro-chip-512gb-hits-new-record-low-apple-clears-stock-as-m5-chip-arrives-2000646132</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/macbook-pro-m4-pro-chip-512gb-hits-new-record-low-apple-clears-stock-as-m5-chip-arrives.1360717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just announced its M5 chip a few weeks ago but this <strong>MacBook Pro with M4 Pro remains an incredibly powerful machine</strong> that handles almost all professional workflows with ease. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5787/">record low pricing at $1,749 on Amazon for the 24GB/512GB model, down from $1,999</a>, makes it more compelling than most MacBooks currently available.</p>
<p>The model sits as the <strong>#1 best-seller among MacBook Pros on Amazon</strong> and the reason becomes clear when you consider the specs at this price point. Apple never runs discounts directly on its website or in its retail stores, so hitting up retailers like Amazon during Black Friday is the only way to score legitimate discounts on current-generation MacBooks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop-Class Performance</h2>
<p>The 12-core CPU splits down into <strong>eight performance cores and four efficiency cores</strong> and makes quick work of everything from video editing to the compilation of software. The architecture executes the resource-intensive tasks much faster compared to the previous M3 Pro, drawing less power in the process, which puts more runtime on your battery when doing intensive work. Real-world performance reveals stutter-free 4K video timeline scrubbing, instant photo filter application across hundreds of images, and code compilation that completes before you finish your coffee.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-core GPU</strong> provides graphics performance that’s competitive with discrete graphics in much pricier Windows laptops. You can edit multi-layer 8K video projects, work with intricate 3D models, or run demanding creative apps like Cinema 4D without thermal throttling. Gaming performance is above expectations for a Mac, with AAA titles running at high settings and maintaining smooth frame rates. A u<strong>nified memory architecture sees the GPU tapping into the same 24GB pool as the CPU</strong>&nbsp;which diminishes bottlenecks normally associated with traditional discrete graphics arrangements.</p>



<p>The 24GB of unified memory handles professional workloads that choke systems with less RAM. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple creative applications at the same time, and switch between projects without any hint of slowdowns. The unified architecture means this 24GB functions more efficiently than traditional RAM since both CPU and GPU access it directly.</p>
<p>The display on the <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR is capable of 1000 nits of sustained brightness and peaks at 1600 nits for HDR content</strong>. Mini-LED backlighting enables true blacks with excellent contrast that makes on-screen content pop. Color accuracy meets professional levels right out of the box, thanks to P3 wide color gamut coverage that will satisfy even photographers and video editors. The <strong>screen refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> courtesy of <em>ProMotion</em> makes scrolling feel butter-smooth and helps alleviate eye strain during extended work sessions.</p>



<p>That’s also <strong>18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of actual work</strong> mixing web browsing, document editing, and creative applications. You can work through a full day without hunting for outlets, and that transforms the way you approach mobile productivity. The <em>MagSafe</em> charging connection means that accidental cable yanks won’t send your laptop flying, and you still have both Thunderbolt ports free for peripherals.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration brings <strong>AI features right to the operating system</strong>, from advanced text editing suggestions all the way to picture generation tools within native apps. All of these AI-related tasks are processed locally by the M4 Pro’s Neural Engine for data privacy and speed. These features keep evolving through new software updates, adding value during the life of the laptop.</p>
<p>You’re getting here a professional-grade laptop with M4 Pro performance for $250 less than Apple’s direct pricing, at $1,749. Similar Windows laptops are $2,500 or more and lack the efficiency and battery life that Apple Silicon delivers.</p>

              <p>The PS5 launched in 2022 and maintained strict pricing for years, with Sony rarely offering any meaningful discounts even during major shopping events. This marks the first year the console sees genuine Black Friday price cuts, and these deals appear exclusively on Amazon. The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/"> PS5 Slim with disc drive drops to $449 from $549</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5802/">Digital Edition hits $399 instead of $499</a>. Both represent <strong>all-time low pricing for 2025</strong>&nbsp;and stock moves fast given the pent-up demand from years of limited availability and no discounts.</p>

<h2>Disc Drive vs. Digital Edition</h2>
<p>The $449 <strong>disc drive version plays physical game discs and 4K Blu-ray movies and gives you flexibility in how you buy games</strong>: You can purchase used games, borrow from friends, sell titles you’ve finished, or take advantage of retail sales that often beat digital pricing. The physical media option preserves your ability to own games rather than licensing them digitally, which matters when publishers remove titles from digital stores. The 4K Blu-ray player adds value if you collect physical movies or want the best possible video quality without compression artifacts from streaming.</p>
<p>The $399 Digital Edition drops the disc drive altogether and saves <strong>you a cool $50 and making the console slightly lighter and more symmetrical in design</strong>. You download all games and content from the PlayStation Store, which means no disc swapping and instant access to your library. Digital purchases go on sale regularly through PlayStation Store promotions, and you can game share with one other person through console sharing settings. The <strong>trade-off is in losing resale valu</strong>e and being locked into whatever pricing Sony sets digitally.</p>



<p><strong>Both versions pack the same internal hardware for identical gaming performance</strong>. A custom AMD GPU based on the RDNA 2 architecture handles ray tracing, 4K resolution at up to 120fps in supported games, and variable refresh rate for smoother visuals. An 8-core Zen 2 CPU will process game logic and AI calculations with plenty of headroom for demanding titles, while 16GB GDDR6 of unified memory ensures smooth performance without bottlenecks between CPU and GPU operations.</p>
<p>The bespoke 825GB SSD fundamentally changes how games load and operate. Load times often fall from minutes to mere seconds, while some games offer near-instant fast travel. For the first time, developers can stream assets in real time rather than rely on loading corridors or elevator rides to mask transfers of data on high-speed storage. This storage architecture is the single biggest generational leap the PS5 offers over PS4 and transforms how games feel to play.</p>
<p><strong>The DualSense controller included offers haptic feedback</strong> which replaces the rumble feature of old with precise, intricate vibrations that simulate everything from textures to feelings. Adaptive triggers will create resistance that changes depending on what’s happening in-game, from the tension of drawing a bow to the recoil of different weapons. These features add immersion that previous controllers couldn’t achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Backward compatibility with PS4 games</strong> means your existing library carries forward, with many titles receiving performance boosts on PS5 hardware. Games run at higher frame rates, load faster, and sometimes receive resolution upgrades without requiring separate purchases. The PS Plus collection includes access to a curated selection of PS4 classics at no additional cost beyond the subscription.</p>
<p>At $449 for the disc version and $399 for digital, these are the best PS5 pricing we have seen this year. The disc model saves you $100 while keeping physical media flexibility, while the digital edition drops down to impulse-purchase territory for anyone holding out. These Black Friday prices on Amazon finally get the PS5 into a place where it’s accessible without the markup or bundles that dominated availability for years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-mini-4k-goes-cheaper-than-budget-no-name-drones-amazon-shows-all-time-low-to-clear-out-stock-2000646105</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-mini-4k-goes-cheaper-than-budget-no-name-drones-amazon-shows-all-time-low-to-clear-out-stock.1360684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most drone photography involves FAA registration, learning about Remote ID requirements and other regulatory hurdles before ever taking to the skies. However, the <strong>DJI Mini 4K weighs less than 249 grams</strong> which means it falls beneath the threshold requiring registration for recreational flights here in the United States (this is why it’s also among the most popular ones). You can purchase this drone, charge the battery and be flying in a matter of minutes-no paperwork or waiting periods required. The good news is,Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/"> just dropped this to $239 for Black Friday, down from the usual $299</a>, which marks the lowest price this model has ever hit.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4K Quality Without the Registration Hassle</h2>
<p>The <strong>footage from the 4K Ultra HD camera</strong> appears professional straight out of the drone. It features a resolution of 3840 x 2160 that retains sharpness whether you fly over landscape views, shoot action sequences, or close-up captures of subjects. The <strong>3-axis gimbal mechanically stabilizes the camera</strong>, and compensates in real time for movements of the drone and turbulence of wind. This stabilization translates to smooth footage even when the drone shifts position-a quality that lacks in amateur videos taken by drones.</p>
<p>It operates well under a variety of illumination conditions, ranging from <strong>bright midday sun to golden hour sunsets and even low-light evening scenes</strong>. You are able to shoot sunrise footage without the blown-out highlights that cheaper cameras display, and sunset shots retain color saturation without losing shadow detail. Night shooting is also better than expected for a drone in this price range, although you will want to keep the shutter speeds reasonable to avoid excessive noise.</p>



<p>The<strong> 10km video transmission</strong> range gives you serious operational distance without losing signal. You can fly the drone far enough to explore large areas, follow moving subjects over extended distances, or capture sweeping panoramic shots. The impressive thing about the video transmission system is that it maintains quality across this range, so you see what the camera sees in real time without lag or pixelation. This range far exceeds what budget drones offer and matches what you’d find in models costing twice as much.</p>
<p>Wind resistance up to Level 5 conditions means the <strong>drone stays stable in 38kph winds</strong>. The brushless motors provide consistent power that maintains accurate positioning of the drone even when gusts hit. This capability is important if one flies over coastal areas, mountains, or any other place where the wind might suddenly change. It also <strong>enables takeoffs at altitudes of 4,000 meters or higher</strong>&nbsp;which is useful for mountain photography or high-elevation adventures.</p>



<p>The <strong>31-minute flight time</strong> from a single battery gives you enough airtime to set up shots, experiment with angles, and capture the footage you want without constantly landing to swap batteries. You can shoot thoroughly around a location or film an entire sequence uninterrupted.</p>
<p>GPS R<em>eturn to Home</em> automatically activates in cases of a low battery or if the connection drops. It flies back to its takeoff point and lands itself, hence avoiding crashes or lost equipment. It enables beginners who might lose their orientation or misjudge the battery levels to be at ease. <strong>One-touch takeoff and landing</strong> simplify operations, freeing you to work on capturing shots rather than managing controls.</p>
<p>QuickShots modes automatically handle complicated camera movements with pre-programmed flight patterns. Helix circles your subject while ascending, Dronie pulls back and up for reveal shots, <strong>Rocket shoots straight up, Circle orbits around a point, and Boomerang</strong> creates looping paths. These automated modes produce professional-looking results without requiring piloting skills or manual camera control. You choose the mode, select the subject, and the drone performs the shot.</p>
<p>You’re getting here a 4K drone with proper stabilization, extended range, and intelligent features for under $239-what most 1080p budget models cost. Its weight of under 249 grams eliminates requirements to register it, thereby removing barriers that stop people from trying drone photography. <strong>Besides its beginner-friendly controls and automatic safety features,</strong> this very much makes 4K quality accessible to anyone interested in aerial photography.</p>

              <p>Amazon shows a <em>“hidden price”</em> on the PS VR2 bundle, rather than the standard retail price because Sony’s contracts with retailers limit how certain deals can be advertised. But the real <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">list price is $299, down from the usual $399, which makes this Black Friday deal an all-time low</a> for the <strong>headset bundled with Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>. This pricing has propelled the bundle to <strong>#1 best-seller</strong> status in its category, and if you already own a PS5, this is the perfect entry point into serious VR gaming.</p>

<h2>Eye Tracking and Sense Technology Redefine VR Immersion</h2>
<p>Because the eye-tracking system monitors where you look in real time, it allows games to <strong>render details precisely where your gaze focuses</strong>. That advantage brought about foveated rendering, a technique whereby PS VR2 delivers sharper visuals in the direct line of sight while doing less processing on peripheral areas. Characters in games can respond to eye contact. This enables <strong>a lot more natural interaction</strong> that simply wasn’t possible with previous systems.</p>
<p><strong>Headset feedback</strong> adds another sensory layer through subtle vibrations that sync with in-game actions. You feel the rush of air as something flies by your head or the impact when objects collide near you. The 3D audio creates a complete sound environment where you can pinpoint exactly where sounds originate, whether that’s footsteps behind you or wind coming from a specific direction.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K HDR visuals boast 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye</strong>, and drastically reduces the screen door effect that plagued earlier VR headsets. Text comes out crisp and readable, distant objects retain detail, and overall image quality approaches what you would get from a high-end monitor. The HDR capability means brighter highlights and deeper blacks give scenes more depth and realism.</p>
<p>The <strong>110-degree FOV offers wide peripheral vision</strong> that aids in keeping the feeling of immersion intact since more of your visual space is filled. You don’t feel like you’re looking through binoculars, which was one of the complaints of headsets with narrower FOV. These lenses also reduce distortion at the edges to keep the image clear across the full field of view.</p>



<p>The Sense controllers introduce haptic feedback similar to the DualSense gamepad, allowing you to feel textures and impacts through your hands. Adaptive triggers create resistance that changes based on what you’re doing, whether that’s drawing a bow or squeezing a trigger. Finger touch detection tracks where your fingers rest on the controller without requiring you to press buttons, enabling more natural hand gestures and interactions. These controllers are a significant upgrade from previous VR input methods that have relied on simple button presses.</p>
<p>It comes with <strong>Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>, a game that shows what PS VR2 can do: it was built for this hardware, taking advantage of eye tracking, haptic feedback, and visuals. You climb mountains with natural hand movements, manipulate the environment with gesture controls, and experience the Horizon universe in a completely new way. The bundle gives you immediate access to premium VR content without needing to buy games separately.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting Sony’s latest VR technology bundled with a full game for $100 less than the standard price. Eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K HDR visuals put this headset above most competitors that cost significantly more. This is the most accessible pricing the PS VR2 has received, and including Horizon Call of the Mountain adds immediate value.</p>
