              <p>It’s officially last-minute-panic time with just a week left to get your presents bought and wrapped, and the number of items on Amazon with the “arrives before Christmas” is dwindling, and dwindling&nbsp;<em>fast</em>. Our advice? Don’t panic, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">take a quick look at this awesome 36% off deal on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet</a>. It’s one of those rare tablets that’s kid-friendly while not being a glorified toy, so it’s a stellar $140 last-minute option for friends and family from young to old.</p>
<p>This 11-inch tablet comes with a robust 7,040mAh battery for hours of games, streaming, or actual work. Split-screen capability lets you run and see multiple apps simultaneously, and the slim and lightweight construction is good for little hands while also being tough enough to endure the occasional knocks and bumps that go hand in hand with kids using tech devices.</p>

<h2>Travel Sanity Saver</h2>
<p>There’s really not a bad time to share the Galaxy A9+ with the kids, but the time for it to truly shine is when you’re taking a trip and need something — <em>anything</em> — to maintain sanity as you’re buckled in for a long flight or drive. The Galaxy Tab A9+ isn’t one of those kids-only tablets that keeps its allure for a short while before the conversation turns to “I want to use&nbsp;<em>your</em> tablet.” Nor is it a high-priced device that you hand over very reluctantly for fear of damage. Pass it to the backseat, or hand it across the aisle of the plane, fire up the Samsung Kids app, and rest easy while they’re engrossed in only the content you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>Chances are that will include some streaming or videos, and the Galaxy A9+ brings that out in vivid fashion across its generous 11-inch screen with 1200p resolution and a brisk 90Hz refresh rate. The built-in speakers are loaded with Dolby Atmos tech for cinema-quality sound, or you can easily pair the A9+ tablet with wireless headphones or earbuds to keep the sound private. Preloading the Galaxy A9+ is easy when you have a generous 64GB of built-in storage and microSD card expansion options.</p>



<h2>Do It All for $150</h2>
<p>Once back in your hands (assuming you can actually get it back), the Galaxy A9+ is a stellar midrange tablet at an entry-level price. It’s especially good if you’re adding it to other Samsung tech products, from big-screen TVs to smart home devices, smartphones, and wireless earbuds. Casting content from the Galaxy A9+ to a Samsung smart TV is remarkably easy, and you can hand off calls and texts from a Samsung smartphone to the Galaxy Tab A9+ and take them across the house, even if you leave the phone behind.</p>
<p>Last-minute holiday shopping panic isn’t fun. But the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is, for adults and kids alike. It’s also the cure for your shopping anxiety because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">Amazon’s offering it for a crazy low $140 price and they can get it to you in time to make it under the tree.</a></p>
