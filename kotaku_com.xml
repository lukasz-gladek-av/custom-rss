In eight award-worthy episodes of <em>The Penguin, </em>Cobb has dismantled the Maroni crime family, inspired mutinies in all of the rival gangs, and is figuratively and literally on top of Gotham. Although Gotham produces a new villain every day, for now, Oz is the king. And he’s already shown how he can influence the media and politics, making him even more formidable.</p><p>The biggest confirmation of Oz being Batman’s next nemesis is in the last scene of <em>The Penguin </em>when Eve Karlo (Carmen Ejogo), creepily cosplaying as Cobb’s mother, tells him there’s nothing in his way of Gotham being his, just before someone gets the bright idea to send the bat signal into the sky.

While Batman was solving riddles and doing the most brooding version of flirting with Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), Sofia Gigante was being drugged, electrocuted, and assaulted in Arkham Asylum thanks to Cobb. Now that she’s back in Arkham Asylum because of the same person, Batman may have gained an ally he doesn’t know he has yet.</p><p>In the comics, Gigante is secretly the serial killer The Hangman, an identity she denies is hers in the show, and runs into issues with Batman. Even if she isn’t The Hangman in <em>The Penguin</em>, she’s shown she’s a ruthless tactician willing to bomb an already decimated community like Crown Point if it means blowing up Cobb’s operation in the process. It would be safe to assume the only joy Gigante feels is the recurring thought of how she will enact revenge on Penguin. Why not let your half-sister’s love interest help do the job for you?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Corruption in Gotham is like sand in the desert. In episode six of <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb spoke about politicians diverting resources like electricity and infrastructure repair to richer communities instead of to the poorer communities like Crown Point that are living in rubble and FEMA tents. In<em> Batman </em>lore, this type of nefarious prejudice is usually the work of one shadowy cabal, The Court of Owls. </p><p>This is a secret society comprised of the wealthiest and most influential people who control every part of Gotham, yet only exist to most of the citizens as an urban legend. The classist divide in the city was a main motivator for The Riddler, who grew up as a poor orphan, targeting corrupt wealthy individuals who he felt abandoned those with similar upbringings. That insidious elitism, along with Gotham’s criminal hierarchy being in flux thanks to Cobb and Gigante’s turf war, might be enough for the true rulers of Gotham to come out of the shadows in <em>The Batman Part II</em>.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In two episodes, the Maroni crime family succession tree was dismantled after Cobb set fire to matriarch Nadia Maroni (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and heir to the throne Taj Maroni (Aria Shahghasemi), before fighting head of the family Salvatore Maroni (Clancy Brown) to the point of a heart attack. </p><p>The Maroni family is no joke and played a pivotal role in <em>The Batman</em>, as Salvatore tried blackmailing Batman’s father Thomas Wayne while he was running for mayor by threatening to release information about his wife Martha Wayne’s struggles with mental illness. This led to a domino effect where Thomas inadvertently got the journalist killed by Carmine Falcone after asking the crime boss to only threaten them into silence, and then got himself killed when he tried to turn Falcone in. In a not-so-roundabout way, the Maroni family is responsible for Batman losing his parents. </p><p>Now, that the heads of the family are gone, is there a long lost familial successor looking to take on the mantle and, as a result, the ire of Batman?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the biggest missteps the movie made that was fixed in the show was the relatively little time fans got to spend in the playground of nightmares that is Arkham Asylum.

Given the fact she’s back in her old, deranged stomping grounds, and the best <em>Batman</em> villains are in Arkham, <em>The Batman Part II </em>would be foolish to treat it like a side quest after <em>The Penguin</em> made us want to live in that world for longer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gotham is fun, but it’s just one city. Both the movie and the show keep all of the action inside the murderous metropolis. But, in <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb mentioned a few times how partnering with the Chinese crime syndicate The Triads could take his operation international. Now that they not only agreed to join his alliance with the other rival gangs of Gotham, but also had internal mutinies that helped Cobb ascend to the top of Gotham’s crime world, it looks like it’s only a matter of time before we see the true scope of Gotham’s influence beyond the city limits. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros/Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Carmine Falcone spread his seed far and wide, and somehow produced two of the most badass women to ever hit Gotham. Kyle may have despondently left the city after deeming it beyond saving at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, but we all know the woman who eventually becomes Catwoman always crawls back to the city that made her. And her letter to her imprisoned half-sister at the end of <em>The Penguin</em>’s season finale is her first step back home.</p><p>Kyle’s letter not only woke Gigante out of her catatonic gaze, but brought a smile to her face. This is arguably the most compelling wrinkle that <em>The Penguin </em>adds to <em>The Batman Part II</em>’s storyline. What could she have possibly written that would make a woman, who could be facing death in prison, feel joy? Did she congratulate her on wiping out multiple crime families, including the one they were both born to and victimized by? Did she let her know that she thinks she’s innocent (she isn’t) and she was framed (she wasn’t)? Or, maybe she told her a plan she has to get her sister out so they can enact her revenge alongside her lover boy Batman?</p><p>Whatever she wrote, <em>The Batman Part II </em>needs to find a way to make that a catalyst for the sisterly meet-up we all want. Plus, I’m sure if you have undeniable talent like Kravitz and Milioti in your cinematic universe, you’re legally obligated to make them share the screen. Or, you should be. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Batman</em> director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Reeves told us</a></span> from the start that Batman wouldn’t been swooping in to save the day in <em>The Penguin </em>because the show was meant to focus solely on telling the story of Gotham’s underworld, not how Batman fights their crimes. That’s all well and good, but we’re going to need to know what this man was doing while another bomb was set off in Crown Point and the entire Falcone family’s murder was plastered all over the news only weeks after he couldn’t stop The Riddler from blowing up the sea wall and flooding the city. How much prep time does this man need?! </p><p>It’s going to ultimately be amazing when Batman returns into this expanded underworld in <em>The Batman Part II, </em>but it would really insult our intelligence if there aren’t parts of the movie where Batman at least acknowledges he was aware of the events that transpired in <em>The Penguin </em>and let’s us in on what the world’s greatest detective was doing with his time. It wouldn’t just satiate fans, it would further solidify <em>The Batman</em> universe being built in front of our eyes.</p><p>Now that the bat signal has been shined in the sky, it’s time to go to work. We, and our questions, will be waiting.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But that doesn’t mean players will have to wait several months before the game’s first new cards appear. There’s also an A1a booster pack event starting around December 17 which seems like it could be part of a smaller, mid-season mini-expansion. That’s a good thing if it turns out to be accurate, as anyone playing daily up to that point will have likely filled out much of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s existing Pokédex outside of the rarest cards. </p><p>Other significant milestones in the datamind findings <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">point to a new store update</a></span> on December 1, as well as something Bulbasuar-themed appearing in the weeks after that.

Two new Barbie dolls have been released, to coincide with the imminent release of the movie version of hit musical <em>Wicked</em>, based on the characters of Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, and Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West (Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo). Each is released in the traditional cardboard box, and as ever, it’s covered in all sorts of tiny writing almost no one ever reads. However, those who did read the fine print on the new dolls got quite a shock when they followed the URL listed for the products.</p><p>It’s easy to see how the mistake was made. The address on the boxes is “www.wicked.com,” which makes sense, right? Except, that takes you to porn site Wicked, owned by Dutch company Digigamma, a company that says it “specializes in running and managing high risk e-commerce businesses.”</p><p>Presumably the intention had been to point people toward Universal’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/wicked&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/wicked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.wickedmovie.com</a></span>, but someone at Mattel assumed the production company had done a better job of scooping up URLs.</p><p>The Wicked porn site must have already been doing a roaring trade in mistaken traffic, long before the Barbie goof. The musical has been an astonishing hit since 2003, sitting on Broadway and touring worldwide ever since. The movie itself will have added to that, with early word suggesting it’s going to be <em>very</em> good. But Barbie has pushed it into the mainstream, with news sites jumping on the error.<br></p><p>Mattel told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span> that it “deeply regrets” the incident, and the doll was removed from sale in stores like Target, Walmart and Kohl’s by the end of Sunday, the 10th.

But that doesn’t mean we can’t still discuss the series and reflect on its history while BioWare forges its future. Somehow, we’ve never done a ranking of the <em>Mass Effect </em>squadmates. While I would love to throw the <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda </em>characters into the mix, those intergalactic explorers have only gotten one game that was clearly building up to a continuation we haven’t gotten. So, rather than pit characters with unfinished stories against people with complete, messy, trilogy-long arcs, we’ll just rank the original squad from the first three games. Grab your omni-tool and let’s dive in.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a632ea56177a9709cc4dc8fd3282b853" data-recommend-id="image://a632ea56177a9709cc4dc8fd3282b853" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob plays an arcade game in front of Alliance students." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob plays an arcade game in front of Alliance students." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a632ea56177a9709cc4dc8fd3282b853" data-recommend-id="image://a632ea56177a9709cc4dc8fd3282b853" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob plays an arcade game in front of Alliance students." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jacob Taylor is a tragic example of a character being mishandled at nearly every turn. On the surface, a man who has been disenfranchised by the usual channels resorting to joining an extremist group because no one else will listen can be a compelling basis for a character. It sure sounds buck wild to look back on, but it’s pretty in line with the <em>24</em>-esque, Bush-era politics of the franchise. But from then on, Jacob becomes an inconsistently written, often carelessly handled party member.</p><p>He goes back and forth between whether or not he trusts protagonist Commander Shepard, stops being so personable, and then his personal story with his father ends up falling into some weird Black stereotypes that are hard to swallow. It only gets worse in <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>as BioWare decided to use some untoward methods to make Jacob the only love interest who leaves Shepard in the final game, and it’s just a big ol’ bummer to look back on.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="78d91e38becfb3dbefe3985f1b524e51" data-recommend-id="image://78d91e38becfb3dbefe3985f1b524e51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James throws a punch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="78d91e38becfb3dbefe3985f1b524e51" data-recommend-id="image://78d91e38becfb3dbefe3985f1b524e51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>James Vega exists as <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s new player insert. He’s a younger soldier who gets dragged into Shepard’s crew more or less by accident and seems pretty ignorant of the ways of the extended galactic society. So, he asks a lot of questions that a newbie might ask about why the Krogans and Turians hate each other and is pretty much a fish out of water for most of the game.</p><p>He can be endearing and heartfelt when he wants to be, and his friendship with shuttle pilot Steve Cortez is delightful. But he also flirts with female Shepard and the relationship systems in <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>never really let you put out that fire and also maintain a decent friendship with him. He feels like one final relic of a moment in <em>Mass Effect </em>that probably wouldn’t fly these days, and as the only character on this list who is only around for one game, he has the least amount of time to make a bigger impression.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="75a1278ef671a1f84545ac7cfc5c7245" data-recommend-id="image://75a1278ef671a1f84545ac7cfc5c7245" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zaeed looks into a crane machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zaeed looks into a crane machine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="75a1278ef671a1f84545ac7cfc5c7245" data-recommend-id="image://75a1278ef671a1f84545ac7cfc5c7245" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zaeed looks into a crane machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Both Zaeed and Kasumi suffer as <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s DLC squadmates who get demonstrably less material to work with across their appearances in the last two games. But damn, bounty hunter Zaeed Masaani is truly elevated by the late Robin Sachs’ portrayal of the gruff, no-nonsense but also kinda sassy old man. Zaeed is an absolutely unhinged gun for hire who is more than willing to put people in the line of fire for his own goals, while also putting his own life on the line for a big enough paycheck. He’s a series of enjoyable contradictions, as he’s one of the most terrifying people on the ship who’s frequently in some of the funniest scenes in the trilogy. It’s just a shame that he feels so underutilized, but that’s what happens when only a fraction of the player base is going to ever see him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="528bed371bb13b9299111f6db78ae1df" data-recommend-id="image://528bed371bb13b9299111f6db78ae1df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ashley looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ashley looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="528bed371bb13b9299111f6db78ae1df" data-recommend-id="image://528bed371bb13b9299111f6db78ae1df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ashley looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of underutilized characters, I have a soft spot for the original <em>Mass Effect</em>’s human squadmates, but I think only one gets their due (we’ll get to him later). Ashley Williams, meanwhile, starts off as a really strong concept for a party member that could truly grow across the span of a trilogy. She begins as a military brat turned proper soldier herself, though her family’s history is a bit spotty. Because of her family’s relationship with other alien races, she comes in with a skepticism that she’s only comfortable voicing to Shepard because they’re also human, and, in theory, seeing a human character reckon with their past prejudiced beliefs makes for a compelling trilogy-long arc.</p><p>The trouble is, <em>Mass Effect 3</em> never truly gets there. You have a game with party members who are giving their lives as they subvert past prejudiced beliefs, but Ashley can’t so much as muster a sentence about how she used to be racist but has come to love and care for aliens she once judged. Sorry, girl. You’re another example of the <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy not quite delivering on its promises.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d3b156a0016b8821f33b4bfdec88d1c" data-recommend-id="image://6d3b156a0016b8821f33b4bfdec88d1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kasumi is shown wearing a hood and talking to someone off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kasumi is shown wearing a hood and talking to someone off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d3b156a0016b8821f33b4bfdec88d1c" data-recommend-id="image://6d3b156a0016b8821f33b4bfdec88d1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kasumi is shown wearing a hood and talking to someone off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As previously mentioned, Kasumi Goto suffers quite a bit as a DLC character like Zaeed. But she’s also a big personality that makes the most of her limited screen time. The thief sometimes feels a little out of place in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s squad of soldiers, biotics, and tech wizards, but she also facilitates one of the game’s coolest missions in the form of an elaborate heist. She’s one of the most unabashedly fun characters on the roster and manages to be consistently funny and charming without devolving into something quippy and groan-worthy. But again, she’s just not utilized as much because people had to pay to have her around.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="191d8e4859111b76beef2fa151a68d0d" data-recommend-id="image://191d8e4859111b76beef2fa151a68d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Samara uses her biotics to fling an enemy aside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Samara uses her biotics to fling an enemy aside." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="191d8e4859111b76beef2fa151a68d0d" data-recommend-id="image://191d8e4859111b76beef2fa151a68d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Samara uses her biotics to fling an enemy aside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Asari Justicar Samara is one of the most tragic figures in <em>Mass Effect</em>. She spends hundreds of years searching the galaxy for her daughter Morinth, who was born with a genetic condition that would kill anyone she mated with. As she hunts down her daughter, believing her to be an irredeemable killer drawn to the ecstasy she gets from manipulating and then discarding her prey, she also finds respect and pride for how her daughter fought for her freedom. It’s a multifaceted issue, of course, but Samara is bound by a Justicar code that demands she go to the ends of the galaxy to find and kill her own daughter.</p><p>It’s only natural that she would still feel all the nuance in between her code. There’s something compelling about a character who is more or less “trapped” within the boundaries of a code they’ve sworn an oath to, but what was most compelling to me was how, in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, she decided she would choose death over following it if it meant she must kill the last of her daughters afflicted by the same condition. Though there are ways to stop it, I am still enamored by how even after two games of expressing her devotion to the Justicar code, the woman underneath it still shines through.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c39ca94505d7c1bebafc88c412363879" data-recommend-id="image://c39ca94505d7c1bebafc88c412363879" data-format="jpg" data-width="1680" data-height="944" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grunt looks up at the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Grunt looks up at the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c39ca94505d7c1bebafc88c412363879" data-recommend-id="image://c39ca94505d7c1bebafc88c412363879" data-format="jpg" data-width="1680" data-height="944" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grunt looks up at the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I love my reptilian son. Urdnot Grunt can sometimes feel like the “Wrex replacement,” as the first Krogan squadmate of the trilogy could die in the original <em>Mass Effect </em>and was thus banished from being a party member again until <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s <em>Citadel </em>DLC. But despite them both being hulking tanks in battle, Grunt and Wrex are still demonstrably different characters with separate places in Krogan culture. Grunt is a tank-bred Krogan, which is a loaded position to be in when your people have a 1/1000 birth rate due to a manufactured sterility plague. Grunt’s whole deal is trying to find a place in a world that he was made to be part of, rather than something he was naturally able to integrate into.</p><p>There are Krogan who hope to deny him a place among their people, and others who advocate for him as he stumbles his way through understanding. He sometimes feels like a bull in a china shop, so having people who create the space for him to find himself is a heartwarming thing in a galaxy full of unfriendliness. By the time he makes a great sacrifice in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was sobbing at the loss of my giant alien child, but then I was fist-bumping when he emerged from the wreckage covered and blood and looking for something to eat. His scene in <em>Citadel</em> is also one of the best ones in the game. Grunt rules.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="175ce8fcc39d49d757946f20b28a31c6" data-recommend-id="image://175ce8fcc39d49d757946f20b28a31c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="EDI stands in the common area of the Citadel Presidium.

In <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, she’s portrayed as a spherical hologram that can show up in different places on the ship. She’s deadpan but witty, and it’s clear that despite being an artificial intelligence, she has inclinations toward humanity that shine through her code. However, at the tail end of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, she is unshackled from her programming and is able to eventually inhabit a robotic body in the third game.</p><p>EDI is still one of the most sharply written, funny, and introspective characters in the franchise, and in a vacuum, her attempting to learn what it means to be a person without any previous framework in this universe to look to is fascinating. But it’s hard to feel like all of this introspection is happening for her when so much of her story ends up feeling tied to a possible human/robot relationship with Joker, the Normandy’s pilot.</p><p>The relationship feels uneven, as it wildly swings from Joker being excited about a sexy robot on the ship to trying to get at the heart of how much these two people care about one another. I get what they were going for, and it can help feed into some late-game decisions you can make, but overall, it just feels like swaths of EDI’s existence as a squadmate were reverse-engineered for that relationship. I still love her, though. When she stands on her own, she’s an incredible character.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e5beb7589a3d241341c69559a96ef7fc" data-recommend-id="image://e5beb7589a3d241341c69559a96ef7fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javik looks up at the sky with a shocked expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Javik looks up at the sky with a shocked expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5beb7589a3d241341c69559a96ef7fc" data-recommend-id="image://e5beb7589a3d241341c69559a96ef7fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javik looks up at the sky with a shocked expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Zaeed and Kasumi felt underserved as DLC, <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>pulled out all the stops for Javik, the Prothean soldier awoken from cryo sleep. To be honest, it’s still baffling that he was a DLC character considering how instrumental Javik is to the world of <em>Mass Effect</em>. The Protheans are one of the last-known living species to have fought the invading Reapers that Shepard is fighting in the trilogy, and what happened to them is one of the biggest mysteries that unravels through each game.</p><p>Having Javik be an optional character you had to pay extra money for is baffling, but he’s noetheless one of the most compelling, meaningfully disappointing squadmates the series has to offer. Asari squadmate Liara has spent her life studying the Protheans her entire life, and to find the last living member of an entire race just to learn he’s kind of an asshole who views everyone around him as primitive cavemen <em>hurts</em>.</p><p>But Javik also has some of the most interesting writing in the trilogy. He’s an echo of a civilization long gone, but even if he dares to hope he can help stop a galaxy-wide invasion, what would his life even look like after? He has no contemporaries, the galaxy is looking to him as a source of wisdom, and all he has to give them are war stories and fearmongering. Even as the Milky Way falls around him, Javik is somehow, even if he doesn’t intend to be, a symbol of hope for the war effort. If one person still survives, the war is not lost. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d38e647c4799bc81adb7441e1614485a" data-recommend-id="image://d38e647c4799bc81adb7441e1614485a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kaidan sits at a poker table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kaidan sits at a poker table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d38e647c4799bc81adb7441e1614485a" data-recommend-id="image://d38e647c4799bc81adb7441e1614485a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kaidan sits at a poker table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ashley Williams’ biggest problem is it doesn’t feel like she has an arc. Meanwhile, Kaidan Alenko feels like he’s one of the most underappreciated characters probably in all of BioWare’s portfolio. In a ship of mostly aliens, having a human character dealing with human problems seems unremarkable to some. But Kaidan’s story offers a clear window into the struggles humanity has been dealing with since it joined the galactic community.</p><p>Kaidan is a victim of humans’ insatiable need to be at the forefront of everything, having been subjected to abusive biotic boot camps as he was forced to undergo rigorous training to hone his telekinetic powers. By the time he reaches adulthood, he fears his powers, has frequent headaches, and has become a bit of a wallflower. He goes on to become a biotics teacher in the human military, controls his power, and becomes the second human Spectre. It’s an understated story of not letting your past define your future. But what about when that future seems tenuous? What if you’ve finally gotten your life together and then the world is ending around you? Kaidan’s story isn’t the most theatrical or dramatic, but it is one of the most grounded in a series defined by galactic-scale wars and life-changing choices.</p><p>Kaidan is the lead of a rom-com, running to Shepard as the Reapers rain hellfire down on everything they’ve known and loved. When the two meet one last time on Earth at the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, he recounts his life and the things he’s done and thanks Shepard for the life he’s lived, hoping that there will still be more of it when the dust settles.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cccbb2c1f28f43c11dc55c8379d699fc" data-recommend-id="image://cccbb2c1f28f43c11dc55c8379d699fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jack holds a gun and is hidden behind cover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jack holds a gun and is hidden behind cover." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cccbb2c1f28f43c11dc55c8379d699fc" data-recommend-id="image://cccbb2c1f28f43c11dc55c8379d699fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jack holds a gun and is hidden behind cover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jack and Kaidan are two interesting mirror images of one another. Both are victims of the abuses put on biotics to achieve some imagined version of human superiority, but at the hands of two different institutions. Jack’s mistreatment at the hands of Cerberus led her down a much different path. She had a lot of lives before she joined the Normandy. She was a pirate, a mercenary, and had even joined a cult. Her tattoos all tell the stories of the lives she’s lived, and that elaborate tapestry paints a picture of who she is.</p><p>Jack starts out as a foul-mouthed punk who puts up walls, but as Shepard and the crew chip away at her armor, she learns to trust a team of close-knit people once more. When she shows up in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, she’s a changed woman, mostly. No longer a loner, she’s dedicating her time to building a better future for biotic kids so no one has to go through what she has. Some might take issue with the hokey way she has a swear jar, but I think it’s sweet to see how she is having to adapt to polite society after spending most of her life throwing middle fingers at it. It’s funny!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86eabbad76c8f11191f209d33061ee18" data-recommend-id="image://86eabbad76c8f11191f209d33061ee18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miranda sits at a desk and looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Miranda sits at a desk and looks into the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86eabbad76c8f11191f209d33061ee18" data-recommend-id="image://86eabbad76c8f11191f209d33061ee18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miranda sits at a desk and looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Miranda Lawson is not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. Unlike universally beloved characters like Garrus or Tali, The Illusive Man’s right-hand woman starts off cold, dismissive of the player, and generally mad that you’re even there. As her icy heart defrosts, you come to learn that Miranda’s cold exterior is a wall built up after a lifetime of everyone who’s ever cared about her always having ulterior motives. It’s not easy to put your trust in anyone when every connection you’ve made has come with a catch. That’s why she initially had only invested emotional energy into her distant relationship with her sister, largely facilitated anonymously as she saved her from her manipulative father’s clutches as a baby.</p><p>Miranda, much like Jack, is a concise summation of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s team-building focus, starting off operating on her own interests, then slowly but surely learning to trust the team she works with after believing for so long she could only rely on herself. What puts her a notch above Jack in my eyes is her role in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. Miranda is a bit enigmatic in the third game, mostly working in the shadows as Shepard handles the Reapers. Having shed her Cerberus ties, Miranda seeks to atone for helping the extremist group reach the status it has in disrupting the war effort, but as she looks into her father’s plans and how they tie to Cerberus, she does so alone. Part of this is because Miranda still feels like she has to handle things on her own, but there’s something potent about someone who was once a radical unlearning their views, realizing that they can’t just integrate back into society and still doing the right thing anyway.</p><p>Miranda’s story can end tragically, as most characters in the <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy can, and there’s a gutting sadness to that ending if that’s where your choices take you, but if she makes it to the ending, there’s something kind of beautiful about someone having gone to the dark side and reaching the opposite end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5336031d5129e20a9bc495d670efb8a6" data-recommend-id="image://5336031d5129e20a9bc495d670efb8a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thane throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thane throws a punch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5336031d5129e20a9bc495d670efb8a6" data-recommend-id="image://5336031d5129e20a9bc495d670efb8a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thane throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In all my years of having deep talks with folks about the <em>Mass Effect </em>series, I don’t think I’ve found a character more surprisingly divisive than Thane Krios. The Drell assassin is introduced in <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>as a religious, terminally ill, absentee father, who could have easily been an edgelord stereotype. He can often be frustrating to talk to, as he uses his being a tool for someone else as a justification for his actions as an assassin, which feels like a sorry attempt at renouncing all personal responsibility. But Shepard has killed plenty of people without monetary incentive, so who are they to judge?</p><p>Thane’s conversations center around the morality of killing, but while he can be a bit immovable on the subject, the guy isn’t immune to the introspection that a suicide mission prompts. As he attempts to reconcile his relationship with his son Kolyat, Thane finds meaning in his last days.</p><p>His final day is one of the most memorable in the trilogy, as he saves a prominent politician from the worst BioWare villain ever, Lieutenant Bastard Kai Leng, but is mortally wounded in the process. Thane’s final moments, in which he, having repaired his relationship with his son, dies in a Citadel hospital, still has me in a chokehold 12 years later. He, Kolyat, and Shepard (if you choose) recite a prayer. Initially, you do this under the impression that it is for Thane’s comfort in his moments of passing, but when Shepard asks about the contents of the prayer, Kolyat clarifies that the prayer wasn’t for Thane, it was for the commander. That shit still hits, get the fuck out of here.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14e199da9ed4b86be8d0fa1752567736" data-recommend-id="image://14e199da9ed4b86be8d0fa1752567736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Garrus looks real pumped about something." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Garrus looks real pumped about something." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14e199da9ed4b86be8d0fa1752567736" data-recommend-id="image://14e199da9ed4b86be8d0fa1752567736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Garrus looks real pumped about something." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This will no doubt be an upset, and I’d say, “Hear me out,” but I know plenty of people will not do that. To be clear: Garrus is one of the best characters in the <em>Mass Effect </em>series, but he is also one of the most uneven characters in the trilogy.</p><p>To get the good out of the way first, the Turian vigilante is one of the most charming, memorable, and likable characters BioWare’s ever put into a video game. By the time we reach <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, he is Shepard’s best bro, a reliable shoulder to rest your head on, and his romance with FemShep is full of both goofy and heartfelt scenes that are some of the best BioWare’s ever written. However, the hill I will die on is that it took Garrus a while to become that character everyone remembers. In the original <em>Mass Effect</em>, he’s got the least going on of any of the party members, and it’s really about nudging him to be one flavor of cop or the other.</p><p><em>Mass Effect 2 </em>certainly fills him out more as a defined character and you can see glimpses of the charming hero we all know and love, though it pretty much repeats this arc by having him become a vigilante that you can Paragon or Renegade him into one conclusion. On top of this, his romance is undeniably the most shallow one in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, mostly just being a bunch of innuendos and talk of “blowing off steam” when the stakes are high enough to have an emotionally vulnerable moment with your long-time squadmate.</p><p>Once we reach <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, there’s not a shade of either variation and he kinda funnels into one version of himself, but then this guy gets some of <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s best work and a lovely romance. By the time you have the “no Shepard without Vakarian” conversation at the end, it’s a stunning, earned culmination of a trilogy-long friendship. Every <em>Mass Effect </em>game feels like it’s almost getting there, so by the time <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>really nailed the incredible character everyone remembers him to be, most people feel a brotherhood with him. But that meandering repetition of the first two games keeps him from ascending to the higher rankings for me.</p><p>Yes, yes, here are some tomatoes to throw at me. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37464373e02f474f9a914bab5b9390ff" data-recommend-id="image://37464373e02f474f9a914bab5b9390ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Legion stands with a group of Geth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Legion stands with a group of Geth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37464373e02f474f9a914bab5b9390ff" data-recommend-id="image://37464373e02f474f9a914bab5b9390ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Legion stands with a group of Geth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Geth are initially presented to you as a hive mind of murderous machines hellbent on the destruction of organics.

He is the first person to tell you the Geth’s side of the story in their uprising on Rannoch, the home planet of their Quarian creators. They were once curious gardeners and laborers who just wanted to know more about the world they were created to live in, and that was terrifying enough for their creators to try to wipe them out. After the Geth successfully drove their oppressors from their homeworld, Legion is an avatar of what’s left: an entire synthetic race of people just as complicated and divided as the rest of us.</p><p>But he also believes in a brighter future for his people, so much so that he sacrifices himself in <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>to elevate the entire race to a new state of intelligence. Legion dies as he lived: hoping that the Geth could find their place in the galaxy alongside not only their creators but the rest of the galactic community. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a9bcea41a4e743c5e6ea3d2d71ff40b" data-recommend-id="image://8a9bcea41a4e743c5e6ea3d2d71ff40b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liara stands in front of a piano." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liara stands in front of a piano." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a9bcea41a4e743c5e6ea3d2d71ff40b" data-recommend-id="image://8a9bcea41a4e743c5e6ea3d2d71ff40b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liara stands in front of a piano." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Liara T’Soni is borderline the <em>Mass Effect </em>series’ mascot at this point, being the only throughline of every game in the series, including the upcoming fifth one. Part of this is because she is the only character other than James who is guaranteed to survive the events of the trilogy as long as you get a good ending in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. Because of this, the asari researcher turned galaxy’s most powerful information broker can be a divisive figure for some fans who might consider her to be a “writer’s pet” who’s been given preferential treatment over the years. That’s all valid, but also, Liara’s constant presence in the <em>Mass Effect </em>universe makes her one of the most well-rounded heroes on the Normandy.</p><p>She starts off as an awkward introvert who has her world rocked twice over in the course of the first game. By the time you meet her again in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, she’s notably hardened and angry at the world, and there’s almost no trace of the naive girl you once knew. Unpacking the various traumas she’s endured to become this person takes its own DLC, and <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker </em>puts her transformation into perspective while bringing the woman we knew back to the surface.</p><p>In <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, she is Shepard’s rock while being hit with as many life-altering blows and revelations as ever. But she remains vigilant, strong-willed, and unyielding, even after facing hardship that would break a weaker person. Liara wanted to discover worlds that had been lost to history and ended up being at the center of history herself. By the time we see her in the next game, she’ll likely be hundreds of years older and wiser. I’m eager to hear the stories she’ll have to tell.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1970ce21f2244da50f611d7f64f156f" data-recommend-id="image://b1970ce21f2244da50f611d7f64f156f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tali types on a keyboard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tali types on a keyboard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b1970ce21f2244da50f611d7f64f156f" data-recommend-id="image://b1970ce21f2244da50f611d7f64f156f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tali types on a keyboard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Tali is one of the two constants in your party throughout the <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy, and she absolutely makes the most of all that time. Tali starts out as a nomad who just happens to stumble into the beginnings of a galactic invasion, bringing evidence of the incoming Reaper invasion to Shepard. Throughout the rest of the first game, she’s mostly a representative of the Quarian people, as she’s the only person of the suit-wearing alien race to appear through Shepard’s first adventure. You get a sense that she’s a very important person to her people, but it’s not until <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>that it becomes clear that she’s in the thick of some of the Quarian’s vitriolic, divided politics.</p><p>Tali finds herself caught between everything she’s ever been taught about her people’s history, all her conflicted feelings of resentment and admiration for her father, and the pressures of being a notable figure within her community that gives her a sense of responsibility to her people. She’s the girl who feels pressure from every angle while she’s struggling to even find out who she is and what she wants in the process.</p><p>In <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, Tali has reached the other side of a suicide mission and knows who she is, knows the truth of what happened between the Quarians and the Geth, and is ready to try and usher her people into a new era, should you be able to facilitate that through your choices, at least. In a series where characters like Ashley start out with prejudiced beliefs and more or less just drop them like an old toy they got bored of playing with, Tali is one of <em>Mass Effect</em>’s most effective characters in terms of watching someone slowly but surely suck out the poison of everything they’ve been taught. She’s a changed woman by the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, and the ending in which she’s able to see Quarians and Geth living side by side in Rannoch is one of the most rewarding conclusions in the trilogy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="567cb2e9f10a8b4187ce284decdd7d03" data-recommend-id="image://567cb2e9f10a8b4187ce284decdd7d03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wrex stands at a bar with a pack of ice in front of him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wrex stands at a bar with a pack of ice in front of him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="567cb2e9f10a8b4187ce284decdd7d03" data-recommend-id="image://567cb2e9f10a8b4187ce284decdd7d03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wrex stands at a bar with a pack of ice in front of him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It still haunts me that there are large swaths of <em>Mass Effect </em>players who never saw Urdnot Wrex fighting Reaper forces on his home planet of Tuchanka and proudly proclaiming “I am Urdnot Wrex, and this is my planet!” Wrex is the first possible casualty of Shepard’s war against the Reapers (RIP to Jenkins, who dies no matter what), and whether he lives or dies depends on whether you’re able to talk him down from a standoff.</p><p>When you first meet him, Wrex is a jaded bounty hunter who has lost all hope for the Krogan race. But when it becomes clear that there’s a possible cure for his people’s sterility on the planet Virmire, a sudden jolt of inspiration strikes. Is there a future for the Krogan that doesn’t end in wasting your life as a mercenary sent out to die, or in thousands of stillbirths? But this cure is being made at a facility that is a threat to the galaxy’s continued existence, so it’s gotta get blown up along with the rest of it.</p><p>Convincing a man who lost all hope for his people that you must destroy a key to their survival is no easy task, and if you can’t get him to stand down, he will meet the wrong end of a bullet. But if you can convince him, he appears throughout the rest of the trilogy as a radical clan leader seeking to usher the Krogan into a new era. Wrex becomes an advocate for the Krogan people where he was once expecting them to burn themselves out to extinction. Without him to help guide his people, the Krogan could have gone down a very different, destructive path.</p><p>Luckily, I never see that future because I am a good friend who he will listen to. The rest of y’all stay safe, though.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50af322891b1bf72997b7916adc6f3e8" data-recommend-id="image://50af322891b1bf72997b7916adc6f3e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mordin sits in a shuttle next to Eve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mordin sits in a shuttle next to Eve." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50af322891b1bf72997b7916adc6f3e8" data-recommend-id="image://50af322891b1bf72997b7916adc6f3e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mordin sits in a shuttle next to Eve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The phrase “going out in the blaze of glory” is cliche, but Mordin Solus should get that shit trademarked. The Salarian scientist is exuberant, prone to singing, and also a brilliant doctor with an immense knowledge of different alien biology. But all that whimsical charm is in direct contrast with his actions and beliefs. Mordin is one of the people responsible for modifying the Krogan sterility plague when it seemed the people were adapting to it, and as horrific as that sounds, he’s pretty steadfast in believing that it was the right call no matter how much you poke and prod at his calculus. He mourns dead Krogan who gave their lives trying to help scientists find a cure for the sickness that has haunted their people, all while knowing his work pushed them to this point. It’s not until <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>that the cracks start to show. Mordin becomes a double agent for the Salarian government and Krogan clans, leaking intel about a potential cure his people have been working on, and helping to create and distribute the cure to the Krogan people.</p><p>But what sells Mordin beyond his charismatic nature and satisfying about-face is how well BioWare executes the end of his story. The cure must be sent through the Krogan homeworld’s atmosphere at the top of a facility that is crumbling down. Mordin’s fate here is determined by key choices you made over the course of the trilogy. Mordin is ready to die for the cause, and if he heads up to the top of the building, he will sing a <em>Mass Effect</em>ified version of “I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General” to calm himself as he dispenses the cure and a new hope to the Krogan race. BioWare mercilessly smothers the final moments of the song under an explosion, and it’s a devastating yet hopeful moment that the trilogy had been building toward.</p><p>Conversely, if you choose to sabotage the cure for more Salarian support in the war, Mordin’s story can end with a much more sinister conclusion. Mordin’s guilt for his crimes can be too great to persuade him, as he sees a future for the Krogan race that he helped delay. If he’s unwilling to back down, Shepard can shoot him in the back, and he won’t make it to the console in time. If your choices throughout the trilogy have undermined the growth of the Krogan race, Mordin can be convinced to help you sabotage the cure and disappear to keep the lie consistent, leaving with hope that maybe there might be a way for the Krogans to not repeat their past violence. All of these conclusions are in keeping with the multifaceted character that is Mordin Solus. He’s a calculated person who can see people as statistics, but he also wants to believe that there is a better way than the path he once chose.</p><p>Had to be him. Someone else might’ve gotten it wrong.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
