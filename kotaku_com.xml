              <p>I was nearly 30 hours into <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> when I lied to a character during a conversation. A few moments later, a message popped up on my screen. I had lied enough times, apparently, that I was offered the chance to take a new secret trait that would force me to lie whenever possible, but I could do so perfectly. This is the Flaws System, and it’s one of my favorite features in a game I’ve played this year.</p> <p>Released earlier this year, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is Obsidian’s bigger and better open-world RPG sequel to 2019’s <em>The Outer Worlds.</em> If the first game was a fun attempt at recreating Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> formula, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is the studio nailing it. In fact, I think in some ways the team has beaten Bethesda at its own game, with improved writing, better combat, and some other cool ideas, like Flaws.</p>

 <p>Technically, <a href="https://theouterworlds.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Worlds_flaws">Flaws were a feature in the first<em> Outer Worlds</em></a>. But in that game, they offered a choice to take extra perk points in exchange for your stats being lowered in specific ways. Like, taking too much head damage would make you 100 percent worse at aiming guns. It was an okay idea that felt too punishing and wasn’t much fun. In <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2,</em> the Flaw system has been revamped to add more chaos to a playthrough. Now, Flaws can be really wild and offer a mix of negative and positive effects. For example, in <em>The Outer</em><em>&nbsp;Worlds 2</em>, if you steal a lot of items, the game will eventually detect this and offer you a Flaw that lets you sell stolen goods for double their value, but it also forces you to steal anything you get close to, which could cause some awkward moments in a store or town.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653924">©Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://theouterworlds2.wiki.fextralife.com/Flaws">Flaws in <em>Outer Worlds 2</em></a> can, if you desire, throw a wrench into your RPG experience and shake things up even dozens of hours into a playthrough. If you don’t look them up ahead of time, which you shouldn’t, they can spice up the latter half of the game<em>,</em> which can suffer from the same problem so many RPGs suffer from: letting you get stuck in a comfortable but boring rut.</p>

 <h2>How Flaws in <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> make it a better RPG</h2> <p>You know that point in an RPG where you’re nearing max level, have the weapons that work perfectly for your build, and have your skills dialed in. Fights become boring. Exploration isn’t as exciting either, as you’ve been to most places a few times now. This is the point at which many players put down the game and walk away. Maybe you push through to wrap it up, having less fun as you go. But with Flaws, the final stretch of&nbsp;<em>Outer Worlds 2</em> was still a wild time for me.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og6q38/skipping_through_dialogue_in_rpgs_finally_bit_me/">When I tried to speed through dialogue too much, I was offered a Flaw</a> that would let me gain more XP, but would randomly choose options during dialogue. Another Flaw offered to make my melee strikes more deadly in exchange for taking more damage when I blocked, an offer which came after I spent too much time punching random baddies and not enough time blocking and dodging.</p>

 <p>I didn’t accept all of them (and I definitely didn’t take the Flaw that makes you accept all Flaws moving forward), but just having such strange choices to contemplate 20+ hours into the game was fantastic. Each time a Flaw notification appeared, I perked up. And when I accepted one, like the Flaw that made me scared of mechs but able to do more damage to them, it altered my playthrough in a way I really appreciated and helped get me out of that “stuck in a rut” phase so many RPGs tend to end up in.</p> <p>The only problem now is that when I started playing a different game, I found myself longing for silly, interesting, and possibly game-breaking flaws to appear as I played. It was a treat to have the game react to how I was playing, actively tempting me with ways to indulge in bad behaviors or silly habits (like reloading too much) in exchange for some equally silly punishments. Now I want more games to do that. So here’s me permitting RPG devs to steal Flaws from <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2.</em> I’d like that, please!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Larian Studios is experimenting <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850">with generative AI</a> and fans aren’t too happy. The head of the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> maker, Swen Vincke, released a new statement to try to explain the studio’s stance in more detail and make clear the controversial tech isn’t being used to cut jobs. “Any [Machine Learning] tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft,” he said.</p> <p>He was responding to a backlash that arose earlier today from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">a <em>Bloomberg</em> interview</a> which reported that Larian was moving forward with gen AI despite some internal concerns among staff. Vincke made clear the tech was only being used for things like placeholder text, PowerPoint presentations, and early concept art experiments and that nothing AI-generated would be included in Larian’s upcoming RPG, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><em>Divinity</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The reaction on social media was swift. “Don’t mind me, currently living through my personal 9/11,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddybaldur/comments/1po65yn/dont_mind_me_currently_living_through_my_personal/">wrote</a> one fan on Reddit. “Consider my feedback: I loved working at Larian until AI,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">wrote</a> an artist who worked on <em>BG3</em>. “reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.”</p>

 <p>Vincke has since tried to address those concerns in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">long statement sent to <em>IGN</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists, writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Since concept art is being called out explicitly – we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse.</p></blockquote> <p>The studio head reiterates that Larian is hiring more artists, not fewer, and that it’s bulking up its creative resources for its upcoming game, not trying to cut corners with AI. There won’t be AI in <em>Divinity</em>, Vincke has promised, and the aim is to help employees, not force the tech on them as some publishers like EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">have reportedly been doing</a>.</p> <p>But the statement doesn’t necessarily address deeper divisions over generative AI tools, which many have likened to being plagiarism machines, and the skepticism that’s bound to arise from letting it near game development at all. “Early Access and the way they managed their community across all their updates helped humanize that team in ways that only helped <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, weird for the studio to be so willing to throw all that goodwill away,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3ma4izugsds24">wrote</a> former<em> Giant Bomb</em> host Jeff Gerstmann.</p>
