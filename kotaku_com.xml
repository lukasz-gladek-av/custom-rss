So now you can try to belt Cynthia Erivo’s “Defying Gravity” battle cry from the comfort of your own home. The digital version of the movie includes some special features like commentary from Erivo and co-lead Ariana Grande, behind-the-scenes interviews, and a handful of deleted scenes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-movie-barbie-porn-site-mattel-1851694637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-movie-barbie-porn-site-mattel-1851694637"><em>Wicked</em></a></span><em> </em>is already a long movie, running at two hours and 40 minutes, but after seeing some of the moments that were cut fans are asking if it would really have been so bad if the film had been a few minutes longer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Some of these deleted scenes were fine to cut. One includes Grande’s character, Glinda the Good Witch, meeting her cronies Pfannee and ShenShen, and while it’s nice to give those characters a little more screen time, they’re mostly bit players in the grand scheme of things. The ones that feel like they would have added a lot of meat to the film include Erivo as Elphaba taking just a few minutes to flesh out her ties to Glinda and her sister’s boyfriend Boq.</p><p>Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship is the lifeblood of both the film and stage versions of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-mattel-porn-lawsuit-news-1851713647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-mattel-porn-lawsuit-news-1851713647"><em>Wicked</em></a></span>, and while there’s a lot of time spent on their enemies-to-friends arc, a few gaps could’ve been filled. The deleted scene “Elphaba’s Promise” is only two minutes long but adds a great deal to the characters’ complicated relationship. This small interaction between the two as they study magic addresses the weird lack of acknowledging the point earlier in the film when Elphaba slips away with Glinda’s boyfriend Fiyero to save a captured lion cub. Here, we see Glinda ask why Elphaba didn’t ask her for help, to which Elphaba apologizes and says she won’t leave her behind again. In the final film, the two never really have a conversation about what happened. This would have also punctuated the moment later when Elphaba brings Glinda along with her to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Seeing that this scene was shot and ready to go makes it a puzzling omission. Yes, yes, you’ve gotta cut some things for time, but you’re telling me the duo fucking about with a busted hot air balloon in the last 20 minutes was more valuable than them fleshing out their relationship?</p><p>Another cut interaction that would have added a lot to the movie is one between Elphaba and Ethan Slater’s Boq. The munchkin is the boyfriend of Elphaba’s sister Nessarose, but he secretly harbors feelings for Glinda. Well, it’s a secret to Nessarose, at least. In “Boq &amp; Elphaba talk,” the Witch of the West talks with Boq about their hopes and dreams and how they’re both hopelessly in love with two unavailable people. When Elphaba is unwilling to admit she has feelings for Fiyero, Boq ends the chat with a banger of a line: “I’m sorry, I misunderstood. I thought we were being honest.” Tea clocked.</p><p>Without spoiling anything for those who don’t know anything about <em>Wicked</em>’s second act—which will make up the sequel movie <em>Wicked: For Good </em>on November 21—Boq is a pretty important character in what’s to come. Though the first film rightfully focuses on Elphaba and Glinda, its ensemble cast is about to go through some transformative experiences in the second film, and giving them just a little bit more time could have gone a long way. At least we have these scenes available to view in the special features. Even if they weren’t in the final cut, you can pretty much consider them canon because they slot nicely into the movie we got.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The lengthy technical document outlines a process for AI-upscaling that could be used to improve image quality using software rather than raw processing power, similar to DLSS used by Nvidia GPUs for PC gaming, as well as PSSR which was recently introduced by Sony for the PlayStation 5 Pro. </p><p>Dale also points out another potential use of the technology: keeping game file sizes small. Nintendo’s first-party releases on the current Switch are infamous for how optimized they are. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> is the company’s biggest game on the platform and it’s still only 18.2GB.<strong> </strong>Higher resolution textures and other improved assets can all dramatically increase that digital footprint, however.</p><p> The patent outlines an example where native 4K textures might bump a game’s install size up to 60GB, while a 1080 native version that uses upscaling could get away with just 20GB, which is still less than the current 32GB cap on existing Switch cartridge memory sizes. </p><p>News of the patent comes alongside more alleged leaks about the Switch 2 hardware itself. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048">Following a recent influx of possible first-look images at the upgraded console</a></span>, there are now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potential photos of the hardware’s actual motherboard</a></span> floating around online. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3804#post-1495792&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3804#post-1495792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This has led to some heated debate</a></span> about what semiconductor manufacturing process was used to create the Switch 2's chip and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dark1x/status/1874534475734073681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1874534475734073681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thus how powerful it might be</a></span>. </p><p>Ultimately, however, it’s impossible to know just how powerful the Switch 2 will be compared to the existing, seven-year-old hardware, until we get a sense of the full list of trade-offs Nintendo has decided on once it reveals the official list of specs and features.

Each of <em>Oblivion</em>’s nine regions of Cyrodiil has unique flora and fauna for the team to recreate, and that’s on top of the enormous landscapes and cities.</p><p>The Gold Coast, for instance, is all but complete, with a new version of main city Anvil, “re-envisioned to realize its original concept art.” It’s the most wildly ambitious project, and as you’ll see in the video below, it looks <em>wonderful</em>.</p><p>Given <em>Skyrim</em> itself is 13 years old, it’s a testament to its engine how stunning <em>Skyblivion</em> is looking (albeit boosted by Bethesda’s own <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em> upgrades). It does seem a bit galling that Bethesda will be sitting on whatever tech they’re using for <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, but this still looks so, so much better than the 19-year-old <em>Oblivion</em> original.</p><p>The video’s narration makes clear that in order to release <em>Skyblivion</em>, they are legally required to remake every asset, including all the 3D models, which is a task of unimaginable magnitude. (Bethesda had a team of hundreds working for four years at full pay to do this the first time—this is a group of unpaid volunteers working in their spare time.) As such, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the team is looking for more volunteers</a></span>—especially for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navmeshing</a></span>, UI and 3D modeling—to help them get the game over the line.</p><figure id="" data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TES Renewal Project / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This whole thing blows my mind. The Skyblivion Team has also written new music for each section of the game, and they’re even considering porting across the DLC when this main game is finished. Planned since 2011, prototyped by 2014, and in full development from 2018, they’re confident for a 2025 release, likely years ahead of Bethesda’s own follow-up, <em>The Elder Scrolls VI: Hammerfell</em>.</p><p>Kudos to Bethesda for letting extraordinary projects like these thrive, rather than sending takedown notifications and legal threats.

Microsoft requires that games released for the more powerful Series X must also work, including all features, on the sub-$300 Series S, and that’s definitely proving trickier as the PC-led fidelity race progresses.</p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> developer Game Science <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-the-game-awards-winner-1851721695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-the-game-awards-winner-1851721695">hasn’t been shy about making its views clear on various matters</a></span>, and CEO Feng Ji <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223#comment&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223#comment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has once more taken to Weibo</a></span> to explain the game’s continuing absence on Xbox.

Phil Spencer Knows, But Won’t Say</a></span></p><p>It’s a splendidly honest explanation, as the Series S, as limited as it is, is still able to play games as technically complex as <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, or <em>Black Ops 6</em>, albeit not at the same settings as the Series X or PS5. Perhaps a more experienced team could achieve it, but it’s seemingly beyond what Game Science is able to deliver right now. And given the enormous complexity and GFX-pushing nature of <em>Wukong</em>, Game Science has delivered an <em>extraordinary</em> amount. (It’s worth noting that Microsoft mad an exception to their rule for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-series-x-s-split-screen-co-op-rpg-1850770513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-series-x-s-split-screen-co-op-rpg-1850770513">where Larian could never get the Series S to handle co-op</a></span>.)</p><p>But the remarks raise concerns about Microsoft’s previous statements on the matter.
