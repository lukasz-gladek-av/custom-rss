            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="594">Nintendo’s next-generation console, the Switch 2, has already had a strong start. Since launching earlier last year, Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most successful consoles in gaming history has rolled out several notable exclusives, including <em data-start="248" data-end="266">Mario Kart World</em>, <em data-start="268" data-end="289">Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em data-start="291" data-end="309">Kirby Air Riders</em>, and and <em data-start="334" data-end="359">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While that exclusive lineup is still growing, the real strength of the Switch 2 at launch is its backwards compatibility. The full eight-year library of original Nintendo Switch games can be played on the Switch 2.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="594">That’s a lot of games, but unfortunately, you’re Switch 2 won’t even be able to hold a small fraction of them on its internal storage alone.&nbsp;Fortunately, Nintendo has once again made storage expandable via microSD cards—though not just any card will do this time around.</p>
<p data-start="994" data-end="1336"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Amazon is offering the Samsung P9 Express 512GB microSD card at 25% off.</a> Normally priced at $120, the discount brings it down to $80, saving you $40 for a limited time. Additionally, the 256GB option is down from $55 to just $40, saving you $15.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="1338" data-end="1805">The Switch 2’s updated system architecture delivers improved performance and noticeably faster load times compared to its predecessor. However, that performance leap also means the console requires microSD Express cards to keep up with its faster data speeds. Older microSD cards that worked perfectly fine on the original Switch simply won’t meet the new standards. Express cards tend to cost more, which makes sales like this Samsung P9 deal hard to pass up.</p>
<h2>Triple Your Gaming Storage</h2>
<p data-start="1807" data-end="2237">Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage. While that’s a massive improvement over the original Switch’s paltry 32GB, the usable space is slightly lower than what’s listed on the tin once system software is accounted for. On top of that, Switch 2 games are noticeably larger than last-generation titles. <em data-start="2114" data-end="2176">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Switch 2 Edition</em>, for example, takes up more than 20GB on its own.</p>

<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Adding a 512GB Samsung P9 microSD Express effectively triples your total storage, giving you far more breathing room as new releases roll out over the coming years. With that kind of capacity, you won’t need to constantly juggle downloads or delete old favorites to make room for the next big Nintendo release. I’ve still got my fingers crossed for a new <em data-start="2624" data-end="2634">Star Fox</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Beyond the Nintendo Switch 2, the Samsung P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the original Switch, the Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Xbox Ally.</a> Also it’s not just for gaming. Photographers have been using these for ages too, so maybe you’re just looking to take more photos and videos on your Canon. The deal is just as good regardless of what you plan on using it for.</p>

              <p>Today’s annual Xbox Developer Direct goes live today at 1 p.m ET, during which the focus is expected to fall heavily on Playground Studios, developers of both <em>Fable</em> and&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>. Both are confirmed to be appearing at the show, alongside GameFreak’s non-<em>Pokémon</em> RPG&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leak-corroborated">as&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> reports</a>, it seems we now doubly-know for sure one of the show’s intended surprises: <em>Forza Horizon</em>‘s release date. However, if any other games are to appear, Microsoft has achieved the unlikely and managed to keep it all under wraps.</p> <p>This isn’t the first time the May 19 release date for <em>FH6</em> has got out into the wild, although a second source certainly makes it seem all the more likely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-release-date-may-xbox-direct-2026-ps5-japan-2000659807">Last week a Saudi X account claimed to have seen an accidentally-released trailer</a> for the Japan-set racing game which featured the release date May 19.&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> now adds that renowned leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">billbil-kun has authenticated the date</a>, alongside the blatantly obvious news that the game will release in Standard, Deluxe and Premium forms. Despite only being a few months away, we’ve seen almost nothing of the game beyond <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658">being teased about the backdrop of Japanese mountains</a> and other culturally iconic artifacts. Microsoft is promising a “deep-dive” during the Direct, which will include “new features.”</p>

 <p>Microsoft also says the Developer Direct livestream will include a “first extended look at <em>Fable</em>,” the relaunching of the action-RPG franchise formerly developed by Lionhead Studios. Despite seemingly having been in some sort of development since perhaps as early as 2017, and confirmed in 2020, this will be the first time anything of depth will have been shown, following <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-4-reboot-gameplay-trailer-xbox-summer-game-fest-1849051021">2023’s somewhat obfuscatory trailer</a> featuring Richard Ayoade. No word has leaked about whether we’ll be seeing a release date for the oft-slipping game.</p> <p>The final announced game is quite the coup for Microsoft (and Sony, it should be said), getting a Game Freak title away from Nintendo for the first time since 2017’s, er, <em>Giga Wrecker</em>. (No, me neither.) That eventually saw a Switch release, meaning the last time the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> developer made a game that didn’t see a Nintendo version was 2015’s&nbsp;<em>Tempo the Badass Elephant</em>, and I think we can all agree: what? Before those two you have to go back to the 1990s. Anyway, action-RPG <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is due to come to PC, Xbox and PS5 (and&nbsp;<em>not</em> Switch) at some point in 2026, and today’s show will reveal “details of our protagonist Emma’s innovative plant manipulation actions and gameplay with her canine companion, Koo.”</p>

 <p>That’s all that’s confirmed, but I bet my right buttock that at least a fourth game will be snuck in there, even if it’s just a teasing glimpse (which you will <em>not</em> be getting of my right buttock.)</p> <p>You can catch the entire thing at 1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) via Xbox’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXn6bvU1Kh4">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a> channels, or just stare at the embed below for the next few hours.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-mini-drone-combo-with-4k-camera-hits-its-first-low-of-the-year-now-cheaper-than-black-friday-2000661980</link>
            <guid>1412920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“The Drone Ban” sounds overly alarmist, but it’s real. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has instituted a ban on new foreign-made drones and drone components. Which, considering the huge market dominance of Chinese brands, translates into a “buy them now while you can” situation for hobbyist drones. While this ban prevents any new models from being imported and sold in the U.S., ones that are already here are still available for purchase and use.</p>
<p>DJI is the undisputed U.S. market leader for drone hobbyists, and they’re a Chinese company that’s subject to the new FCC ban. Thankfully this doesn’t affect current DJI products already in the country, so <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/">Amazon’s number-one-selling hobbyist drone — the DJI Mini 4K — is available and at its lowest price in 30 days after a 21% price drop down to $309.</a> There won’t be any upgraded versions of the Mini coming, so it’s wise to grab this one while supplies last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Beginner-Friendly Bundle</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 4K Combo that’s on sale at Amazon is comprised of the top-selling, beginner-friendly Mini 4K, its remote controller, two DJI Mini 2 Intelligent Flight rechargeable batteries, a propeller holder, and shoulder bag. The two batteries combine for over an hour of flight time, more than enough to use the Mini 4K’s UHD camera to take incredible aerial still photos and 4K videos.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Mini 4K is exceptionally beginner-friendly — easy to learn, easy to operate, and built with failsafe features like GPS Return to Home, which automatically brings it back to its point of origin if the signal is dropped or you just feel like you’re losing control of the drone. Most of the commands are one-touch, including takeoff and a soft landing that prevents crashes. The DJI Fly app (available for download at the official DJI website) is packed with learning resources that will have you sending the Mini 4K up to 4,000 meters high, with video transmission of up to 10 km for long-range flight and photography.</p>



<h2>Tiny and Tough</h2>
<p>The Mini 4K weighs just over 8 ounces, and the four propeller arms fold back into the main body to reduce it to a neat palm-sized package. Even with such a small and lightweight body, the Mini 4K’s four brushless motors are powerful enough to battle winds of up to 23 mph while in flight, a vast improvement over earlier hobbyist drones.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the Drone Ban will be lifted and new advanced models from DJI and other foreign manufacturers will again be allowed into the U.S.? Of course — nothing is less predictable than what comes out of Washington. But there’s an equal or better chance that the ban will stick, and it could take years for U.S. manufacturers to catch up to where DJI is now. Bottom line: The last legal foreign-made hobbyist drones are on our shores now, and the DJI Mini 4K is among the very best for beginners and more advanced flyers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/">Take this Amazon limited-time deal and score yourself a terrific entry-level drone bundle for just $309.</a></p>

              <p>If yesterday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">Ubisoft announcements of cancellations and studio restructuring</a> and promises to focus on gen-AI were intended to win back shareholder confidence, it’s safe to say that’s not <em>really</em> worked out. At the start of trading today, the publisher’s share price dropped to its lowest level in 14 years, a third of their value wiped out overnight, and that’s after years of colossal falls. In fact, an Ubisoft share bought in June 2018 has now dropped in value by more than <em>95 percent</em>.</p> <p>Yesterday, on announcing <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">the cancellation of projects like the&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake</a> alongside other unannounced titles, and a plan to restructure its development studios yet again (in other words, close more of them and fire many more staff), Ubisoft described these actions as introducing “a radically new value-creation model.” It’s certainly proven radical.</p>

 <p>A <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">lengthy statement</a> laid out how Ubisoft plans to redesign its entire structure and “simplify” its operations, all with a goal to create “efficiency” and convince investors that the company is going to stop hemorrhaging money. The plan promised to focus its attentions on turning its established IPs into “annual billionaire brands” while directing its attention toward all of last year’s buzz-words like live-service and “Gen-AI initiatives.” It appears that simply stating that the games that currently don’t make close to a billion dollars a year will now start doing so hasn’t convinced shareholders of the company’s future.</p> <p>At the time of writing, a share in Ubisoft is wavering around $4.30, down from $6.60 yesterday. That’s a drop from a peak of $13.40 last year, and an astonishing plummet from 2018’s all-time peak of $95. Things had stayed hopeful until January 2021 when prices still held to around $83, but then began a steep slope downward that has never let up. This has all occurred alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">the repeated cancellation of major projects</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">wave after wave of firings</a> of its employees at studios all around the world.</p>

 <p>This endless deckchair rearrangement doesn’t appear to be fooling anyone, and each move has seen prices tumble in response. This morning’s market reaction to yesterday’s latest raft of plans could be the sharpest drop the company has ever seen, unless there’s a skin-of-their-teeth bounce-back later in the morning.</p>

 <p>Still, if you were looking to sell your brand to a private owner, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-shareholders-approve-55bn-sale-saudi-arabia-trump-2000655342">as EA is currently attempting</a>, being this colossally incompetent would sure make you look a lot cheaper to interested buyers.</p>
