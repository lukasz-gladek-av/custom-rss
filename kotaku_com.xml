He noted that Larian already uses machine learning to speed up grunt work like polishing motion capture footage or voice editing, and said that he sees generative AI tools as potentially helpful for fast-tracking early prototyping when developers need to quickly see ideas put into practice in order to better evaluate them. </p><p>The studio is also apparently exploring using narrative AI tools to flag potential plot holes or inconsistencies as human writers create scripts, but Vincke doesn’t see a future in which AI tools are making finished products or replacing game developers. </p><p>“I don’t think you would have a competitive advantage if you do, because it’s gonna be what’s available to everybody—if the baseline goes up because generation is available to everybody? Fine, that’s a new reality that we’re in. But you’re still gonna wanna create something special on top of that, and I think that’s where teams like us will make the difference.</p><p>“I don’t think that people in my position that say ‘oh, we’ll replace everyone with AI’ are doing the right thing, they’re doing the wrong thing. But what I do think is we’re gonna jump forward in the kinds of games we make…we’re gonna be making our games differently, but to say that it’ll replace the craftsmanship? I think we’re very far from it.”</p><p>Yoko Taro has a much less optimistic view of the tech. The director behind the <em>Nier</em> games, infamous for wearing a giant creepy moon-shaped mask in public, recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40366&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Famitsu</em></a></span> that he thinks the wave of generative AI advancements will lead to a grim future for game designers in which many roles once held by humans are eliminated. “I think that AI will make all game creators unemployed,” he said, according to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yoko-taro-fears-game-developers-will-lose-their-jobs-to-ai-in-50-years-we-may-be-treated-like-bards/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yoko-taro-fears-game-developers-will-lose-their-jobs-to-ai-in-50-years-we-may-be-treated-like-bards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translation by <em>Automaton</em></a></span>. “In 50 years, game creators may be treated like bards.”</p><p>The response was part of a roundtable discussion with fellow designers Kazutaka Kodaka, Kotaro Uchikoshi, and Jiro Ishii about the recently released visual novel strategy game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></a></span>, which Kodaka, known for his distinct work on <em>Danganronpa,</em> helped make. The group was asked if AI tools would eventually be able to mimic the styles of human creatives. Taro suggested the tools would actually help players bypass game makers altogether, at least in certain types of games like text-heavy adventures. </p><p> “I think that in the near future, we will move from an era where we have to imitate the style of our favorite creators to an era where we can have our favorite scenarios generated,” Yoko added. “AI will determine the preferences of users and skillfully generate route branchings that they would want to read, and the recommendation capabilities will continue to improve.” </p><p>A fittingly grim diagnosis from the designer of <em>Nier Automata</em>, an action-RPG about machines with some very human-like tendencies in a post-humanity dystopia.

The incredibly blurry image was posted to the force’s X page, with what seems like a wildly inappropriate comment given the violence involved.</p><p>“Turns out Team Rocket’s not the only one causing trouble...” the post begins. After detailing the crime, it continues, “[we] believe the driver may have info that could help us catch ‘em all (or at least the one responsible).” The post then adds, “don’t just sit there like a Snorlax - contact Crime Stoppers.” Er, great everyone. Good stuff.</p><p>It’s unclear where the 8,000 AUD valuation comes from. <em>ABC</em> reports that the cops said the card was a Base Set Unlimited holo Charizard, graded 9, but non-1st edition Base Set Charizards tend to only sell for around 1,500 USD (2,300 AUD). You need a PSA 10 to see the big values, where it shoots up to almost $9k.</p><p>My guess would be that this was a far more rare “shadowless” version of the card, a printing of the set that saw the shadow effect to the right of the window art forgotten. At a grade 9, those are currently valued at just under 5,000 USD, or 8,000 AUD.
