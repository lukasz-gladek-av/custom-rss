              <p>Microsoft’s most popular console has officially gone retro. Let’s remember what made it great.</p> <p>The Xbox 360 came out a year earlier than the competition and $100 cheaper than the base PlayStation 3. It seemed to make all the right moves, using <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> to jump start online multiplayer into the soon-to-be dominant form of gaming, while investing it all back into indie curation, big exclusives, and marketing deal that made the console feel like the place everyone had to be.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on Jul 30, 2024. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>In some ways it felt like the best of all worlds, and by the end of the generation you could pick up an Xbox 360 for just $100 and play dozens of the best games ever made. The culture was far from healthy, and some of the places making everything were a mess to work for. But it was also a fun time, and a weird one. Here’s what we’ll miss about it and why the Xbox 360 still feels so special to us.</p>

 <hr> <p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-remember-some-xbox-360-games-1826905842">Let’s remember some Xbox 360s</a>! What’s your Xbox 360 origin story Carolyn?</p> <p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> The first E3 I ever attended was in 2005, with the Xbox 360’s launch still some months out and I have to say, the games I saw on the show floor looked amazing. It’s hilarious to me now considering I haven’t even thought about this game in probably 15 years, but at that time, the game that blew me away the most was probably <em>GRAW</em>. Interestingly, though, despite my initial excitement about the console being rooted in its graphical power and my lust for next-gen spectacle, now, when I think back on what made the console so special to me, it’s not really about that aspect of it at all. What about you Alyssa?</p>

 <p><strong>Alyssa Mercante:</strong> I’ve told mine on<em> Kotaku</em> more than once, but I had borrowed my high school sweetheart’s original Xbox to play <em>Halo 2</em> when he went away to college, but not long after that <em>Halo 3</em> came out, which wasn’t backwards compatible. So I went out during my free period in high school (we had an open campus for seniors, you could take your car and leave if you didn’t have class), and drove to a Target where I spent my summer job savings on a 360, <em>Halo 3</em>, and Xbox Live.</p>

 <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I have zero recollection of the Xbox 360’s launch. What was I even doing at the time? 2005. Hmm. I was going into my senior year in high school, barely playing anything except for the occasional late-stage PS2 game—<em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</em>, followed eventually by <em>Okami </em>and <em>Final Fantasy XII</em>. My only real memory of the beginning of that console cycle is my brother getting a PS3 and me having almost no interest in it. It wasn’t until my girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend in college got me hooked on <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> that I finally picked up a super cheap used Xbox 360 arcade edition for like $150. That four years after the console launched but still somehow only the mid-way point.</p>

  <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Yeah, I don’t remember exactly when I finally got one myself—I certainly couldn’t afford one at launch, and my memories of the time around release have a lot to do with playing Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie (lol) at GameStop kiosks.</p>

 <p><strong>Moises Taveras: </strong>The first time I ever played an Xbox 360 also had to do with <em>Call of Duty: MW2</em>. It was all the rage with the kids in my middle school, but I was largely looking from the outside in as a) a PlayStation kid since my youth and b) someone who came from a family too poor to afford more than one console. But eventually, I made friends who had 360s and I remember us all cramming onto a couch in the smallest bedroom imaginable at our friend Howard’s house and playing local multiplayer matches till we lost our voices from shouting. I learned really quickly then that the 360 was synonymous with multiplayer and socializing with folks and it made me want one so bad. Little did I know I wouldn’t get a 360 till the very end of the console generation!</p>

 <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I think part of the Xbox 360’s dominance in that era can be attributed to the fact that it offered the best online experience for folks wanting to play <em>Call of Duty</em>, but it also did something incredible that totally won over people like me. I’m not saying I didn’t have an amazing time playing Gears of War co-op, I absolutely did, and huge credit to Microsoft for putting out a steady stream of banger exclusives that really made Xbox Live feel essential. But for me, when I think about the Xbox 360, what still gets me excited most is Xbox Live Arcade, and particularly amazing games like <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition</em>. Games like this took the arcade leaderboard competition of my childhood and absolutely exploded it. Suddenly I was staying up nights pouring everything I had into beating my friends’ high scores on online leaderboards for all the world to see. Man, it was incredible.</p> <p><strong>Moises:</strong> Supergiant Games’ Bastion absolutely blew my mind as far as what I thought games could be. It being a console exclusive to the 360 through XBLA broke my heart and kept me from the portfolio of what’d become my favorite studio, and then Xbox just kept pumping out indie titles like it. Honestly, my working definition of an indie game was largely informed by this era of XBLA games.</p>  <p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> The Xbox 360 was the first console launch I was really tuned into the industry for. I was full-blown sicko mode for that thing as a kid, and was counting down the days. I was a huge Rare fan at the time and Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero were a huge deal to me. But broadly, I think I fell off video games for a bit because the system just didn’t speak to my tendencies. As Moises said, the 360 became the multiplayer system and I preferred gaming in solitude, and eventually pivoted to the PS3 in the final years of that generation. But I played the <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy on the 360, so I ended up keeping an old 360 in my home longer than any other system. I had to replace the household 360 more times than probably any other system my family owned.</p>

 <p>We got a launch window system that died by the time <em>Halo 3 </em>came out, so we had to replace it swiftly. Then I got my own 360 for Christmas 2009, just before the launch of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. That sucker lasted over a decade. It gathered dust for large swaths of the time, but since I didn’t own an Xbox One, it was the only way for me to go back to my old <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy saves until the Legendary Edition came out in 2021. So while I had mostly abandoned the system by the end of the generation, the 360 is still a defining system in my life because it gave me one of the most important video game experiences of my life. I’ll always be grateful for it, even if I think the Microsoft was a trailblazer for some of the industry’s worst modern tendencies with it.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>That was the other thing that I think tipped me in the direction of the Xbox 360 besides the price and walled multiplayer gardens. As someone coming from the PS1 and PS2, it just had more of the RPGs I was craving earlier or in better condition. I came to the original Mass Effect late but it blew my mind. I got to catch up on Star Wars: The Old Republic. It was synonymous with retro and couch-coop indie games for me like Castle Crashers and Super Meat Boy. It really did just nail a lot of the same things that the PS4 did a generation later and which ultimately helped Sony to reverse the tide.</p>

 <p><strong>Moises: </strong>it’s so weird to think about now given Xbox’s current situation and catalog, but the 360 was where all the games were!</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Another thing that was a big factor for me, I have to admit, is that I was totally cheevo-pilled. The Xbox 360 brought about the advent of achievements and I got extremely excited about pulling off absurd things like beating Call of Duty campaigns on Veteran to get all the achievements. I no longer put much stock in achievements or trophies, but to this day I greatly prefer the at-a-glance number that reflects your achievements compared to all the trophies of PlayStation’s system. And on top of that, the whole interface on Xbox just felt so much more inviting to me than that on Sony. I think avatars were really smart of them to introduce in that era. I loved signing on and seeing little cartoon versions of all my good friends online, playing games of their own. In comparison to that, the whole interface of the PS3 just felt cold and impersonal to me, and that console would end up gathering dust in my entertainment center.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>The Xbox 360 home screen definitely felt a lot more inviting and hit that sweet spot of clutter to chill. The controller was also very solid. Have any of you gone back and tried to hold a PS3 DualShock? It feels like you’re being pranked. I take it none of you ever had an issue with red-ringing or other hardware failures?</p>

  <p><strong>Moises:</strong> Nope! Correct me if I’m wrong but those issues got ironed out with later iterations of the console, so by the time one of my best friends let me indefinitely borrow his 360, it was smooth sailing for me.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I did have to send mine back for repairs once, and for a while there at least, it felt like everyone I knew who owned one was hitting the red ring. There was a period there, at least in my circle of friends, where there was real disbelief and anger that Microsoft had sold us all a product that was so prone to failure. I think it speaks to just how fond people were overall of the console—its library, its interface, its online features—that today, when you bring it up, you’re far more likely to get fond recollections than bitter complaints. It was so good that even the considerable irritations so many of us experienced with it are now just a footnote in our memories.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong>My console ended up red-ringing in like, 2012? But then I read that you can just put it in the oven and bake it at a low temperature to loosen up the glue. Has worked like a charm ever since.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Wow, I never knew that!</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I think one of the reasons people look back so fondly on the Xbox 360 is that, in retrospect, it felt like the last time you could contain the entirety of what was going on, coming out, and being talked about in your head at any given time. It was still very intimate and physical, with midnight launches and stacks of controllers in the split-screen coop session. There was spectacle with E3 but also the feeling you alone were discovering these incredible hidden treasures on Xbox Live Arcade, which was like a return to finding the internet for the first time again.</p>

 <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> I agree. And they just had so many games that became sensations for a time, from <em>Braid</em> to <em>Geometry Wars</em>. The curation was exceptional, and it was an era in which it still felt like the whole culture, or much of it at least, could still come together for a few weeks around some exciting new downloadable game.</p> <p><strong>Moises: </strong>Yeah. By comparison, when the PS4 really started to pivot to those smaller more intimate games early in its lifetime, it wasn’t that those games were lesser, but it did feel like they were being more haphazardly thrown on the platform to fill gaps between big exclusives. Meanwhile XBLA had these clearly thought out rollouts and events that made a big deal of Arcade titles. Also everything was less shitty. Xbox Live Gold was the original multiplayer subscription, and the only one for quite some time, but it at least seemed to provide value with great deals and a platform that produced rock solid multiplayer hits. It also wasn’t as expensive as anything is nowadays.</p>

  <p><strong>Carolyn:</strong> Before we wrap things up here, I think we can’t talk about what an amazing console the 360 was without saying a little more about its games. Are there any games y’all want to shout out as particular favorites that really helped make that library great or were emblematic of what the console was doing? When I think about the 360, I think about how the grittiness of <em>Gears of War</em> coexisted harmoniously alongside the whimsy of <em>Viva Pinata</em>, and I’ll never forget the dozens of hours my friends and I spent driving around doing challenges together in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>. It really did feel, more than a lot of other consoles, like it offered something for everyone, and like the people behind it thought deeply about how to bring people together to share in the experiences it offered.</p> <p>And even though some of its games were also on PlayStation, at least everyone in my friend group, won over by the cheevos and online features of Xbox, always bought multiplatform games there, which perpetuated the console’s dominance in that generation. It’s a little wild to think how this generation it feels somewhat the opposite for me, like most people I know play most multiplatform games on PlayStation. Wild how the tables have turned. But yeah, any other 360 shoutouts?</p>

 <p><strong>Moises: </strong>I cannot separate the 360 from the stunning role it did in promoting so many smaller studios to the mainstream. I already invoked Bastion from Supergiant Games, but I can’t not shoutout Limbo and Playdead, which has now delivered two absolutely singular game experiences in a row. Oh and Shadow Complex does still own.</p> <p><strong>Ethan: </strong><em>Limbo </em>was incredible. While the indie darling backlash was fair and warranted, it was really an incredible run of curation there for several years. <em>The Dishwasher</em> games were great, and really spoke to that sense of Newgrounds 2.0 animating the grungy vibe of XBLA. It’s also wild how much Microsoft tried to court Japanese RPG fans with<em> Blue Dragon</em> and<em> Lost Odyssey</em>. For me personally, <em>Dungeon Defenders</em> is still an all-time great. One of the last times I was able to rope friends into playing something for hours with me on a couch.</p> <p>I was trying to think of my top five favorite 360 games, exclusive or no, and couldn’t stop listing stuff. The end of that console generation was so strong, on both 360 and PS3, maybe there’s hope that the Series X/S and PS5 pick up in their final years. But with massive budgets, long development times, and so much risk-averse consolidation, I’m not hopeful.</p> <p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>Whether it picks up to some degree or not, I think it’s safe to say that there will never be an era quite like that exemplified by the 360 again. The console was just perfectly poised to take advantage of a given moment in gaming culture and technology, employing exciting new ideas like achievements to build a sense of both community and friendly competition around games in ways that its library and online service leveraged brilliantly. Also, Sneak King was great.</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Any parting thoughts since you vanished, Alyssa?</p> <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> LMAO. The time my 360 red ringed right before I went up for senior year of college. The day before. And I went out and bought another because not having one wasn’t an option. That or the time my mother heard me cursing out misogynists in Italian?</p> <p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Was it on the $3 phone bank operator Xbox 360 headset?</p> <p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> Beninteso!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Meta Quest 3S is literally the best value proposition in VR headsets at the moment. It’s an entry-level model capable of delivering performance very close to the premium Quest 3 which sells for $599. For the vast majority of buyers, this will be the smart choice.</p>
<p>Now the 128GB version has dropped to an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">all-time record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday at $249, down from $299</a>. The numbers say a lot about demand: over <strong>30,000 units sold in just a few days</strong>. This is the best-selling VR headset in its category right now and the popularity speaks well of the exceptional performance-to-price ratio that Meta managed to achieve with this model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wireless Freedom</h2>
<p>The <strong>completely wireless design eliminates the cables and external sensors</strong> that plagued earlier VR generations. You move naturally through virtual spaces without tripping over cords or worrying about connection points. Room-scale VR experiences feel liberating once you can spin, duck, and explore without physical tethers. Inside-out tracking uses built-in cameras rather than requiring external base stations. Set up takes minutes instead of hours, and you can play anywhere with enough clear space.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor brings <strong>double the graphical processing power of the previous Quests</strong>. Games load faster, graphics render with more detail, and frame rates stay smooth during intense action. This leap in processing power enables the creation of more complex virtual environments with better lighting, textures, and physics simulation. Developers can be more ambitious when constructing an experience because they know the hardware can sustain it.</p>



<p>The 8GB of RAM represents a 33% memory increase that directly impacts performance: The more RAM, the more the headset can juggle several background processes without bogging down active gameplay. Apps switch faster, menus load quicker, and the overall experience just feels more responsive. Games can load larger levels and handle more simultaneous objects without stuttering.</p>
<p>Dual RGB color cameras power a full-color Passthrough feature that will seamlessly blend the real and virtual worlds together. You can see your actual room in color while interacting with virtual objects overlaid in your space.<strong> Mixed reality apps let you place digital furniture in your home</strong> to preview before buying. Fitness apps show you your real environment while adding virtual trainers and UI elements. The quality of Passthrough is on par with what you’d see when looking through a pair of sunglasses, making it very practical for extended use.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life exceeds two hours on a single charge</strong> and covers most gaming sessions quite comfortably. Improved power management also extends playtime compared to earlier Quest models. Quick charging gets you back into action a lot faster once the battery runs low. External battery packs that are compatible with USB-C can extend sessions indefinitely, if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Instant access to 40+ games as part of the 3-month tria</strong>l removes any barrier to software purchases out of the gate. Popular titles from a multitude of genres give you plenty to explore while you discover what VR experiences you enjoy most. The ever-growing games catalog adds new releases monthly, so fresh content will surface regularly.</p>
<p>The exclusive<strong> Gorilla Tag bundle adds a selection of in-game items and currency</strong> that fans of the popular multiplayer game will appreciate. This social VR title has gained phenomenal traction, and the exclusive content sweetens things for existing fans or curious newbies alike. The 1000 shiny rocks provide immediate in-game purchasing power.</p>
<p>At $249, the Meta Quest 3S 128GB is offering flagship VR performance at an entry-level price this Black Friday. This headset sits just $50 above the old Quest 2 while offering dramatically better specs that approach the $599 Quest 3.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-drops-airpods-pro-3-to-a-record-low-for-the-first-time-margin-clearly-isn%E2%80%99t-a-priority-this-black-friday.1362634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Apple drops a new tech device to replace a top-rated favorite — say, the AirPods Pro 2 — the first questions are always “how much better can the new one be?” and “do I really need to upgrade?” In the case of the AirPods Pro 3, the answers are “a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>” and “yes, absolutely.” The AirPods Pro 3 aren’t just Apple’s best active noise-cancelling in-ear buds, they’re the best ones made by anyone, anywhere, at any time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">They’re also on sale for the very first time at Amazon for Black Friday, with an all-time low price of $220.</a></p>
<p>There’s definitely nothing wrong with the AirPods Pro 2. They’re still among the very best wireless earbuds on the market (and almost certainly the subject of some epic Black Friday deals of their own, especially now that the Pro 3s have arrived). But the Pro 3s are on a whole new level, from their sound and noise cancellation to their redesigned feel — more contoured, shorter stems, and a better overall fit. As much as we love the Pro 2s and didn’t think we’d be recommending an upgrade this soon, here we are.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Turns Phenomenal</h2>
<p>As long as the list of serious perks is for the AirPods Pro 3, we have to start with the active noise cancellation. It takes the formidable ANC of the Pro 2s and doubles it, creating the world’s best in-ear active noise cancellation. And now with as much of the outside world blocked out as you want, you can immerse yourself in the upgraded sound of the Pro 3s. Apple’s added a new acoustic architecture that really brings out the bass, but also the mids, vocals, and every facet of the music.</p>
<p>It’s also an improved Spatial Audio sound, which will have you turning your head to move the sound source over and over until you get used to just how realistic the effect is. And you can move your head or any other part of your body as much as you like with the AirPods Pro 3, because in addition to the more contoured design, they also come with five sets of ear tips to ensure a more secure fit. The AirPods were already great workout buds, but the better fit and the new heart-rate-sensing feature that links to the Move ring and step count on your iPhone, and also the Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy feature.</p>



<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>Active Noise Cancellation is a notoriously greedy feature when it comes to battery life, but the AirPods Pro 3 give you 8 full hours of ANC listening time on a single charge, and 10 hours in Transparency mode, even if you engage the Hearing Aid feature that’s been carried over and enhanced from the AirPods Pro 2. The Hearing Aid feature now has automatic Conversation Boost and active Hearing Protection to safeguard your ears when the environment around you gets overly loud. (Think live sporting events or construction zones.)</p>
<p>If putting the brand-new AirPods Pro 3 on sale is Apple’s opening move for Black Friday and Cyber Week, it’s a sign of a truly epic holiday shopping season to come. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">This Amazon deal for $220 is the lowest price yet on the AirPods Pro 3, and they’re a worthy upgrade even from their famously great predecessors.</a></p>

              <p><em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>‘s legendary Lord Yuri, Udo Kier, has died aged 81. The news of the death of the well-loved German actor on Sunday morning was <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/udo-kier-dead-own-private-idaho-andy-warhol-frankenstein-1236590259/">shared by his partner</a> Delbert McBride, followed by an impassioned online tribute from Hideo Kojima.</p> <p>For games players, Kier is most immediately identifiable as Lord Yuri, in what’s widely considered to be one of the best&nbsp;<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games,&nbsp;<em>Red Alert 2</em>. Leader of the Soviet Psychic Corps, Yuri was the antagonist of the game, and the star of the esteemed expansion pack,&nbsp;<em>Yuri’s Revenge</em>. The <em>C&amp;C</em> games were famous for their use of FMV and real-world actors, making Kier a very familiar face to a generation of strategy gamers.</p>

 <p>Over his career, Kier appeared in over 220 films, working with legends like Lars von Trier, Werner Herzog, Gus Van Saint and Alexander Payne, and most recently was due to star in Hideo Kojima’s mysterious next game,&nbsp;<em>OD</em>. In the game, co-written with Jordan Peele, Kier was due to play one of the lead roles, alongside Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer. Kojima reacted to the news of Kier’s death this morning on X, calling the actor an “icon of his time.”</p>

 <p>According to Kojima’s post,&nbsp;<em>OD</em>‘s filming (the game, like so many of the creator’s, was due to use motion capture and astonishingly photorealistic faces for its characters) was delayed until 2026 by the recent voice actors strike, meaning none of Kier’s scenes have been shot. Kojima stated that despite this, the two had stayed in close contact, emailing one another and meeting up as recently as September. “He told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year,” said the video game director.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m at a loss for words. It all happened far too suddenly.<br>Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot “OD” for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year.

Other video game roles for the actor included 2022’s&nbsp;<em>Martha Is Dead</em> and 2017’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: WWII</em>, but his portrayal as the ESP-wielding Lord Yuri will always be his most iconic.</p>

The 2024 Galaxy Tab A9+ finds its place in the <strong>middle of budget and premium</strong> and offers solid specs without the price of a flagship. You get an 11-inch tablet ready to provide a quality Android experience for consumption, casual gaming and productivity tasks. Now down to just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">$149 from $219 for the 64GB/WiFi, it has reached a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday</a>.</p>

<h2>Big Screen Entertainment</h2>
<p>It has an<strong> 11-inch display running at a resolution of 1920 x 1200</strong>, and provides sharp text and detailed video playback. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> gives you a noticeably smoother scrolling through apps and websites compared to the more common 60Hz on tablets. Peak brightness reaches 480 nits to give you good visibility outdoors or in bright rooms. The TFT LCD panel does a solid job with color reproduction-whether you’re watching shows, browsing photos, or reading e-books.</p>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos powered quad speakers</strong> turn this tablet into a surprisingly capable media machine. Movies, TV shows, and music will all be augmented by the increased audio that fills a room. The speakers feature directional sound, a more immersive experience than that of single or dual speaker arrangements. You can comfortably watch content without having to use headphones and actually hear what is being said.</p>



<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 69<strong> processor performs everyday tasks with competent performance</strong>. Streaming video, web browsing, social media scrolling, and casual gaming are relatively smooth. Similarly, 4GB of RAM manages multiple apps open simultaneously without excessive slowdown. You won’t mistake this for a flagship tablet when running demanding games or heavy multitasking, but it covers the basics reliably. The 64GB of internal storage <strong>expands up to 1TB via microSD card</strong> and gives you room for downloaded content and files.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multi Window Display</em> lets you run multiple apps side by side on the large screen</strong>: Browse the web while checking email, take notes while doing video calls, or refer to a document while writing in another app. This split-screen functionality turns the tablet into a productivity tool for real work: students can research and write papers in parallel, professionals can manage spreadsheets while being part of video conferences.</p>

Choose the file you want to share, select the device nearby, and voilà! In a few seconds, your file transfers wirelessly.
