              <p data-start="0" data-end="620">As the new year begins, it’s a natural time to think about fresh starts, new routines, and treating yourself to something that actually adds value to your daily life. This is the perfect moment to invest in a piece of tech that supports your health, productivity, and lifestyle moving forward. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/">Apple’s latest release, the Apple Watch Series 11, launched earlier this year and is already seeing impressive discounts of up to 25%, making it a smart and timely upgrade to kick off the year.</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1323" data-end="1927">What’s New in the Series 11</h2>
<p data-start="1323" data-end="1927">The Apple Watch Series 11 represents Apple’s most advanced mainstream smartwatch to date. Compared to earlier generations, it brings noticeable improvements in health tracking, durability, connectivity, and overall software experience. The redesigned Liquid Glass interface gives the display a cleaner, more modern look. Enhanced Smart Stack widgets make it easier to access relevant information throughout the day, while new gesture-based controls—like a one-handed wrist flick to dismiss notifications—add convenience to everyday use.</p>
<p data-start="1929" data-end="2460">Health and fitness remain at the core of the Apple Watch experience. The Series 11 supports a wide range of biometric tracking features, including heart rate monitoring, ECG readings, blood oxygen levels, cycle tracking, and sleep analysis. A new hypertension notification feature can alert users to trends that may suggest elevated blood pressure, helping them stay informed about potential health concerns. The watch has a sleep score system, making it easy to understand sleep patterns and work toward better rest.</p>
<p data-start="2462" data-end="2810">On the software side, features like Workout Buddy provide personalized fitness insights and encouragement, helping you stay motivated and consistent with your goals. And of course, the Series 11 still includes all the familiar Apple Watch integrations, such as seamless syncing with an iPhone for calls, messages, notifications, Apple Pay, and more.</p>


<p data-start="2812" data-end="3404">From a design perspective, the Series 11 stays true to Apple’s signature sleek look. It’s available in 42mm and 46mm sizes, with a choice between aluminum or premium titanium cases. The aluminum models feature upgraded Ion-X glass, which Apple claims is roughly twice as scratch-resistant as before. With water resistance up to 50 meters and added dust protection, the watch is well suited for workouts, outdoor activities, and everyday wear. Cellular models also support 5G connectivity, allowing for faster data speeds and improved performance when your iPhone isn’t nearby.</p>
<p data-start="3740" data-end="3990" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/">If you’re looking for a meaningful way to start the new year with something that supports healthier habits, the Apple Watch Series 11 is a compelling choice.</a> The smaller 42mm model originally debuted at $399, but it’s currently available for just $299 thanks to a 25% discount. That’s a $100 savings. If you prefer a larger display, the 46mm version is also discounted. It launched at $429 and is now priced at $329, reflecting a 23% price drop. No matter which size you choose, you’re saving the same $100 for a limited time. Apple also offers a wide range of customization options, including case finishes like jet black, rose gold, and silver, along with bands in colors such as black, light blush, and purple fog, allowing you to tailor the watch to your personal style.</p>
