It’s been a frustrating situation for gamers who rely on the online retailer. But it’s finally, possibly, coming to an end. </p><p>Over the weekend, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as spotted by <em>IGN </em>and others</a></span>, a handful of first-party Nintendo games popped up on Amazon and are being officially shipped and sold by the retail giant. <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/amazon-switch-2-nintendo-mario-donkey-kong-pre-orders-1851784603&amp;asc_source=&amp;asins=B0F66KLYVH,B0F66JNF9W,B0F66GWKZS,B0F66DW2X7,B0F66DXJNM,B0F66GQLHH,B0F66DHVR7&amp;isPreview=1&amp;isSlp=1&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree, </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</em></a></span><em> </em>are some of the first-party Nintendo games now available to pre-order directly from Amazon and Nintendo. This seems to indicate that the two companies have come to an agreement and ended the lockout. There was even a listing for the Switch 2, though that has been removed for now. But this all seems to point to Nintendo products and games returning fully to Amazon in the near future. </p><p>As for why Nintendo stopped selling new games and consoles on Amazon, there’s never been a confirmation from either company. Some fans speculate that Amazon was shipping games ahead of their release and that this led to leaks, but that has yet to be confirmed. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The quest chain becomes available to you at the beginning of Act 3, and lets the Samurai frontman have the keys to V’s body to tie up some loose ends left by his untimely demise. If you’re playing a V that is wholly uninterested in Johnny’s wants and views his engram as nothing more than a digital parasite, it might not make sense to follow this path. But if you’re even the least bit curious about the impact Johnny’s left on those still alive in 2077, do these quests.

Kerry’s quests take a fascinating look at how art persists in a capitalist hellscape like Night City, and explore how even if you preserve yourself with expensive cybernetics, age and time come for us all. It’s just a matter of how you adapt to its passage.</p><p>That’s what makes Kerry’s quests interesting regardless of the V you’re playing, but if you’re rolling a male V, you can also enter a relationship with Kerry, which is one of the most interesting explorations of V and Johnny’s cohabitation. He’s the last companion you meet in the game so his story comes pretty late, but it’s definitely worth seeking out before you head into the endgame.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 3 after A Like Supreme</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Kerry</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-recommend-id="image://17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-recommend-id="image://17304c88a409d71d17e978f9aaab38ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Judy is shown sitting on the hood of a car in diving gear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Judy Alvarez is one of the few unambiguously good people in Night City, and her questline, in which she attempts to fight for better working conditions for sex workers in the city, is some of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s best introspective work.</p><p>The final quest, “Pyramid Song,” is one of the most memorable in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and shows Judy wrestling with what “home” means to her when Night City has only chewed her up and spit her out.

But that new path is only open to you because Panam and her Nomad family opens V up to a new way of thinking. Vibing with the Aldecaldos, who have no connection to the city and are mostly just passing through, offers a perspective you don’t hear very often in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. So much of the time you spend in Night City is with people who put the city and its values up on a pedestal, whereas Panam and her family have the perspective to see through its bullshit.</p><p>Panam’s questline is all about helping her get the nomads into a better position to leave Night City, and maybe by the time you’re done, you’re at least considering other possibilities for yourself.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Panam</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-recommend-id="image://309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-recommend-id="image://309233db0c8fe5f9ec83638d58eae9c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and River are shown looking at a computer in a bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike Panam, Judy, and Kerry, River is the one companion you have to go out of your way to meet. Finding the Night City cop and helping him sort through a local mystery that weaves in and out of his family life makes for one of the most interesting breaks in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s usual action. Expect a little combat and chatter, but also light adventure game mechanics and some pretty horrifying Night City lore.</p><p>This questline does, however, unmask <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s weird, inconsistent framing of cops and law enforcement, even weaponizing the ACAB saying in a particularly tacky lift that I’m not wild about. But if nothing else, these quests offer, for your inspection, a layer of the game’s inherent worldview that’s worth examining and dissecting.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Elizabeth Peralez</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-recommend-id="image://900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-recommend-id="image://900670a1c9768768ed74cb62383e0c4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Jackie are shown standing in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The trouble with “Heroes” is the quest can take different forms depending on what decisions you make during “The Heist” in Act 1. Choose to send Jackie’s body to his family or tell Delamain to wait for you with his body and you’ll be rewarded with one of the best segments in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. On the other hand, if you send him to Ripperdoc Viktor Vektor you’ll experience a much worse result that is pretty bleak.</p><p>The “good” version of “Heroes” is one of the game’s best examples of how human connection can help people weather the harsh realities of Night City. The quest reflects on Jackie’s life and legacy, and lets you insert a little of your own relationship with him, too.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after The Heist</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Mama Welles</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-recommend-id="image://69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-recommend-id="image://69d3d472a97106d78ae61d41e4121aff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joshua and a corpo are shown sitting at a restaurant table while he eats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The questline known colloquially as “Sinnerman” is harrowing, but offers one of the most rewarding hypotheticals V will face in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. It follows convicted murderer Joshua Stephenson, who has a religious awakening in prison. Here, he decides he wants to face execution by crucifixion, which will be recorded in a Braindance for millions to experience every sensation and emotion.<br></p><p>Joshua asks V to accompany him in his final days, and the drama that unfolds asks the player to question the prisoner’s faith, whether you’re just being inquisitive or outright antagonistic. It also presents you with opportunities to meddle and interrogate whether that’s your place, making for a fascinating philosophical debate with Joshua, Johnny, and ultimately yourself.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Life During Wartime</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Wakako Okada</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-recommend-id="image://2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-recommend-id="image://2d9def182ef496fb2d32063a92a1b430" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Peralezes are seen sitting in their living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is spent either on the ground floor of Night City or dealing with corporations and gangs, but “Dream On” offers one of the best looks into the universe’s political systems. The quest starts with some detective work for mayoral candidate Jefferson Peralez and his wife Elizabeth, and rapidly escalates into a grand conspiracy involving political power in Night City. It goes some wild directions before reaching its conclusion, and hints at some larger forces working in the background of Night City that are fun to speculate about.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after I Fought The Law</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Jefferson Peralez</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-recommend-id="image://4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-recommend-id="image://4d958f9aceaa208dc9dbd0d4c7519b02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown facing off in Delamain's core." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has a few types of collectathon quests, but the Delamain cabs ones are probably the best. The questline starts with a simple call from Delamain, the AI that runs a self-driving cab service in Night City, as several of his cars have gone MIA around the city. Each AI-powered car you round up has a distinct personality. Some are great, like a car terrified of drive too fast that you have to carefully direct back to its home base. Some are obnoxious, like one that is literally just GLaDOS from <em>Portal</em>, which was a dated reference in 2020 and even more dated now. But it all culminates in a final quest that gets into some light immersive sim elements and has a pretty great decision to make at the very end.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Playing For Time</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Automatically acquired in Act 2</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2805d726dd8fd5236c082e799c1c03f3" data-recommend-id="image://2805d726dd8fd5236c082e799c1c03f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V is shown wearing a replica of Johnny's jacket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V is shown wearing a replica of Johnny's jacket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2805d726dd8fd5236c082e799c1c03f3" data-recommend-id="image://2805d726dd8fd5236c082e799c1c03f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V is shown wearing a replica of Johnny's jacket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Grand, big-idea quests have their place, but sometimes you just need to tuck into a small corner of Night City and learn a little more about the people on ground level. “The Ballad of Buck Ravers” is a great such quest that bolsters V and Johnny’s relationship in the context of local musicians and their fandoms. The merc and the digital copy of the rocker-turned-terrorist bond over music and reflect on the legacy Johnny still enjoys in the hearts of those who loved his music more than his explosive, anarchic antics.<br></p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Playing For Time</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Talk to the busker in Japantown</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a35e5ccd6feeb4dc65ab97e173f3c57" data-recommend-id="image://9a35e5ccd6feeb4dc65ab97e173f3c57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown pondering something over a series of warehouses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown pondering something over a series of warehouses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a35e5ccd6feeb4dc65ab97e173f3c57" data-recommend-id="image://9a35e5ccd6feeb4dc65ab97e173f3c57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Johnny are shown pondering something over a series of warehouses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Bes Isis, Samurai’s ex-keyboardist and current investigative journalist, has been working on a story for a while, but her leads are drying up. “Killing in the Name” sends V and Johnny on a wild goose chase around Night City in search of clues, digital footprints, and the source of an urban legend. Its conclusion is pretty tongue-in-cheek but illustrates how chatter on the internet can become a bigger story worth reporting on.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Transmission, on hold until Act 3 after A Like Supreme</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Check your email in your apartment after Transmission, then call Bes Isis after A Like Supreme</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="45dd0c0bcfa6b75ddf76997730a743c6" data-recommend-id="image://45dd0c0bcfa6b75ddf76997730a743c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Claire and V are shown standing next to her giant combat truck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Claire and V are shown standing next to her giant combat truck." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45dd0c0bcfa6b75ddf76997730a743c6" data-recommend-id="image://45dd0c0bcfa6b75ddf76997730a743c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Claire and V are shown standing next to her giant combat truck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you can’t stand driving in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, this quest is not for you. If you have any sensible taste in how a car should handle in a video game you probably can’t stand driving in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, in which case “The Beast in Me” is not for you. There’s a reason I drive motorcycles exclusively in this game, and that’s because the 2.0 update did nothing to stop cars from feeling like they’re constantly hydroplaning.<br></p><p>All that being said, “The Beast In Me,” while comprised of a series of standard open-world street races, delivers some lovely character work after you cross the finish line. The questline follows Claire, the bartender at The Afterlife bar V frequents. She’s looking for a driver for some street races, and V has a driver’s license so they’re more than qualified to get behind the wheel and get shot at. The driving is still a pain, but some good, contemplative story beats wait in the margins.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 2 after Playing For Time</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Phone call from Claire</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65b9a6f25b2295fbb669bd292f8d0b0f" data-recommend-id="image://65b9a6f25b2295fbb669bd292f8d0b0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Brendan are shown talking to a Night City citizen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="V and Brendan are shown talking to a Night City citizen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65b9a6f25b2295fbb669bd292f8d0b0f" data-recommend-id="image://65b9a6f25b2295fbb669bd292f8d0b0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="V and Brendan are shown talking to a Night City citizen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s capitalist hellscape not even a vending machine can just be a vending machine.

Do you want to hear her voice act in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>? Whatever your answer to either of those questions, Grimes voices android pop artist Lizzy Wizzy in “Violence” (and she also shows up again in <em>Phantom Liberty</em>). The diva fears her boyfriend and manager might be cheating, and wants V to look into it in secret. The quest’s conclusion ends up leading you to something far more insidious than infidelity, making for one of the prime examples of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> saying “well that was fucked up, huh?” and just…moving on. But it also explores how artists are commodified in Night City, and the horrifying endgame corporations have in mind for people whose work they profit from.</p><p><strong>Available in:</strong> Act 3 after the final part of Tapeworm</p><p><strong>How to acquire:</strong> Text message from an unknown sender asking to meet at No-Tell Motel</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25b9374bf23976132950007f2fd19cb6" data-recommend-id="image://25b9374bf23976132950007f2fd19cb6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Barry is shown sitting in his gross ass apartment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Barry is shown sitting in his gross ass apartment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="25b9374bf23976132950007f2fd19cb6" data-recommend-id="image://25b9374bf23976132950007f2fd19cb6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Barry is shown sitting in his gross ass apartment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>During <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s second act you’ll pass by a couple of cops trying to talk to one of your apartment neighbors.
