However, unless you were too busy watching Nintendo Directs or haven’t looked at the in-game manual on the main menu, you’ve probably been sleeping on a really neat tool that <em>Mario Kart World </em>added to your driving repertoire. In light of this, let’s take a look at what the new Rewind command does, as well as how to use it to significantly improve the single player experience.</p><figure id="" data-id="eaead72ae983b42cb1e32cb8b9746ab4" data-recommend-id="image://eaead72ae983b42cb1e32cb8b9746ab4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Mario Kart World.

A circular arrow is in the middle of the screen, indicating that the Rewind command is in use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h53360"><a id=""></a>What does Rewind do?</h2><p>On the surface, Rewind sounds pretty simple. <strong>As long as you’re playing single-player in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you can tap the down button on the D-Pad and reset your driver’s position to where they were a couple seconds ago.</strong> Hold down the button and your driver will Rewind even further back in time. Straightforward, right?</p><p>Well, there are a <em>few </em>nuances to how exactly Rewind works—The Dry Bones is in the details, as they say. For instance, <strong>Rewind doesn’t rewind the entire game when it’s used, just your driver’s position</strong>. So if you’re first in a race and you get hit by a red shell that knocks you into 24th place, you’ll still be in 24th even after using Rewind. In fact, you’ll be even <em>worse </em>off, as Rewind will just make your opponents’ leads even greater. </p><p>Rewind will also generally maintain your driver’s momentum from the moment you pressed Rewind, as opposed to resetting it to whatever state your driver was in at the point you Rewind to. To put that in simple terms, if you were going top speed and got hit with a red shell, you’ll still have to accelerate to reach top speed again even if you go back to the moment before you were hit with the shell. Conversely, if you <em>were </em>at your driver’s top speed at the time you press Rewind, you’ll be going just as fast as you were before hitting the Rewind button.</p><p><strong>Just keep in mind that Rewind is <em>completely incompatible </em>with Drifting.</strong> You can’t initiate a Rewind during a Drift, and you can’t rewind into a Drift either. If you’re in the middle of a race, make sure to think twice about using Rewind if you just finished turning a sharp corner.</p><h2 id="h53361"><a id=""></a>How to best use Rewind in<em> Mario Kart World</em></h2><p>This is starting to sound like a list of inconveniences. You might be wondering exactly <em>how </em>Rewind can realistically help you out in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. While this isn’t all-inclusive, there are two use cases where using Rewind can save you a lot of time and frustration.</p><p><strong>The first and most obvious use of Rewind is in Free Roam mode</strong>. There are several “?” Panels and Peach Medallions that require tricky jumps to reach, and setting those maneuvers up can take time. Normally, failing a huge leap means repeating all that driving around to return to your original vantage point. <strong>By using Rewind, you can easily undo your mistake and give it another shot in seconds.</strong> Rewind is equally helpful when you accidentally fall from a high place in a map that’d normally take a handful of minutes to return to!</p><figure id="" data-id="c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-recommend-id="image://c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif of Mario Kart World gameplay.

Waluigi is shown getting rewound to avoid the impact of a Blue Shell." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-recommend-id="image://c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif of Mario Kart World gameplay. Waluigi is shown getting rewound to avoid the impact of a Blue Shell." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The second reason you might want to Rewind is that <strong>it can make you impervious to Blue Shells</strong>. That’s right, as long as you’re in the middle of the Rewind animation, items and other racers can’t hurt you until it’s over. So when a Blue Shell is hanging over your head, a well-timed Rewind will completely circumvent the blast and preserve whatever item you were holding onto at the time.</p><p>You of course will still lose ground because of the way Rewind inherently works, and a Rewind <em>after </em>you get hit won’t do anything for you. Still, if you’ve hit your top speed and you’re on a straightaway, a quick Rewind won’t set you back as much as letting a shell smack you.</p><p>This isn’t all-inclusive of how Rewind can help, but once you realize these tricks exist, you’ll learn to really love this button. And if you’re in the market of saving time and potential frustration, make sure to learn <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">how to AFK your way into unlocking every vehicle in <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span><em> </em>as well.<strong> Just remember that you can’t Rewind when you’re racing online!</strong></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-when-how-to-rewind-switch-2-1851785829]]></content:encoded>

Doing so will complete a challenge. </p><p>Next, hop over to the challenge menu and look for an exclamation mark indicating a completed challenge.

Even the reward text for creating a character seems to reference the skater, telling players not to spend it all in one place, before teasing that maybe they should do that. </p><p>If I were a conspiratorial person, I’d ponder this scenario: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278">Tony Hawk reportedly pushed for Bam Margera</a></span> to be added to the game very late in the process. That could have meant it was tricky to add him to the full roster, so they added him as a secret character, but they really wanted people to be able to play as him. It’s been nearly two decades since Bam was in a <em>Tony Hawk </em>game! So the devs set his price to something pretty low and made it easy to unlock him within minutes of booting the game, effectively making him a playable character right from the moment you start.<br></p><p>Regardless, you’ve probably stopped reading this blog ages ago because you went to unlock him<em>.</em> So I’ll just keep thinking about this grand conspiracy alone. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804]]></content:encoded>

That doesn’t detract from the original experience, nor does it make it any less the ‘canonical’ version of the story.” Sure, disembodied voice.

This is why the flashback-heavy format is so crucial to the story it tells, and is one of the many reasons HBO’s show feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of the story it’s adapting. Denying the player cathartic, easy answers is a core part of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and laying out its story in the most straightforward, literal way feels like capitulating to an audience that already didn’t like the story you told in the first place, whether they knew why Abby killed Joel early on or not.
