In the podcast episode, Stiller implies they were working on <em>Severance </em>before the streamer’s existence was publicly announced, as he described the early experience as “developing this show for a platform that didn’t exist yet.” What we didn’t know at the time the series order made news is that Apple wasn’t convinced Scott should be Mark, and a year went by with no new developments on the show because they were trying to figure out how to get Apple on board with Scott starring.</p><p> “There was a long process of talking about other ideas. But, really, I was not going to do the show if [Scott] wasn’t going to do it. I kept saying that to them, and they were like, ‘Okay, maybe you’ll think of this actor. Maybe you’ll think of that actor,’” Stiller recalls. </p><p>Stiller was confused as to why the bigwigs at Apple were dragging their feet on accepting Scott, but changed their minds once they saw Scott read for the part. Taking it all in stride, Scott humbly admits his star power might not have been enough for the Apple head honchos. “I understood why they were feeling this way because, the first time I read this script, my first instinct was: ‘There’s no way I’m going to end up doing this. This is too good,’” Scott explains. “If I was Apple, I would likely be wanting a giant star to play this role.”</p><p>Since Apple came to their senses, Scott has gone on to garner an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe nomination for Beat Actor in a Television Series — Drama for his impeccable portrayal of Mark on <em>Severance. </em>Apple were saved from themselves, and we all have Stiller and his year-long persistence to thank for it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, back in 2010, we did get just such a game. </p><p><em>Transformers: War for Cybertron </em>is a third-person action shooter that lets you play through both sides of the civil war on the robotic planet of Cybertron. One campaign is focused on the Autobots and the other tells the story of the Decepticons. And don’t expect Earth or humans in this game, as it’s all about the bloody civil war that, eventually, leads to the fall of Cybertron (good name for a sequel) and the exodus of the Transformers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>War for Cybertron</em></a></span> and its sequel, <em>Fall of Cybertron</em>, play like most other third-person action shooters of the day, complete with the <em>Gears of War</em>-inspired “Hold this button to look at something cool happening” feature. But that’s fine, because instead of boring soldiers shooting people, you get to play as giant transforming robots with silly names who use big guns to destroy other robots, and ayou can become a car or hover tank, too. </p><p><em>War </em>and <em>Fall </em>both know that people want action and sci-fi nonsense in a <em>Transformers </em>game, make the right call in giving you plenty of that. Also, I hope you like different-colored metal corridors filled with nameless robot drones who you blast away over and over again, because that’s mostly what you do in these games. That may not sound great, but because it’s covered in <em>Transformers </em>lore, characters, and weirdness, it still ends up being a lot of fun. And unlike most other third-person corridor shooters of the era, you can transform into a car or a hover tank whenever you want. While in either form you can move faster and gain access to more powerful weapons. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They truly are more than meets than eye. </a></span></p><p>What’s wild to me is that I’m not a <em>Transformers </em>fan and I still enjoyed going back and replaying <em>War for Cybertron</em> earlier this week. If you <em>are</em> a <em>Transformers</em> fan, I expect you’ll get even more out of all the characters and lore shoved into these action-packed shooters. </p><h2 id="h165560"><a id=""></a><em>War for Cybertron</em> deserves a second life</h2><p>So how do you play <em>War for Cybertron</em> and its sequel in 2025? It ain’t easy. The games were pulled from digital storefronts years ago once Activision’s licensing deals expired, so you can’t just buy them on Steam. You can find used Xbox 360 copies floating around on eBay and other sites for under $30, but you’ll need an Xbox 360 console to play them, as none of the games are backward compatible. </p><p>There are other ways to find these games and play them on PC; perhaps you might check out some large archive of content on the internet. Once you get your PC version (I’m not asking how), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can use this tiny tool</a></span> to unlock the framerate and play <em>War for Cybertron</em> at 120 FPS. </p><p>It’s a shame that Microsoft and Activision haven’t cut a deal with Hasbro to remaster or at the very least port these <em>Transformers </em>games to modern hardware so more people can play them. We know Hasbro wants these games made available again, so it seems like it comes down to Activision. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571">The publisher claimed in 2023</a></span> that despite comments from Hasbro, it still had access to original code for the games. Over a year later, nothing has manifested and it’s still hard as heck to play these popular <em>Transformers </em>games. Which is a shame. </p><p>While we’ve continued to receive smaller <em>Transformers </em>games over the years, it’s been far too long since the last big-budget game based on the franchise hit store shelves. Hasbro and the other companies involved should work out a deal and get the <em>Cybertron </em>titles back on digital stores in 2025, giving <em>Transformers </em>fans who missed out a chance to play these fantastic games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tanks are typically expected to be defensive bullet sponges that pull aggro from their squishier teammates. But the role splits into two: some are main tank protectors, others are off-tank supporters, who run into a team fight hoping their healers are paying attention. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’</a></span> Vanguards similarly fall into several different archetypes, and each has a niche they occupy. But who is the best? While it can depend on the situation, a few heroes are more versatile than others, letting us love them more. Here’s our ranking of the eight tanks that are in the game now. We’ll update this ranking when the Thing is added later in Season 1.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-recommend-id="image://06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-recommend-id="image://06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As far as Vanguards go, I consider myself a Captain America main. Because I’ve spent a decent amount of time wielding his vibranium shield I’m confident in saying that America’s Ass is easily the worst tank in the game that I keep using because I haven’t found another character I gel with. When Steve pops off, it feels incredibly satisfying—more often than not you jump into a fight, slap someone around for a little bit, then jump out as your health rapidly deteriorates. Cap is one of the most disruptive heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it’s hard to get that much value out of him when his melee-based kit lacks that certain punch you need to make the most of his dives. If his attacks were a little more powerful and he could reliably get kills, he could be a contender, but right now, he serves as little more than a distraction while other heroes pull off more impressive plays.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-recommend-id="image://789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-recommend-id="image://789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Master of Magnetism is one of the more methodical Vanguards in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Sure, his slower kit isn’t as exciting as barreling through enemy teams as Thor, or setting up an ambush as Doctor Strange—hence his lower place in this list—but if you need someone to exert enormous amounts of pressure onto an enemy team and stop your team from getting dived on, Magneto’s an excellent pick. His shield-based moveset is all about absorbing damage and throwing it right back at the enemy team. He requires more patience than other tanks on the roster, but in the right hands, he’s a fortified frontline fighter.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-recommend-id="image://828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-recommend-id="image://828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On his face, the Hulk can come off like a gimmick character, clearly taking a page from <em>Overwatch</em>’s book. Like D.Va in Blizzard’s shooter, the Hulk has two forms, one much weaker with only a pistol to pester enemies until he can return to his massive, more impactful form. Despite this, The Hulk is an effective dive hero with good crowd control, mobility, and ways to convert damage into power, and he has better damage output than Captain America, so you can actually reliably smash your way through a team fight. His Super Hulk ultimate is an incredible survival tool that heals you to a whopping 1500 health, and altogether he’s just a really bulky brawler that can wreck shop when you know how best to cycle your abilities. However, Hulk’s team-up abilities make him one of the most desirable off tank picks with certain teammates. Pairing Hulk with Doctor Strange and Iron Man gives the two sarcastic geniuses an incredible damage boost that can make even half a team a force to be reckoned with. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-recommend-id="image://0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-recommend-id="image://0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the more entertaining spins <em>Marvel Rivals </em>puts on <em>Overwatch </em>archetypes is making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span> the equivalent of the robot-piloting hamster, Wrecking Ball. The symbiote-journalist duo is all about swinging into the battlefield, causing a bunch of chaos, and then feeding on all the incoming damage to get a second wind. He’s got great crowd control as he slows enemy movement, and can disrupt an enemy team formation better than most other heroes on the roster. Admittedly, he is one of the more independent tanks, and doesn’t have much in the way of supportive abilities to help his team, lacking something like Magneto or Hulk’s shields, but that mostly means you need a good team comp to compliment him when he swings into battle. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-recommend-id="image://fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-recommend-id="image://fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Peni Parker is an absolute menace on defensive maps. Her mine-based kit allows her to set up traps, claim space, and has enemy teams walking on eggshells as they try to push onto an objective and avoid her explosive traps. Her abilities are less useful when you’re pushing toward an objective yourself, but her mech is powerful enough to handle scraps and push alongside more brawl-based heroes. While she may be a bit situational, Peni is easily one of the best Vanguards in the game for holding an objective and countering teams that carelessly dive on a point. Also, setting up mines in front of the enemy spawn and blowing up half their team never gets old.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-recommend-id="image://ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-recommend-id="image://ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The God of Thunder is easily the best off tank in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. His mobility attacks let him dive in and out of fights easily, but they also double as a means to isolate and assassinate enemies, even as they’re grouped up. Thor’s entire kit feeds into itself, gaining power, health, and a stronger transformative state just by smartly utilizing all of his abilities. Where some tanks are more slow-paced, rewarded for intellectual play and setup, Thor is an unstoppable force, encouraged to stay in the brawl and reliably deal some of the most devastating attacks with short universal cooldowns. The catch being all of this is powered by a unique passive called Thorforce, required to pull off some of Thor’s most impressive abilities. Managing those mechanics is the difference between getting shredded immediately and swiftly taking out the enemy supports and cutting your foes off at the knees.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-recommend-id="image://2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-recommend-id="image://2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy’s talking tree is one of the more straightforward Vanguards in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but Groot is also one of the most reliable at what he does. He uses his branch-like limbs to build walls anywhere on the map. This can be a defensive measure, but it’s also an excellent way to stall enemies from reaching an objective. Toss those suckers up in front of an enemy spawn door and it will take them at least a few seconds to shoot their way through. Not to mention his ultimate ability has some of the best crowd control, as he groups enemies together and sets them up for a quick and easy wipe. Groot is just good at getting in the way, and when the enemy team finally does make its way to him, he’s a strong brawler who can become near-invincible when Rocket is riding on his shoulder and pumping him full of health. Groot is the platonic ideal of a defensive tank, and I’m always thrilled to see one on my team.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-recommend-id="image://d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-recommend-id="image://d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stephen Strange is easily the Vanguard who has gotten the most buzz since <em>Marvel Rivals</em> was in beta, largely because his portal ability led to some hilarious viral moments of tricking foes into walking off the side of the map out of spawn. But that’s a microcosm of what makes him a compelling tank, because the experimentation he allows is unmatched by almost any other character in the roster.</p><p>Baseline, Doctor Strange is one of the most effective defensive heroes because his shield is a big Reinhardt-style wall that can protect multiple heroes at once. But after you pair that with the sorcerer’s flight-based mobility, his possibilities as a shutdown character make him an excellent counter to some of the greatest threats in the game. Is your enemy’s Hela about to unleash a devastating ultimate on your team? Fly up in her face, throw up your shield, and give your team a chance to take cover before she can rain damage down on you. Is the enemy team putting too much pressure on your team to successfully get out of spawn? Throw up a portal and ambush them from behind. And yes, a well-placed portal can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-doctor-strange-portal-combo-exploit-kills-1851723986&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-doctor-strange-portal-combo-exploit-kills-1851723986">play incredible mind games with the enemy team</a></span>, tricking them into walking off into a chasm, or forcing them into a loop by placing both ends of the portal in front of their spawn room doors.</p><p>Doctor Strange is the kind of hero you need to keep a game like <em>Marvel Rivals </em>interesting. Right now, NetEase <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-midtown-map-dazzler-tease-poster-1851736189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-midtown-map-dazzler-tease-poster-1851736189">hasn’t been shutting down too many of the shenanigans</a></span> players have been uncovering in the game’s first month, and for the sake of its longevity, I hope Doctor Strange remains one of the most unique and experimental characters in the game.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Given the size of the PS5 platform and the expected first-year sales of the Switch 2, it could also be a huge boon to the decade-old multiplayer collection for millions of new players who may never have experienced the critically-acclaimed series in the past to come swarming to its servers. </p><p>The alleged leak comes amid a flurry of other rumors of multiplatform game-hopping in 2025. Windows Central executive editor Jez Corden suggested that <em>Flight Simulator</em> and <em>Master Chief Collection</em> will be far from the only Xbox ports flying to other consoles this year. “Way more than that,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1877737536048574891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1877737536048574891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on X.

Microsoft began this shift a year ago by bringing <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Pentiment</em>, and <em>Grounded</em> to other platforms, and has already confirmed its big Xbox exclusive of 2024, <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, will come to PS5 less than six months after release.<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>are also already confirmed to be coming day-and-date to Sony’s console in 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
