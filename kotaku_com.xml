              <p>Valve’s attempt to have courts dismiss a legal action brought against it for allegations of overcharging and anti-competitive practices has failed, as reported by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">the <em>BBC</em></a>. A <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/judgments/16407724-vicki-shotbolt-class-representative-limited-v-valve-corporation-judgment-cpo">judge’s ruling</a> is allowing the case brought by lawyer Vicki Shotbolt to go ahead on behalf of 14 million Steam users in the UK.</p> <p>First filed in 2024, Shotbolt’s claim (with <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/about-us/">its own fancy website</a>) is an attempt to prove that Valve’s policies on Steam violate UK laws on “anti-competitive prices” and “unfair trading conditions that prevent or hinder others from competing with them.” The argument concerns Valve’s demand that games sold on Steam not be made available at a permanently lower price on rival stores, <em>and</em> that once you buy a game on Steam, the only way you can buy further content for that game—be it DLC, expansion packs or cosmetics—is also via Steam. This, Shotbolt claims, allows Valve to “hold a dominant position in the PC gaming market” and “that it may have used this position in ways that violate UK competition law.”</p>

 <p>Class action lawsuits are not a commonplace event in the UK, where the mass litigation is known as a “collective action claim,” and works on an “opt-out” basis. Basically, Shotbolt and her law firm are going to sue Valve on behalf of British Steam users unless they specifically say they don’t want in. That’s how it’s able to claim to be suing on behalf of 14 million people.</p> <p>Valve, obviously, objects to the claims, and filed to have the case thrown out. A ruling filed January 26 by the Competition Appeal Tribunal says that Valve opposed on the basis that the “PCR” (the shorthand for Shotbolt’s group) “had not put forward an adequate methodology” before venturing all manner of peculiarly specific fiddly details about “determining the effect of the alleged PPOs [Platform Parity Obligations]” and that the “class definition was inadequate” and so on. The latter was seemingly based on lots of kids using Steam, and how they couldn’t opt in or out of the action. It all seemed to amount to “They didn’t cross their Ts sufficiently,” and the tribunal was having none of that.</p>

 <p>Shotbolt’s team promised to double-check their punctuation, and that seemed to be enough to have Valve’s concerns overturned. “The PCR proposed revisions to the <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/#classDefinition">proposed class definition</a> which substantially diminished the concerns raised by Valve,” says the ruling, which appears to mean they rejigged things to ensure it was just representing over 13s…I think? “In light of that development,” says the ruling, “the Tribunal rejected Valve’s challenge in this respect.”</p>

 <p>All of that basically amounts to “Yup, this action can go ahead,” which will mightily annoy Valve. Those who don’t want to be included in the entire PC gaming population of Britain will have the option to opt out pretty soon, given <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/">the site’s FAQ</a> stated it was waiting for this very certification before offering the option. Given 99.9 percent of Steam users will never even know this action is taking place, that sounds impressively farcical.</p> <p>Should the PCR win, it’ll mean everyone in the UK is entitled to some money back, which will likely be fairly meaningless amounts to all involved except for Valve. The claim is looking for £656 million, which at the time of writing is $904 million. Given that <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-pc-sued-price-fixing-1851537419">when we first covered this story in 2024</a> that figure converted to $838 million, Valve will likely hope for a quick resolution before Trump manages to tank the dollar even further.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-26250mah-power-bank-hits-its-first-low-of-the-year-as-this-300w-max-3-port-charger-starts-selling-out-fast-2000663253</link>
            <guid>1417537</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Anker Prime Power Bank is a 26,250 mAh portable power bank with three ports, a compact Phantom Gray housing, and compatibility with laptops, tablets, and phones. The Anker Prime Power Bank allows you to charge up to 300W through two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so a notebook, phone, and additional items, such as headphones or earbuds, can charge at the same time without taking turns. It’s small enough to fit into backpacks and carry-on luggage and has a TSA-approved battery size, so you can generally fly with it. There is also a smart display screen on the front of the unit that shows charging information.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/">You can find the Anker Prime Power Bank on Amazon today for $171, down from its original $230, which represents a savings of $59 and 26% off the original retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hefty power bank with plenty of charging power</h2>
<p><span>The charging configuration on the Anker Prime Power Bank is optimized for rapid charging of larger items while supporting smaller items. One USB-C port delivers up to 140W with a compatible 5A cable for rapid laptop recharging, and the other two USB-C and USB-A ports recharge your phone, earbuds, or other accessories simultaneously. With a maximum of 300W, you can use the bank as a central charging station rather than just to recharge your phone.</span></p>
<p>The Anker Prime Power Bank was also optimized to charge quickly, allowing the unit to spend more time available for use rather than idling due to discharge. The dual USB-C ports will accept up to 250W of combined input and allow the bank to recharge to approximately 50% in around 13 minutes and fully recharge in approximately 1 hour if you have the correct chargers.</p>



<p>In addition to displaying how much capacity remains in the bank and the current amount of power it is supplying, a smart display will show the status of each device currently charging via a simple visual display, eliminating the need to guess whether a device is charging. When paired with Anker’s app, you can view charging activity in even greater detail and adjust your usage preferences for how you want power used.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the overall design allows users to place the Anker Prime Power Bank wherever they want to recharge their devices, including desks, bags, hotel nightstands, and many other locations. The bank’s compact frame is light enough for daily carrying but feels sturdy and substantial when placed next to a laptop with several cables plugged into it. In the box, you will receive the Anker Prime Power Bank, a 3.3-foot-long 240W USB-C to USB-C cable, a travel pouch, a welcome guide, and a 24-month limited hardware warranty. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/">With the entire package bundled at $171 instead of the usual $230, the Anker Prime Power Bank is an affordable source of portable power in one small unit.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Really Doesn’t Want You To See Its Canceled Prince Of Persia Remake]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-art-leak-canceled-remake-2000663501</link>
            <guid>1417468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been less than a week since Ubisoft announced it was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>cancelling several projects</span></a><span>, including the long-awaited </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake. That project had apparently been struggling since its 2020 announcement, having essentially started over from scratch </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ubisoft-1850470554"><span>back in 2023</span></a><span>. But while the remake itself may never see the light of day, some concept art and screenshots from the game’s 2024 pre-alpha version have started circulating online. Ubisoft, however, is doing its best to get them taken down before anyone can see what might have been.</span></p> <p><span>The art and images are from a 2024 workshop presentation, and though they don’t show the game in motion, there’s enough here to get a sense of what the team at Ubisoft was working toward before the project was canceled. The presentation was posted to YouTube, then subsequently copyright-struck by Ubisoft. Fans still managed to grab the images, though, and have been sharing them across social media.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake – the full workshop presentation 2024 was leaked on YouTube yesterday!</p> <p>I’ve put together some of what was shown during the conference — everything looks absolutely beautiful!😩😍 </p> <p>(Pre-Alpha, Early 2024)<br>Soundtrack is from the remake! <a href="https://t.co/3BDRlFlgHJ">pic.twitter.com/3BDRlFlgHJ</a></p> <p>— Prince of Persia Universe (@princeozzyX) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>From the sound of it, the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake was even further along by the time it was canceled earlier this month, as Eman Ayaz, an actor who has hinted she was playing a role in the game, had shot a marketing promo for the game just two months prior.</span></p> <p><span>“I pushed myself past old limits and discovered things I didn’t even know existed inside of me through the lives that I lived in this character,” Ayaz </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0hv4QFIak"><span>says in a YouTube video</span></a><span>. “It was something that’s completely out of the range of any character that I’ve been cast in in the past. And I got to do things I’ve never gotten to do before. And it brought out what I honestly believe is the best performance of my career. And now nobody is ever going to see that. I can’t stress enough how much I had kind of planned my life around the release of this project.”</span></p>

  <p><span>While the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake is probably the most high-profile cancellation at Ubisoft this month, the company shelved five other games and delayed seven more as part of a larger restructuring. Don’t worry though,</span><i><span> Beyond Good and Evil 2 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><span>is still coming</span></a><span>. </span></p>
