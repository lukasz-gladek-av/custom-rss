Funny thing, though: Atlus and Sega haven’t <em>actually </em>announced a remake of <em>Persona 4</em> yet. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196646" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>OK, so while a remake of the 2008 PS2 RPG<em> Persona 4</em> has yet to be officially confirmed, there have been a lot of rumors and speculation floating around the web about such a project. But it’s all been leakers and insiders sharing tidbits and possible information, nothing concrete. However, with a famous voice actor from the original game talking openly about the project and implying that it might have recast some characters, it seems the cat is out of the bag, even if Sega and Atlus didn’t plan on that happening. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 28, Lowenthal posted on BlueSky</a></span>—in response to fans asking him about the remake and his return—saying that he wasn’t coming back despite possibly begging Atlus to return. </p><p>“And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the <em>Persona 4 </em>remake,” posted Lowenthal, who also voices Spider-Man in the Insomniac games on PS4/PS5. “I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back.”</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Sega and Atlus for more information about the remake and the recasting.</p><p>The last big <em>Persona </em>remake, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1bfec2j/what_do_you_think_about_the_new_voice_cast_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1bfec2j/what_do_you_think_about_the_new_voice_cast_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, did recast the main group</a></span> of characters. While the decision was controversial at the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927">many praised the new voice acting in the RPG</a></span>. So it seems that Atlus might be doing the same thing again, assuming <em>Persona 4</em> remake is real and happening. And it wouldn’t be the first time:&nbsp;<em>Persona 4</em> was previously partially remastered and improved. That version of the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/persona-4-golden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/persona-4-golden"><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></a></span>, was then ported to Vita in 2012 and consoles and PC in 2020. </p><p>As for why Lowenthal, a famous voice actor with a long career in the industry, would seemingly leak a project ahead of an official announcemen? Well, perhaps the rumors have been swirling for so long that he forgot it wasn’t actually official yet. Or maybe he was grumpy about not being cast.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
