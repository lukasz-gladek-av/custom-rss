              <p>It’s almost as if Amazon knows you’re thinking about upgrading your older laptop for something newer, faster, and packed with more features than you thought possible. Why else would they offer this deal on the Dell 15 Inspiron touchscreen laptop in its most souped-up state — <strong>the max 64GB of RAM and 2 TB SSD, preloaded Windows 11 Pro, and a free accessory bundle worth $199?</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/">It lists for $2,400, but right now it’s just $900 dyring this killer 63% off limited-time deal.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Credit where credit is due, Amazon has been hard-selling this high-end Dell model lately, maybe because they know that a touchscreen laptop packed with as much RAM and SSD space as possible and driven by an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor (speeds up to 4.5GHz) and AMD Radeon graphics chip is a literal game-changer to anyone who’s been slogging through their work and play with an older, slower machine. Why else would they take a do-it-all machine like this and slash $1,500 from the price?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Machine, Premium Deal</h2>
<p>The top-of-the-line specs, preloaded Windows 11 Pro — including the AI wizardry of Microsoft Copilot — and compact profile and light weight of this Dell laptop virtually guarantees it would be a significant upgrade for pretty much anyone. (Other than the happy shoppers who have already cashed in on this deal.) It’s slim and lightweight enough to pop into a backpack or briefcase to take anywhere, and built sturdily so it won’t break down or fall apart during your road trips.</p>
<p>The touchscreen has all the responsiveness of a high-end tablet, but it’s also a full-HD screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and IPS technology for wide viewing angles. The energy efficient LED-backlit screen helps keep your power bills manageable, and the entire screen plus processor plus graphics card is the equation for awesome streaming on the Dell Inspiron 15. But if you insist on using the high-end visuals for work, there’s also an HD webcam and MaxxAudio Pro speaker for those unavoidable Zoom calls.</p>



<h2>No Upgrades Needed</h2>
<p>You won’t need to immediately drop more money on upgrading the OS of this Dell Inspiron 15, because Windows 11 Pro is already loaded and ready to go. Which also means Copilot AI is at your service. This AI assistant has gotten rave reviews for power, speed, and intuitiveness, and the Dell Inspiron 15 gives it more than enough processing power to do that research or write that email for you almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>We’ve been playing Whak-a-Mole with these massive PC laptop deals at Amazon — every time we think we’ve covered the last of them, two more pop up. But there’s on guarantee these will continue to drop like this, and this one that saves you $1,500 off the price of a brand-new Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop and free accessories bundle valued at $200 isn’t going to get beat anytime soon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/">Head to Amazon now and make the upgrade that puts a powerful touchscreen PC laptop in your hands and a pile of money back in your pocket.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I don’t envy any designer tasked with expanding upon </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>, a game so airtight that it could only have crystallized through a process of rigorous elimination. Whenever I go back for another run–which isn’t too often these days, though I did spend at least three solid months of my 2020 malaise deep in a </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> foxhole–I’m always impressed by the game’s ability to wring near-infinite permutations of itself out of a relatively restrained framework.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I say “restrained” with an asterisk here because, as any </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> vets well know, the game is packed full with enough ideas to keep things surprising and challenging for many tens of hours. But key to its replayability is its immediately graspable possibility space: there are six weapons, four zones with (basically) one boss each, and a grab bag of themed powerups that all offer unique variations on playstyle. One successful run usually clocks in at around 30 minutes.</span><i><span> Hades</span></i><span> onboards you painlessly, and it’s not long before you’ve internalized the game’s core mechanics and progression systems, free thereafter to relinquish yourself to their combinations. (Contrast with a roguelike like </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></i><span>, which uses the genre’s randomized, cyclical structure as a vector for dizzying mechanical maximalism, tipping the scale more toward chaos and unpredictability (to great effect) than careful strategizing.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628069"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628069">©Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Developer Supergiant Games could have made </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> bigger, surely, but they didn’t. Bigger would have been unnecessary, and </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> wasn’t built to sustain the unnecessary. It was built to be </span><i><span>played</span></i><span>, quickly and repeatedly. It cut right to the bone. Why add more?</span></p>

 <p><span>After about 30 hours with </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>, I’m still not quite sure.</span></p> <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> is Supergiant’s first sequel. This tracks for a couple reasons: one, </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> sold a gazillion copies, and two, it was the studio’s first genuinely excellent video game. I’m warm on </span><i><span>Transistor</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pyre</span></i><span>, but </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> felt like a blistering synthesis of all the action game chops they’d been honing for nearly a decade, and it made a deservedly enormous splash. It’s only natural that they’d return to this well, having hit upon a template that represents a perfect alignment of all their skills.</span></p>

 <p><span>If we coldly define “well designed” as “the numbers in this game make sense,” </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> is very, very well designed. All of its weapons are sensibly balanced, all of its progression systems are finely tuned, and it doles out new mechanics and information at just the right pace to keep you grinding out fresh runs. It’s a game made by smart, talented people who know exactly what they’re doing.</span></p>

 <p><span>And if we coldly define a “video game review” as “I tell you whether or not a game is fun,” then yes, </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> is fun. In some ways it’s more fun than the first. Their structures are nearly identical: you control a figure from the Greek pantheon, fighting your way through the underworld in an attempt to reach and eliminate a boss at the end. Here, your player character is chthonic goddess Melinoë, tasked with defeating the titan Chronos. You’re aided remotely by other members of the pantheon via upgrades to your moveset, and the game’s story unfolds gradually across dozens of runs.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628073" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628073"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628073">©Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>’s greatest feat of narrative design, shared with its predecessor, is its reactivity. It responds to your decisions (and mistakes) in granular, entertaining ways: Melinoë may express frustration that she (you) didn’t get as far in a run as she’s used to, or gods may remark upon the fact that you’ve already received boons from other gods, offering complementary boons in turn. Certain characters become more directly involved with your journey as you progress–a standout here is the goddess Nemesis, who, after a certain point, begins making clandestine runs of her own, and will challenge you to petty contests or snipe items from shops should you cross her path. The game successfully sells the illusion that you’re not just going through the same motions ad nauseum; every run, regardless of outcome, is a narrative or numerical step forward.</span></p>

 <p><span>Complicating this reactivity considerably is another, entirely separate route through the surface, beginning in the mythic city of Ephyra and culminating in a battle atop Mount Olympus. The surface route is, effectively, an entire </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> game unto itself, with its own bespoke zones, enemies, items, characters, and encounter design. There’s an astonishing amount of detail and mechanical inventiveness on display here, though just as impressive is the interplay between the two routes. Surface runs will periodically change or realign certain aspects of underworld runs and vice-versa, gradually engendering a natural inclination to alternate between both without pushing players too forcefully toward either. This is, by a wide margin, the most robust addition <em>Hades 2 </em>makes to the </span><span>formula, a confident and meaningful doubling down on the first game’s most distinctive virtues. On its own, it’s nearly enough to convince me that the existence of a</span> <span>sequel was not only desirable, but necessary. Then they added a bunch of other stuff.</span></p> <p><span>“Stuff” is an ever-shifting variable in game design. One game’s stuff is another game’s foundation. I wouldn’t dream of complaining about weird, fiddly currencies in a game like </span><i><span>Crusader Kings III</span></i><span>, because </span><i><span>Crusader Kings III</span></i><span> is, I say affectionately, designed for people who derive genuine pleasure from poring over minute differences between health insurance plans. I </span><i><span>would</span></i><span>, however,</span><span> complain about weird, fiddly currencies in a game like </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>, which is about pressing a shitload of buttons as fast as you can until an evil skeleton dies.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628070">©Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> has a lot of weird, fiddly currencies. Fundamentally, I get why they’re there: the game is exponentially larger than </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>, and Supergiant is trying to fill in the margins to avoid any potential long-term redundancy. </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>’ primary currencies were “darkness,” used mostly for unlocking permanent perks and stat upgrades, and “gemstones,” which unlocked helpful modifications to routes. The game was concise enough to coast by with little else. </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>’s darkness equivalent is “ashes,” but there’s also “psyche,” which can expand Melinoë’s available attunement slots; “moon dust,” which improves Melinoë’s abilities (represented here by an “arcana card” system); “bones,” which are a sort of catch-all currency with which all aforementioned currencies can be bought; and a slew of collectible resources, including various types of ore and flora, which, when combined, modify routes in much the same way gemstones did.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In theory, all of these interlocking systems should seamlessly coalesce into something that feels holistic and self-sustaining. In practice, they place more obstacles between you and having fun. Just cleared a room? Time to run around hitting rocks with your pickaxe and digging up flowers with your shovel (assuming you crafted the pickaxe and shovel to begin with). Want to harvest psyche from a wandering spirit? Grind your momentum to a halt to play the most braindead take on Simon Says in gaming history. Want to add something to a route that the first game was way less stingy about? Plant a seed in your garden, wait a couple runs for it to grow, pick it, realize you don’t have the other required resources yet and have no clue where to get them, give up and just start another run so you can play a video game again.</span></p> <p><span>I spent the first few hours of </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> being genuinely curious about these systems, the following few hours trying to tune them out, and the remainder of my time actively wishing they would go away. They never impeded my progress to the point that I was compelled to drop the game entirely, though runs eventually began feeling more like obligatory farming missions than intrinsically satisfying arcade action gauntlets. That action is there, but it’s obfuscated by a veil of fussy numbers and half-baked cozy sim mechanics, just intrusive enough that they’re impossible to ignore. The math checks out; the experience doesn’t.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Less is Moros."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Supergiant Games</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Top-down roguelike action RPG.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Constantly evolving and reactive design, creative progression, infinitely pliable combat system.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked: </p>                 <p>Overemphasis on fussy resources, uneven weapon movesets, tedious writing.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms: </p>                 <p>PC (played), Switch, Switch 2. </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 25, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played: </p>                 <p>30 hours.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>It’s especially disappointing, then, that the core gameplay can’t quite compensate. Certainly not for lack of trying–</span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>’s weapons are all admirably cerebral, placing a greater emphasis on positioning and multitasking than anything in the original (with the possible exception of the railgun Exagryph, which also happens to be the only one I hardly ever touched). The dual wands, for instance, are designed around constant, careful projectile management, while the axe hits slowly enough that a single improperly-spaced attack, especially in the more unforgiving later zones, can put you at an enormous disadvantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I understand and appreciate the effort to mechanically differentiate Melinoë from </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> protagonist Zagreus, to make her feel less like an in-your-face rushdown beast and more like a prudent tactician. But–and I know how vague and unquantifiable this sounds–the game isn’t as satisfying to play. Supergiant’s combat design has always been fairly straightforward, and that’s fine, because whatever it lacks in raw complexity it more than makes up for with intuitive, thrilling buttons; those buttons are just a bit more limp here, the game’s ambition again chafing against its uncertainty over what to do with it.</span></p> <p><span>Carried over more directly from the first game is an emphasis–even greater, this time around–on character dynamics and interactions. Melinoë, like Zagreus, is booted back to a central hub after failing a run, wherein she can chat up a number of friends, family members, and frenemies before making her next move. Relationships with these characters, and with the Olympians, deepen naturally over time, and can be deepened further by offering them “nectar,” a resource available in either route. Give someone one nectar and they’ll hand you a personalized, equippable item with unique attributes; give them more, and you’ll begin growing closer with them. Very occasionally, that closeness may blossom into intimacy.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628066" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628066"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628066">©Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The stories and characters in these games do basically nothing for me. I was probably willing to be a bit kinder toward </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> because it was a new, shiny thing with novel ideas about how to structure a video game narrative, but outside of some exciting beats and the occasional funny joke, </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> had my eyes glazing over. This is uninspired fanfiction by nature and in execution, a sanded-down and self-serious reinterpretation of Greek mythology that warps its figures into cuddly, quippy dating sim archetypes. I’m by no means fundamentally opposed to any work of fiction that wants to riff on those myths (though I’m getting a kick out of imagining how much the </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> games would piss off my high school Latin teacher). I only take issue with </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>’s irritatingly focus-tested writing, which comes off as little more than red meat for fan engagement; directly downstream from this is the game’s dorky faux-eroticism, presupposing the sexual appeal of its characters and then refusing to actually let them do anything sexy. It’s hard to care about cleavage when everyone talks like a gifset.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s all be adults about this: I have not “finished” </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>. I’ve completed a few runs and played several dozens more, though one of the game’s biggest draws is that a successful run is merely another plot point; the story and gameplay both continue evolving long after. I’m willing to accept that there could be an eventual moment, which I have yet to reach, where a new upgrade makes the weapons as engaging as those in the original’s arsenal, or where the writing takes an unexpected turn for the better, or where the resource management evens out into something more relaxed and coherent. I’m also willing to accept the game’s foibles even if they remain uncorrected, because I’ve had, more or less, a great time with it. Supergiant’s core design philosophy is still kinetic enough to cut through the noise, and unpredictable enough that I want to see where it goes. This is still </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> we’re talking about, </span><i><span>II</span></i><span> or otherwise.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After a week of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-mark-hamill-pedro-pascal-marvel-star-wars-2000627564"><span>controversy</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135"><span>boycotts</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </span></i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1tjh_ZO_tY"><span>returned to late-night television last night</span></a><span>. The Disney-owned ABC talk show was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>yanked off the air</span></a><span> following a monologue in which Kimmel claimed the Republican party was using the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk for “political points.” The entire fiasco has been seen by many as a high-profile example of the Trump administration making a calculated strike against free speech in an effort to silence the president’s critics, but on Tuesday, September 23, Kimmel retook the stage to deliver a nearly 28-minute monologue about the situation, Trump’s colossal tantrum, and the fact that he </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>tried to link autism to Tylenol</span></a><span> with zero scientific backing.</span></p> <p><span>You can watch the full monologue here, in which a teary-eyed Kimmel greets a chanting audience, thanking people for their support over the past week, including the right-wing figures who spoke about how dangerous it was for the president to try to silence his critics. He also gets choked up while saying it was “never [his] intention to make light of the murder of a young man.”&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Kimmel continued,</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I don’t think there’s anything funny about it. I posted a message on Instagram on the day he was killed, sending love to his family and asking for compassion. I meant it, and I still do. Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I undestand that, to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. For those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I’d have felt the same way. I have many friends and family members on the “other side” who I love and remain close to even though we don’t agree on politics at all. I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn’t, ever.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>After clarifying his stance on Kirk’s death, Kimmel’s monologue shifts its focus to the importance of free speech in America, pointing out the hypocrisy of both the FCC and Trump on the subject. He condemns Trump’s continued attempts to undermine the press, and to his credit, he doesn’t take his foot off the gas when talking about Trump. Other public figures with a lot to lose might have pulled their punches against the administration after being taken off the air, but there’s none of that here. He also likens the FCC’s use of threats and intimidation to mafia behavior, going so far as to tag in Robert De Niro for a skit in which the actor puts on his best mob boss persona to play a new FCC chairman. The whole thing’s worth a watch.</span></p>

 <p><span>So how did Trump respond to this? Exactly how you’d expect. The president posted an unhinged rant on his </span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115256938634035559"><span>Truth social account</span></a><span> claiming that “ABC Fake News” told the White House that </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</span></i><span> Had been “cancelled.” He also says the late-night show was “another arm of the DNC” and that would be a “major illegal Campaign Contribution” to…well, he doesn’t specify. But what he does do is gesture at suing ABC for…something? He references the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/abc-trump-lawsuit-defamation-stephanopoulos-04aea8663310af39ae2a85f4c1a56d68"><span>2024 defamation lawsuit</span></a><span> in which ABC paid $15 million to Trump’s presidential library fund, so he seems to think he can get more money from the company for…putting Kimmel back on the air?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Kimmel is back on the air in most of the country, several cities were </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/09/23/sinclair-nexstar-not-airing-jimmy-kimmel-list/86307443007/"><span>unable to watch the show live</span></a><span> due to some affiliate stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar Media Group preempting the show and replacing it with news. Some affected cities included Washington D.C., Nashville, New Orleans, Portland, and Salt Lake City. Those groups can’t stop people from going to YouTube, however, where the monologue has already racked up 9.1 million views since being posted last night.</span></p>
