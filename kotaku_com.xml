              <p>Electronic Arts revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339">it‚Äôs planning to add a college basketball game</a> to its ever-expanding roster of sports franchises. Then 2K Games came out hours later and indicated <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-college-hoops-ea-college-football-26-1851784967">it was doing the same</a>. Now new reporting suggests both publishers have been at war behind the scenes trying to lock up the deals needed to make an NCAA basketball game a reality.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/08/28/sources-ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-talks-hit-snag/"><em>Sports Business Journal </em>reports</a> that while EA won a bidding round earlier this year with the Collegiate Licensing Company for the rights to the NCAA brand, 2K Games has moved forward with its own college basketball game by trying to negotiate brand partnerships with individual colleges like UCLA.</p> <p><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúUCLA Athletics and UCLA Trademarks &amp; Licensing, an enterprise of the </span><span data-testid="content-text">Associated Students UCLA</span><span data-testid="content-text">, have announced a long-term collaboration with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text">2K</span><span data-testid="content-text"> which will see the UCLA Men‚Äôs and Women‚Äôs Basketball programs bring the rich legacy of Bruins basketball to a future project,‚Äù the school <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/basketball/ucla-men-s-and-women-s-basketball-confirmed-for-2k-college-basketball-project">announced on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bring the Madness. Let‚Äôs run it back. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CBB</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItsInTheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ItsInTheGame</a> <a href="https://t.co/iBNhGxn2yj">pic.twitter.com/iBNhGxn2yj</a></p> <p>‚Äî EA SPORTS (@EASPORTS) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1939703160479637660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The campus has been quiet for too long üòè <a href="https://t.co/AuqoX5u5Qr">https://t.co/AuqoX5u5Qr</a></p> <p>‚Äî NBA 2K (@NBA2K) <a href="https://twitter.com/NBA2K/status/1939805441468342727?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>EA is apparently very unhappy about this. According to <em>Sports Business Journal</em>, it wanted the rights to everything in NCAA divisional basketball on both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs leagues, which would give it the sort of exclusivity stranglehold it long had with the NFL in its <em>Madden</em> series. And if EA doesn‚Äôt get its way, sources told <em>Sports Business Journal</em> the publisher might abandon the upcoming game altogether.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe opportunity that‚Äôs excited us in college basketball is to deliver a full, standalone experience that captures everything that makes the sport so special,‚Äù EA Sports VP Sean O‚ÄôBrien told <em>SBJ</em> in a statement. ‚ÄúThe approach we‚Äôve proposed is to create a game that includes all 350-plus NCAA Division I schools‚Äîboth men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams included‚Äîwith name, image and likeness compensation for all athletes, 32 conferences, the NCAA and all things that make ‚ÄòMarch Madness‚Äô the most exciting month of sports and all the traditions and pageantry fans love.‚Äù</p>

 <p>Basically, 2K Games, which was reportedly part of the NCAA bidding war but lost to EA, has decided to move ahead with a college basketball game regardless. While it abandoned its<em> Hoops</em> franchise over a decade ago, it‚Äôs been releasing<em> NBA2K</em> every year and could quickly spin off a new version of it for college teams or, as <em>SBJ</em> reports, possibly position it as an add-on or expansion for the existing franchise.</p> <p>EA, which also abandoned its basketball franchise over a decade ago, will have to start from scratch. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2025/08/26/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game/85645694007/">Recent reporting</a> suggests a new game would be years away at best and possibly <a href="https://x.com/ChrisVannini/status/1939704916269818312">not arrive until 2028 or later</a>. Unless it can get the NCAA and its member schools to pull the plug on 2K‚Äôs game, it‚Äôll be coming in late. A big part of what helped <em>EA Sports College Football</em> explode in popularity last year was years of pent-up demand. Now both publishers are in a race to see who can cash in on the latest untapped market for annual sports games.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/voidbreaker-fps-review-steam-pc-gamepass-titanfall-roguelike-roguelite-2000621067</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/voidbreaker-was-made-by-one-person-and-might-be-2025%E2%80%99s-best-fps.1283550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love it when a game comes out of nowhere and surprises me. Earlier this month, that is exactly what happened when I saw the trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460"><em>VoidBreaker</em> during Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. I downloaded the fast-paced sci-fi roguelike FPS shortly after seeing it, and not only is it good, but it might be one of the best shooters I‚Äôve played all year. And it was made almost entirely by one guy, Daniel Stubbington.</p> <p><em>VoidBreaker</em> is an incredibly fast and sleek first-person shooter available now in early access on Steam and Game Pass PC. The game is set inside a large, highly advanced AI program that is using human test subjects to gather data on combat and warfare. This involves you endlessly fighting and dying over and over again through ‚Äúruns‚Äù of the program‚Äôs randomly generated gauntlets filled with various robotic enemies and other odd cyber-opponents. Luckily, very early on, a previous human who was trying to escape the program contacts you to help take the AI down and get out alive. Sadly, your ally is just the digital remains of a very dead person who has a skeleton hiding in your cyberjail‚Äôs basement. But while he‚Äôs dead, his mind is still in the program and helps you hack the system, slowly unlocking permanent bonuses and new weapons to help you get further during each action-filled run.</p> <p>If some of that sounds silly, it is! And that‚Äôs the point. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-pacman-silent-hill-hollow-void-2000619570"><em>VoidBreaker</em></a> leans into the absurd and strange situation you find yourself in, with plentiful jokes delivered by a dry robot announcer during runs. Messages include the program explaining how living forever in pain is better than dying, and how you aren‚Äôt alone because the AI is always watching you. It strikes that perfect balance between silly and dark that <em>Portal</em> nailed so many years ago.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="VOID/BREAKER | Launch Trailer | PC Game Pass" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44fxNXBOvIQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>Another run, another run, another run‚Ä¶.</h2> <p>The gameplay loop of <em>VoidBreaker</em> will feel pretty familiar if you‚Äôve played <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadzone-rogue-roguelike-steam-pc-shooter-destiny-2000617173">any roguelike game</a> in the last few years. Each run feels different, as enemy encounters and other sections of the digital gauntlets are randomly generated. As you progress through these runs, you find mods of various rarity levels that give you new abilities, make you stronger or faster, or even change how your gun works. And of course, as in most roguelikes, there‚Äôs a currency you earn that can only be used at shops that randomly appear on your path during that run. There‚Äôs also a currency that lets you unlock permanent upgrades in the aforementioned secret dead guy basement.</p> <p>So yeah, nothing groundbreaking in <em>Voidbreaker</em>. Instead, the reason to play this new FPS is for the gameplay and combat. Movement in <em>VoidBreaker</em> is incredibly smooth, snappy, and satisfying. This is the kind of game where it‚Äôs just fun to run around and jump, even outside of a fight. And gunplay is equally fantastic, with the assault rifle you unlock fairly early into the game being a loud and hectic death machine that sprays enemies with bullets in a way that always makes me happy. Buildings and other structures you spot in the levels can also be <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">destroyed √† la <em>Battlefield</em> and crumble upon enemies</a>, stunning or even killing them. Oh, and you can pick up most items using a <em>Half-Life</em>-like Gravity Gun mechanic and fling them back at baddies, too.</p>

 <p>As you upgrade your character during runs, adding ice bullets, improving your Gravity-Gun-thingy, unlocking fire attacks, and collecting super-powerful grenade mods, the action in <em>VoidBreaker</em> can become extremely chaotic. At times, it became nearly too much for my eyes to keep track of as my rifle spat out electrically charged bullets covered in energy fields, buildings collapsed around me, and enemies filled the arena with various red projectiles that can do a lot of damage if you aren‚Äôt careful. It can be a lot, and I think for some it might be too much. But I enjoyed every moment of it, even if there were definitely times when I was just spamming my abilities and grenades toward a massive cloud of destruction and death and hoping for the best.</p> <p>But the chaos is part of the fun, and death isn‚Äôt that big of a deal in <em>VoidBreaker</em>. After all, it just gave me another excuse to load back up in my weird, sparse cyber apartment/prison and quickly say hi to the skeleton in the basement before hopping back out for one more run. I‚Äôm excited to see how the game expands in early access. Now, I need to go and play more <em>VoidBreaker</em>. Just one more run. I‚Äôll go to bed eventually. It‚Äôs only 2 a.m‚Ä¶.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In 2014, before allegations of sexual misconduct against him became public, actor Kevin Spacey was one of the biggest names out there thanks to Netflix‚Äôs <em>House of Cards</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kevin-spacey-the-kotaku-review-1654032299">And his role in that year‚Äôs<em> Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em></a> was a highlight. But now, it feels like a problematic relic. However, the game‚Äôs director, Glen Schofield, doesn‚Äôt think the shooter is ‚Äútainted,‚Äù even if Spacey was ‚Äúweird‚Äù to work with.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/kevin-spacey-got-a-little-weird-on-the-set-of-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-we-all-had-to-fake-laugh/">In an interview with<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> Glen Schofield was asked about Spacey‚Äôs involvement in<a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-call-of-duty-games-from-worst-to-best-1844765026/20"><em> Advanced Warfare</em> as the shooter‚Äôs main villain</a>. In 2014, Spacey delivered a fantastic performance that was praised by many critics and fans. In 2017, his role in the game became less celebrated after accusations of sexual harassment and assault were levied against the actor. While years later, he was ultimately not found liable for harassment and was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/uk/kevin-spacey-trial-jury-verdict-intl/index.html">acquitted of assault</a>, Spacey‚Äôs reputation was still heavily damaged, and he appeared in fewer film and TV roles. Despite that, Schofield told the outlet that Spacey‚Äôs inclusion ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt taint the game.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAt the time, that‚Äôs the actor I wanted,‚Äù said Schofield.&nbsp;‚ÄúWhen he was on set, and we said action, he was unbelievable. He just is a great actor, right? Then when we said cut, you could tell the video games weren‚Äôt his thing. We had to get him a trailer. So he had a trailer outside that he would go in and he was a little bit more difficult, I would say.‚Äù</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="et" dir="ltr">On set filming <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdvancedWarfare?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AdvancedWarfare</a>! <a href="http://t.co/2Q0jZPkiwT">pic.twitter.com/2Q0jZPkiwT</a></p> <p>‚Äî Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/464570512510042112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Advanced Warfare‚Äô</em>s director did claim that Spacey ‚Äúgot a little weird once in a while on the set.‚Äù Schofield added, ‚ÄúHe would say things that just weren‚Äôt proper. We all had to fake laugh. There was some stuff.‚Äù</p> <p>Schofield explained that the initial pitch for <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare 2</em> involved Spacey‚Äôs character returning in some form despite dying in the previous game. However, Activision passed on that pitch, which he‚Äôs grateful for now.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe were going to go there,‚Äù Schofield admitted, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt, because it was like two months before we would have shipped when the scandal broke.‚Äù</p>

              <p>The undead hordes are back in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>,&nbsp;</em>but they aren‚Äôt hanging out in a snowy cemetery like in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-zombies-north-yankton-halloween-survival-1851664429">last year‚Äôs Halloween event</a>. Instead, zombies have infested the tropical island of Cayo Perico in a new mode that‚Äôs bigger and trippier than the last zombie survival mode.</p> <p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3k38k52o5383/battle-hordes-of-undead-in-the-new-cayo-perico-survival?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=465:cayo-perico-zombie-survival-20250828">On August 28, Rockstar Games officially announced</a> (and then promptly added) a new zombie survival mode to <em>GTA Online.&nbsp;</em>Titled ‚ÄúCayo Perico Zombie Survival,‚Äù this new mode transports players to the already existing tropical island of Cayo Perico to fight off waves of zombies. During the mode, which can be played solo or with three of your friends, players will encounter a wide array of undead foes, including DJ zombies and undead conquistadors. Remember when this was a gritty online crime simulator set in the same universe as <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>? Anyway, here‚Äôs the trailer for the new mode:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battle Undead in the New GTA Online Cayo Perico Survival" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GbuCIrZSPDk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Compared to last year‚Äôs Halloween zombies mode, this new Cayo Perico Zombie Survival is much bigger and wilder. Last year‚Äôs mode was set in one small snowy cemetery, featured a handful of zombie types, and that was it. This new mode features more enemy variety, moves players around the island to fight the undead in different spots, and just seems like a weirder and bigger thing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-zombies-mode-ludendorff-cemetery-survival-1851672030">I guess last year‚Äôs zombie event being a massive success</a> convinced Rockstar Games to invest more money and resources into this new undead survival mode. It sounds like this mode will be leaving on September 10, so don‚Äôt wait too long to hop back into <em>GTA Online,</em> earn some new exclusive rewards, and kill a bunch of zombies.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs Rockstar‚Äôs official description of the mode:</p> <blockquote><p>Your favorite island paradise just came down with a deadly case of party fever. As if a major narcotrafficking island wasn‚Äôt dangerous enough, it‚Äôs now been overrun by the undead ‚Äî and maybe it‚Äôs the drugs or the tropical climate, but this time they‚Äôve got a whole lot weirder. Cut your way through waves of undead, including conquistadors armed with muskets, Panther Trainers and their feral pets, swarms of Splitters, and more in the new Cayo Perico Survival. Fight through these hordes and make your way to the airstrip ‚Äî then pray your evacuation plane doesn‚Äôt take too long.</p></blockquote>
