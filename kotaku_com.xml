But when the <em>THPS 3+4</em> were announced, Margera was missing from the remake’s roster of new and old skaters. Many attributed this to Margera’s many legal problems and widely reported substance abuse issues, which allegedly led to his firing from the production of the film <em>Jackass Forever</em> in 2020. But apparently, Margera is doing better and his friend Tony Hawk fought to make sure he was a part of the upcoming remake. </p><p>During a March 23 livestream of the skating podcast <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/thenineclub&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/thenineclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Nine Club</em></a></span><em>,</em> co-host Roger Bagley claimed that Margera was added to <em>THPS 3+4 </em>at the last minute after Tony Hawk skated with the troubled former <em>Jackass </em>star earlier this month. <br></p><p>“Well, here’s what happened,” explained Bagley during the stream. “The game was already done. Tony called up Activision or whatever and was like ‘Hey, we’re putting Bam in the thing,’ and they’re like ‘We can’t.’ And he goes ‘No, you’re gonna do it,’ and basically made them fly Bam back out here to get body-scanned and everything else, and put him in [<em>THPS 3+4</em>].”</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Activision about the reported return of Margera. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>O</em>n March 24, <em>TMZ</em> corrobated the claims made in the podcast</a></span> and reported that it had heard from sources that Hawk was impressed by how well Margera had cleaned himself up and how he’s trying to stay sober.

It was a free peer-to-peer file sharing service that launched in 1999 and let people share music with others without paying for it. Record companies got mad and sued it into oblivion and it shut down in 2001. But the brand name didn’t die, and has lingered around for the last 20 years connected to various companies and legal digital music products.

According to the CEO of Infinite Reality, there is “no better name than Napster to disrupt.” “Disrupt what?” you might ask. Well, how about how people consume music in the metaverse?</p><p> “When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it’s very important that they have a connected space that’s around music and musical communities,” said CEO  John Acunto. “We just don’t see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.”</p><p>The plan is to let musicians and fans create and explore 3D spaces in Napster, which in theory will be a metaverse-like game or program. According to Acunto these spaces will be “crazy environments” that are really “only limited by their imaginations.” The CEO gave the example of a reggae artist creating a beach hangout to listen to his music. Wild. Crazy! How did he come up with such an amazing and innovative idea?!?  </p><p>Before Infinite Reality stepped in and bought Napster, the brand had been owned by many different companies, including Rhapsody and Best Buy. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23122179/napster-web3-bought-hivemind-algorand&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23122179/napster-web3-bought-hivemind-algorand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Napster’s last owner was an NFT company</a></span> that wanted to do something with music on the blockchain, but that plan fizzled out.
