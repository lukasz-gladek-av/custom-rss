              <p>Nintendo, apparently dissatisfied with being a stalwart of nearly every school child‚Äôs life, is aiming even younger. A new range of products under the banner of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/index.html"><em>My Mario</em></a> has been announced, including wooden block toys, board books, and a Switch and mobile app that‚Äôll let kids mess with Mario‚Äôs face, all focused on a preschool market. Gotta get ‚Äôem young and impressionable.</p> <p>Initially launching in Japan, the physical toys will be available in select Nintendo stores, but will almost inevitably find their way to international markets soon enough. The range includes plastic crockery, a mini-backpack, rattle plushies, and super-adorable teeny clothing, so you can deck your toddler out as a nearly-walking Nintendo billboard.</p> <p>The app, which is confirmed as coming to Switch and iOS, lets little kiddos goof around with Mario‚Äôs face, pulling and stretching the poor plumbers various features, causing him to react in different ways. It sounds super-basic, which is precisely what kids that age will want, reacting to their experimental input. Also, it‚Äôll be free, so they can keep their complaints to themselves.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616597" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616597"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616597">¬© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This new range launches in Japan on August 26, and will include the most beautiful-looking building block sets, but each block is also an amiibo! There‚Äôs a Mario, Toad, Yoshi, Luigi and Peach, along with items like&nbsp;? blocks and green pipes, letting your kid build up a gaming scene, or just smash them into each other before chewing on the side of Yoshi‚Äôs face until the paint wears away. A Mario picture book looks equally well made, each board page interactive in some form. And oh my goodness, I want to go back in time and get the Mario romper suit with a hoodie for when my boy would fit in such things.</p> <p>There‚Äôs also a collection of stop-motion animation videos that‚Äôll appear on the My Mario website when it goes live, each about a minute long telling stories about the mustachioed hero, again aimed at the youngest kids.</p> <p>All the physical objects will initially go on sale in Nintendo stores in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, but hopefully Nintendo will see the demand for international customers once everyone realizes those wooden blocks are secret amiibos and adults go insane trying to buy them. It‚Äôs unclear if the app will be available in English, but again, it‚Äôd be pretty daft not to.</p> <p>I shall never stop finding it incredibly weird that an ambiguously aged, mustache-wearing portly Italian plumber is such a staple of everyone‚Äôs lives, and it only gets more strange when aimed at preschoolers. And yet he‚Äôs the best! Nintendo‚Äôs clearly aiming to ensure kids are fully enculturated before they can even say his name.</p>

              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism-1851787197">controversy erupted</a> around the art for an animated card in <em>Pok√©mon TCG Pocket</em>‚Äòs latest set, Wisdom of Sea and Sky, where a drawing of legendary monster Ho-Oh looked almost identical to that of a piece of commissioned art by a Chinese creator. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">The Pok√©mon Company swiftly apologized</a>, and announced the art for both the ‚Äúimmersive‚Äù Ho-Oh and Lugia cards would be temporarily pulled from the new set, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1950406273150693652%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">while making it extremely clear</a> that the fault for the issue did not lie with the artist. Now, both cards have been added to the mobile app, with new art by the same artist.</p> <p>Every set of cards in&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> comes with at least one so-called immersive card: a card that when tapped on comes to life, showing a short but elaborate animation that eventually loops back around to the original image. They‚Äôre absolutely magical, and offer something real-life cards could obviously never do. For Wisdom of Sea, those cards were intended to feature legendary Pok√©mon Ho-oh and Lugia, the two mascot characters from 2000‚Äôs <em>Pok√©mon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>. However, when the artist whose Ho-Oh drawing had been so clearly been copied drew attention to this, both immersive cards were pulled from the set at the eleventh hour‚Äìthe result being both cards featuring nothing but some placeholder text and a black screen instead of an animation. It was clearly embarrassing for the company. TPCi made it clear at the time that the responsibility for the issue lay entirely with themselves, providing dodgy reference materials for the artist to work with.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616592"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616592">¬© The Pok√©mon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It was odd at the time that both cards were pulled, given no accusations had been made about the Lugia art, but today‚Äôs new cards feature a brand new piece of art for that Pok√©mon too, suggesting TPCi noticed something had been amiss there.</p>

 <p>That‚Äôs all been fixed now, with both cards added to the set overnight, featuring a brand new pieces of Ho-Oh and Lugia art from the same artist, the excellent Sie Nanahara. When you launch the app today, a very small patch will be added, and if you already pulled the cards you‚Äôll find the new art and animations will appear.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We'd like to share a new update with you. Please take a look. üôá <a href="https://t.co/Gh6wgL7G3Z">pic.twitter.com/Gh6wgL7G3Z</a></p> <p>‚Äî Pok√©mon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1953683542182924568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>By sheer luck I‚Äôd pulled both immersive cards already, so when I started&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> first thing this morning, as is my routine, I was able to watch both animations, and they‚Äôre both utterly splendid. Each shows the legendary pocket monster either descending from the sky or rising from the sea to meet their counterpart, with all manner of other Pok√©mon appearing along the way. (Including, in the Lugia animation, my beloved Mantine.) Oddly enough, those strange rectangular artifacts on the original Ho-Oh card remain, the elements sliding apart as the animation begins.</p> <p>Sie Nanahara is responsible for all the incredible art in both cards, which is clearly a stunning amount of work, and includes a brand new rendition of Ho-Oh and Lugia. While <em>Pok√©mon</em> card art is usually based on each artist‚Äôs own vision, when it comes to the immersive cards it‚Äôs become clear that far more precise instructions are provided, and this is how things went wrong. It‚Äôs excellent that Nanahara has been able to react so quickly to demonstrate her skill, and hopefully this whole messy incident will result in her receiving far more work.</p>
