              <p>PCs don’t have to be bulky power-hogs that take over your entire workspace or super expensive to be efficient. If you’re after something that saves space while keeping up with your everyday work and play needs, there are quite a few solid mini PCs on the market. And Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5557/">The retailer has dropped the price of the Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny M70q Gen 5 PC to just $800, after a massive 64% discount</a>. Even better, you’re not just getting the PC. This deal also includes a USB Calliope keyboard and mouse, plus Windows 11 pre-installed. That’s a full setup ready to go right out of the box. The deal, however, is selling fast, and there’s no telling how long the offer or the stock will stick around. If you’ve been waiting to upgrade your desktop situation for less, now is the time to act.</p>

<h2>Impressive Performance In a Lightweight Frame</h2>
<p>This is a mini PC, which means you’re getting impressive power packed in a compact, lightweight frame. It measures just about 7 x 7 inches with a slim 1.4-inch depth, so it can fit into any setup without demanding a lot of space. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can simply tuck it behind their monitor or under the table using the VESA mount support, but you will have to purchase the mount separately.</p>
<p>Power-wise, it’s equipped with Intel Core i5-14400T, which is a 14th Gen chip with 10 cores (6 performance, 4 efficiency) and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz when needed. There’s a massive 32GB RAM that keeps everything running smoothly, which can especially be helpful during multitasking. You can perform a bunch of different tasks at once without experiencing frustrating slowdowns that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>Storage is handled by a 1TB PCIe SSD. It offers enough space to store all that you own, from photos to videos, programs, a ton of work documents, backups, and more. You really won’t have to invest in another storage solution anytime soon. And since it’s a solid-state drive, you can also expect much faster load and boot times compared to the traditional options out there. Together, both memory and storage ensure that you’re able to access your system quickly, plus get through busy days with ease.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, and a wide port selection, including USB-C, multiple USB-A ports, Ethernet, and a headphone/mic combo jack. You can enjoy faster wireless connectivity, as well as expand your system by adding an external display or peripherals.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-dumps-the-forerunner-265-now-selling-the-garmin-watch-for-pocket-change-2000643948</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-dumps-the-forerunner-265-now-selling-the-garmin-watch-for-pocket-change.1352767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t need to spend $1,100 on the latest <em>Fenix 8</em> to get a serious running watch that tracks everything you need. The sweet spot in Garmin’s lineup has always been the <em>Forerunner</em> series, and for good reason: these watches outsell everything else in the brand’s catalog. The Forerunner 265 is the most premium and popular model in the range and packs a brilliant AMOLED display and advanced training metrics that rival watches costing twice as much. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/">just quietly marked it down to $299, slashed from its usual $449 price tag</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low</strong> for a watch that delivers fantastic running features without the extreme price of Garmin’s flagship models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Runners Keep Picking This Watch</h2>
<p>The difference is apparent from the very first moments you fire up the Forerunner 265: that <strong>brilliant AMOLED touchscreen pops with color and sharp text</strong>&nbsp;which remains quite readable under direct sunlight, joined by traditional button controls that work beautifully when your hands are sweaty or you’re wearing gloves. The <strong>46mm size</strong> makes the watch feather-light on your wrist so you just about forget it’s there on those ultra-long runs-or really through most of the day. Get <strong>up to 13 days of battery life in smartwatch mode</strong> and up to 20 hours in GPS mode to give you plenty of juice for training weeks.</p>
<p>Your day begins with a personalized report which provides context for how to approach each and every training day. Upon waking, you get an overview of your sleep quality, recovery status, and training outlook alongside HRV status, training readiness, and local weather. This information helps you decide if today is the day to push hard or if your body needs an easier session. The training readiness score brings together <strong>sleep quality, recovery, training load, and HRV status</strong> to tell you if you’re primed to go hard and get the most out of your workout.</p>



<p>Race preparation becomes strategic with <strong>personalized daily suggested workouts</strong>. You input your target race and course details into the Garmin Connect app, and the watch creates training plans that adapt after every run to match your current performance and recovery status. The race widget on your watch keeps your goal front and center while the workouts adapt as your body responds to training.</p>



<p>Multi-band GNSS technology with SatIQ provides accuracy in positioning that more affordable watches simply cannot attain. This matters when you’re running in areas with tall buildings, heavy tree cover, or challenging terrain where the basic GPS signals struggle. Optimizing this accuracy for battery life means you won’t be sacrificing runtime to get accurate distance and pace. You <strong>have more than 30 built-in activity profiles for running, triathlon, cycling, open-water swimming, and lots more</strong>.</p>
<p>Safety features add peace of mind during solo training sessions. <strong>Incident detection works</strong> during select outdoor activities and sends a message with your live location to emergency contacts when paired with your compatible smartphone. The <em>Assistance</em> feature lets you manually trigger an alert when you need help, something that is good to have when you are exploring new routes or training in remote areas.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting a watch that competes directly with models costing $600 or more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of the biggest games of the year are getting new difficulty options. Some of the biggest companies would kindly like their workers to quietly leave. Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of gaming news and culture. <a href="https://beta.ideas.lego.com/product-ideas/0046a36e-c287-4ddf-9ff2-dc1b553dfde1">This Lego arcade</a> is one of my favorite new proposed fan sets. It would go perfectly in that giant Lego city I have no time or money for building in my attic.</p> <h2>Krafton will let developers voluntarily resign as it doubles down on AI</h2> <p>The <em>PUBG</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101"><em>Subnautica 2</em> publisher</a> will allow employees based in South Korea to be part of a new voluntary resignation program that gives anywhere from six months to three years of severance,<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette"><em>Business Korea</em> reports</a>. Krafton says the plan isn’t aimed at sneaking through “soft” layoffs, but is “to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation,” according to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-for-employees-as-it-transforms-into-an-ai-first-company/">a translation by <em>Automaton</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The news comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-ai-pubg-bloodlines-2-motion-blur-2000638553">Krafton committed $70 million</a> in investment for GPU clusters to drive its agentic AI transformation and as fellow South Korea publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">Nexon suggested</a> adopting generative AI technology is a matter of survival.</p> <h2>220 <em>GTA 6</em> devs signed a letter blasting the firing of 31 colleagues</h2> <p>The IGWB trade union group in the UK announced on Thursday that the letter was delivered to Rockstar management. It accused the company of union busting and demanded the reinstatement of the previously fired developers. French union STJV is planning a protest in front of Take-Two France on Friday.</p>

 <p>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account—during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down,” one of the fired employees said in a statement. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</p>

 <h2>Could <em>GTA 6</em>‘s delay also delay the launch of the PS6?</h2> <p>That’s the thought experiment one recently analyst proposed. “We are currently forecasting a next-gen PlayStation and Xbox to arrive in late 2027–but might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the <em>GTA 6</em> wave and waiting until 2028?” Ampere Analysis research director Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-delay-of-gta-6">posed the idea to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the <em>GTA</em> franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies.”</p>

 <p>The idea here is that GTA 6 will lead to a spike in new console sales that will dramatically increase the current-gen install base. If that peak doesn’t come until early 2027, console makers might have an incentive to wait a bit before pushing out their next hardware release. But as Harding-Rolls also points out, backwards compatibility makes that less of an issue these days.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill f</em> just got a new easy mode</h2> <p><a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/gate?p=q9avy6C9QUKFRFGSGPvBvfio1VMukY6Si2kFcyPbJy1IDNigoCWC1RGMUocaVwR2">Patch 1.10 added</a> a “casual” difficulty for players who are tired of messing around with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">Souls-y action combat</a> and just want to experience the world and story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is the latest monster-taming RPG in the series to forgo voice acting. As these games have become more cinematic, it’s become pretty jarring that these characters don’t have voices when they speak. </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> has fully animated scenes in which characters’ mouths flap as they speak, but no sound actually comes out. As such, fans have been making their own voice dubs of the series for years, and there are </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2iFaaUZo9M"><span>some pretty good ones out there</span></a><span>. There’s also a deeply unserious one by </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485">Final Fantasy XVI</a> </span></i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402?_gl=1*9icn1w*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcxJHQxNzQ3MjQ1MDg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> actor Ben Starr playing Naveen from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> completely straight with his usual broody delivery.</span></p> <p><span>In a recent episode of the Kit &amp; Krysta Podcast, Starr “auditioned” for the role, with co-hosts Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang acting alongside him as the protagonist and Taunie. Starr, hilariously, makes no attempt to capture Naveen’s youth and pretty much whips out his gravely Clive voice from </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></i><span>. If you’ve ever wanted to hear Starr be a broody simp for a Pokémon streamer, here’s your chance.</span></p>   <p><span>It’s a funny bit and I have to applaud the artistic choices made with a mostly straight face here, but it does underline that a lot of the character of these games can be dialed up and enhanced with a good voice actor in the booth. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> definitely shows that Game Freak has the writing chops to execute </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>some really funny, memorable scenes and jokes</span></a><span> despite not including voice acting, but every time I hear a fan try to embody these characters, I just wish the games had that same spark we get in projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389">anime</a> or the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i></a><span>games. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>takes a baby step toward this future by giving your main character Link-like grunts and yells when they do some actions, but they’re one person in a city full of heroes and villains that I’d love to hear speak instead of just reading. Don’t get me started on that weird scene in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>where a whole concert was happening just for a character to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC9vQmmvvfI"><span>pantomime the performance instead of singing</span></a><span>. Though that’s also </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thecamsteady/video/7536409709599870222"><span>allowed fans to interpret that character’s musical chops</span></a><span>, as well.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With the holiday approaching fast, now is a great time to get a head start on all of your gift shopping. Whether you have a low budget White Elephant coming up at your office or you’re just looking for another good stocking stuffer for your high school to college-aged kid, consider this. INIU’s portable charger is something anyone that owns a phone would greatly appreciate, which is probably most people you know. The portable charger is normally listed on Amazon at $36. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5555/">However, a limited time deal is bringing the price down by 37% and it’s not even Black Friday or Cyber Monday yet</a>. Right now, that savings of $14 brings the price you pay down to just $22.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5555/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Travel-Friendly Charging</h2>
<p>This portable charger from INIU is the perfect travel buddy. It’s small in stature, able to fit in your pocket alongside your phone easily. It only measures in at 3.2 inches by 1.5 inches by 1.1 inches and weighs just 4.1 ounces. The charger even comes with a built-in keychain so you can clip it easily to your backpack or bag. Or just keep it on your keys so you always have it with you. Perfect for charging during trips or long commutes. It’s also TSA compliant so you’ll have no trouble taking it with you through the airports while traveling.</p>
<p>You’ve got lots on things you carry on you that need to be recharged every now and again. This portable charger can help you out with it’s built-in USB-C charging cable as well as the 5W wireless charger for Apple Watch. It’s also got an additional USB-C port in case you need to charge two phones at once.</p>



<p>Despite it’s compact form , this portable charger can pack a lot of backup power. With 5,000mAH on hand, the power bank can provide an Apple Watch with six full charges or an iPhone 16 with up to 91% from zero, giving you that reliable boost of power when you really need it.</p>
<p>It’s fast too. With Power Delivery support and 20W output, you can bring an iPhone 17 Pro up to 56% in just 25 minutes time. When it’s time to charge the portable power bank itself, it can do that fairly quickly as well. It can reach full charge from 20% in just two hours time.</p>
<p>The digital display on the front is there to let you know exactly how much power the charger has left in it. This can help prevent you rushing out the door with it, expecting it to be at full charge but then you realize you had forgotten to plug it in. You get a simple three digits indicating what percent battery the charger has left.</p>

              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is certainly one of 2025’s big success stories, but you’d be hard-pressed to call its concept wholly original. Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG may well have been first to combine fully real-time movement with turn-based combat, but it was built on the shoulders of games like <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, <em>Atelier Ryza</em> and even <em>Mario RPG </em>and&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario</em>, along with a wealth of other influences (<em>Final Fantasy</em>,&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>,&nbsp;<em>Earthbound</em>…). So when another studio independently developers a turn-based RPG with real-time dodge and parry mechanics, it’s hardly a given that it’s lifting directly from this year’s hit. Yet this is the accusation <em>The Time I Have Left</em> is being bombarded with, and it’s really getting developer Ground down.</p> <p>The forthcoming RPG, which describes itself as “a time-driven escape adventure with RPG elements,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129480/The_Time_I_Have_Left_Demo/">has had its most recent demo available on Steam</a> for just over a month, and it’s been mostly been well-received by players, albeit with the qualification that combat is rather “clunky”—a term used by an awful lot of Steam reviews. However, it’s a different criticism that’s bothering developers Ground, and that’s the suggestion that its copying <em>Expedition 33</em>. Something the team suggests would be a tricky feat, given demos of its game were playable in 2022, some three years before the French success was released.</p>

 <p>“Every time someone accuses us of ripping off&nbsp;<em>Expedition 33</em>, we die a little bit inside,” the team wrote <a href="https://x.com/ground_ga/status/1988670588311990583">on X</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/groundga.bsky.social/post/3m5hgbijcms2j">BlueSky</a>. “Yes, it’s a turn-based RPG,” the post continues, and “Yes, it has dodges and parries.” But, the developers implore readers, “our game already had all that in the public demos we released in 2022 and 2024.” The post concludes, “No need to call us names.”</p>

The developers later noted their delight at the supportive response they’ve received to this, with almost 1,000 replies so far.</p>

 <p>Ground hasn’t had a particularly easy time of late. The studio itself went bankrupt earlier in the year, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1918830/discussions/0/595160802290523510/">the entire staff has continued on developing the game</a> while seeking more support, and has still managed to put out the new demo. And given the popularity of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it’d make some degree of sense for publishers to take note of this one, given there’s a pre-built audience out there right now.</p> <p><em>The Time I Have Left</em> features imbalanced combat in which enemies get more actions per turn than you, but you have multiple ways to influence the fight during their moves. There are parries and dodges, but also interrupts, counters, and even ways to gain more turns for yourself, with different suites of direct control in both phases of battles. The developers welcome feedback on the demo on Steam, although perhaps avoid mentioning you-know-what if you do.</p>
