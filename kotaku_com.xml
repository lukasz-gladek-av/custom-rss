There hasn’t been much news about the film in some time, with some wondering if it was going to be dumped on streaming services. But nope, it’s still coming to theaters. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196766,196452" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s rewind a bit, because I feel like a lot of people might not even be aware that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-return-movie-konami-cast-james-mary-gans-1850229464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-return-movie-konami-cast-james-mary-gans-1850229464">a third (!) <em>Silent Hill </em>movie is happening</a></span>. In fact, it already happened. <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> has been done for a bit now, after it wrapped up shooting in 2023. It’s directed and co-written by Christophe Gans, the same guy who directed the weirdly good original <em>Silent Hill </em>film from 2006. This new film isn’t connected to that movie or the less popular 2012 sequel film, <em>Silent Hill: Revelation</em>. Instead,<em> Return to Silent Hill</em> is a standalone movie based heavily on <em>Silent Hill 2. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 18, <em>Deadline </em>revealed</a></span> that Cineverse, Bloody Disgusting, and Iconic Events Releasing—the same trio of companies responsible for <em>Terrifier 3</em>—are bringing<em> Return to Silent Hill</em> to theaters. The horror film will be released on January 23, which does make me nervous, as that’s historically the month when movie studios and production companies dump bad films into cinemas.</p><p> There is no trailer for the movie yet, but here’s an old teaser from 2022: </p><p>“Return to <em>Silent Hill </em>hits theaters at the perfect time,” said Mark Rupp, CFO/COO and co-founder of Iconic Events Releasing. “[It arrives after the] successful recent launch of the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> game remake that the movie is based on, while also celebrating the 20th anniversary of the start of the horror film franchise.”</p><p>Yeah, that makes me even more nervous. The fact that the main reason this thing is getting a theatrical release is because the recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake did so well doesn’t fill me with confidence. </p><p>Regardless, in January 2026, we are getting a live-action adaptation of <em>Silent Hill 2.</em> If <em>Return to Silent Hill </em>turns out to be bad, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202?_gl=1*187f2zx*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAyNzkwOTMkbzEzOCRnMSR0MTc1MDI3OTE0MiRqMTEkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202?_gl=1*187f2zx*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAyNzkwOTMkbzEzOCRnMSR0MTc1MDI3OTE0MiRqMTEkbDAkaDA.">well, at least we’ve got a bunch of <em>Silent Hill</em> games and remakes to play these days.</a></span> </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Things like “always hit the small camp first to get level 2" and “never fight the Bell Bearing Hunter boss beneath the castle.” A third is “don’t bother trying to revive someone with three bars unless you have your ult.” But time and time again, players try to do that anyway.

While the visual icon over a fallen party member’s body shows a trisected circle with one segment filled for each time they’ve been downed, it turns out the actual number of hits it takes to bring them back to their feet scales dramatically with each full bar. (Yes, you revive your teammates by doing damage to them.)</p><p>Anyone who’s spent a few hours with the multiplayer roguelike intrinsically knows this, but having the math clearly laid out should help discourage anyone from trying to be a hero and getting cooked by a Nightlord in the process:</p><p>As Zullie the Witch explains, attacks done in an effort to revive a teammate are logged completely differently than normal damage against enemies. Each weapon type does a certain base amount of damage—starting at 10 for daggers and torches and peaking at 25 for ballistas—and it takes 40 damage points to fill up the first revive bar. Simple enough, a flurry of quick stabs with a dagger will do it. But the second and third bars are where things get deceivingly devilish. At two bars, the damage required per bar is 45 for a total of 90, and at three bars its 80 each, for a whopping total of 240 damage. </p><p>That would be tough enough on its own, but the extra tricky part comes from how fast the bars refill in-between hits. At one bar, the meter refills at just two damage per second. At two bars, meanwhile, the refill happens at nine damage per second, while at three bars, they’re refilling at 40 points per second. That’s why it’s essentially impossible to revive other teammates without an ultimate cooldown ready when you’re the last one standing. Turning your attention away for even a second to dodge an incoming attack will see almost all of your progress lost. </p><p>So why do many players insist on trying to revive thrice-downed teammates anyway? Psychologically, the fact that our minds are trained by the UI to think linearly while the game is scaling exponentially is no doubt part of it. Another is that no one wants to be the reason their team failed, getting your ass beat while strangers watch powerless to help. Third, it’s kind of just terrifying to go up against <em>Nightreign</em>’s tougher bosses with no backup. </p><p>Unless you’re used to playing solo, the game has a knack for making you think you’re better than you are because of how easy it is to whale on enemies while they’re trading off aggro against two other players. Once the odds are evened, the truth has nowhere to hide. As Zullie the Witch has shown, though, your best bet is to just dig in, block, dodge, and take pot shots until your ultimate art is ready. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He explained that he didn’t know what was in the trailer, only that it was game- or toy-related. Thieves took multiple large pallets of Switch 2 consoles from the trailer. Police estimate that over $1 million worth of consoles were stolen from the truck. Authorities aren’t sure if the robbery happened in Bennet or somewhere else. </p><p>Police are still searching for the thief or thieves who got away with all these Switch 2 consoles. And if you live in Grapevine, Texas, and have struggled to get a Switch 2 at launch, well, this might be why. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
