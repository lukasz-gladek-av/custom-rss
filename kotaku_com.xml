              <p>Surprise! Xbox has announced a new digital event that will broadcast later this week and will provide a new look at <em>007 First Light</em> as well as some “brand-new reveals” and Game Pass announcements, too.</p> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/17/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-announce/">On November 17,</a> Microsoft announced the next Xbox Partner Preview, a digital broadcast that the company says “shines a light on upcoming games” from various third-party studios. Beyond a new trailer for IOI’s upcoming<em> 007</em> game, Xbox promises new footage of horror adventure game <em>Reanimal</em> and an extended look at gameplay from<em> Tides of Annihilation.</em> Xbox also promises more info about the games revealed in the showcase on the company’s blog, Xbox Wire.</p> <p>The event will begin on Thursday, November 20, at 10 am PST / 1 pm EST. And you can watch it on <a href="https://youtube.com/Xbox">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a>, and <a href="https://tiktok.com/@Xbox">TikTok</a>. The YouTube stream will be broadcast in 4K/60, which is always nice.</p> <p>“Xbox Partner Preview is all about bringing you news from our partners across the globe,” said Xbox in a press release. “Be it release date announcements, fresh new gameplay from upcoming titles, and world premieres of unannounced new games. We’re also excited to reveal that Jennifer English, who portrays <em>Tides of Annihilation</em> protagonist Gwendolyn, is our voiceover artist for the show.”</p> <p>All of the games confirmed to show up in the Thursday event, as well as the new reveals teased in the announcement post, will all be Xbox Play Anywhere, so you can buy the game once and play it on Xbox, PC, and devices that support cloud streaming, with your save games and progress seamlessly hopping from machine to machine. This is a very nifty feature that I use a lot, and I’m happy to see more third-party devs and publishers embracing it. I hope &lt;INSERT GAME YOU ARE EXCITED ABOUT HERE&gt; is finally revealed or announced after the long wait. Good luck!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will Leon S. Kennedy and his glorious hair appear in the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>? He totally will, according to many fans. But officially, Capcom hasn’t confirmed it, and <em>Requiem’s</em> producer has even called the rumors “fake news,” but spoke just vaguely enough that fans will likely continue to believe in this popular online theory.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941">Almost immediately after <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> was revealed in June</a>, fans began theorizing that the survival horror sequel is secretly hiding another playable character: Leon. Officially,<em> Requiem</em> features only one playable character, Grace Ashcroft, and is a return to the slower, creepier horror found in past entries.</p>

 <p>Playable in either third or first person, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is set to launch in February for consoles and PC, and many fans believe that when it does, Leon will at the very least show up or might even be a playable character. As evidence, they point to the fact that, since being announced, we’ve seen very little of the game beyond a few sections. Some suggest this confirms that you’ll play as Leon in other parts of the game. A leaked image of a grizzled Leon wearing an eyepatch adds more fuel to the fire. And <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">Capcom has been oddly coy</a> about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon when asked in past interviews</a>. But according to the game’s producer, there’s no concrete basis for fans to believe that Leon will be in the game.</p>

 <p>“Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more detective work [on the part of players],” said <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in"><em>Reqeuim</em> producer Masato Kumazawa in a new interview</a> with <em>Stevivor.&nbsp;</em> “So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value.”</p>

 <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">“Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation.”</p>

 <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Kumazawa also directly addressed the “leaked” eyepatch image, and it’s not good news for fans who liked the redesign.</p> <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">“There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news.”</p> <p data-slot-rendered-content="true">However, Kumazawa never says directly that Leon <em>isn’t</em> in the game. Instead, his answer essentially boils down to him saying that it all just amounts to speculation and telling people to only trust information from Capcom. So if you’re still holding out hope that Leon is in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, this interview doesn’t negate the possibility that the famous character could pop up. It just seems that if he does, he’ll have both eyes intact. <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> launches on February 27, 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

              <p>It’s award season for video games, and that means it’s time to gear up for another hours-long commercial with some awards sprinkled in between the new trailers. The Game Awards is back this year and will be streaming live on December 11. Today, November 17, host Geoff Keighley will be announcing this year’s nominees, which are decided by a panel of different critics, journalists, and other industry figures. Funnily enough, we already know the nominees for the Game of the Year award because <a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1990445247823008144?s=20">they were leaked beforehand</a>, so we’ll start filling in the rest of the categories as they’re announced. If you want to watch the whole announcement stream, you can do so below.

              <p>Soon you’ll be able to walk into a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-staten-island-switch-2-stapler-auction-charity-1851785951">GameStop</a> to trade in, well, nearly anything. For one day only in December, the company will accept almost any piece of junk you try to give it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-staten-island-switch-2-stapler-auction-charity-1851785951">GameStop Auctioning Off Infamous Staten Island Switch 2 Stapler For Charity</a></p> <p>This “<a href="https://www.gamestop.com/trade/">Trade Anything Day</a>” stunt will take place on December 6. Yes, there are certain exclusions on what you can walk in and plunk down on the counter in exchange for store credit. But the company claims it’s open to giving you store credit for some unexpected items.</p>

 <p>It’s a common-enough joke on the internet that GameStop’s trade-in values for even the latest games are pretty abysmal. But the advertisement for the “Trade Anything Day” features everything from a mug, to a taxidermied squirrel, to a lonely leather boot. “Bring Whatever, Get Store Credit” the ad reads, with “No Questions Asked” written at the bottom, modified to say “<i>Some</i> Questions Asked.*”</p>

 <blockquote><p>Hazardous waste or material, chemicals, liquids. Lithium ion batteries or items containing lithium ion batteries. Weapons and ammo. Dead or alive animals (Taxidermy items are valid for trade). Alcohol, Tobacco, drugs or pharmaceuticals (legal or not). Computers (such as desktops, laptops, notebooks, all-in-ones, minis, workstations, e-readers, tablets, thin clients, smart displays, virtual reality headsets with built-in processor, interactive flat panel displays with built-in processor) excluding certain MacBooks GameStop normally accepts in trade.&nbsp; Computer peripherals intended for use with a computer and weighing less than 100 pounds (monitors, keyboards/keypads, mice/pointing devices, external hard drives (excluding those normally accepted in trade), facsimile machines, document scanners, printers, 3D printers, label printers, digital picture frames. Small electronic equipment (portable digital music players, VCRs, DVD players, DVRs, digital converter boxes, cable or satellite receivers, projectors including those with DVD player capability). Small scale servers. Televisions. Gift cards and other currency (foreign or domestic). Jewelry. Sexual and explicit items. Items resembling body parts. Items MUST fit in our 20x20x20 measuring box. Terms and conditions of promotion are subject to change. GameStop employees have the discretion to reject any item.</p></blockquote> <p>Some of these exclusions make sense. You probably shouldn’t be bringing in expired prescription drugs. But while it might be understandable for the company to not accept VCRs and DVD players, not being able to trade in electronic devices such as tablets and VR headsets with onboard processors (which would include the Oculus family of headsets) is a bit of a surprise.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">GameStop Just Bought Half A Billion Dollars Worth Of Bitcoin</a></p> <p>I’ll have to see what weird things I have laying around to test out this policy to the fullest extent. Shame I don’t have all those wall-mounted deer heads anymore. I might have been able to put them toward $10 off <i>GTA VI</i>.</p>
