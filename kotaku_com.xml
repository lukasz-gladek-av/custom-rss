              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-my-video-game-family-is-bringing-to-thanksgiving-1845758556">Thanksgiving</a> is later this week in the United States. Loads of people are going to be traveling across the country to visit family members, some of whom they like, while eating food and cursing the fact that they have to do this all over again in like three weeks for Christmas. But who cares about all that? We are here to discuss the star of Thanksgiving: The food.</p> <p>What makes a perfect <a href="https://kotaku.com/public-school-thanksgiving-feast-the-kotaku-review-1820327714">Thanksgiving plate</a>? It’s a question that will likely get a lot of different answers, and all of them will be wrong unless they happen to match your perfect platter of tasty treats.</p> <p>For me, I have to have turkey at Thanksgiving. It’s the only time of the year when I’m willing to put the effort into prepping, cooking, and then carving up a giant turkey. And no, turkey isn’t dry or flavorless; you’ve just likely had some poorly cooked turkey. I’ve had turkey that was succulent and packed with flavor. The key is to brine, shield the white meat, and don’t overcook that thing or shove stuffing in it.</p>

 <p>Beyond a few big slices of turkey on my plate, I also have to have fluffy, garlic-y mashed potatoes, sweet corn, steamed but still crunchy broccoli (no cheese!), some stuffing that wasn’t cooked in a turkey, and a few Hawaiian sweet rolls. No gravy needed. Salad optional. It’s Thanksgiving. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bobs-burgers-thanksgiving-episodes-list-ranked-best-1851709655">I’m here to load up on carbs and collapse in front of a TV</a>.</p> <p>But that’s <em>my</em> perfect plate. What are you serving or hoping to be served on Thanksgiving? Let us know in the comments below! We’ll then be back later this week with a follow-up post sharing some of your answers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of the year again, right before Thanksgiving, when stores and online retailers treat Black Friday as a weeks-long event and not a single day of the year. Strange, but hey, it leads to a lot of great deals, so I’m not complaining.</p> <p>Sony is getting in on the early action with a massive digital PSN store Black Friday sale consisting of a mix of first and third-party PlayStation 5 games, ranging from newer releases, like this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><em>Death Stranding 2,</em></a> to older hits like <em>The Last of Us </em>and <em>Spider-Man.</em> <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/99d2af65-6386-4f11-a1f9-94d1e9c84063/1">This big Black Friday PSN sale goes from now until December 1.</a> So buy some games for yourselves and enjoy them. You deserve it. 2025 was a mess.</p>

 <p>I’ve also highlighted some great deals on non-exclusive PS5 games. <em>Battlefield 6</em> currently has its hooks in me so deep that I might have to uninstall it to actually play other stuff. <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is great, but not a huge open-world zombie game that is easily worth $48. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is probably my favorite game in the franchise since <em>Origins</em>, and at under $50, it’s a steal. For folks looking for some creepy scares over holiday break, <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>and <em>Silent Hill f</em> might just be what you’re looking for, and both are fantastic. And if you have a spouse or sibling who is free this Thanksgiving, <em>Split Fiction</em> might just be the perfect co-op adventure to complete while munching on leftovers.</p> <p>Anyway, here are some of the best exclusives we spotted in the sale. Plus, below that list is <em>another</em> list of other great games that are cheaper than normal until next month.</p> <h2>PlayStation 5 Console Exclusives</h2> <ul> <li><em>Death Stranding 2 –</em> $50 ($70)</li> <li><em>Astro Bot</em> – $40 ($60)</li> <li><em>Baby Steps</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> – $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> – $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Last of Us Part I&nbsp;</em>– $30 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Last of Us Complete&nbsp;</em>– $70 ($100)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>– $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition&nbsp;</em>– $40 ($60)</li> </ul> <hr> <h2>Other Great Games On Sale</h2> <ul> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – $60 ($70)</li> <li><em>Clair Obscura – Expedition 33</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> – $48 ($60)</li> <li><em>Stellar Blade</em> – $40 ($70)</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> – $42 ($70)</li> <li><em>Forza Horizon 5</em> – $39 ($60)</li> <li><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> – $26 ($40)</li> <li><em>Ready or Not</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> – $42 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill 2</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Split Fiction</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> – $35 ($50)</li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> – $10 ($50)</li> <li><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Ed.</em> – $43 ($71)</li> <li><em>Star Wars Jedi Survivor</em> – $11 ($70)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> – $21 ($70)</li> <li><em>Hell Is Us</em> – $42 ($60)</li> <li><em>Resident Evil Remake Trilogy</em> (2,3,4) – $41 ($90)</li> </ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/vampire-bloodlines-2-vtm-chinese-room-hsl-2000646997</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloodlines-2-dev-was-begging-to-name-it-something-different.1363306/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>At its best, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607"><i>Bloodlines 2</i> can be a good time</a>, especially when you just focus on the compelling story and writing. It can even be a fun vampire power fantasy from time to time. It has its charm in places, sure, but it almost never earns its name or identity as the sequel to the 2004 cult-hit <i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</i>. Turns out, its developer agrees: It never should’ve been named <i>Bloodlines 2</i>.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i> Was So Close To Being Something Special</a></p> <p>Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of The Chinese Room and writer of <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s story, recently spoke about the early days of taking over <i>Bloodlines 2</i> with Cat Burton on <i>The Goth Boss Podcast</i> (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/interview-chinese-room-paradox">h/t <i>PCGamesN</i></a>), saying that while he was eager to create a game set in <i>Vampire: The Masquerade</i>, he didn’t just want to drag previous developer Hardsuit Lab’s work across the finish line. And he most certainly didn’t want to call it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. He told Burton:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We would sit there and go and have these planning sessions on ‘how do we get [Paradox] to not call it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>?’ That feels like the most important thing that we can do here, is come at this and say ‘this isn’t <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, you can’t make it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. There’s not enough time and there’s not enough money.’</p></blockquote> <p>Pinchbeck would leave The Chinese Room in 2023, shortly after the team took on the <i>Bloodlines 2</i> project.</p>  <h2>Would a name change have made that much of a difference?</h2> <p>“No one would be happy,” Pinchbeck said about trying to deliver a more direct sequel, something truer to the original <i>Bloodlines</i>’ RPG spirit. “We sort of approached it from [the] point of view of ‘what <i>can</i> we do with the time and the money that’s available?’” he said, “we can’t make <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, we can’t make <i>Skyrim</i>, but we can make <i>Dishonored</i>.”</p>

 <p>It’s hard not to play <i>Bloodlines 2</i> and feel the <i>Dishonored </i>inspiration. Though you do explore an open world, it’s tiny; and while scripted dialogue scenes in the final product are often excellent, <i>Bloodlines 2</i> hardly has the kinds of character interactions and sidequests that made the original notable. That leaves behind a first-person game where you wield supernatural powers, often steathily, against your opponents. Sound familiar?</p>

 <p>I’m not sure if a different name would’ve made for a significantly better reception for <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. In fact, it might not’ve been talked about nearly as much if it wasn’t called <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. Games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-swansong-impressions-rpg-tabletop-bl-1848939458"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong</i></a> and <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Heart of the Forest</i> are far better games set in the World of Darkness, the broader mythos of <i>VtM</i> which it shares with other games like <i>Werewolf</i>. Though at least those games weren’t burdened with the expectation that led up to <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s eventual release.</p> <p>Much like <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood</i>, a differently-named <i>Bloodlines 2</i> would’ve otherwise been just a mediocre action game that at best appeals to a niche audience of TTRPG fanatics. That’s presently what it is anyway, regardless of the name it bears.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a%E2%80%99s-go-to-competitive-team-has-made-multiplayer-boring.1363285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve only spent a few nights in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> multiplayer mode, and while I’m not usually a competitive player, I had a pretty fun time during those early days post-launch, before everyone had figured out what the meta was going to be. It’s chaotic, makes the most out of the game’s real-time battle system, and hitting several enemies with one giant Surf tsunami is always satisfying. Even using my non-optimized team of favorites was a blast. But it was only like this for a few nights. Now, you can’t boot up the game without folks running the same three Pokémon and essentially turning competitive battles into a game of rock-paper-scissors.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not uncommon for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>meta to form that prioritizes a handful of monsters, but </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer format has incentivized players to find what are essentially three of the strongest, most versatile Pokémon in the game’s roster and swap between them ad nauseam. This time, Metagross, Xerneas, and Garchomp have become the go-to team.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer mode pits four players against each other, each with a team of three monsters, competing to rack up the most knock-outs in a limited time. These three Pokémon are not only powerful on their own, but they also have some of the most robust defensive capabilities in the game. Their Steel/Psychic, Fairy, and Dragon/Ground typings make them resistant to several incoming elements, and they each have versatile movesets. Basically, these three Pokémon cover most situations between them, and they are also excellent counters to one another. Metagross’ steel attacks can take down Xerneas, whose fairy-type moves are effective against Garchomp, who can knock Metagross over with a well-positioned Earthquake.</span></p>

 <p><span>These three Pokémon are so dominant in competitive play now that everyone else is just trying to get a few good hits in before some variation of this team pops up on the battlefield. When I started writing this up, I hopped into one match to see what teams I would come across, and while I didn’t face this exact composition, all three of my opponents had at least two of them on their team. I’m not the only person who’s noticed this, either.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646989" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646989"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646989">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I know Metas are inevitable, but </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> online battles went from actually quite fun at release to the most monotonous and miserable thing ever over such a short time,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oqppm0/i_know_metas_are_inevitable_but_legends_za_online/"><span>Reddit user TheFierceDiety writes</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“Adding in the legendaries this early in ranked was a crazy move,” D00MPhd wrote in response. “Xerneas being playable in ranked homogenized the format in the worst way. If they waited until there were more legendary options to choose from, like in older games, we would still see a degree of diversity among team building.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This kind of homogeneous teambuilding is the reason official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>competitive play has tiers that sort different monsters into different groups. Right now, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has no such designation that lets you battle against teams of comparable power. If the game implements something like that, players who want to use different teams might have somewhere to play without having to deal with the impenetrable wall that is Metagross, Xerneas, and Garchomp.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe things will change when the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> launches on December 10 and adds several new monsters to the roster, but for the moment, this is what players are dealing with when they hop onto ranked battles. It’s made worse by the fact that you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>have to play ranked battles to unlock certain Mega Stones</span></a><span>, so even people who don’t want to deal with these teams have to in order to get every Mega Evolution. It’s bad enough that there’s a growing cheater problem infecting the mode; now we have to deal with the same few monsters every battle. At least Game Freak made it easier to get high enough rank for those rewards by essentially making it impossible to lose rank. Now you can just go get beaten up for a few rounds and still get what you want. You’ll be fine.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hundreds of people were fired for what they said about Charlie Kirk in the wake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-assassination-bandai-namco-ai-model-gunpla-2000626472">his assassination</a> earlier this year. Ex-Sucker Punch artist Drew Harrison <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">was one of them</a>. In her first interview since her joke about the murder prompted an online harassment campaign targeting the<em> Ghost Of Yotei</em> studio, she says Sony never asked her to remove the offending post or apologize for it before deciding to fire her.</p> <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-fired/">Speaking to <em>Aftermath</em></a>, the 10-year veteran of the PlayStation first-party team outlined what she experienced on the inside the studio and the campaign online to get her tossed out of it. “I just thought, ‘I’m their entertainment for the day,’” Harrison said. “I assumed it was going to go how it always has: Nobody cares about what they say because they literally only harass for the fun of it.”</p>

 <p>“I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back,” she posted on Bluesky the day Kirk was shot. Online reactionaries like Mark “Grummz” Kern and others looking to exact revenge for anyone appearing to make light of the assassination began directing their followers to boycott<em> Yotei</em> and demand Harrison’s termination.</p>

 <p><em>Aftermath</em> reports that Sucker Punch became bombarded with so many anonymous calls that some employees were even instructed to unplug their desk phones. “I made the worst people on the internet mad,” Harrison wrote in the office chat the next day. “As an apology, there are banana muffins in the kitchen.”</p>

 <p>But later that day, a member of Sucker Punch’s leadership reportedly published the following message in the company’s chat:</p> <blockquote><p>Due to a social media post by one of our team members, many corners of our studio and Sony organization are having to manage a developing situation. We may have to pause a trailer release…there will be some significant amount of work created now to ensure we keep the spotlight on the fantastic game we’ve all created. Please be mindful of how you represent yourself online…</p></blockquote> <p>Harrison told <em>Aftermath</em> she was contacted later that day for an unscheduled call with a Sony HR rep (not a studio manager) who told her she was being immediately fired for allegedly “inciting violence” with her social media joke.</p>

 <p>“Full disclosure, the joke was not in the best taste,” Harrison said. “But at no point did anyone ask me to delete it. At no point did anyone ask me to apologize—and for the record, I would have. I would have worked with PR to write an apology. It feels like nobody investigated the harassment me and my coworkers were receiving.”</p>

 <p>Sony has never directly commented on the reason for the firing. “I think we’re aligned as a studio that celebrating or making light of someone’s murder is a deal-breaker for us, and we condemn that, kind of in no uncertain terms,” studio co-founder Brian Fleming later <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sucker-punch-brian-fleming-interview-playstation-ghost-of-yotei">told <em>Game File</em></a>. “That’s sort of our studio, and that’s kind of where we are.”</p> <p>Harrison said no one from Sucker Punch’s leadership, including Fleming, reached out to her before Sony fired her. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, meanwhile, has gone on to sell millions of copies despite the boycott targeting Harrison and reactionary attacks against lead actor Erika Ishii (whose performance <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">was nominated for a TGA</a>).</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-console-linus-skillup-valve-2000646965</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-machine-won%E2%80%99t-be-subsidized-to-price-it-like-a-500-gaming-console.1363252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve hasn’t officially announced the price of its upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Steam Machine consoles</a>. Maybe even CEO Gabe Newell doesn’t know how much the company will eventually decide to charge. But that hasn’t stopped a drip-feed of quote and speculation from pointing toward the higher end of the pricing spectrum. The company recently confirmed it won’t be subsidizing the devices, seemingly squashing any chance of it being less than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">price of a PlayStation 5 Pro</a>.</p> <p>That was the sense we got from comments Valve made back when the Steam Machines <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">were first revealed</a>. Despite an emphasis on “affordability,” the company was also quick to confirm that the consoles would be “very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts” but also closer to the “entry level of the PC space” than what some fans might be expecting.</p>

 <p>Last week on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo?si=vFixe-qpVjph_B0v">LinusTechTips YouTube channel</a>, Linus Gabriel Sebastian confirmed that he asked Valve directly if the smaller storage Steam Machine would be in line with a current $500 console. “Nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn’t great,” he said.</p>

 <p>The scales have now tipped even further away from that price point in an interview Valve did <a href="https://youtu.be/yvu66Y2VLq8?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu">with gaming channel Skill Up</a>. YouTuber Ralph Panebianco asked point-blank if the company would use proceeds from Steam to make the hardware cheaper than it costs to manufacture. “No,” software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais said. “It’s more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance.”</p>

 <p>It’s not been uncommon in the past for console makers to underprice hardware in order to grow their install base and make more money off of selling more games and servers on the backend. As the biggest PC gaming store around, Valve has billions of profits it could through at gaining market share in a potential console war. It sounds like that’s not what the company has planned, however.</p>

 <p>No subsidies is basically the final nail in the coffin for any hope that the Steam Machine will be priced to compete directly with a Switch 2, PS5, or pre-tariff Xbox Series X. Some fans are still hoping the 512GB model might come in between $600 and $700, which would put it around the current price of the 1TB Steam Deck OLED.</p> <p>Even that seems overly optimistic, especially with <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">recent reports</a> that the AI arms race is about to push PC component prices <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">even higher</a>. Next-gen consoles, which all rely on the same chip makers, will be facing similar pressures. We’ll see how it all shakes out when Valve reveals the Steam Machine price early next year. Who knows. Maybe the PS6 and next Xbox won’t be anywhere close to $500, either.</p>
