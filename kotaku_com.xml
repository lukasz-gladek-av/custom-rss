<h2 data-start="901" data-end="943"><strong data-start="901" data-end="943">A Blend of Technology and Iconic Style</strong></h2>

These connect effortlessly to Spotify, allowing you to enjoy your favorite playlists or podcasts while keeping your ears open to the world around you. Phone calls are equally convenient.

              <p><span>God, Nintendo can be an annoying company. Not 24 hours ago, I was writing about how it made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s music volume options a toggle</span></a><span> that only let you choose between “normal” and “louder,” and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today and has its own obnoxious music options for players to contend with. At least </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s nonsense came at no additional cost to you. </span><i><span>Metroid</span></i><span> has paywalled basic options and features behind $30 amiibo figures.</span></p> <p><span>One of the big additions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>is an open-world hub space that Samus travels through on a super cool motorcycle. Unfortunately, this area is pretty lifeless, and you only really have the rattle and hum of Samus’ bike to accompany its desolate, isolating vibes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s some ambient music in the background, but it’s certainly not doing much to make these sections exciting. Some open-world games, like </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, let you turn on a radio station while traveling to make driving segments more stimulating, but </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has no such option…unless you buy the </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>Samus amiibo.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me get this straight: If you pay $29.99 for the collectible Samus amiibo in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetroidPrime4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetroidPrime4</a>  you get to play/select music while driving the Vi-O-La bike in the otherwise quiet desert… In other words: They locked MUSIC while riding through a desert behind a $30 paywall… Am… <a href="https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR">https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/1996340617497227440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The figure allows you to change the music while riding your motorcycle, and paywalling such a basic feature would be maddening if it weren’t also one of the most Nintendo-ass decisions the company could have made. I think I’m more impressed by the new ways it finds to be obtuse than anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Amiibo figures, small figurines of characters that unlock things when you tap them on a Nintendo game system were first introduced in 2014 for the Wii U and 3DS, and have always come with bonus in-game rewards that were, often items or cosmetics. Gating features that would be standard in most games is so weirdly hostile that I’m surprised Nintendo gets away with it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650512">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For whatever it’s worth, the Samus amiibo looks great, but do keep in mind it’s not to be confused with the </span><i><span>other</span></i><span> Samus figure that includes her bike. That one won’t let you change the music; instead, it will let you change the motorcycle’s color and see how much you’ve traveled on your chopper. Good thing these things look pretty on a shelf. I’m trying to imagine what would happen if any other company charged $30 for baseline functionality. It probably wouldn’t go well!</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-watch-se-3-gets-cleared-out-at-all-time-low-practically-renewed-level-pricing-for-its-latest-smartwatch-2000650254</link>
            <guid>1372798</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even Black Friday and Cyber Week deals tend to give the greatest discounts to the one-gen-behind tech devices while keeping the markdowns on the newest releases far more modest. And when a brand-new device does get a big splashy deal, it’s almost always shortlived.</p>
<p>Yet here we are nearly a week after Black Friday, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">one of Apple’s newest smartwatches is still sitting under $200 at Amazon</a>. That’s the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3, which is still $50 below its usual price despite being barely three months old. There’s no catch, no hidden “refurbished” language, or anything else that would give you pause before cashing in and upgrading your exercise tracking, sleep monitoring, and overall smartwatch game for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Upgrade or Starter</h2>
<p>At $200 and with the sturdy construction that Apple puts into all of its smartwatches, the Apple Watch SE 3 is in a unique position where it can be either an upgraded watch for someone with an older model, or an ideal first smartwatch for a younger user. The Apple Watch For Your Kids feature is easily set up on the SE 3, and it lets the wearer call, text, and share their location even if they don’t have an iPhone. They’ll benefit from the all-day 18-hour battery life and rapid recharging just as much as adult wearers, if not more.</p>
<p>As an upgrade on an older smartwatch, the SE 3 brings a wide array of advanced features, most notably in the health and sleep monitoring and tracking departments. The SE 3 monitors the quality and duration of your sleep and gives you an overall sleep score so you can work to maintain or improve it. The smartwatch also gives you alerts if it detects possible sleep apnea, which could give you early detection of a potentially life-threatening condition and allow you to seek treatment.</p>
<p>All of the workout tracking, activity rings, seamless sync of data with an iPhone, and other advanced features that have established the Apple Watch as one of the preeminent health-oriented smartwatches on the market, are present in the SE 3, and in their most recent and advanced forms.</p>



<h2>Easy to See</h2>
<p>The many great features and visuals of the Apple Watch SE 3 are always at the ready, thanks to the 1,000 nits of brightness that come from the OLED Retina display. It also now features Always-On display mode, so you can look down at any time during your workout or run and see your running pace or heart rate, or your text messages and incoming calls.</p>
<p>The 40mm GPS model of the Apple Watch SE 3 continues to defy convention during the holiday shopping season, first by getting a fat $50 price break, and now by keeping it well past Black Friday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">This 20% off deal at Amazon is still going strong, but who knows for how long?</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech Failed to Clear Racing Wheel at Black Friday, Now Liquidating Stock at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-failed-to-clear-racing-wheel-at-black-friday-now-liquidating-stock-at-record-low-2000650485</link>
            <guid>1372783</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday ended three days ago, and Black Friday seems like a long time ago but Amazon still has this bundle at its lowest price ever: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/">Logitech G923 racing wheel with pedals and the separate shifter usually costs $459, but right now it’s only $333</a>.</p>
<p>This is a g<strong>reat gift for people who love racing games</strong> or who are tired of playing Gran Turismo and Forza with a regular controller that doesn’t feel like real driving. The <em>TrueForce</em> force feedback system connects directly to game audio engines to make vibrations and resistance that match what’s happening on screen and it fixes the problem of not being able to feel what you’re seeing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How TrueForce Makes Sim Racing More Fun</h2>
<p>The<strong> G923’s force feedback technology processes game sound up to 4000 times per second</strong> to make the wheel vibrate: You can feel the texture of different road surfaces, the rumble of engine vibrations, and the effect of hitting curbs or going off-track through steering resistance that changes all the time. This is different from older force feedback systems that only reacted to directional forces like crashes or understeer as they missed the small things that make driving feel like you’re in control of the car. The dual-motor system has enough torque to make it feel like you’re steering a heavy load when you’re going fast around a corner, but it still lets you turn smoothly when you’re going slowly.</p>



<p>The <strong>wheel can turn 900 degrees</strong> which is the same amount that real car steering does which means that you are turning the wheel the same amount that you would in a real car, not making big movements. The rim is wrapped in real leather for grip and durability that lasts through long marathon races and the hand-stitching gives it a high-end look that cheap rubber or synthetic materials can’t match. Steel paddle shifters behind the wheel make a satisfying click when you change gears. They are also in a place where your fingers naturally rest while racing. The steel shaft that runs through the center of the wheel hides the force feedback motors which makes a strong connection that sends feedback exactly without any dead zones or flex.</p>
<p>The <strong>pedal set has a progressive brake spring</strong> that makes it harder to push down on the brake pedal, just like real hydraulic brakes that need more pressure to stop faster. This progressive resistance makes it easier to control how hard you brake, which is very important when you want to brake as late as possible without locking the wheels. The throttle and clutch pedals have lighter springs to make them easier to use, and all three pedals have rubber faces with texture that keep your feet from slipping when you drive aggressively.</p>



<p>The <strong>separate shifter makes the experience go from good to great</strong> by giving you a real H-pattern with six speeds and reverse: You can put the shifter exactly where it feels right for you in relation to your wheel and seat because it mounts separately with a desk clamp or screws. The metal shaft and gear mechanism make mechanical clicks and resistance that feel good to use. The whole thing is strong enough to handle rough shifting during competitive racing.</p>
<p>You can <strong>use this with PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Mac</strong> so you don’t have to stick with one platform if you upgrade your hardware or switch between systems. The wheel connects to your computer or console through USB and gets its power from them and you don’t need any extra power supplies or complicated setup beyond putting it on your desk.</p>
<p>This $126 off the bundle is a big savings compared to buying the wheel and shifter separately, where you’d usually pay full price for each part. For less than the cost of the wheel alone at regular price, you get professional-grade sim racing hardware that real racers use in competitive leagues.</p>
