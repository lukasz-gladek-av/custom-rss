              <p data-start="0" data-end="470">If you’ve been considering upgrading your smartphone, now is the perfect time to treat yourself to something fresh and exciting. Amazon has just made it even easier for you to do so, with the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro being offered at some hefty discounts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6590/">The Pixel 10, featuring 128GB of storage, has dropped from $799 to as low as $549</a>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage is now available for just $749, down from its original price of $999.</a></p>
<p data-start="472" data-end="1445">Both the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro come equipped with a 6.3-inch display that boasts a resolution of 1280 x 2856. While this isn’t quite as large as the Pixel XL’s 6.8-inch screen, it still provides an optimal viewing experience, making it perfect for reading tex messages and watching videos alike. The display is bright, vibrant, and remains clear even under direct sunlight. Plus, it supports a smooth 120 Hz refresh rate, which makes gaming and general use feel fluid and responsive. The Pixel 10 Pro is available in a range of colors, and regardless of the option you choose, they are all part of the deal that brings the price down to just $749. For the standard Pixel 10, the frost and obsidian (white and black) colors are available for $599, while the funkier lemongrass and indigo options are discounted by an additional $50, bringing them down to $549. Though, you were likely planning to slap a case on it right away, so who needs to worry about color, right?</p>

<h2 data-start="1447" data-end="1481">Pro-Level Photography Features</h2>
<p data-start="1482" data-end="2068">When it comes to photography, the Pixel 10 Pro stands out with its impressive triple rear camera system. The 50 MP main camera is paired with a 48 MP telephoto lens, offering pro-grade zoom capabilities. You can now take photos or record videos at up to 100x Pro Res Zoom, which delivers the best zoom quality the Pixel series has seen to date. There’s also a 48 MP ultrawide camera that allows for macro focus, making it easy to capture incredibly detailed close-up shots of small subjects. On the front, a 42 MP camera ensures your selfies and video calls are crystal clear and sharp.</p>


<p data-start="2070" data-end="2427">The Pixel 10 Pro also comes with built-in Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, which seems to be getting baked into everything these days whether you want it or not — including in smartphones. Gemini is designed to help by doing things like creating group shots from multiple photos, generating images, summarizing unread emails, and other stuff of the like. It’s powered by Google’s next-gen chip, which enables the phone with the processing power needed to fully utilize AI.</p>
<p data-start="2429" data-end="2784" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">As for cellular service, the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are both unlocked, meaning you can choose the carrier and data plan that best fits your needs—whether that’s Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, or any other major carrier. Currently, you can save up to $250 on either the Google Pixel 10 or Pixel 10 Pro, making this an ideal time to upgrade your device.</p>
