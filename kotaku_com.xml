<p>I’m far from alone in the assertion that <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i> featured some of the best stealth mechanics of the series. Were they packaged with a story and overall level design that did them justice? I say no to that, but I can’t deny that <i>MGSV</i> plays like a dream. Oh, and the plot twist was super neat, for the record.</p> <p>When <i>Delta</i>, the remake of 2004’s <i>Snake Eater</i>, was announced, many an <i>MGS</i> fan hoped that the game would play similarly to <i>MGSV</i>, and would perhaps even run on the celebrated Fox Engine.</p> <p>Folks, I’m here to tell you that’s not the case. As I alluded to in my review of the fancy new remake, <i>Delta</i> plays much like the <i>MGS3</i> you remember from just about any of its re-releases over the years. Plus, it runs on Unreal. And in my experience, that worked out well. I experienced very few technical issues during my time with a pre-release build provided by Konami. I was not thinking about graphics engines; I was fully immersed.</p>

 <p>But let’s have a chat about how this game plays in its moment-to-moment gameplay and put <i>Delta</i> under the microscope to compare it against <i>The Phantom Pain</i> and the original <i>Snake Eater</i> as it exists in the current <i>Master Collection</i>.</p> <h2><span id="movement-and-shooting"></span>Movement and shooting<span></span></h2> <p><i>Delta </i>and <i>MGSV</i> feel very different in motion, but it does feel like there’s a similar animation framework under the hood. <i>Delta</i> has a slower pace to it. <i>MGSV</i>’s Venom Snake is a bit choppier in his movements (not choppy in a bad way, but he has a kind of rigid urgency in how he moves that doesn’t feel present in <i>Delta</i>). Play some animations next to each other and you’ll see similarities, but to me, both with what I can see and what I have felt while playing <i>Delta</i> for 30 hours, the new remake feels smoother even compared to the impressive, and somewhat speedier, gameplay of <i>MGSV</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619227"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619227">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Unlike <i>MGSV</i>, <i>Delta</i> does not feature a sprint option. Snake’s speed when you’re pushing forward on the analog stick (or the W key on keyboard) without using the stalking feature is his top speed. In my opinion, sprint wouldn’t have worked in the remake as the environments are just too small. They feel as dense and lush as a jungle should be, but even compared to those in <i>MGS4</i>, these environments are smaller. It’s a PS2 game after all!</p>

 <p>Snake’s forward roll from the 2000-era <i>MGS</i> games is back and it functions like you remember it. You can roll into enemies to damage them. Rolling is key to non-lethally damaging certain bosses, and is especially important when trying to beat Volgin without “killing” him.</p> <p>Snake can now hop over waist-high cover like in <i>MGSV</i>, something not possible in the original.</p> <p>A very odd, basically insignificant change for all but the most diehard <i>MGS</i> freaks (and I’m one) is that flattening yourself against an opened locker door does not close the door. Does this matter? Here, no. There aren’t many lockers in the jungle. Should we ever see a <i>Delta</i>-fied <i>MGS2</i>, however, I’ll make a case for keeping this quirk in that game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619217"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619217">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Comparing the feeling of guns is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/13u1iyr/the_crocodile_seen_in_mgs3_is_known_as_an_indian/">a tough gavial</a> to wrestle as <i>MGSV</i> features a wildly different palette of weaponry with different ammo counts, even among similar categories. Also, <i>MGSV</i> let you upgrade weapons to improve their performance. No such mechanic exists in <i>Delta</i>. What you find is what you get.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619214"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619214">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Delta</i>’s shooting feels like it splits the difference between the over-the-shoulder standard we see in every damn third-person shooter these days and what exists in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>. You can swap camera orientation to the left or right on the fly, like in <i>MGSV</i>. And the speed of shooting feels a touch closer to <i>MGSV</i>, but only on a very superficial level. It still feels like the pacing of <i>Snake Eater</i>, and you kinda have to play it to really feel what I’m talking about here. You’ll experience this most directly if you get caught and have to shoot your way out of a situation.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619215"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619215">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A non-animation-related change <i>Delta</i> makes from the original concerns how the tranquilizer pistol functions. There’s a distinct bullet (dart?) drop over a distance, Making this pistol dramatically less OP. To me, this is a huge win as the tranquilizer gun, while essential for the series’ meta commentary on violence, made it too easy to quickly put a number of guards to sleep, often diluting the sneaking experience. In <i>Delta</i>, you’re gonna have to get closer to the enemy if you want to put them to sleep without doing a bunch of physics in your head to calculate where that dart is going to land. This makes for a more challenging and immersive experience.</p> <h2><span id="closequarterscombat-(cqc)"></span>Close-Quarters-Combat (CQC)<span></span></h2> <p><i>MGS3</i> introduced CQC to the series, deepening the way you would enter and leave combat. Before this, Snake had a simple punch-punch-kick animation and the ability to flip an enemy or grab them in a chokehold, from which you could either knock them out through strangulation or snap their little digital necks.</p>

 <p><i>MGSV</i> expanded CQC to include all manner of new moves such as throwing an enemy up against a wall, stealing their gun, or going all Neo on a swarm of enemies with a rapid series of punches on multiple targets when surrounded. In <i>Delta</i>, you still get that old familiar punch-punch-kick animation with three taps of the melee button. It feels a little awkward to be honest, being mapped to the right trigger on a controller, but that button serves as your CQC command here, just as it does in <i>MGSV</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619219"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619219">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Snake’s moveset is otherwise just like it was in the original (at least as far as I can tell after 30 hours). You can grab with similar speed and movements; you can toss an enemy down to the ground by combining the CQC button with a directional movement. This feels easier to do in the <i>Remake</i> than it does in the original. Holding enemies up at gunpoint, however, is a little trickier. You have to be <i>real </i>close to do it. I didn’t hold up enemies a whole lot during my playthrough as I found I wasn’t close enough and ended up getting spotted too often. Maybe with future playthroughs I’ll get a better sense of that, but it feels harder than it did in the original, and even compared to <i>MGSV.</i></p> <figure id="attachment_2000619224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619224"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619224">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>CQC in <i>Delta</i> sticks very close to how it was in the original game. There’s a more dramatic flair at work in the animation that can sometimes feel different, but Snake typically grabs and tosses enemies at a similar pace as in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>.</p>

 <h2><span id="it-feels-like-snake-eater,-it-tastes-like-snake-eater-(with-a-bit-of-hot-sauce)"></span>It feels like <i>Snake Eater</i>, it tastes like <i>Snake Eater </i>(with a bit of hot sauce)<span></span></h2> <p>While <i>Delta</i> has clearly taken some cues from <i>MGSV</i>, and maybe it even borrowed some animations here and there, the experience of playing this remake almost never feels like <i>Phantom Pain</i>. Yes, Snake can now crouch walk and transition to crawling in a way that doesn’t exist in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>, but otherwise everything feels like an analog copy of the original. Analog in the sense that it’s not a pure copy, and features a few quirks of its own.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619221"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619221">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When in battle, <i>Delta</i> also feels dramatically more similar to its original in my experience. <i>Phantom Pain</i> is snappier, faster, conceived as a modern third-person shooter. The new camera style of <i>Delta</i> can make things easier (veterans should probably start on Hard mode, as I mentioned in my review), but you’re still in trouble when the enemies spot you and start increasing in number. It is hard, as it was in the original, to shoot your way out of situations. <i>MGSV</i>, in my experience, could let you be more of a bloody menace if you so desired. <i>Delta</i>, however, aims to preserve the outnumbered, outgunned feeling of the original.</p> <p><i>Delta</i>’s unique additions to the <i>Snake Eater</i> formula feel grounded in its roots with gentle modern modifications. A <i>Snake Eater</i> mod of <i>MGSV</i> this is not.&nbsp;So if you’re like me and hold that 2000’s-era <i>MGS</i> experience in high regard, get ready for a wildly satisfying modern tweak of a legendary stealth game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s an exciting time for <i>Metal Gear Solid </i>fans such as myself. We’re not only about to get a remake of one of the best <i>MGS</i> games of all time, but also a new take on the classic stealth gameplay that made it so memorable. Earlier this month, I and several other journalists were invited to a <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> event to get some lengthy time in with the game and to check out the super cool installation at NYC’s Lightbox studio that housed a recreation of the iconic flower bed of the game’s final showdown. Along with Michael McWhertor of <i>Polygon</i> and Destin Legarie of <i>The Destin Channel</i>, I got to chat with <i>Delta</i>’s producers, Noriaki Okamura and Yuji Korekado.</p> <p>What follows is a transcript of our roundtable conversation, with some slight edits for brevity and clarity. Konami provided a translator for our interview.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Michael McWhertor, <i>Polygon</i>:</strong> There’s been a lot of remakes in recent years, especially at Konami, and I wondered when you started working on this project how much you wanted to do this as a reinterpretation, or as a straight remake. Did you wanna add to it? Did you want to make <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> through the lens of 2025? What was that approach like? Was it a straight remake or something else?</p>

 <p><strong>Noriaki Okamura, Producer, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>:</strong> This is something we contemplated at the very beginning when we were starting this project: What would be the best way to do a remake of <i>MGS3</i>? And in those conversations what we ultimately decided on for <i>Delta </i>is [that] the concept of <i>Delta </i>is to be able to have new <i>Metal Gear</i> fans, new<i> Metal Gear </i>players to experience the original as is, as much as possible. Obviously we did the modernization that we need to so that it will be more fluid and more accepting to modern gamers and how they play games but in order for us to respect what was originally great about the game, we wanted to keep it as is as much as possible.</p>  <p><strong>Destin Legarie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL"><i>The Destin Channel</i></a>:</strong> You’ve had a few preview sessions and you’ve gotten some feedback online. What changes have you been able to implement based on that online feedback today?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado, Creative Producer, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>:</strong> So one of the things we did is that, after we announced that we’re gonna do a remake, obviously there were a lot of reactions from a lot of <i>Metal Gear </i>fans and one of the things that really stood out to us is some of the additional modes that were, you know, removed, and because this game has been re-released so many times, and so some of them were they really wanted Snake Versus Monkey back, or, like, the Secret Theater videos back. After we we saw that there’s so much demand for it we decided, OK, what can we do to make those modes come back and what kind of way would be best to bring them back? So we did look into that kind of feedback.</p>

 <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> Specifically, I’ve seen a lot of feedback about some of the facial animations. Has that feedback been taken to heart?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> Yes, we did get that kind of feedback. We heard them loud and clear and especially after we released some of the earlier trailers, that’s definitely something that was pointed out to us and like I said, we want to make sure the experience that we provide in the remake is the same kind of experience that the people who played the original experience had. We wanna make sure that wow factor is still there, so after that we definitely wanted to make sure that the quality is on par to what a <i>Metal Gear </i>game needs to be.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619261"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619261">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Claire Jackson, <i>Kotaku</i>:</strong> What was it like balancing modern stealth mechanics with the stealth challenges of the original game?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> One of the things we did for <i>Delta</i> is to provide two types of what we call “Play Styles.” We have the Legacy Style which you can play kind of with a similar camera and controls as the original, and the new style you can play with more modern controls and a third-person camera setting. And when we allowed that new type of play style, we had to make some adjustments, some rebalancing because the way that you can now see the map changes how you need to hide and what you can see and what you can look out for. So one of the things we changed was the character animation, character motions and also the reactions and the responses of of some of the NPCs, the AI as well, and we needed to do that because allowing a different kind of angle, different kind of play style changes the thrill, the nervousness of needing to hide. So this is something that we had to go back and do a lot of testing with, utilizing modern technology to make it feel [like] that same nervousness as you were playing in the original style, but with a new modern control and camera.</p>

 <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> Do you feel that modernization might make it too easy? Because I remember when [the GameCube remake of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, <i>The Twin Snakes </i>came out, a lot of the criticism was that having that extra perspective made gameplay easier and the game easy.</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> To simply put it, yes, we knew this would happen, obviously. So, we had to do a lot of rebalancing between when you’re playing the Legacy Style versus the New Style, we had to make sure that the difficulty level would still match whatever playstyle you’re playing with and not make things too easy or too difficult.</p>

  <p><strong>Claire Jackson:</strong> Does the team have a preference between the original, overhead camera or or the third person one?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So, for [me] personally, [I love] both. Obviously modern players are more used to the third person camera and you know, specific types of controls. So for [new players] we want them to play with New Style first and because we think that this is the best way for them to get immersed into<i> Metal Gear</i>’s world in that way that they’re more used to. And once they cleared the game it will be fun for them to go back and replay the game in Legacy Style and see, “oh my goodness, there’s a whole new way of playing this game that I didn’t even know about,” so we would love for them to enjoy both Play Styles.</p> <p><strong>Michael McWhertor:</strong> I’m wondering if any technical issues came up developing certain aspects of the game? And I’m specifically thinking about how easy it was on the PlayStation 2 to, say, change the date, on your PlayStation 2 [to defeat the sniper boss, The End], whereas now on a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X or a PC, it’s, it’s more difficult to change the date on your system because it’s connected to the internet, and I’m wondering if you have a technical solution to that issue or if any other technical issues popped up?</p>

 <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So just with how we were able to adapt [the game] to the consoles and platforms back then, we were able to do that for all the the supported platforms that [<i>Delta</i>] is going to come out on today, and you know there’s different features on different types of platforms and features that we wanted to incorporate as well. For instance, we like the [rumble] feedback on the [PS5’s DualSense]. These are the types of things that we did really look into to make sure that we do what we can to best adapt [the game] to modern consoles as much as possible. In terms of technical difficulties, we didn’t really have too much, yeah.</p> <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> I know we’re here for <i>Delta </i>today, and we’re running low on time. I have so much that I want to ask but I would get in trouble if I didn’t ask about <i>Metal Gear </i>[<i>Solid</i>]<i> 4</i>. Is there any hope you can give for fans about <i>MGS4</i> possibly being in Volume 2 [of the <i>Master Collection</i>] or is it being worked on in any capacity?</p> <p><strong>Noriaki Okamura:</strong> This is something that we’re always, always thinking about: What is our next move in terms of the <i>Metal Gear</i> series, and we are aware that a lot of fans really want <i>MGS4 </i>back because it’s currently not playable on any current hardware or platforms, and this is something we do want to address at some point, making sure that fans can have a chance to play it once again. Unfortunately we can’t give you any more details other than that, but yeah, hopefully in the future this is something we can do.</p> <p><strong>Claire Jackson:</strong> Were there any unique challenges or surprises when it came to preserving the cinematic flair of the original [<i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i>]?</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619262"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619262">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So for the cutscenes, we had to remake everything: The character models, the level, the stages, we had to do it all from scratch. And when we did that, one of our concerns was that even though everything looks amazing, if we still kept the same facing, the same camera angles, would it still hold up? And so once everything was done and we decided to create all the cinematics using the same camera, using the same background music, voice acting, we were blown away because the way that [<i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i>] was built originally was already perfect to begin with and the the modern graphics just enhanced that to the fullest. So we were very surprised that, you know, even to this day the way it was originally made was, you know, [it] didn’t need to be retouched.</p>

              <p>I find myself in a simulation of a simulation, a modern recreation of a fictional jungle that I and many others fought and persisted through decades ago. As I crawl through the grass, sneak through Soviet weapons facilities, and survive on the animals of the wild, my mind oscillates through deja vu, the pleasant stupor of nostalgia, and the thrill of a sophisticated stealth experience that challenges my reflexes as well as my ability to plan several steps ahead to stay in control of dangerous situations. An inspired story threads these sneaking sequences together, telling a tale of fractured relationships, the pain they cause, and how grand forces beyond our control shape us. I’ve been here before; I’m struck with a strange feeling of being caught between memory and newness. As I crawl through the mud, I think, is this an authentic experience? Is this a substitute for the “real thing” that came ages ago? I take a step forward. “Huh? Footsteps? Is someone there?” says someone around the corner. It’s time to put those thoughts about reality, simulations, and authenticity to the side; I’ve a mission to complete. Into the fray I go, silently, swiftly, with new, deadly precision.</p> <hr> <p>To remake <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> is an interesting proposition. The winding, cryptic narrative of the <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> series starts with the events of <i>Snake Eater</i>. It’s a prequel, and a well-written, rightly celebrated one at that. It also represents a maturation of the formula series creator Hideo Kojima, along with the team of developers at Konami, started with 1998’s <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. <i>Snake Eater</i> digs deeper into the series’ stealth focus, with enemies more attuned to the sounds of your footsteps and more capable of spotting you from a greater distance. You also have to contend with needs such as hunger and treating your wounds, and using camouflage is essential to staying out of sight.</p> <p>With the games that followed <i>MGS3</i>, the series began to lose much of its identity, becoming less an evolution of the original <i>Metal Gear </i>games that arrived on MSX in the late ‘80s and more a response to the third-person shooters of the Xbox 360 and PS3 era. With <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i>, we drifted even further from the original mold, embracing an open-world format, fracturing the traditional narrative structure many were used to, and perhaps most controversially, replacing the iconic voice of the American version of Snake while eliminating such series’ staples&nbsp; as dedicated “codec” conversations. This fractured series identity is what <i>Delta</i> steps into.</p>

 <p>Fans of that original <i>MGS</i> experience might feel like we’ve lost our way from the kind of stealth and narrative adventures that we cherished so much in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s. <i>Delta</i> arrives as a potential reset for that, and succeeds with flying camo colors as a remarkably faithful remake of one of the all-time greats of our medium.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619271"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619271">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>After <i>MGS2</i>’s switcheroo forced players to contend with a protagonist who, to put it mildly, challenged the masculine archetype the series had centered up to that point, <i>MGS3</i> recenters traditional, Kurt Russell-inspired masculinity, the kind that defines itself through rugged violence essentialized as a struggle against nature; a thing to fight, a thing to kill, a thing to consume. And the women of the game are eager to show as much tits and ass as an M rating would allow at the time.</p> <p><i>MGS3</i>, and by extension <i>Delta</i>, is prone to complicated, often incorrect, assumptions about governments and economic systems, and its wiser moments can all too quickly be overshadowed by the excitement of wielding deadly weapons without caution and smashing up commies in the East. Still, it’s important to see <i>MGS3</i> as a bold reaffirming of what worked in <i>MGS</i> and a rejection of what didn’t, in the eyes of some, in <i>MGS2</i>. <i>Snake Eater</i> would go on to be one of the most celebrated <i>MGS</i> titles. Now we’re here in 2025, and once again <i>Snake Eater </i>exists as a kind of course correction for the series; it’s an opportunity to take the missteps of <i>MGSV</i>, its open-world structure that often felt directionless and bland, its fractured narrative that was hard to parse for a story already playing with some high level concepts, and correct them.</p>

 <p>In doing so, <i>Delta </i>stands to remind us of just how powerful this era of <i>MGS</i> was, when it was laser focused on captivating, linear level structure, along with a story you could enjoy as you would a film, not the disconnected threads that <i>Phantom Pain</i> asked players to stitch together themselves. It also streamlines those aspects of the original that saw you spending much of your time diving through cumbersome menus, and offers a more traditional camera and aiming experience via its “New Style” mode, which the game defaults to. It also, naturally, delivers the high level of graphical fidelity we expect from a modern AAA game, though some purists may take offense at differences in color grading (they should really just go play the original if it bothers them that much). I’d argue this stylistic change is in line with what <i>Snake Eater</i> was always aspiring to, and is in keeping with what Kojima envisioned for the future of the series, which was to bring it even closer to photorealism.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619272" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619272"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619272">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>And so, we come back to Kojima, whose stamp is all over <i>Snake Eater </i>and who is nonetheless conspicuously absent from <i>Delta. </i>To be frank, the lack of Kojima on this project feels weird, even preposterous. Would we accept a <i>Twin Peaks</i> “remake” or fourth season without David Lynch? Would we tolerate a shot-for-shot remake of <i>The Matrix</i> without the participation of the Wachowski sisters? Crazy talk! Would we even want those things if their creators <i>were </i>intimately attached?</p>

 <p>But of course, for all the genius and talent David Lynch gave to <i>Twin Peaks</i>, what would that show be without <a href="https://youtu.be/e-eqgr_gn4k">the incredible compositions of Angelo Badalamenti</a>? Would <i>The Matrix</i> have warped our minds in the same way without <a href="https://youtu.be/jYk0WHcmrYo">the technical and creative genius of John Gaeta</a>, who was able to bring bullet time to life? It is so often the case that the works which we remember and cherish dearly are collaborative works, brought to life by far more than just the director’s name.</p> <p>Video games are no different. While <i>MGS</i> wouldn’t exist without the enthusiastic, eccentric creative energy of Hideo Kojima, it takes far more than one person to build a video game as ambitious as any <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. Major AAA titles are team efforts, and success can never be attributed to any one individual. Who’s to say what <i>MGS</i> would’ve been like if even one other person on the teams that built these games were swapped out?</p>

 <p><i>Delta</i> makes no attempt at hiding the work of Hideo Kojima, with his name showing up a number of times in the opening credits. With very limited exceptions that will certainly be dissected vigorously by the <i>MGS</i> fanbase, the camera work in the cutscenes stays true to that in the original with frightening accuracy. The environment and characters look incredible, conveying well the emotional depth the original aimed for with its lofty cinematic goals. Add the fact that the game uses the original’s voice acting and music, and the combined effect plays a trick on the mind: <i>Delta</i> gave me both the thrills of a modern, polished AAA game and an active dose of nostalgia for the PS2 era in all the best ways.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619273" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619273"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619273">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>When that camera is turned over to you, the default settings give you a different kind of perspective than what <i>Snake Eater</i> originally shipped with. You can freely rotate the camera, you can even move in first person like you could in <i>MGS4 </i>and <i>V</i>, though at a slower pace. You press the left trigger to raise your weapon, you fire it with the right. You reload with a face button.</p>

 <p>For all these modern comforts, however, the game still feels like it’s playing in the world that <i>MGS, Sons of Liberty</i>, and the original <i>Snake Eater</i> built. Smartly, the d-pad becomes of use in a way that preserves the left and right corners of the screen as your dedicated item and weapon management system. Gone is the more <i>Gears of War</i>-esque weapon selection system of <i>The Phantom Pain</i>. Added to this layout is an up-press on the d-pad to scroll through a selection of camo to change outfits way faster than you could in the original. You can also press down on the d-pad to bring up a new codec/radio menu and swiftly hop on a call with the game’s NPCs–and yes, you can still call Para-Medic to save your progress and enjoy snippets of cinema history afterwards.</p> <p>This streamlining takes elements of <i>Snake Eater</i> that once required you to sift through different screens to engage with them and instead places them in the heat of the moment, easier to reach for when you need them. In my experience, this improves the flow of <i>Snake Eater</i>’s gameplay so much that I prefer playing <i>Delta</i> over the original based on this alone. And while I have some serious reservations about the thought of any other <i>MGS</i> game getting remade, I have to say, if it’s going to play like <i>Delta</i>, have at it, Konami! (I will now hide under my desk to avoid getting struck by lightning.)</p> <p>Most mechanics remain largely faithful to the original, rather than undergoing the kind of deep expansion you might expect them to receive in a remake such as this. Close-quarters-combat, for instance, has not been expanded beyond some flashier animations that mostly occur during certain boss fights–one fight in particular relies on these fancier animations instead of a sound cue like the original did. This marks perhaps <i>Delta</i>’s most extreme deviation from the original.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619274" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619274"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619274">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>You can, however, crouch-walk. This was not in <i>MGS</i> DNA until <i>Guns of the Patriots</i>, and it’s a welcome modernization here; moving from cover, crouching, then going to a crawl all feels suitably smooth, sophisticated, and intuitive. It makes for a wildly impressive and immersive stealth experience that demands an adherence to form in the way you approach situations. You need to learn and memorize how best to turn corners, when and where to emerge from tall grass. <i>Snake Eater</i> encourages you to build those best practices, that stealth form, like an athlete training for an event; <i>Delta</i> gives you increased mobility and camerawork to be more immersed in the experience. It can make the game easier, however. With that in mind, I recommend that veterans of the original start on Hard difficulty unless they’re looking for a breezy first trip through.</p> <p>The one downside to the new camera style is that it can, on occasion, feel claustrophobically close. There’s no FOV slider, even on the PC version, and the game’s environments are smaller than what we’re used to in modern shooters.</p> <p>The pacing of the game has not changed much either. Snake moves at about the same speed as he did in the original. No sprint function was added, and things like swimming and wading through mud still feel like a chore. I think Konami could’ve stood to be a bit bolder by speeding that pace up, but it fits with a game that’s already trying to make its combat feel meatier and more impactful than that in a rapid, twitchy shooter. Despite feeling similar to modern games in terms of its controls, <i>Delta</i> also still feels like the original <i>Snake Eater</i>, not an <i>MGS3</i> overhaul mod for <i>MGSV</i> or something. Indeed, it feels more like classic <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> than any <i>MGS</i> game has in decades, without feeling like a retro throwback that requires a rewiring of your brain.</p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>Same great snake taste you love, now with four times the pixels!</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Konami</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person stealth action game.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Faithful recreation of a classic, wonderfully improved controls.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Lack of an FOV slider, some slower elements of the original remain.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms: </p>                 <p>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs (played).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>August 28, 2025 (playable on August 26 for those who pre-order the deluxe version).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>30 hours on a non-lethal, never-spotted run on the game’s Hard difficulty setting using the “New Style” camera.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p>That extends to the menu systems, which have all of the character and detail that they exuded in the original. Eat a snake, and you’ll sometimes see a little cutscene of our protagonist chowing down, followed up by the sound of him chewing, swallowing, and commenting on how tasty it was. The game will play the audio every time you eat, as it did in the original. The remake could’ve given us an option to skip as it does feel a little tedious and repetitive when you’re more than a dozen hours into the game.</p>

 <p><i>MGS3</i> was always far from my favorite <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. It lacked <i>MGS2</i>’s fourth-wall-breaking meta stuff that had me captivated, putting me in a weird liminal space where I obsessed about what the purpose of a “sequel” even is. Its plot twists, in my opinion, don’t match up to the wild revelations of the first <i>MGS</i> or, for that matter, those of <i>MGSV</i> later on. And its survival mechanics always slowed the action down too much for me. But <i>Delta</i> really helped me appreciate what this game is by breaking down the rigid barriers of the original’s menu-diving while giving me a more sophisticated set of movement options and camera controls. And the game is visually impressive not just because it’s a modern-day AAA game with the horsepower of our modern consoles and GPUs. There’s real care in the presentation, from the improved fidelity of facial animations to carry those wonderfully well-written lines of dialogue, to bits of grass, leaves, and sticks getting stuck to your clothes and falling off as you move around. <i>Delta</i>’s graphics got more than a few “wows” out of me.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619275"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619275">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve got my critiques of that 2004 premiere of Snake in the jungle, but there’s no denying that the original <i>Snake Eater</i> will remain one of the greatest games of all time and people should play it if they care about the history of this medium, and to see how the now humble processing power of the PS2 was pushed to its extreme to tell a captivating story about shifting allegiances, broken relationships, and the threat we humans pose to ourselves by using our intellect to build super weapons. For those returning to this jungle, expect a faithful and respectful rearticulation of a game you loved–and if you didn’t love it, maybe the slight modernizations will win you over as they did for me.</p>

 <p>Should someone come across <i>Snake Eater</i> for the first time with <i>Delta</i>, they’ll find a phenomenal modern stealth experience housed in the kind of classic narrative and linear structure that modern games have been neglecting far too often in their quests to make their worlds bigger. <i>Delta </i>knows its subject matter can stimulate the imagination, and no piece of silicon can out muscle that.</p> <p><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater </i>modernizes the classic mechanics of the original while preserving the breathlessly tense feeling of its stealth gameplay, and its painstakingly accurate recreation of the original’s aesthetic and vibrantly beating cinematic heart preserve so much of why these games have withstood the test of time. Should <i>Delta </i>be not just a one-off but the dawn of a new generation for <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, it’s a promising one indeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cracker Barrel is changing its iconic and famous logo for the first time in nearly 50 years. Sadly, the new logo sucks, and is part of a larger trend of corporations ditching their unique qualities and going as broad as possible in order to make the line go up. And somehow this new boring logo, according to chuds online, is <em>also</em> an example of “<a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901">going woke</a>.” Folks, it’s a mess out there.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/cracker-barrel-cbrl-new-logo-branding.html">On August 19, Cracker Barrel announced</a> that it was ditching its <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/20/lifestyle/cracker-barrel-introduces-controversial-new-logo-and-menu-changes/">48-year-old logo</a> featuring a man sitting next to a barrel. Instead, the restaurant that specializes in “Southern comfort food” has replaced the well-known logo with a new one that is simply a yellow shape with the Cracker Barrel name slapped on it. It’s the kind of thing that I could whip up in Photoshop in under five minutes, though I wouldn’t get paid the likely tens of thousands of dollars (or more) that the people who actually created the new logo received.</p> <p>There’s no way around it: The new logo is boring, bland, and bad. People hate it. You don’t have to look hard to find plenty of people online sharing negative thoughts on the new, modernized logo. It’s also part of a larger, less talked-about rebrand that has been happening at Cracker Barrel over the last year or so, with old restaurants ditching their rustic look for chic white walls and modern design touches.</p>

 <p>“Our story hasn’t changed. Our values haven’t changed,” <a href="https://www.crackerbarrel.com/newsroom/news-releases">said Cracker Barrel’s CMO Sarah Moore</a>. “With ‘All the More,’ we’re honoring our legacy while bringing fresh energy, thoughtful craftsmanship and heartfelt hospitality to our guests this fall.”</p> <p>The reality is that Cracker Barrel’s “story” has changed, because it is now 2025 and it’s a publicly traded company. In this day and age, you can’t just be a successful restaurant that grandparents bring their grandkids to so they can share stories from “back in my day…” over large portions of so-so comfort food. You can’t just be a profitable company. You have to grow. You must always grow. The stockholders demand it. They’ll cut your head off and replace you if there isn’t steady, never-ending growth. Making that line go up is all that matters, and if that means ditching a classic logo that might have put off some younger eaters, &nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">or laying off people endlessly,</a> so be it. Instead of trying to be one thing for some people, Cracker Barrel and other companies desperate to grow must be many things to everyone. And in trying to appeal to all, Cracker Barrel has stripped itself of its famous logo and unique characteristics, which makes it hard to justify going there for a meal.</p> <h2>Cracker Barrel, Welcome To The Culture War</h2> <p>But of course, also because it is 2025, this logo change can’t just be something we all look at, shake our heads at, maybe make a few jokes or comments about, and then move on from. Nope! Changing the logo has set off a firestorm online among chuds and weirdos, with <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1958279379408372204">one of President Trump’s sons</a> complaining about the change as an example of a company “going woke.”</p>

You’re about to learn that wokeness really doesn’t pay.” Over on the Cracker Barrel subreddit, which is a thing even if it has a very tiny community, you can find a strange mix of people complaining about food while sharing memes calling the food joint “Cucker Barrel.”</p> <p>“I think it’s time for the Employees and Customers to Stand Up. Go Woke Go Broke,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackerBarrel/comments/1mvv0n8/i_think_its_time_for_the_employees_and_customers/">said one poster</a>. Another person shared a petition to fire the CEO of Cracker Barrel over the changes. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/fire-the-ceo-and-restore-cracker-barrel-s-classic-look-and-rustic-feel?recruiter=326443188&amp;recruited_by_id=0e810e00-19b2-11e5-a5a1-cdf6156a9733&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=starter_onboarding_share_social&amp;utm_medium=mobileNativeShare">The petition had one signature</a>, and the poster had 0 upvotes.</p>

 <p>To be clear, I don’t think Cracker Barrel changing a logo is “going woke,” whatever that idiotic complaint means today. Nor do I think it’s an attack on old American values. I do, however, think Cracker Barrel’s simplified logo and shift to more sterile-looking dining rooms are bad and frustrating. I don’t want everything to be targeted to everyone with no distinct traits or features. I’d like to have the choice to go to a place that is filled with old-timey decorations and a charming logo from the ’70s.</p> <p>Also, Cracker Barrel, a few logo changes and some white walls aren’t going to trick me or younger people into eating there. I say lean into your clientele and make the menus cursive and put rotary phones on each table that you have to use to order your food. Give those grandparents even more stuff to point at and go, “Oh, I bet you don’t know what that is!” while their young grandkids roll their eyes.&nbsp; Not everything needs to appeal to the masses. That’s how you end up with boring Marvel movies and dull games that are overstuffed with every feature you can think of. And that sounds like a terrible future.</p>
