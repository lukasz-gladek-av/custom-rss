Games San Diego. WB also revealed that it was canceling Monolith’s <em>Wonder Woman</em> game, too. Many online were angry and sad about Monolith’s shutdown as the studio had been around since the ‘90s and had produced some beloved games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gamings-greatest-unsung-heroine-695285585&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gamings-greatest-unsung-heroine-695285585"><em>No One Lives Forever</em></a></span><em>, Blood, </em>and <em>FEAR.</em> Some of Monolith’s classic PC games are hard to play in 2025 for various reasons. But hopefully, that will change soon, thanks to GOG. </p><p>On Wednesday, digital game marketplace GOG (previously known as Good Old Games) announced that next month it will add spooky FPS <em>FEAR </em>and its two expansions to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG Preservation Program</a></span>.

To honor their legacy, we’re proud to announce that <em>F.E.A.R. Platinum</em> will be joining the GOG Preservation Program—and sooner than planned, with other Monolith icons to join eventually as well.”</p><p>GOG further added that it will have more news to share about its wonderful preservation efforts tomorrow, February 27. </p><p>So what other Monolith games might be coming to GOG’s program soon? Well, there’s one title a lot of people want: <em>No One Lives Forever</em>.

Unfortunately, based on a follow-up post shared by GOG asking people to vote for <em>No One Lives Forever </em>on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.co/8lqIoZckdm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.co/8lqIoZckdm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preservation Program’s Dreamlist</a></span>, it seems unlikely that <em>NOLF </em>or <em>NOLF 2</em> will be coming to GOG’s program anytime soon.</p><p>Still, it’s nice to see GOG doing the work to preserve and save gaming history even as corporate overlords and terrible executives continue to destroy and gut the video game industry. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
