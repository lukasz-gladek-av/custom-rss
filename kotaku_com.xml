However, I’ve spotted these games appearing in different parts of the store while looking for other stuff. And I can only imagine how many younger kids are searching up some of those “Italian Brainrot” memes and buying games based on them. Many of these titles featuring AI art are priced very low. <em>Tralalero Tralala Jumper,</em> for example, is only 50 cents. </p><p>I’m honestly baffled as to why Sony is letting this stuff live on the PlayStation Store next to big games like <em>God of War</em> and indie darlings like <em>Blue Prince.</em> It makes the store feel less like a curated collection of great games and more like a landfill where anyone can dump their garbage. It took me just a few minutes to locate dozens of these games, and it seems wild to me that Sony doesn’t have a few people on staff going through and deleting some of the most egregious crap on the store. </p><p>If something isn’t done soon I wouldn’t be surprised if this AI slop becomes a bigger problem, with more and more folks stumbling upon this junk as they shop the PlayStation Store. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494]]></content:encoded>

Once there, he sees the stakes are very high because everyone else is super-powered and does super cool stunts and shit, and he’s just an actor who did those things in movies. So he says “fuck that,” but it looks like Raiden will bring him around by pointing out that the tournament will decide the fate of Earth. </p><p>Other newcomers joining the cast alongside Urban include Adeline Rudolph as Kitana and <em>The Last of Us</em> star Tati Gabrielle as Jade. Beyond the newbies, there are several returning characters from the 2021 film, including Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion. He ends the trailer with the character’s signature “get over here!” line and the crowd goes wild. Keep your popcorn in its bucket when the movie premieres on October 24, though.

The first movie had its share of martial arts fighting scenes, but they were spread out across a movie with a lot of talking.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-2-karl-urban-johnny-cage-first-trailer-1851786495]]></content:encoded>
