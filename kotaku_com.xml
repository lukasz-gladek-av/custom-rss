On the Dew Drinkers Discord and Mountain Dew subreddit, you can often spot people sharing photos of their collections. Because there are so many variants of Mountain Dew and some of them are rarer than others, collecting all of them, just the super-rare versions, or simply one’s personal favorites has become a big part of the community. </p><p>Some of these collectors empty the cans and bottles out, displaying them like figurines or pieces of art. But others keep the liquid in the containers, sometimes drinking them years later with mixed results. And one of these collectors, West_Yogurtcloset497 on Reddit, had the worst thing happen to him recently when a single, unnoticed leaky can caused a devasting chain reaction. </p><h2 id="h2772913"><a id=""></a>A Mountain Dew disaster</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On March 9</a></span>, West_Yogurtcloset497—who has been collecting Dew for about three years—checked on his collection of Mountain Dew cans still sitting comfortably in their boxes. What he discovered was horrible. The boxes were soaked and dozens and dozens of cans were leaking. </p><p>“There was a pool of [Mountain Dew] Maui Burst on the floor,” West_Yogurtcloset497 told <em>Kotaku</em> via DMs. “I thought my cat had peed there. I cleaned it up and went about my day. The next day, the [puddle] was there and I investigated.”</p><p>However, it wasn’t cat urine that he had found. Instead, his collection of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-true-crime-story-of-a-gamefaqs-user-who-just-wanted-1847161600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-true-crime-story-of-a-gamefaqs-user-who-just-wanted-1847161600">Mountain Dew</a></span> cans were leaking soda all over each other and the wall. According to the collector, he’d had most of those cans for about a year and had been storing them in his room while he went to college about two hours away, which made it hard for him to check on the collection. And despite keeping the cans upright, a tactic used by many collectors to avoid blowouts caused by weight crushing the weaker sides of the cans, a leak ruined everything. </p><figure id="" data-id="dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-recommend-id="image://dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->West_Yogurtcloset497 / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-recommend-id="image://dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Presumably, one can from the very top was faulty out of the factory, and leaked,” explained the collector. “The acid decayed the other cans causing them to leak, which exponentially killed more and more cans over the months.”</p><p>After discovering the soda destruction—the collector says he lost about 100 to 125 cans—and cleaning up the sugary mess, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West_Yogurtcloset497 posted images</a></span> of what happened on the Mountain Dew subreddit, adding: “PSA Check up on your cans frequently and make sure they are stored correctly.”</p><h2 id="h2772914"><a id=""></a>Community reactions and the future</h2><p>In the comments below, people commiserated with the collector about his loss and shared similar stories of times they were screwed over by a leaky can or bottle.

It tasted like metal and got flu like symptoms a day after.” </p><p>I asked West_Yogurtcloset497 if he drank any of the leaky cans before throwing them away. “Nah. No telling how long some of them were open.” He did try some of the cans that survived the Dew-pocalypse and says they were still carbonated and tasted “fine.” </p><div><p>Thankfully, due to cold weather, his room wasn’t filled with ants or other bugs and there wasn’t a nasty smell. However, he did confirm that his wall is ruined and will need to be cleaned and fixed up. As for the future, the collector tells me that he will continue to store cans, but has learned a valuable lesson in how to do so properly. </p><p>“[I won’t] keep the cans in the boxes anymore,” said West_Yogurtcloset497. “And make sure to check on them frequently. I knew cans eventually leak, but I had no idea that a single leaking can could kill most of my can collection.” </p></div><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This 2024 colorful 2.5D  platformer is easily of one of the best “metroidvania” games released in years, and it’s definitely one of Ubisoft’s best games in recent memory. It plays wonderfully, looks amazing, runs like a dream, and has some memorable boss fights.  It’s also not massive. Most people can finish it in under 18 hours. Seriously, check this one out later this month on either PS4 or PS5. </p><p>Meanwhile, if you want to see where the<em> Armored Core</em> franchise started, the first three PS1-era games will be added to PS Plus Premium later this month. I have fond memories of fighting my brother in <em>Armored Core</em>’s demo, but never actually played the full game. Perhaps I’ll give them a shot later this March. </p><p>Remember, to access, download, and play these games you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber. And if your subscription runs out in the future, you’ll no longer be able to play these games.</p><hr><p>Anyway, here’s the full list of games being added to PS Plus and its various tiers next week:</p><h2 id="h30969"><a id=""></a><strong>PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>UFC 5</em></strong><em> | </em>PS5</li><li><strong><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown </em></strong><em>| </em>PS5, PS4</li><li><strong><em>Arcade Paradise </em></strong><em>| </em>PS5, PS4</li><li><strong><em>You Suck at Parking </em></strong><em>| </em>PS5, PS4</li><li><strong><em>Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions </em></strong><em>| </em>PS4</li><li><strong><em>Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy </em></strong><em>| </em>PS5, PS4</li><li><strong><em>Bang-On Balls: Chronicles </em></strong><em>| </em>PS5, PS4</li><li><strong><em>Syberia: The World Before</em></strong><em> | </em>PS5, PS4</li></ul><h2 id="h30970"><a id=""></a><strong>PlayStation Plus Premium</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Arcade Paradise VR</em></strong> | PSVR2</li><li><strong><em>Armored Core</em></strong><em> (PS1 Classic) | </em>PS5, PS4</li><li><strong><em>Armored Core: Project Phantasma </em></strong><em>(PS1 Classic)</em>&nbsp;<em>| </em>PS5, PS4<br></li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Armored Core: Master of Arena </em></strong><em>(PS1 Classic)| PS5, PS4</em></li></ul><p><em> .</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
