              <p>If you want to enjoy your favorite titles on the go without compromising on performance, you need a solid gaming laptop. The best ones out there offer a balanced combination of power, sufficient RAM and storage, plus a high refresh rate display. Of course, as you’d expect, such options don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $2,000 for a machine this capable. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5414/">Amazon is now offering the latest 14-inch Razer Blade gaming laptop for $1,800, after a nice 14% off its regular price of $2,100</a>. We know it’s still an investment even at its discounted rate, but definitely one that’s worth it, considering all the features you’re getting here. It’s an early Black Friday deal, but we can’t say how long it’ll stick around. If it’s been on your radar, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5414/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Superior Performance for Both Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop packs the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, paired with 115W TGP and DLSS 4 support for higher quality frames and immersive visuals that can bring any scene to life. It’s powered by AMD’s new Ryzen AI 9&nbsp;365 processor, which offers up to 50 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) and delivers 200% more AI processing power than the previous Blade 14. This translates into much better overall performance, especially if you’re working with AI tools that usually demand a lot from your system. This also makes the laptop a great option for creatives who frequently use resource-intensive programs for their projects.</p>
<p>Then there’s 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM running at 8000MHz for faster multitasking, as well as a 1TB SSD to store everything you own.</p>



<p>As for the visuals, you’re getting a 14-inch 3K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 0.2ms response time. It’s not the biggest screen out there, but it’s spacious enough to enjoy your games without feeling cramped. The display is also Calman Verified, which means it’s going to ensure accurate color reproduction consistently. You can expect visuals to look exactly how the creator intended, whether you’re gaming or streaming your favorite show.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the laptop is quite lightweight and compact. The vapor chamber cooling system keeps it cool during long gaming sessions without sacrificing performance. And speaking of extended use, the 72Wh battery offers up to 11 hours of usage on a single charge. You can go an entire day without worrying about plugging it in!</p>

With <i>Arc</i>’s all-time concurrent player count hitting 462,488 at the time of this writing,&nbsp;the survival-based PvPvE shooter’s player peak outstrips&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Helldivers 2</i>‘s top count of 458,709 by just a few thousand players. And with the game holding at 208,000 concurrent Steam players at the time of writing, it doesn’t look like it’s going to stop for a breather.</p>

 <p><i>Helldivers 2</i> wasn’t the only shooter surpassed by <i>Arc Raiders</i> this weekend. <i>Battlefield 6</i> was also left behind as Embark Studios’ new shooter hit the cherished number-three spot in <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">Steam’s most-played games</a>, behind <i>Dota 2</i> and <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> (like breaking the laws of thermodynamics, it would take an act of god to see those two games dethroned for any meaningful amount of time).</p>

 <h2>Bitter PvP skirmishes aren’t souring the fun of <i>Arc Raiders</i></h2> <p>Prior to its launch, it was natural to be skeptical of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ potential to appeal to a wider crowd than previous games in its genre have. Extraction shooters haven’t been the smash hit that, say, battle royales or even hero shooters have been, and for some players the PvP element of <i>Arc Raiders</i> can make for a disruptive, uncomfortable experience.</p>

   <p>But as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oncgsr/i_mean_this_in_the_most_respectful_way_possible/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a recent Reddit post</a> with over 9,000 (sorry) upvotes confirms, fans of the extraction shooter are eager to accept the brutal, sometimes unfair-feeling outcomes that spontaneous PvP can generate, especially when those encounters involve extraction camping, which is when folks intentionally wait for others to extract before jumping them when they least expect it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-skills-mobility-survival-conditioning-solo-2000641789"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Best Skills For Solo And Team Play</a></p> <p>On said Reddit post, many are chiming in about alternative strategies for dealing with extraction campers, namely the use of escape hatches which you can either find or craft keys for. This, I’d wager, is a perfect example of why I think <i>Arc Raiders</i> is proving such a hit: The game is eager to help you find ways to get around uncomfortable situations. On top of its varied progression systems, <i>Arc Raiders</i> asks players to invest in strategic solutions to difficult problems and it seems to be working out well.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Last week, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-funko-pops-astarion-shadowheart-karlach-1851676142">Funko Pop company</a> hit investors with a dramatic disclosure. “There is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months,” it revealed in its latest quarterly <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001704711/83187cc3-3ab8-4098-bc5f-cb16ca0775c6.pdf">earnings report</a>. This is the company warning that it’s at increasing risk of defaulting on its loans. How much is that? Roughly $241 million. I don’t think the banks will accept payment in the form of <em>One Piece</em> Funko Pops.</p>

 <p>The company revealed that it amended its credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank back in July in an effort to waive certain requirements and buy time in order to refinance its debt under more manageable terms. That sounds reasonable and the company is certainly spinning this situation as business as usual, but it’s also saying, in no uncertain terms, that there’s a decent chance it won’t be able to pay out everyone it owes by the end of the next 12 months unless something big changes.</p>

 <p>“I want to reiterate the sense of urgency and opportunity around our Make Culture Pop strategy, executing across the intersection of culture, creativity, and commerce,” Josh Simon, who just joined as CEO in September after five years at Netflix, said during <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-funko-beats-eps-forecast-stock-dips-in-q3-2025-93CH-4340543">the latest earnings call</a>. “In the short term, I’m looking to maintain the momentum [the chief financial officer] discussed.”</p>

  <p>He continued, “Over the long term, what’s most exciting to me, and I hope is equally exciting to our investors, are the multiple opportunities to transform the company for substantial growth. We have a strategic advantage from building this company over the last 27 years, and we intend to leverage that legacy and relationship with our community of fans to take advantage of the huge opportunity in the increasingly global world of entertainment and pop culture fandom.”</p>

 <p>Who doesn’t love “multiple opportunities to transform the company for substantial growth”?</p> <p>But the numbers are bad. Funko Pop lost $1 million last quarter, a harsh drop from the over $8 million in profit it made a year ago. Why is <a href="https://kotaku.com/rare-funko-pop-willy-wonka-golden-ticket-holy-grail-1850683490">the collectible company</a> tumbling off a cliff? You might think it has something to do with losing certain big licenses to competitors or flooding the market with way more junk than even the most die-hard fans are willing to absorb, but the biggest kiss of death came back in the spring in the form of President Trump’s trade war. Tariffs hit sales of cheap toys manufactured overseas hard.</p>

 <h2>Funko mystery boxes to the rescue</h2> <p>The company claims that’s all in the past, however, and the new CEO is touting a big anticipated boost from the upcoming releases of <em>Stranger Things</em>‘ final season&nbsp;and <em>Wicked: For Good</em>. He was also very proud of Funko’s recent Dodgers Championship Five Pack, which he attributed to the company’s new “quick strike” team that can essentially take any major pop culture event in the world and merchandize it at warp speed.</p>

 <p>By far my favorite secret Funko strategy to not go bankrupt is its new Bitty line of mini-figures. That’s right. The company’s brilliant maneuver in its time of distress is just making Funkos smaller and combining them with loot boxes. “We are also planning new innovative retail experiences, such as selling Bitty Pop products through vending machines with a surprise or mystery element to the purchase experience,” the executive team said during the call last week. Inspired!</p> <p>Will Funko still be around in five years? Will it be be acquired by another toy company or chopped up for parts in a private equity buyout? It’s hard to day. One thing’s for certain, though: the plastic faces it has littered across shelves <a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-spider-man-harry-potter-post-malone-pokemon-1850178280">and landfills</a> will remain with us for decades if not centuries to come.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-max-is-going-for-pennies-now-the-cheapest-vacuum-and-mop-from-the-prestigious-brand-2000642382</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping the floors clean with pets constantly shedding or kids bringing in dirt is a never-ending chore that consumes precious free time. The <strong>Roborock Q7 Max+</strong> tackles this daily struggle head-on, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">and it’s currently hitting an all-time low of just $219 on Amazon, slashed from its original $429 price</a>. This is the most affordable entry point into Roborock’s premium robot vacuum lineup and it <strong>still includes the self-emptying docking station</strong> that higher-end models boast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Premium Features at an Entry-Level Price</h2>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction power</strong> puts this vacuum in serious performance territory, generating enough force to pull embedded pet hair from carpet fibers and lift stubborn debris from hard floors in a single pass. That suction strength matters greatly when you have to deal with the fine dust that settles into textured surfaces or the heavier particles that accumulate along baseboards and in corners. The<strong> edge-cleaning design</strong> ensures the vacuum captures debris right up to walls and furniture legs, eliminating those frustrating dust lines that cheaper robots leave behind.</p>



<p>The<strong> dual anti-tangle system</strong> solves one of the most frustrating problems with robot vacuums: the constant need to stop and cut hair wrapped around brushes. The main brush on the <em>JawScraper</em> features a design that actively resists hair entanglement, while the side brush boasts a 0% hair-tangling rate even with long-haired pets or family members who shed constantly. This engineering improvement translates into fewer maintenance interruptions and more consistent cleaning performance. You can go several weeks without having to flip the robot over and go through the annoying process of cutting hair free from brush rollers.</p>



<p>Th<strong>e RockDock Plus self-emptying station elevates this vacuum from a good deal to an exceptional one</strong>. With a 2.7-liter sealed dust bag that holds up to seven weeks of dirt, pet hair, and other debris, you empty the system roughly twice a quarter, not after every cleaning session. The sealed bag does not allow dust to escape when finally needing to replace the bag so allergy sufferers are protected from the collected allergens being reintroduced into the air.</p>
<p>The integrated vacuum and mopping function covers the complete floor cleaning equation in one device: After it vacuums up dry debris, <strong>the mop functionality follows through with the ability to take on stuck-on spills and paw prints</strong>. Three adjustable water flow settings let you adjust the amount of moisture based on your floor type and just how dirty they’ve gotten-from light dampening during daily maintenance to heavier flow for deeper cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>LiDAR navigation accurately maps your home which is a far cry from what can be achieved with budget robots relying on simple bump sensors. The laser-based mapping creates a detailed floor plan that the robot then uses to calculate the most efficient cleaning path, covering every accessible area without redundant passes or missed spots. Real-time mapping updates when the robot discovers new obstacles or you have rearranged furniture, thus adapting to the changes in your home layout automatically.</p>
<p>For $219, this Roborock Q7 Max+ brings flagship features to midrange pricing and opens premium automated cleaning to households that may otherwise find these systems too expensive.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-springing-a-surprise-showcase-on-fans.1348657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony has announced its next State of Play showcase, spotlighting upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pc-cross-buy-leak-sony-handheld-ps6-2000641324"><span>PlayStation 5 games</span></a><span>. However, this one will be a little bit different when it premieres tomorrow, as it will specifically highlight games from Japanese developers, and thus will only be streamed in Japanese with English subtitles.</span></p>

 <p><span>The State of Play Japan stream will take place tomorrow, November 11, at 2 p.m. PT /&nbsp; 5 p.m. ET /&nbsp; 11 p.m. CEST, and will be hosted by Japanese voice actor Yuki Kaji, known for his roles in the </span><i><span>Ys</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>series overseas. According to a post on the </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/"><span>PlayStation Blog</span></a><span>, the 40-minute show will focus on games from developers in Japan, as well as Asian studios more broadly, and will have a spread of both “beloved series” and independent projects. Sometimes, when companies put on streams like a State of Play or a Nintendo Direct, Japan will get a different version than the one we see in English-speaking territories, but it sounds like this show will be the same across Japanese and English streams. The show will be featured on PlayStation’s YouTube channel.</span></p>

 <p><span>The blog doesn’t get into any specifics about what games will be shown, but Kaji hosting does make me wonder if we might hear more about the next </span><i><span>Ys</span></i><span> game. </span><i><span>Ys X: Proud Nordics</span></i><span>, an enhanced port of the original </span><i><span>Ys X</span></i><span>, was released earlier this year on Switch 2, so perhaps it might come to the PS5 when it launches in English next year. Or maybe a new </span><i><span>Ys </span></i><span>could be on its way? But that’s just me speculating.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, based on the show’s premise, we might not hear much from PlayStation’s internal studios because most of its first-party dev teams are based outside of Japan these days ever since Sony shuttered Japan Studio. Team Asobi operates out of Tokyo, but given that it just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a><span> last year, it’s probably too early for that team to deliver anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
