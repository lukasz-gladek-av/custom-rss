              <p>The <strong>combination of LEGO and Minecraft naturally resonates with kids</strong> who grew up building virtual worlds block by block and now get to recreate those experiences with physical bricks. Judging by the o<strong>ver 40,000 units Amazon moved</strong> since this deal went live, this partnership seems to be a massive success and proves that the iconic Creeper mob translated into 665 pieces hits differently when priced right.</p>
<p>And the good news is that Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5126/"> dropped this buildable Minecraft figure to $31 from its usual $39 for Black Friday</a>, which marks a record low that makes this detailed construction set affordable instead of something parents bookmark and forget.</p>

<h2>Favorite LEGO Minecraft Set</h2>
<p>The <strong>665-piece build provides hours of satisfaction</strong> without being overly complex or tedious, as with many repetitive builds. You build up the Creeper’s iconic, pixelated look brick by brick, reproducing the blocky aesthetic of the original mob that defined Minecraft’s look and made it so unmistakable across all gaming culture.</p>
<p><strong>Four poseable legs</strong> let you adjust from menacing walk to explosive lunge for added play value beyond simple display, allowing builders to create dynamic poses that match their vision. A<strong> detachable head</strong> reveals a surprise compartment inside and contains a first-version Minecraft mini-figure and TNT element which adds an element of discovery for when the builder explores the model beyond surface-level construction.</p>



<p>The <strong>finished model stands over 8 inches tall</strong>, and provides enough physical presence to command attention on shelves or desks without dominating entire rooms like some massive Lego sets that require dedicated display furniture. Color accuracy matches the Creeper’s green and black color scheme perfectly and uses the right shades that</p>
<p>The early version of the mini-figure included represents early Minecraft character designs and adds collectible value for fans appreciative of the game’s evolution and history. The TNT element references the Creeper’s explosive nature, the defining trait that made this mob so terrifying to encounter in-game and so iconic within gaming culture. These small touches speak to attention to Minecraft lore rather than slapping the brand name on generic building sets, rewarding fans who get the reference and appreciate authentic representation.</p>



<p>Construction follows LEGO’s typical excellent quality in its instruction, with clear numbered steps and visual diagrams that preclude confusion and minimize frustration. <strong>Young builders aged 10 and up</strong> can complete this independently, though the complexity level provides enough challenge to keep the build engaging rather than mindlessly simple. The finished Creeper serves as both a building accomplishment and a gaming tribute, bridging physical and digital play in ways that resonate with kids who live in both worlds.</p>
<p>At $31 instead of $39, you save $8 on a LEGO Minecraft set that provides authentic mob representation, interactive poseable elements, hidden surprises, and display-worthy construction at a price that makes gift-giving or self-purchasing financially painless.</p>

              <p>Beats — owned by Apple — makes some of our favorite audio solutions out there. The audio quality is impressive, and the headphones play nicely with both iOS and Android devices. If you’ve been looking to grab a new pair, we come bearing great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5945/">Thanks to Black Friday, Amazon is currently offering a massive 57% discount on the premium Beats Studio Pro, which brings the price down to $150 from $350.</a> Prime members can save an additional $13 with free delivery. It’s one of the hottest deals on the retailer right now and is selling out fast. We recommend jumping in on it before the price shoots back up to the not-so-friendly $350 tag.</p>

<h2>Three Sound Profiles, Two Listening Modes</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, Beats stuck to its typical over-ear design with these, which is not a bad thing. The upgraded UltraPlush over-ear cushions flaunt premium, engineered leather designed for all-day comfort. Pressure is distributed evenly across both sides with the headband, making it easier to have these on for hours without feeling uneasy. Survive longer commutes, take back-to-back meetings, or just push through a busy day without constantly adjusting them or taking them off to let your ears breathe.</p>
<p>Comfort alone can’t do it all, which is why sound quality is just as top-notch. The brand claims the Beats Studio Pro are its most powerful, precise over-ear headphones to date, and we don’t doubt that. Rich, balanced sound comes from upgraded drivers with a two-layer diaphragm, refined micro-venting, and 25% stronger magnetics that reduce distortion to zero, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. Three distinct sound profiles take customization to a whole new level. There’s the signature profile to deliver a balanced output, the entertainment profile for a more immersive streaming experience, and the conversation profile for clearer calls or podcasts.</p>



<p>Listening modes include Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. The adaptive ANC is smart enough to monitor the sound around you and create a precisely-tuned filter to cancel it out. It’s great for when you want to focus on a task, or just feel the tunes down to your bones without background distractions. Of course, you can’t always afford to zone out. In public settings where you’d rather stay a bit more aware, the transparency mode lets some outside in. You’ll be able to hear when the barista calls your name, hold quick conversations with a polite thank you and please, plus stay alert to traffic.</p>
<p>High-fidelity output is supported via USB-C, while a Theatre-like, 3D sound is made possible with spatial audio. The latter places the sound all around you, making it feel like you’re surrounded by 64 speakers at once. Switching between both modes and managing music couldn’t be easier. Multi-function on-ear controls let you do all that with just a few taps; no need to pull your phone out.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge lets you vibe to your favorite songs for up to 40 hours in one go. No sweat when you’re running low, either. Plug these in for 10 minutes and enjoy up to 4 additional hours of jamming. Beats Studio Pro work well with both iOS and Android devices, so compatibility won’t be an issue, as well. The box comes with the headphones, a woven carrying case, a 3.5mm audio cable, a universal USB-C charging cable, a quick Start Guide, and a warranty Card. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5945/">This deal takes a whopping $200 off the usual price of the Beats Studio Pro, placing them in a much more affordable range. Get yours fast, and discounts on this massive tend to expire quickly.</a></p>
