              <p>Your current graphics card struggles to maintain 60fps on modern AAA games and forces you to lower settings until everything looks like a PlayStation 3 title from 2008. The good news is that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5293/">Asus GeForce RTX 5070 just dropped to $584 from $739 on Amazon, offering 12GB of GDDR7 memory and Nvidia’s latest architecture for the lowest price this card has ever seen</a>. That’s flagship gaming performance before the holiday rush clears inventory, and gives you the horsepower to max out Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5293/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Raw Power That Delivers 4K Gaming</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 has 12GB of GDDR7 memory running on a 192-bit bus which delivers <strong>huge bandwidth for textures, shadows and ray-traced reflections</strong> that the older cards choke on. Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture brings third-generation RT cores and ups performance for ray tracing three times over previous generations, and allows you to actually enable those gorgeous lighting effects without watching your framerate collapse.</p>



<p>The 5888 CUDA cores tear through modern game engines, pushing consistent 60+ fps at 4K resolution in demanding titles like Alan Wake 2, Starfield, and the latest Call of Duty. <strong>DLSS 3.5 with Frame Generation uses AI</strong> to create additional frames and doubles your framerate in supported games and achieves buttery-smooth 120fps gaming in graphically intense scenarios.</p>
<p>The Asus TUF design wraps this <strong>GPU in military-grade components and a protective PCB coating against dust, moisture, and static discharge</strong>. That matters with rigs that run hot during marathon gaming sessions or live in less-than-pristine environments. The triple Axial-tech fans feature a unique barrier ring design that increases air pressure by 31% compared to standard fans and pushes more cool air through the heatsink to keep temperatures under control during extended gaming.</p>



<p>PCIe 5.0 future-proofs your system for future motherboards and processors but the card works just fine in the PCIe 4.0 slots that most current systems are using. You get <strong>two HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 outputs</strong> to support multiple 4K displays at 120Hz or one 8K monitor, depending on what you’re trying to do with multi-monitor setups or cutting-edge high-refresh displays.</p>
<p>This deal makes the RTX 5070 cheaper than many RTX 4070 Ti models at $584, with superior performance and newer technology. This is the lowest price ever, so if you’re still waiting for an excuse to upgrade from a struggling GTX or older RTX card, there’s no reason to keep suffering through low settings and choppy framerates anymore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asus hardly ever runs sales on its laptops, let alone its best-sellers like those in the Vivobook series. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5292/">14-inch Vivobook is now available from Amazon for $476, down from $799</a>, and it’s an all-time low price cut for a configuration that<strong> packs 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and Intel’s 10-core i5-1334U processor</strong>. That’s a straight 40% discount that pushes the price of a premium ultraportable below most budget laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5292/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h3>Great Laptop in 2025</h3>
<p>Inside this Vivobook sits an Intel Core i5-1334U processor with a total of 10 cores divided between performance and efficiency architectures which boosts to 4.6GHz when you need maximum speed for more demanding tasks. This multi-core design crushes workloads that include Excel data analysis, Photoshop editing and light gaming without the stuttering usually experienced with dual-core budget laptops.</p>



<p>Heavy lifting-like compiling code or exporting videos-is left to the performance cores, while efficiency cores manage background processes and lighter tasks to conserve battery. The 24GB of DDR4 RAM means even the most strenuous multitasking-scenario virtual machines, 4K footage editing, and 50-plus browser tabs open across multiple research projects-run smoothly.</p>
<p>For this price, <strong>you get a 1TB PCIe SSD with read speeds over 3,000 MB/s</strong>. It means Windows will boot in less than 10 seconds, applications launch instantly, and you are never left waiting. With its huge storage capacity, you can hold years of documents, photos, videos, and software without being pushed onto cloud subscriptions or external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>14-inch FHD display pushes sharp text and vibrant colors</strong> through an IPS panel with ultra-narrow bezels that maximize screen real estate. A 16:9 aspect ratio provides enough vertical space for productivity work like writing and coding without losing the widescreen format so great for streaming shows and movies. Anti-glare coating on the display reduces eye strain in marathon study sessions or all-day work sprints.</p>
<p>From a security point of view, <strong>the HD webcam includes a physical privacy shutter</strong>, which, when slid into place, physically covers the lens, offering the best and fullest assurance that no defective software or malware could turn on the camera without your knowledge. The video call quality remains clear and sharp for seamless Zoom meetings, online classes and remote collaboration.</p>



<p>The<strong> battery life extends up to 8 hours for typical use</strong>, and covers most workdays or class schedules without hunting for outlets in between.<strong> Windows 11 is pre-installed with integrated Microsoft Copilot AI</strong> to help with drafting emails, summarizing documents, creating creative content, and automating repetitive tasks using natural language-based commands. Wireless connectivity is taken care of by Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.1 to support modern peripherals, hotspots, and home networks. The <strong>port selection includes USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and a headphone jack</strong>.</p>
<p>At $476 instead of $799, this deal is the lowest price Amazon has offered on an Asus Vivobook with this configuration. Budget laptops at similar prices ship with half the RAM, a quarter of the storage and processors that struggle with anything beyond web browsing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-1tb-hp-laptop-at-70-off-is-practically-free-amazon-adds-299-bonus-bundle-on-top.1341814/</guid>

              <p>A $2,000 laptop typically means you’re buying a MacBook Pro or high-end Windows machine with premium specs that justify the investment. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">HP 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop originally carried that same $1,999 price tag but just crashed to $626 on Amazon</a>, and drops into mid-range laptop territory while packing specs that embarrass most competitors at double the cost.</p>
<p>The 69% discount makes this <strong>one of the best HP laptop deals of the year</strong>, delivering <strong>32GB of RAM, a full 1TB SSD, and an Intel Core i3 1315U processor</strong> that handles work and study without breaking a sweat. Amazon sweetens the deal further by<strong> throwing in an exclusive accessory kit worth $299</strong> including a mouse, laptop sleeve and other essentials you’d normally buy separately.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic Specs for Everyday</h2>
<p>Inside, this laptop has an Intel Core i3 1315U processor <strong>with six cores that boost up to 4.5GHz</strong> and give you enough horsepower for video calls, document editing, web browsing with dozens of tabs and light content creation. The 10th generation architecture of the processor balances performance cores for demanding tasks with efficiency cores for background processes so that your battery lasts longer during all-day classes or work sessions.</p>
<p>Again, 32GB of DDR4 RAM ensures that multitasking is smooth even when running virtual meetings on Zoom, editing spreadsheets and keeping research tabs open all at once. Most laptops at this price point ship with 8GB of RAM that chokes under moderate workloads which makes this configuration a huge upgrade for professionals who need real multitasking capability.</p>
<p>With the 1TB SSD, you get years of document and media file storage without being forced into cloud storage subscriptions or external drives. Employing SSD technology, near-instant boot times and application launches eliminate waiting that turns productivity into procrastination. The read and write speeds of this drive make file transfers and software installations dramatically faster compared to conventional hard drives.</p>



<p>The intuitive touch further extends to an interactive <strong>15.6-inch HD touchscreen that changes how you will be working</strong> with spreadsheets and creative applications. Touch gestures-such as pinch-to-zoom, swipe navigation, and tap selection-are natural to anyone who uses a smartphone daily, which makes it easier on the learning curve for new users. The HD resolution of 1366×768 balances clarity with battery efficiency: it’s sharp enough for everyday tasks without the power-hungry requirement of 4K displays.</p>
<p>Advanced features such as BitLocker for encrypting sensitive files and Hyper-V to run virtual machines <strong>come pre-installed in Windows 11 Pro</strong>. A dedicated Copilot AI key launches Microsoft’s AI assistant in an instant to help users with everything from drafting emails and summarizing documents to generating images to automating repetitive tasks without needing to open individual apps. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity provides faster downloads, smoother streaming and more reliable connections within crowded networks.</p>



<p>The connectivity suite rounds out with two USB-A 3.0 ports for legacy devices, a single USB-C 3.0 port for modern peripherals and fast data transfer, and an HDMI port for easy connecting of external monitors or projectors during presentations.</p>
<p>At $626 instead of $1,999, this deal represents the steepest discount Amazon has offered on a fully-equipped HP laptop with these specifications. The included $299 accessory kit saves you from having to hunt for compatible mice, sleeves, and cables once your laptop arrives.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-v11-drops-to-record-low-amazon-practically-giving-it-away-for-pennies-2000640660</link>

              <p>Mid-range vacuum cleaners sell for around $400 and deliver middling performance that leaves you vacuuming the same spot three times. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Dyson V11 cordless stick vacuum drops to $399 from $629 on Amazon</a> and puts great Dyson engineering at the exact price point where most people settle for inferior suction and frustrating battery life. This <strong>all-time low means you’re paying mid-range money for a flagship vacuum</strong> that actually picks up everything in one pass instead of pushing debris around like a broom with commitment issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Suction Power That Works on Real Dirt</h2>
<p>The Dyson V11 generates <strong>185 Air Watts of suction through its Dyson Hyperdymium motor</strong> which spins at 125,000 rpm to create cyclonic forces that capture 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns. That microscopic filtration traps allergens, dust mites and pet dander instead of blowing them back into your air like cheap vacuums with inadequate sealing.</p>



<p>The fully sealed filtration system ensures what gets sucked in stays trapped in the bin rather than escaping through gaps and vents. <strong>Three cleaning modes adjust power output based on floor type</strong>: Eco mode conserves battery for light cleaning, Auto mode intelligently adapts suction to different surfaces, and Boost mode delivers maximum power for ground-in dirt and stubborn pet hair.</p>
<p>The torque drive cleaner head features stiff nylon bristles that dig into carpet fibers to extract embedded debris while anti-static carbon fiber filaments capture fine dust from hard floors without scratching. Dynamic Load Sensor technology automatically detects floor type and adjusts suction power in real time, so you’re never wasting battery on bare floors or leaving dirt in carpets.</p>



<p><strong>Battery runtime reaches up to 60 minutes in Eco mode</strong> with non-motorized tools and covers most homes in a single charge without the anxiety of dying mid-clean. The seven-cell lithium-ion battery delivers fade-free power that maintains consistent suction from full charge until the last minute, eliminating the frustrating power drop that plagues cheaper cordless models. The LCD screen displays remaining runtime in real time based on your current power mode and attachment, so you know exactly how much cleaning time remains.</p>
<p>The point-and-shoot bin emptying mechanism ejects dirt with a single push and keeps your hands away from dust and allergens. The 0.2-gallon bin capacity handles typical cleaning sessions without constant trips to the trash can, though homes with multiple shedding pets may need more frequent emptying. The hair screw tool features a conical brush bar that spirals hair off and into the bin instead of tangling around bristles like traditional attachments.</p>



<p>The vacuum <strong>converts from stick to handheld configuration in seconds</strong> by removing the wand, transforming it into a powerful tool for stairs, upholstery and car interiors. <strong>Six included attachments</strong> cover every cleaning scenario: the combination tool for quick dusting, crevice tool for tight gaps, mini motorized tool for upholstery, soft dusting brush for delicate surfaces, stubborn dirt brush for dried-on messes, and up-top adapter for high-reach cleaning. Wall-mounted docking station charges the vacuum and stores all attachments in one organized location, eliminating the tangle of tools stuffed in closets.</p>
<p>At $399 instead of $629, this deal delivers Dyson’s flagship cordless performance at the price point where competitors offer vacuums that struggle with basic cleaning tasks.</p>
