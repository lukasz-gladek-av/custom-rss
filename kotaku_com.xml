              <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might not be the only massive sci-fi RPG on Switch 2 for long. Could <em>Starfield</em> get ported as well? Why is <em>Dead Space</em>‚Äòs old Creative Director all-in on AI? And How did an AI replica of a real content creator make its way onto the official <em>First Descendent</em> TikTok channel? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‚Äòs brief daily roundup of gaming culture and news, where we‚Äôre doing a bunch of clean-up from the first day of Gamescom 2025.</p>  <p>Podcaster NateTheHate, who‚Äôs quickly developed a reputation for accurate leaks around upcoming Nintendo announcements, now claims Bethesda‚Äôs open-world sci-fi RPG is coming to the company‚Äôs handheld hybrid next year. ‚Äú<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> won‚Äôt be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,‚Äù he <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027">posted on X</a> yesterday. ‚ÄúSee that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5‚Ä¶<em>Starfield</em> is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.‚Äù FromSoftware‚Äôs <em>The Duskbloods</em> has also been confirmed for Switch 2 in 2026, and Nintendo has yet to reveal any of its expected slate for the console‚Äôs second year. <em>Starfield</em> is reportedly coming to PS5 next year as well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">seemingly closer to whenever the second expansion launches</a>.</p> <h2><em>The First Descendent</em> blames TikTok for AI slop video</h2> <p>Nexon‚Äôs free-to-play loot shooter, also known as ‚ÄúGooner <em>Destiny</em>,‚Äù <a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-ads-tiktok-the-first-descendant-nexon-2000618182">accidentally shared an AI-generated ad on TikTok</a> that ripped off another content creator. <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/3100882">The publisher now says</a> a TikTok marketing program automatically solicited the ad and linked it to <em>The First Descendants‚Äô</em> account with no controls to verify copyright infringement or other content concerns. Sounds bad! ‚Äú<span lang="EN-US">We will also be committed to continuously being more transparent and responsible to regain the trust of our community and creators,‚Äù the company writes. ‚Äú</span><span lang="EN-US">Once again, we deeply apologize for the disappointment and inconvenience this incident has caused.‚Äù</span></p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> could be coming to Switch 2</h2> <p>Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">told <em>VGC</em></a> at Gamescom that Square Enix is in talks with Nintendo about porting the hit MMORPG over. ‚ÄúThe discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future,‚Äù he said. It sounds like <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> isn‚Äôt out of the question either. Yoshida added, ‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs just my aim to provide <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and <em>16</em> to as many players as possible, and I hope that as many players as possible will be able to enjoy those two games.‚Äù</p> <h2>The director of <em>Callisto Protocol</em> is going all-in on AI</h2> <p>Glen Schofield <a href="http://AI is going to be fantastic">told<em> The Game Industry</em></a> ‚ÄúAI is going to be fantastic.‚Äù He said he‚Äôs holding seminars about how AI can make creatives more efficient and thinks the technology will be an inevitable part of game development in 5-10 years, but he‚Äôs not sure exactly how it will all shake out. ‚ÄúIs it going to be an engine?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRight now, it‚Äôs a whole bunch of things that just kind of suck it in‚Ä¶ and into what? It‚Äôs going to have to settle down a bit before we actually use it.‚Äù Schofield also claimed<em> Callisto Protocol</em> sold over 5 million copies, but regretted not delaying it. He said AAA games are not dead and is looking for someone to pay him to make another.</p> <h2><em>High on Life 2</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>The sci-fi comedy shooter <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/high-on-life-2-demo-hands-on-preview-gamescom/">will arrive</a> on PC and console, including on Game Pass, on February 13, 2026. Ralph Ineson, best known as Cid in <em>FF16</em> and more recently Galactus in <em>The</em> <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, will be voicing the newest gun in the game.</p>

 <h2><em>Triangle Strategy</em> shadow-drops on Xbox and PS5</h2> <p>The HD-2D homage to games like <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> was previously a Switch exclusive on console. Square Enix‚Äôs port is <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1958158169240371511">now on Xbox</a> with a starting discount of 30 percent off.</p> <h2><em>Stalker 2</em> comes to PS5 in November</h2> <p>The survival horror shooter <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1958150213127798847">makes the jump</a> on November 20 as more former Xbox console exclusives get ported and help round-out Sony‚Äôs previously anemic 2025 release slate.</p> <h2>The biggest lines at Gamescom are for <em>Silksong</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THIS IS THE LINE OF HOLLOW KNIGHT SILKSONG ON PRESS DAY AT 9AM. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gamescom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gamescom</a> <a href="https://t.co/lNz1q62AZ5">pic.twitter.com/lNz1q62AZ5</a></p> <p>‚Äî Daan K. üîú Gamescom 2025 (@NintenDaan) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintenDaan/status/1958063065150226808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel is getting a special announcement on August 21‚Äî<a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-gamescom-stream-2000618437">a release date, hopefully?</a>‚Äîbut in the meantime, attendees at Gamescom are making the <em>Silksong</em> demos at the Nintendo and Xbox booths the highlights of the show so far. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-offers-buttery-smooth-performance-on-switch-2">Nintendo Life&nbsp;already went hands-on</a> and confirmed the Metroidvania Soulslike supports 120Hz refresh on Switch 2 in TV mode.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410">Kirby Air Riders has a release date and looks refreshingly old-school</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-layoffs-rod-fergusson-diablo-gears-2000618449">Rod Fergusson is trying to save BioShock a second time</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/denshattack-train-game-tony-hawk-anime-onl-gamescom-2025-trailer-2000618578">This Japanese train game was the best thing revealed at Gamescom</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hidden SECRETS In GTA 3" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBpNWVDQ5QM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>
