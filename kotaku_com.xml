However, the game’s handling of trans identity goes beyond just options you can choose in the character creator that may support your own personal headcanon. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare has given you the option to actively declare in-game that your hero is transgender, in a way that’s reflected in dialogue throughout the game. Historically this has been the kind of thing that players have had to just apply to a game’s hero through their own imaginations, so I was happy to see BioWare went the extra step to codify it for those who want to play a trans Rook.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Rather, it comes a few hours into the game when you unlock Rook’s quarters in the Lighthouse base. This isn’t something you can miss, so if you’ve started your own playthrough and haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry, you just haven’t gotten to this point in the game. When you’re setting up Rook’s room, one of the items you’ll put down is a handheld mirror. This gives Rook a moment of self reflection and you the opportunity to add some backstory to your character based on things you included in the character creator. Personally, I chose to talk about my tattoos and speak a little lore for my hero into the universe. But there’s one option that allows you to touch on Rook’s gender identity, specifically stating that your character is transgender. This isn’t tied to anything specific in the character creator, so no matter what options you choose while making them, you can still have a trans Rook in your story.</p><figure id="" data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The three options include “I’m getting there,” “I love who I am,” and “Feels good to see the real me,” so you can designate your trans identity and also color in where you think they are in their personal journey. This will unlock some dialogue options throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> that allow you to discuss this aspect of your identity with other characters, so it’s not just a thing you have to internalize. However, as far as I can tell after finishing the game, if you don’t pick this option when you’re setting up Rook’s room, it doesn’t come up again later. So be sure to go down this dialogue path when you’re examining the mirror if you want to play as a trans Rook and have it be recognized in dialogue. It just might give you a point of common connection with some characters that will enrich your story throughout.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, one genre that you might not immediately think of as a hotbed of good scares is role-playing games. You’d be wrong, though. RPGs of all types have some of the best horror stories in the medium, thanks to the focus on expansive worlds and player freedom that can easily be twisted into a scary situation of your own making. If you’re a fan of thrills as well as lengthy games you can really sink your teeth into, then these seven terrifying RPGs are the perfect treat for Halloween.</p></div><div><p>We all saw this coming. The 2004 vampire RPG basically has the market cornered on horror RPGs even two decades after its release. But there’s good reason for that! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wit-and-charm-are-powerful-weapons-in-vampire-the-masq-1835701842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wit-and-charm-are-powerful-weapons-in-vampire-the-masq-1835701842"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em></a></span> drops you into an incredibly realized world of vampire politics that you get to involve yourself in and change through a slew of wonderful combat and dialogue systems. It’s a great RPG but it’s also deeply rooted in the compelling vampire world it’s set in, so you really can’t do better than this.</p></div><div><p>While <em>The Witcher 3</em> is already a gritty and dark fairytale RPG full of monsters, its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-the-kotaku-review-1779646150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-the-kotaku-review-1779646150"><em>Blood and Wine</em></a></span> expansion might be an even better pick for Halloween. Sure, the brown and gray color palette gets a Technicolor update, but that’s just to make all the blood look even more vibrant. <em>Blood and Wine</em> is a vampire story that builds on the solid systems and characters of the base game. You don’t even have to play <em>The Witcher 3</em> first, as you can start <em>Blood and Wine</em> right from the menu.</p></div><div><p>The best parts of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928"><em>Pathologic 2</em></a></span> only show themselves once you die. The horror RPG is all about managing your resources to stay alive. You need to eat, drink, rest, and heal constantly, on top of managing your reputation across the game’s many towns. But once you do die, a weird meta encounter informs you that the world has gotten worse and so have you. What was already a strange and dangerous world becomes exponentially so through debuffs like less health or more unconventional things such as losing the ability to hug characters. The more you die, the more things change, and there is always a little bit of a pull on your curiosity to find out how bad things can really get.</p></div><div><p>Square Enix’s cult classic answer to <em>Resident Evil </em>will always deserve more attention than it gets. As you’d expect from the makers of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/parasite-eve-had-more-in-common-with-final-fantasy-than-1788134625&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/parasite-eve-had-more-in-common-with-final-fantasy-than-1788134625"><em>Parasite Eve</em></a></span> added RPG elements to the survival horror genre to great success. You play as Aya Brea, a rookie NYPD cop who, over the course of a lonely week in late December, works to save the city from a mitochondrial outbreak that threatens to destroy the world. It’s pulpy, it’s scary, it’s fun, and it’s worth playing if only for seeing the jaw-dropping opening cinematic.</p></div><div><p>For my money, no game has done gothic horror better than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854"><em>Bloodborne</em></a></span>. The city of Yharnam, with its constant sense of dread that bears down on you as you explore its cobblestone streets and gothic structures, has one of the most imposing atmospheres in any game ever. Sure, there’s still the tough-as-nails combat and constant retreading of territory we know from the <em>Souls </em>games—this is still FromSoftware—but rather than dark fantasy, <em>Bloodborne </em>evokes true horror. That happens both in the grotesque monster designs you encounter during its difficult fights but also in its story of cosmic dread and humanity’s overambition.</p></div><div><p>Cosmic horror will—for better and worse—always be synonymous with H.P. Lovecraft. One of the author’s most famous creations, Cthulhu, has even spawned a fantastic tabletop RPG, on which the video game <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> is based. That video game is a great translation of Lovecraftian cosmic horror thanks to its emphasis on sanity. As you progress, you’ll slowly lose your mind, but before you do that you’ll be out to work as a detective. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854"><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a></span> lets you choose your background, which then opens up different dialogue options during investigations. This makes each playthrough feel unique, and cultivates the sense that perhaps you aren’t getting the full picture.</p></div><div><p>The secret to horror roguelike <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/darkest-dungeon-the-kotaku-review-1755308882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/darkest-dungeon-the-kotaku-review-1755308882"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a></span>’s success is stressing you the fuck out. Each member of your party, with whom you attempt to navigate the titular dungeons, has a stress level. If they get too stressed they will literally have a heart attack. This will stress you out and that’s great! The system makes you keenly aware of the risk vs reward of every action. If your party members explore without light, don’t eat proper food, or witness deaths, they’ll become increasinglystressed. But what if you can just make it through? It might be worth it! That’s the eternal conundrum of every run of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
