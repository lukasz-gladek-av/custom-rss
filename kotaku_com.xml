              <p>Last week, I finally traveled to New York City to visit the <em>Kotaku</em> office, hang out with the people who work there, and even meet up with some former staff. It was a great time! Had a blast visiting the city, and getting there was a breeze. However, getting home was a mess and involved me crashing in the Detroit Metro Airport for seven hours before heading home to Kansas City. But it wasn’t all bad news. While in the airport, I found a strange vending machine that dispenses hot personal pizza pies.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zackzwiezen.com/post/3mafio2oits2b">My wife and I landed in Detroit around midnight.</a> After verifying our new tickets to Kansas City with the staff, we picked out a spot near our terminal and killed time until our flight. Once we had set up a home base in the corner of the seating area, not far from a bathroom, charging station, and water fountain, I decided to explore. I quickly stumbled upon a 24/7 area of the airport<!--StartFragment --><span>—mostly deserted at 1 a.m.<!--StartFragment -->—<!--EndFragment --></span>that was filled with different vending machines. It was the Pizza Cat machine that caught my eye.</p>

 <p>I was hungry. And I didn’t want to eat more chips and jerky. I wanted something hot and tasty. So a big vending machine promising hot pizzas in five minutes made me excited. I wasn’t alone either. Before I could get to the machine, an older man with a large roller suitcase walked up to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7Hdkrxnw9Ms">Pizza Cat</a> and began ordering a pizza. He then stepped back and watched. I did too. The machine hides what it does, but I was able to hear what sounded like a small motor and fan kick on.</p>

 <p>About five minutes later, a cardboard box containing the man’s cheese pizza popped out of a slot. He turned around, looked at me, and then sort of shrugged as if to say, “Huh, this is weird.” I replied, “Weird, but hey, it’s pizza!” I must have startled him because he let go of his luggage, which fell to the floor with a loud thud, and in the process nearly dropped his newly acquired pizza. After I helped him get situated, he scurried off to eat his food.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655810" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655810"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655810">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, I repeated the process he’d just finished and used the large touchscreen to order a pepperoni pizza. Five minutes later, it popped out in a box. As I was grabbing it, another person, a younger man, slipped in behind me to toss away his pizza box. “Pretty good, actually!” he shared with me before leaving. I wasn’t so sure.</p>

 <p>Sitting back down with my wife in the corner of the airport we’d picked out, I opened the box and found a small, very thin, and slightly greasy little pizza. It had a crispy crust and looked okay. But when I picked up a slice, it felt very soft and rubbery. Thankfully, it wasn’t chewy, but the bland dough and tiny amount of sauce were disappointing. The cheese was fine and the pepperoni slices spicy enough to help it not be a completely bland bit of food.&nbsp; Still, after enjoying NYC pizza just a day before consuming this vending machine pizza, I wasn’t impressed.</p>

 <p>Then again, being able to spend $13 to get a personal pizza whenever I want in the middle of an empty airport at 1 a.m. is nice. If you ever find yourself stuck in the Detroit Metro Airport overnight and crave some food, look for the Pizza Cat vending machine, lower your standards, and enjoy a hot pizza pie. Or something approximating a pizza.</p>

              <p>The holidays are winding down. Did you get what you wanted? If not and you own a Switch or Switch 2, there’s a still a chance you can treat yourself to something for a decent price. Some of the best games of the year are currently on sale on the eShop, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447">some older ones that deserve a place</a> in everyone’s portable gaming library.</p> <p>Nintendo itself isn’t really running any great discounts on Switch exclusives at the moment. <em>Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>New Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</em> are both $20 off, but everyone probably already has those. There are some notable Switch 2 games on sale, including <em>Street Fighter 6</em> for just $20 (half off), <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> for $40 (down from $60), and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> for $40 (down from $70).</p>

 <p>But if you only own a Switch, here’s a quick smattering of the best deals on the eShop for everything that’s available on both consoles:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>No Man’s Sky</strong></em> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2</strong></em> – $25 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></em> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hades II</strong></em> – $22.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Ball x Pit</strong></em> – $12 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Prince of Persia The Lost Crown</strong></em> – $12 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Death’s Door</strong> </em>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hollow Knight</strong> </em>– $7.50 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hades</strong> </em>– $ 7.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Baten Kaitos 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster</strong></em> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</strong> </em>– $20 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong> </em>– $8 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Mega Man Legacy Collection</strong></em> – $5 (66 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong></em> – $6.39 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Sifu</strong></em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Dead Cells</strong> </em>– $12.50 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>The discounts on <em>Silksong</em> and <em>Hades 2</em> aren’t wild, but the games are already so cheap to begin with that it’s still enticing. And if you don’t have the games those are sequels to, you should grab them first since they’re a steal at just $15 for both. <em>Ball x Pit</em> is a great “shut your brain up” game for $12. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection</em> is a great way to get hyped <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829">for <em>Mega Man 12</em></a>, whenever that eventually arrives.</p>

 <p>But I want to call special attention to<em> Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, which is the cheapest it’s ever going to be and just got a free upgrade for Switch 2. Now’s the time to get cracking on this dense tactical-RPG in preparation for the next <em>Divinity</em> sequel. <em>Baten Kaitos 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster</em> is also a cult-classic RPG pick-up from the GameCube era that I’d recommend for just $15. And if you had fun with the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remaster this year, <em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em> is very good in similar but different ways. A perfectly grim and grindy strategy RPG for the dark, cold winter months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years now, <em>Fallout</em> fans have been wondering when the next mainline sequel will arrive. Hype for the game most assume will be called<em> Fallout 5</em> grew even larger last year after Amazon’s TV show made the post-apocalyptic franchise bigger than ever. And while Bethesda hasn’t formally announced<em> Fallout 5</em>, that hasn’t stopped the studio’s creative director, Todd Howard, from talking about it over the years.</p> <p><em>Fallout 4</em> arrived on consoles and PC in 2015. Not long after its launch, people began wondering about<em> Fallout 5.</em> As a result, whenever Howard sits down for an interview, it’s not unusual for someone to ask him about <em>Fallout 5</em> and the future of the franchise. Here’s nearly every time Howard has talked about <em>Fallout 5</em>, presented in chronological order. One thing to keep in mind before scrolling down is that Howard is very careful when talking about <em>Fallout 5</em>, so be prepared for comments that give you plenty to infer and speculate about, but little in the way of cold hard facts.</p>

 <h2>June 2018 – <em>Fallout 5</em> will be a single-player video game</h2> <p>Technically, <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/videos/fallout-76-interview-mit-todd-howard-nicht-so-ein-krasser-umbruch-wie-bei-fallout-3-gamestar-tv-fuer-alle,96653.html">during a 2018 interview with German outlet <em>GameStar</em>,</a> Howard didn’t say anything specific about a new <em>Fallout</em> game. However, when asked if all upcoming Bethesda games would feature multiplayer like <em>Fallout 76,</em> he replied that no, future games from the studio would still be single-player adventures.</p>

 <h2>November 2021 – Bethesda has a <em>Fallout 5</em> “one-pager”</h2> <p>A few years later, during an <a href="https://youtu.be/LUOZsjTwbLU?t=1207">interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Howard spilled a bit more about the next <em>Fallout</em> sequel. He told the outlet that Bethesda has a “one-pager on <em>Fallout 5</em>, what we want to do,” but made it clear that the plan at the time was <em>Starfield</em> and then <em>Elder Scrolls VI,</em> seemingly confirming that<em>&nbsp;Fallout 5</em> remained many, many years away.</p>

 <h2>June 2022 – <em>Fallout 5</em> is next after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls VI</em></h2> <p>The following year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-new-details-todd-howard-interview">in another interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Howard said this about Bethesda’s future:</p> <blockquote><p>“Yes, <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing<em> Fallout 5</em> after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.”</p></blockquote> <h2>June 2023 – <em>Fallout 5</em> might not be Bethesda’s next game after <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em></h2> <p>A year after saying <em>Fallout 5</em> would be Bethesda’s next project after shipping <em>Elder Scrolls VI,</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/0Gs22Sn2VMU?t=1166">Howard backtracked a bit</a> and clarified that he simply meant that <em>Fallout 5</em> would arrive after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>, not that he wanted to confirm it as the next game. This confusing backtrack worried fans who now wondered if Bethesda had a different project in the works that could further delay <em>Fallout 5. </em>In this same interview, he argued that long gaps between sequels, while annoying for fans, have rarely hurt a game’s success or quality.</p>

 <h2>March 2024 – <em>Fallout</em> TV showrunners were told to avoid certain details that will be in <em>Fallout 5</em></h2> <p>After causing a ruckus online by claiming that the<em> Fallout</em> TV show was “basically <em>Fallout 5,</em>” showrunner Johnathan Nolan clarified that he just meant this is the next story in the universe and not a replacement for an upcoming game. In fact, the show is actively avoiding some parts of the franchise <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762">because it would cause problems for <em>Fallout 5.</em></a></p>

 <p>“Well, there&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;some things where I said, ‘Don’t do this because we are going to do that in&nbsp;<em>Fallout 5</em>,’” Howard told <em><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/fallout-tv-series-todd-howard-fallout-5/">Den of Geek</a>.</em></p> <h2>April 2024 – Todd Howard dodges a question about <em>Fallout 5</em>‘s release after <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></h2> <p>When talking to <em>IGN</em>, Howard was yet again asked about <em>Fallout 5</em> launching after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>. This time,<a href="https://youtu.be/7dSeF1CMChs?t=1308"> he straight-up dodged the question</a>, but did confirm that Bethesda is working on different projects. “I’m going to avoid putting dates on anything, I’ve learned that the hard way,” said Howard. “So, obviously, you know, our focus as far as new development right now is <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not making plans for other things.”</p>

 <h2>June 2024 – Bethesda is not in a rush to release a new <em>Fallout</em> game</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120">During a 2024 interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays,</a> Howard said that Bethesda didn’t feel the need to “rush out” a new <em>Fallout</em> sequel or spin-off, though he also acknowledged that the wait between<em> Fallout 4</em> and <em>Fallout 5</em> is growing longer and longer.</p> <blockquote><p>“Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game. And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, or now<em>&nbsp;Starfield</em>, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do.”</p></blockquote> <h2>October 2025 – Howard ends Fallout Day stream with a promise that more is being worked on</h2> <p>To celebrate Fallout Day, the day the bombs fell in-universe and destroyed the Earth, Bethesda held a digital showcase to announce a <em>Fallout 4</em> update, reveal some <em>Fallout 76</em> news, and not much else. Seemingly aware that this presentation would be disappointing to fans longing for <em>Fallout 5,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">Howard appeared at the end</a> to offer some hope, telling fans that the studio is “working on even more” and that Bethesda is “looking forward to the day” when all is revealed.</p> <h2>December 2025 – Howard confirms <em>Fallout 5</em> won’t ignore the TV show</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">In an interview with the <em>BBC</em></a>, Howard was asked if the events of the <em>Fallout</em> show are being considered by the devs while making <em>Fallout 5</em>. Would the show and the game really exist in one world?</p>

 <p>“In short, yes,” Howard told the outlet. “<em>Fallout 5</em> will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account.”</p> <h2>December 2025 –&nbsp; Bethesda is still working hard on more <em>Fallout&nbsp;</em></h2> <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned#:~:text=%22I%20will%20say,for%20our%20fans.%22">Speaking to <em>Game Informer</em>,</a> Howard made it clear that <em>Fallout</em> is a very important franchise for Bethesda and that it has been working on projects related to the post-apocalyptic world for a long time.</p> <blockquote><p>“I will say, first, looking at <em>76</em>, we’ve never stopped developing <em>Fallout</em>. We’ve had a full team on <em>Fallout</em> for a long time. So <em>Fallout</em>, as a franchise, is the one we’re still doing the most work in above anything. Now, the majority of our internal studio is on<em> Elder Scrolls VI.</em> We are doing other things with <em>Fallout</em> that we haven’t announced, and you know, there’ll come a time for that. I get the sort of anxiety from fans, like, ‘Well, what else? What else? Feed me!’ But, look, we’re working on stuff, and we do like to wait. And so, I think there’ll be a moment to talk about that, and we want to make those special moments for our fans.”</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An interview from earlier this year featuring Level-5 CEO and president Akihiro Hino talking positively about AI and claiming the tech is writing 80 percent or more of the studio’s code these days recently went viral online. And now Hino has responded, denying that the studio behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/5-hours-with-the-new-layton-great-writing-weak-puzzle-1797076176"><em>Professor Layton </em></a>and <em>Ni no Kuni </em>games has fully shifted to AI programming, but also defending generative AI and claiming it will lead to “greater growth” in the industry.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650">On December 26, Hino posted a lengthy response</a> to the online “commotion surrounding AI” and the <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/level-5-ceo-says-games-are-now-being-made-80-90-by-ai-making-aesthetic-sense-a-must-for-developers/">spreading of a past interview on social media</a> that followed in the wake of <em>Clair Obscur</em> losing an award over its usage of the tech. According to Hino, “many game companies” are using AI these days, but not all of them are making it public. He also dismissed the claims that Level-5 is using genAI to write 80 percent or more of the code in the company’s games.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">今日はめずらしく、自分が作っているゲームの話ではないことを書きます。</p> <p>【AIをめぐる騒動について】…</p> <p>— 日野晃博 (@AkihiroHino) <a href="https://twitter.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“The truth of the matter is that there’s an unreleased title themed around AI, and for that specific title, a programmer mentioned they’re deliberately having AI handle the programming as well,” said Hino. “They used that as an example to suggest that an era like that might be coming, and that’s what got blown out of proportion.”</p>

 <p>“On the flip side, if they really were creating 80%–90% percent of the code with AI and successfully making games that way, it’d be incredibly impressive, and they’d be in high demand from the AI community. We haven’t reached that level yet. That said, it’s also true that AI is enabling time savings that can’t be dismissed, and I believe this has the potential to upend common sense in game development. It might shift us from a world where developing the AAA games everyone wants to play takes 5–10 years to one where we get to enjoy them every two years.”</p>

 <p>Hino further mentioned that <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=%C2%A9McDonald%E2%80%99s%20/%20Kotaku-,Generative,-AI%20isn%E2%80%99t%20new">generative AI</a> sometimes gets treated “like it’s synonymous with plagiarism,” a characterization he takes issue with. He continued, “A knife can be used for cooking or as a weapon; a computer can create games or enable cybercrime. AI might produce plagiarized content if misused, but if used properly, it has the power to enrich the creative world even further.”</p>

 <p>“I want to see games evolve even more in my lifetime. I want to experience and create dreamlike games that surpass the standards of today’s AAA titles. If we let the impression take hold here that ‘using AI is evil,’ it could seriously hinder the advancement of modern digital technology. I hope creators and audiences alike can recognize AI as a tool that people use to make their works. Here’s to hoping that various technological innovations lead to even greater growth in the game industry!”</p>

              <p>A new year is almost here, which means more comically large new Lego sets to taunt our wallets. The latest leaked set is for Minas Tirith from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and its rumored to cost over $600. I’m looking forward to adding the <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658"><em>Star Trek</em> Enterprise</a> to it and rounding up my irresponsible purchases for the year to $1,000.</p> <p>According to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b04dj4jMGgI">Brick Tap</a></em>, Lego will release the new <em>Lord of the Rings</em> set on June 1, 2026. It’ll be priced between $600 and $650 and be a whopping 8,278 pieces. From the front, at least, it will seemingly look like a miniature recreation of the city of Gondor etched into the side of a mountain as it’s depicted in Peter Jackson’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> films.</p>

 <p>If the leak is accurate, that would make Minas Tirith the sixth-biggest Lego set ever, just behind the new <em>Star Wars</em> Death Star. It would also be a couple thousand pieces more elaborate than the existing <em>Lord of the Rings </em>Rivendell set.</p> <p>According to <em>Brick Tap</em>, the set will also include 10 minifigures: Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Pippin, Denethor, Faramir, four Gondor soldiers, and Shadowfax. All it will be missing is an orc army to lay siege to the city. There is a <em>Lord of the Rings</em>: Barad-dûr set but it’s sold separately and currently on backorder.</p>

 <p>The hope among some fans is that this signals Lego views <em>Lord of the Rings</em> as a well worth returning to, and that we will continue to get new sets from it like we have with <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em>. Personally, I hope it means we eventually get another <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Lego game. Maybe this time an open-world action-RPG.</p>

              <p>Bungie’s <em>Marathon </em>was&nbsp;recently re-revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">ahead of a March 2026 release window</a> and in addition to a number of new gameplay changes, the extraction shooter also looks surprisingly different from how it did during its 2025 alpha test. Whether that visual overhaul is good or not depends on who you ask. The glow-up has some fans more hyped than ever for the next multiplayer shooter from the makers of <em>Halo</em> and <em>Destiny</em>, but not everyone’s on board.</p> <p>While the studio recently released new gameplay footage as part of a recent vidoc <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">previewing the work that’s gone into the game</a> since it was originally delayed, there have also been leaks of recent closed beta tests <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ps4sga/20_minutes_of_new_marathon_gameplay_from_the/">going around</a>. Instead of shying away from how the game has visually evolved over the last six months, Bungie went ahead and released a brief before-and-after sizzle reel showing off the differences. The most notable shift is in the overall lighting, which is now much warmer with more dramatic shadows:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BEFORE // AFTER <a href="https://t.co/YdthsI78nm">pic.twitter.com/YdthsI78nm</a></p> <p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2003888405449503173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>At first glance, it seems like there’s basically been another additional layer or two of visual depth and detail added to the visual presentation of each scene. It looks like the extra level of polish that you’d expect a game’s visuals to receive when going from alpha to the finished release, and which Bungie had already hinted at back when the game’s original open alpha test was taking place. The footage from those sessions was always a work-in-progress and supposed to be taken as such. The emphasis was more on having players react to the overall concept and moment-to-moment gameplay, all of which has been tweaked since its initially negative reception.</p>

 <p>“Genuine question how did this change in only a few months this is gorgeous,” <a href="https://x.com/Protheon_/status/2003955720262402494">wrote</a> <em>Destiny</em> streamer Protheon in response. “Yeah, that’s the stuff. Right into my veins please,” <a href="https://x.com/Skarrow9/status/2003894013641085355">shared</a> Skarrow9, another <em>Destiny</em> content creator. Prospective players were also impressed. “Like, come on, dude. This shit looks so good. We STILL got people who thought the alpha was gonna be the final product, too. I can’t fucking wait,” <a href="https://x.com/EndlessGl/status/2004348217782378572">wrote</a> X user EndlessGL.</p>

 <p>Not everyone’s on board, however. One of the major selling points of <em>Marathon</em> is its “<a href="https://x.com/josephacross/status/1663415932344225794">Graphic Realism</a>” art style that makes it look a bit like an early 2000s Nike ad by way of <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>. A lot of the the original <em>Marathon</em> alpha footage looked a bit hazy and unfinished, but it was also enveloped in some more striking color palette contrasts; hyper-saturated pinks and neon yellows pop among the cold steely blues and latex blacks.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Went from kinda unique looking to "Focus M, Bowser's castle is just up ahead" <a href="https://t.co/0SqZpOCfgB">https://t.co/0SqZpOCfgB</a></p> <p>— SSSS.ayah (@SayaDoesStuff) <a href="https://twitter.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The shift to more conventional, warmer lighting has some dunking on the new <em>Marathon</em> look as a generic fan reshade mod. “They replaced the cool minimalist environment art and deliberate use of color with generic ue5 rtx shadows fucking whyyyyyyyy,” wrote one person. “Went from kinda unique looking to ‘Focus M, Bowser’s castle is just up ahead,'” <a href="https://x.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199">wrote</a> another. The post, with over 54,000 likes, was referencing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-parody-viral-voice-actor-ue5-instagram-2000655479">recent viral parody</a>&nbsp;of what <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> would look and sound like as a conventional AAA blockbuster.</p>

 <p><em>Marathon</em> doesn’t need to win over folks like this to succeed, and many fans were asking Bungie for a grittier, more realistic look to the extraction shooter while it was being tweaked during the recent delay. They’ll no doubt be satisfied by how the game’s overall visual presentation is shaping up. Bungie, and <em>Marathon</em> in particular, have also become popular to hate on for various online contingents who don’t actually have any personal stake in the game succeeding or any apparent interest in actually playing it. So it’s easy to brush off any nitpicking as just more online noise.</p>

 <p>But I’ll be curious to see just how much the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">striking imagery around <em>Marathon</em>‘s original reveal</a> can survive the messy road to actually shipping it. Senior art director Joseph Cross, who played a central role in helping define the visual language of the game, recently left the studio just months ahead of its new release date. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” he told <em>Kotaku </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">earlier this month</a>.</p>

            <p>The Switch 2 is out and Nintendo’s original handheld/console hybrid getting ready to sail west to the summer country. Since 2017, Nintendo has made the most of less-powerful hardware and created an ecosystem unlike that offered by its direct competitors. Compared to its high-end rivals, including its own next-gen successor, the Switch is by no means a very powerful way to play games today. But it’s still one of the most affordable and versatile, allowing you to play console-quality games from almost anywhere, from your couch to the bus. If you’re just now hopping on the Switch train—it’s still regularly <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-used-prices-xbox-series-x-s-preowned-2000614748">one of the cheapest machines on the market</a>—here are the best games to start with.</p>

              <p><span>Oh hey, it’s been a while since we did one of these. Actually, before we get to my favorite games of 2025, here were my favorite games of 2024 that I was so </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3ldmmw2n25c2x"><span>rudely not allowed to tell y’all about</span></a><span> last year.</span></p> <ol> <li><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></li> <li><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></li> <li><em>Mouthwashing</em></li> <li><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></li> <li><em>1000xResist</em></li> <li><em>Shadow Generations</em></li> <li><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></li> <li><em>Astro Bot</em></li> <li><em>Marvel Rivals</em></li> <li><em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em></li> </ol> <p><span>I tend to get pretty reflective when I write these end-of-year lists. My </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2022-pokemon-legends-arceus-overwatch-ofk-1849935691"><span>2022 list</span></a><span> was written mere days after I started here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-games-2023-baldurs-gate-3-cyberpunk-sf6-1851113163#:~:text=Baldur's%20Gate%203%20to%20Pok%C3%A9mon%3A%20Kenneth%20Shepard's%20Most%20Spellbinding%20Games%20Of%202023,-Pok%C3%A9monRPGStreet"><span>my 2023 one</span></a><span> was put together shortly after I’d watched the site I’d moved my life across the country for get torn asunder in spite. I imagine my 2024 list would have read similarly, but my 2025 one? I’m maybe a little more hopeful than I’ve been in a while.</span></p> <p><span>In 2025, I’ve started to feel my spark come back. I’m writing things I’m proud of, I’m enjoying games like I’ve regained my sense of taste, and every now and again I get riled up about something happening in the industry with a passion that once felt like it had been siphoned out of me. In a roundabout way, my anger at an industry that keeps finding new ways to treat the people in it like they’re disposable is probably a good thing. A year ago, or even six months ago, I might have just let out a defeated sigh and rolled my eyes, then turned back to the blog mines. Now? I can feel my blood boiling again in a way it hasn’t in a long time.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are days when I still feel like I’m getting back on my feet, and like my legs are shaking underneath me as I try to stand tall again. Well, as tall as a 5’3” man can, at least. But if I’m feeling something about the games I’m playing and writing about, that’s an improvement over this time last year, when I wondered if I’d ever feel that again. Here are the 10 games that helped me get my spark back.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Honorable mentions: Battle Suit Aces, Absolum, After Love EP</span></i></p> <figure id="attachment_2000655449" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655449"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655449">© Surgent Studios</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>10.<i>&nbsp;Dead Take</i></b></h2> <p><span>Surgent Studio’s escape room horror game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439"><i><span>Dead Take</span></i></a> <span>was one of the biggest surprises of 2025 for me. Though I find its overreliance on jump scares exhausting, I was enamored with how it captures the horrors of being in a competitive, creative field. During a long exploration of an abandoned mansion after a party he wasn’t invited to, Chase Lowry discovers horrors beyond comprehension behind every locked door(and some captured on USB drives). Even if I’m not an actor, anyone who has worked in a competitive, creative field knows how dangerous people in power with a cult of personality can be. They’ll manipulate people into betraying one another, and the desperate will grovel at their feet in the hopes that some of their prestige and notoriety will trickle down into their hands. Desperation breeds tragedy, but so does selfishness, and </span><i><span>Dead Take </span></i><span>delivers that unmistakable truth in every corner and hidden passage of its mansion.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005257" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005257"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005257">© Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>9.<i>&nbsp;Split Fiction</i></b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i></a> <span>was an early favorite for GOTY that I feel like a lot of people cooled on pretty quickly. I understand why, to some extent. Its storytelling, while well-intentioned with its parallels to current anti-AI sentiment, is pretty amateurish for a game about fiction writers. But it also has the kind of varied, tight, cooperative platforming that only Hazelight is making these days, and the final level is a truly astonishing feat of technical prowess and design bravado that is so confident, you can tell Hazelight knew it was cooking when it pulled it off. I still remember how it felt when my co-op partner (shoutout </span><i><span>Restart</span></i><span>’s Jesse Vitelli) and I reached that moment in which the simulation of my character’s science fiction stories and his character’s fantasy ones overlapped, and the game didn’t so much as stutter as it seamlessly blended them both into one final, incredible set piece.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>8.<i>&nbsp;Goodnight Universe</i></b></h2> <p><span>There aren’t a lot of games that could possibly live up to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, which remains one of the most affecting things I’ve ever installed on a game device. The eye-tracking adventure game’s follow-up, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goodnight-universe-review-before-your-eyes-webcam-baby-2000642517"><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i></a><i><span>, </span></i><span>had incredibly big shoes to fill, and I have to commend developer Nice Dream for even trying. Though it didn’t hit me the same way its predecessor did, I was still moved by the team’s knack for drawing connections between its characters that echo every messy, tangled web of feelings we might have for one another. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s eye-tracking mechanics are simultaneously bolder and less thematically precise than those of its predecessor, which makes some sense considering its story is less straightforward, yet it still manages to bring it all together in a stunning closing chapter. But it is, to its detriment, not as focused as </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, so it doesn’t stick the landing as well. Even so, these guys are ones to keep watching, and I will be first in line for whatever comes next.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000003670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003670"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003670">© Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>7.<i>&nbsp;Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</i></b></h2> <p>I’m 33 years old now, and I’m still fighting battles I did as a kid. <a href="https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-2-review-dont-nod-swann-1851776436"><i><span>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</span></i></a> <span>is a game for the quiet kids who, even once they reach adulthood, overthink everything they say and do when they’re in a group setting. You can know everyone in a room loves you and wants you there, and you’ll still second-guess every word that comes out of your mouth. Don’t Nod’s supernatural narrative adventure is a return to the </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span> studio’s roots, and it’s wonderful to see the team back in its element, examining human connection in a way that, even if it appears singular on the surface, can resonate with anyone who’s ever once felt like they were on the outskirts of a group waiting for their turn to speak up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Even as I, playing as the introverted videographer Swann, sat in a small diner with people who were ostensibly my friends during the game’s modern-day segments, the flashbacks that colored in the lines of our relationship felt like the kind of intrusive adolescent memories that are embarrassing to look back on, as they’ve become distorted over time. </span><i><span>Lost Records</span></i><span> makes you look back on moments that felt huge as a kid only to realize they would feel small as an adult, but because they felt cataclysmic when you were young, the wounds they leave last far longer. The game</span> <span>understands that nostalgia and trauma intermingle, and examining one means encountering the other. The rose-colored filters through which we sometimes look back at the past can’t hide the challenges Swann and her friends sought to forget, and Don’t Nod is in top form as it lets you fill in the blanks.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000630352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630352"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630352">© Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>6.<i> Digimon Story: Time Stranger</i></b></h2> <p><span>When you finish </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a><span>, the credits will show little sprite versions of your party, as it existed in specific story moments, walking across the screen. For me, it was always some form of three Digimon: Guilmon, Gabumon, and Gatomon. These three have been my favorite Digimon for over 20 years, and every time I head back to the Digital World, I’m looking for these three.</span></p> <p><span>One thing I will give the </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games over most other monster-taming games is that their experimental evolution system means you can have just about any party you want right out of the gate. I’m a sentimental guy, and having my three favorite Digimon as my only party throughout the entire run of </span><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i><span> helped the RPG coast over some of the bumps in the road. I had my core three before I left the first dungeon, and I didn’t use any others throughout the rest of the main story. The advantage of these modular systems in monster-taming RPGs is that you are free to write your own story with your own party, and while I probably could have made the game easier if I’d traveled alongside other monsters, this was </span><i><span>our </span></i><span>story, and my friends aren’t replaceable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000283175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000283175"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000283175">© Ritual Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>5.<i> Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</i></b></h2> <p><span>I will take a rhythm game in just about any form I can get it, and as developers have started adding musical mechanics to just about any game they can, I’m not really hurting for options. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fretless-wrath-riffson-deck-builder-music-rpg-review-1851786514"><i><span>Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</span></i></a><span> marries sonic strategies and deck-building duels to such great effect that playing through its turn-based battles felt like reawakening to an old, often dormant version of myself who used to perform music professionally. I know a rhythm game is good when its musical minutiae becomes second nature to me, like the muscle memory of playing your favorite song on guitar. </span><i><span>Fretless </span></i><span>linking every dodge and damage boost to the beat of its music makes its timing-based mechanics a breeze because you feel it in the riffs and percussion underneath them. Sometimes I miss that old musician version of me, but it’s nice to know something like </span><i><span>Fretless </span></i><span>can bring him back out.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000621057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621057"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621057">© Too Kyo Games</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>4.<i> Shuten Order</i></b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/shuten-order-review-kodaka-danganronpa-hundred-line-2000621052"><i><span>Shuten Order</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> individual murder mystery routes might not seem like that much to write home about, but together, the “multi-genre” detective story is a pretty ambitious effort made of five compelling adventure game stories. Rei Shimobe wakes up with amnesia, and is told that God himself has tasked her with solving her own murder. To do this, she must investigate one of five possible suspects. Each suspect leads her down a different route, with each having a completely different set of mechanics to play with and mysteries to solve. Though you’re accusing a different person of facilitating your demise each time, following each path to its conclusion is the only way to find the truth. </span><i><span>Shuten Order </span></i><span>is full of signature Too Kyo Games twists and turns, and yet, even as a connoisseur of the team’s work, I was still enraptured by the game’s many mysteries, and how it managed to essentially create five different games within one.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000003155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003155"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003155">© Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>3.<i> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i></b></h2> <p><span>From its first hour, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>had its sights set on me, an RPG fan with a proclivity for stories that pick at every wound I’ve ever suffered. Sandfall Interactive’s debut game is a series of gutpunches punctuated by flashes of hope, with elaborate, timing-based battles in between. It circumvents a lot of the problems I have with turn-based games which can often feel too simple for my tastes, with battles that feel like wars of attrition rather than strategic encounters in which my build decisions truly make a difference. In </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>, dodging and parrying keep things interesting in the moment, but finding synergies in its characters’ bespoke mechanics is where the real thrills come in.</span></p> <p><span>But </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s grief-driven story is what has stuck with me the most. It is a story of despair, loss, and misdirection, with each twist more devastating than the last. Games about how the living must carry on when they have to leave those who have passed behind hold a vice grip on me. Grief holds a grip around my throat unlike any other experience in this life, and every time I see someone else’s interpretation of what it means to persist without those who helped you get where you are, I feel like I learn something new about how I handle it myself. Not every emotion and feeling </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> elicited from me on that front was a positive one. But I think that’s okay. I don’t think pretending grief always ends with acceptance is my style. It certainly isn’t </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000652247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652247">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>2.<i> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2> <p><span>There’s a moment in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> late game in which every named hero you’ve met in its Paris-inspired metropolis </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>bands together to save the city</span></a><span>, and it made me set down my controller and just take it all in. It has been three years since we got a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG, and it was within those three years that I’ve moved to New York City and grown to care about people and a place in a way I don’t think I ever have before. I’ve been putting off doing a lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a><span> DLC side quests because there’s something comforting about knowing I still have reason to go back to Lumiose City, as if when the credits roll, all those feelings of community and home might disappear.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is not a perfect game, and there are no doubt people reading this who are throwing tomatoes at their screen because I’m not mad about window textures, but it is a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game that speaks directly to me. Its real-time fights represent one of the most interesting evolutions of the series’ battle system, and make for a much more entertaining, almost puzzle-like iteration in which even quick fights feel fluid, strategic, and engaging in a way they don’t in even my favorite </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. But more than that, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> cultivates a feeling of belonging by focusing on a city and the people who would lay their life on the line to protect it and each other.</span></p> <p><span>I run around Lumiose with my Raichu by my side who, after a decade of waiting, can finally Mega Evolve, and stories play out in my mind of Grisham waving as we pass by his coffee shop, or Tarragon’s workers yelling at us as we climb their scaffolding. We return to Hotel Z and meet up with the rest of Team MZ, ready to discuss how we can best help the city as it struggles to figure out how to allow humans and Pokémon to live in harmony. I love going on journeys across a region in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, but for this moment in my life, a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game that spends a long enough time in one place to actually think about its world and how to make it a better place is exactly what I need. If the </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>series is going to be Game Freak’s place to experiment, I’m so on board for whatever it does next.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000002144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002144"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002144">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>1. <i>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</i></b></h2> <p><span>It’s kind of a bummer to say that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792"><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a><span> is my favorite game of the year but I will probably not be “finishing” it any time soon. I have seen Too Kyo Games’ incredible, ambitious visual novel/tactical RPG’s true ending, but there are still dozens of final chapters I haven’t seen myself. I don’t know if I ever will. The knowledge that so many are still waiting for me is so daunting, it keeps me from picking the game back up and diving in. But knowing those 90+ conclusions are in the game, and that I could have stumbled upon any of them if I’d made one different choice, is still such an achievement. Even as it intimidates me, I can’t help but be in awe of </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>I really can’t name a moment in a video game that hit me harder this year than the first “ending” in </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>. I’d spent 100 in-game days fighting an invading alien force attacking the titular academy only to fail the mission I’d been tasked with. I could let myself sit in that failure, or I could go back in time, repeat those 100 days, and hopefully do it better next time. I felt a mix of awe and anxiety, as I had an embargo coming up and realized the game was going to be, at minimum, twice as long as I’d anticipated. I wrote a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>vague impressions post</span></a><span>, singing its praises but not being able to explain why; then, a few weeks later, I finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><span>laid out what happened</span></a><span>, and why I wasn’t ready to review the game here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. I spent a vacation dragging myself through the game’s “truth” route, uncovering all the mysteries within the school and finding a stunning Kazutaka Kodaka finale. That guy hasn’t let me down once on that front, and it makes the promise (threat) of 100 endings as scary as it is tantalizing.</span></p>

 <p><span>I know I can count on Kodaka for a lot of things. He takes narrative swings most writers would shy away from; his work is polarizing and obnoxious on its way to making an incredibly profound and existential point about why any of us even bother to get out of bed in the morning when giving into nihilism and rotting away would be so much easier, and my god, does he know how to deliver it with the force of a baseball bat to the gut. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>isn’t just one of the most ambitious visual novels of all time, it’s led by one of the only writers with the gusto and reckless abandon to make it work.</span></p> <p><span>I hope one day that I’ll head back to the Last Defense Academy to uncover more of its secrets, silly antics, and strategic battles. But at the moment, what I’ve seen is enough to know that I could not have played a game this year that would have resonated with me more than </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everybody loves a great gift bundle, even when it’s of the DIY variety. If you already have a Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch 2 bought and wrapped and ready, there’s still time to create an awesome holiday bundle by making the very small addition of the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">Samsung P9 Express microSD card — the 256GB version is selling at Amazon for 40% off, and going fast.</a></p>
<p>The P9 Express microSD card isn’t exclusively a gaming accessory — it works like any microSD card, with the ability to add storage and memory to tablets, drones, digital cameras, and more — but it has the speed and thermal protection that make it ideal for handheld consoles like the Switch 2 and the Steam Deck. Its transfer speeds reach up to 800 MB per second, which is an impressive 4x faster than Samsung’s standard microSD cards. When you’re using it as an extended storage device for games and downloadable content, that speed makes a huge difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best of the Best</h2>
<p>Samsung’s enormous footprint in the tech world makes it easy to forget the fact that they’re also the world’s No. 1 flash memory brand, and have held that title since 2003. It makes sense that in the Samsung universe that’s populated by elite-level big-screen TVs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables, a humble microSD card that measures just 0.59 by 0.43 inches and weighs less than one-hundredth of an ounce can be easily overlooked.’</p>
<p>But the data sheet for the P9 Express microSD card makes it look like an absolute giant. That sequential read speed of 800 MB/s is tailor made for handheld gaming consoles. Games load and install far faster than with other microSD cards, and the all-important downloadable content that often requires weeks of gaming to earn is also safely stored and at the ready.</p>



<h2>More Than Just Fast</h2>
<p>The amazing speed is obviously the main draw to the P9 Express microSD card, along with its seamless compatibility with the market’s two top handheld gaming consoles — the Nintendo Switch 2 and the Steam Deck. Then there is its expansive compatibility with other tech devices like digital cameras, drones, smartphones, and more. But none of that would matter if the card itself was fragile, or prone to breakdowns and data failure.</p>
<p>Samsung, thankfully, has given the P9 Express six distinct forms of protection to ensure its long life and reliability. The P9 Express is designed to withstand extreme temperatures ranging from -13°F to 185°F, up to 72 hours immersed in seawater, airport x-ray machines, magnetic forces up to 15,000 gauss (equivalent to a high-field MRI machine), drops of up to 16.4 feet, and up to 10,000 swipes. Needless to say, it’ll survive the rigors of handheld gaming.</p>
<p>The Samsung P9 Express microSD card makes a fine stocking stuffer on its own because it’s so universally useful, but as a companion with a brand-new handheld gaming console, it’s a serious winner. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">It’s also selling seriously fast at Amazon right now, so get there before the 40% off deal dropping its price to just $33 ends.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After being announced in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-prime-4-1796058481">2017</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400#comments"><em>Metroid Prime 4: </em><em>Beyond</em></a> finally launched on Switch and Switch 2 earlier this month to solid reviews, but also plenty of complaints about the game’s open-world desert hub. Well, it turns out that despite realizing that players were souring on open-world games, development studio Retro was stuck with its design and had to finish it.</p> <p>In a new interview with Japanese video game magazine <em>Famitsu</em>, the development team behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585"><em>Prime 4</em></a> talked openly about the game’s controversial open-world hub and motorcycle. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-famitsu-interview-with-nintendo-staff-regarding-metroid-prime-4-beyond-its-development-history-origins-its-placement-within-the-timeline-etc.1392244/">The answer below comes from ResetEra via machine translation</a>:</p>

 <p>“At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying ‘we want to play an open-world <em>Metroid,</em>‘” explained an unspecified member of Retro Studios. “However, <em>Metroid’s</em> core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds. Thus, we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas.”</p>

 <p>However, the development of<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> took “longer than expected to finish” and had already been reset once <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/metroid-prime-4-on-nintendo-switch-samus-aran/">in 2019</a> after Bandai Namco, the game’s original developer, was removed from the project and replaced with <em>Prime</em> creators Retro. And in that time, Retro says fan feelings towards open-world games “changed.” But, apparently, another reset was “out of the question,” and so the team had to move forward with its open-world hub despite knowing that many players wouldn’t be happy about it.</p>

  <p>In the same interview, it’s further explained that during the creation of <em>Prime 4,</em> shooters and action games evolved and became faster. The team ignored these changes so it could retain the “tempo of an adventure game.” The end result, Retro says, is a game that is “pretty much divorced from the changing of times.”</p>

 <p>As for the inclusion of the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657">divisive motorcycle, Viola</a>, Retro told the outlet that it came about because the player moves fairly slowly in <em>Prime 4,</em> and traversing the large open area of the desert was a problem.</p> <p>“While Samus possesses high-speed abilities like the Boost Ball and Speed Booster, we determined that ‘riding a bike’ was the optimal solution to satisfy both the perspective of ‘moving freely and quickly across large areas’ and the perspective of ‘looking cool,” said Retro. “Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game.”</p>

 <p>It’s certainly nice to hear more about how these decisions were made, but it doesn’t change the fact that the open-world hub in <em>Prime 4</em> just didn’t work out.</p>
