              <p>Cooking can feel overwhelming if you’ve never mastered timing, temperatures or knowing when meat is actually done. The Ninja <em>DZ550</em> <em>Foodi</em> solves these everyday kitchen frustrations by removing all the guesswork from meal preparation through its integrated thermometer that tells you exactly when your food reaches the perfect doneness level.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5066/">dropped this dual-basket air fryer from $249 down to just $129</a>, and the timing creates a great opportunity if you’re looking for restaurant-quality results without culinary school training. The <strong>two independent 5-quart baskets</strong> eliminate the stress of coordinating multiple dishes because the <em>Smart Finish</em> feature syncs everything to complete simultaneously.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5066/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Independent Baskets That Transform Meal Preparation</h2>
<p>The <em>DualZone</em> Technology offers <strong>two completely separate cooking zones with independent fans and heaters in each 5-quart basket</strong>. You can air fry chicken wings in one basket at 400°F while roasting sprouts in the other at 375°F. Both finish cooking at the same time, thanks to the <em>Smart Finish</em> feature that automatically calculates timing differences. The <em>Match Cook</em> function copies your settings from one basket to the other instantly; this is very useful when you need to cook larger amounts of the same food in both baskets, and gives you a total 10-quart capacity. IQ Boost spreads the 1690 watts of power efficiently across both zones. This improves cooking speed when you are preparing different items at the same time.</p>



<p>The integrated Foodi thermometer takes the guesswork out of cooking proteins by continuously monitoring internal temperature throughout the cooking process. Just insert the probe into your chicken breast or pork chop, select your desired doneness level from rare to well-done, and the system alerts you as soon as your food reaches perfection. This feature is invaluable for novice cooks unsure when meat is safe to eat. It also prevents overcooking expensive cuts by constantly checking and maintaining heat. The temperature range goes from 105°F for gentle dehydrating up to 450°F for high-heat searing and air frying, allowing you control over every cooking method.</p>



<p><strong>Six cooking programs</strong> cover almost every meal preparation scenario you’ll encounter: <em>Air Fry</em> gives crispy results using little to no oil by circulating superheated air around food at high speeds and creates that satisfying crunch on fries, wings, and breaded items.<em> Air Broil</em> applies intense heat from above to caramelize the surfaces of meats and vegetables. <em>Roast</em> envelops food in moderate heat for even cooking, perfect for whole chickens or root vegetables. <em>Bake</em> offers consistent heat distribution for cookies, muffins, and casseroles. <em>Reheat</em> warms leftovers without making them soggy like microwaves do. <em>Dehydrate</em> removes moisture at low temperatures over long periods, making it ideal for jerky, dried fruits, or vegetable chips.</p>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch footprint fits two large baskets</strong> while keeping counter space in check. The unit cooks food up to 30% faster than conventional ovens by eliminating preheating time and focusing heat directly around the food. Both nonstick cooking baskets and crisper plates are dishwasher safe for easy cleanup, and the nonstick coating prevents food from sticking. The gray finish resists fingerprints and blends seamlessly into most kitchen color schemes. This air fryer turns frozen foods into crispy meals in about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This is the lowest price ever on this Ninja XL air fryer, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sure, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-buds-4-pro-only-have-one-shot-at-challenging-airpods-pro-3-2000677942">rumors about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are swirling around</a> but here’s the real deal you need to know right now: The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon, and they’re crushing the competition, including Apple’s AirPods Pro. These earbuds combine top-tier active noise cancellation with cutting-edge AI features that adapt to your environment in real-time: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">slashed the price from $249 down to just $165, and over 30,000 people have already grabbed them</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Sound Engineering That Rivals Studio Headphones</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have been totally revamped by Samsung from the ground up: The dual-driver design used in them stands them out in terms of design from almost every earbud existing on the market. In each earbud, there’s a 10.5mm dynamic woofer that’s complimented by a 6.1mm planar magnetic tweeter that’s driven by dual amplifiers. The two-way speaker design provides an outstanding separation of bass and high details.</p>
<p>This opens an incredible soundstage that’s as spacious as it gets considering that it’s an earbud. The stems on these earbuds aren’t only fashionable – inside them reside cutting-edge microphones that enable the adaptive functions and provide sound that’s as clear as it gets on calls that have a 15kHz bandwidth.</p>



<p>The <strong>adaptative active noise cancellation powered by Galaxy AI</strong> adjusts based on your environment and automatically reaches peak isolation levels throughout your daily routine. Riding on a crowded subway to work? The noise cancellation amps up to max isolation levels. Headed to your favorite coffee shop that’s a bit less crowded? The noise cancellation adjusts to save on battery life while still staying focused on your work.</p>
<p>The system automatically pairs perfectly with Siren Detect capabilities that automatically shift you to ambient mode as soon as it picks up emergency vehicle sounds. All of these come in conjunction with an adaptive equalizer that automatically adjusts based on the earbuds’ fit inside your ears. In plain sight, it adjusts sound profiles based on acoustic leakage. No matter whether it’s a workout routine or working at your desk, these earbuds deliver constant levels of optimized sound. The earbuds’ <strong>water-resistant rating of IP57</strong> guarantees extreme durability despite exposure to rain or heavy sweating.</p>



<p>Galaxy AI integration offers capabilities that genuinely add value as opposed to just being catchy: The <strong>real-time interpreter offers face-to-face conversation translations via your earbuds</strong>. This overcomes language barriers during travel or international business meetings: The service enables you to answer calls in a given language and receive translations of those conversations in another. This functionality functions during earbud conversations via the Samsung Phone app.</p>
<p>Battery life provides the same six hours with ANC enabled and seven hours without it, <strong>which goes up to 26 hours when using the wireless charging case</strong>. The charging case design includes a transparent lid as well as an easy-to-carry design that fits perfectly inside your pocket. The charging slot for wired charging is positioned at the bottom of the charging case.</p>
<p>The earbuds come equipped with the latest connectivity of Bluetooth 5.4. They also feature Auracast that enables easy broadcasting of sound to nearby devices with Auracast capabilities. The company provides an additional two-year Amazon warranty exclusively for Samsung users.</p>
<p>All these factors combined at such an unbelievable low cost make the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro an incomparable value.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-is-going-all-in-now-selling-its-1800w-delta-3-classic-power-generator-for-peanuts-2000639643</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter’s arrival brings shorter days and unpredictable weather which makes backup power more important than ever. Power outages can strike at the worst moments, leaving you without heat, refrigeration or the ability to charge essential devices. That’s where portable power stations come in, and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5064/">Amazon has dropped the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic (1800 AC output) to an all-time low of $399, down from $599</a>. This is the Classic model, which differs from the base Delta 3 by offering a more streamlined feature set at a much lower price point. For most households, the Classic delivers everything you need without the premium add-ons.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5064/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power Without the Premium Price Tag</h2>
<p>The Delta 3 Classic comes with a 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery that holds immense value in terms of practical battery life. LiFePO4 battery life may sound like an advertising gimmick at first: The truth remains that LiFePO4 batteries enjoy an <strong>unmatched lifespan of more than 10 years</strong>. That simply implies that you can power this power bank thousands of times with minimal capacity loss.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1800W of continuous power</strong> supports your necessary electronics without an issue. The fridge in your house may not get power. Carry a space heating device to heat your room. No issues at all. Coffee maker in the early morning hours at your camping site. Nothing is more important than that. The<strong> X-Boost Technology increases your power capacity to 2600W</strong>. The starting surge power of 3600W provides power to your devices that consume high startup power without shutting your system down.</p>



<p>Charging speed is what sets good power stations from great ones: In that respect, the Delta 3 Classic stands out. The X-Stream AC charging system gets your power <strong>levels from zero to 80 percent in only 45 minutes</strong>. Consider that for a moment: In that amount of time, it takes to watch an episode of your favorite TV show, you’ll have enough power to last your laptop an entire workday as well as keep your fridge full of cold food throughout an outage.</p>
<p>The &lt;10ms UPS or uninterrupted power supply function may not seem like much at first, but it’s actually an enormously helpful addition. As someone who works from home and deals with flickering power supplies on a daily basis, the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic’s seamless changeover from power to battery backup means that your computer won’t miss a beat.</p>



<p>The ability to charge via solar power raises the functionality of the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic to a whole new level. Using an optional 500W solar panel, you’ll be able to recharge the power station within 2.5 hours of direct sunshine. This turns the power solution from being an emergency power solution system to being a long-term off-grid power solution. Planning an adventure camping experience at a remote destination over an extended weekend? Use your solar solution setup during the day. No power at your destination due to a power outage? Solar charging solutions ensure that you’re not off grid.</p>
<p>At $399, the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic provides an incredible value within the portable power station industry.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate 20TB External Hard Drive Now Costs $0.10 per GB, 50% Cheaper than Launch Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-20tb-external-hard-drive-now-costs-0-10-per-gb-50-cheaper-than-launch-price-2000639636</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-20tb-external-hard-drive-now-costs-0-10-per-gb-50-cheaper-than-launch-price.1337692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Digital storage needs spiral out of control faster than you can keep up with them, and watching your available space shrink while cloud subscription costs climb month after month creates a frustrating cycle that never ends.</p>
<p>Seagate has lost its mind <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">with the pricing on its 20TB Expansion HDD, slashing it to $229 from the $499 launch price</a> which creates the situation where this massive drive costs less than the 12TB model still sitting at $299 on Amazon. You’re <strong>paying around $0.01 per gigabyte</strong>, half the launch cost and <strong>roughly ten times cheaper than equivalent SSD storage</strong> for this kind of capacity.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Mechanical Beats Solid State on Value</h2>
<p>SSDs dominate performance conversations with their 2,000 MB/s transfer speeds and instant access times, but when you need to store 20 terabytes of data, the math shifts dramatically in favor of mechanical drives: A 2TB SSD runs $150 to $200 (putting it at $0.07 to $0.10 per gigabyte) while this Seagate unit delivers the same price for ten times the capacity.</p>
<p>This <strong>Seagate drive pushes data at 220 to 246 MB/s over USB 3.0</strong> which handles large backup operations, media library management and archive storage without breaking a sweat since you’re not booting operating systems or running applications from external storage anyway. Moving a 50GB file takes roughly four to five minutes which is perfectly adequate for transferring weekend photo shoots or shuffling game installations between drives.</p>



<p>The quoted capacity of 20TB provides ample capacity for the <strong>retention of more than 5 million high-definition images at 3.5MB each, 4,000 hours of video at 1080p resolution, or 50 full game copies of 100GB on average</strong>. The drive comes pre-formatted with exFAT and allows it to work seamlessly with both Windows computers and computers from Apple without needing to format it once.</p>
<p>The setup process could not be simpler since you simply attach <strong>the 18-inch USB 3.0 cable from the drive’s micro-USB connector to your computer’s USB port</strong> and attach the 18W power adaptor to an electrical outlet. The set comes with international plug adapters that fit on the power brick; thus, various electrical outlets found in different nations won’t pose a problem. No need to install anything on your system since the process of getting underway happens in less than a minute as you simply drag files from your system to the drive icon on your desktop to copy them or drag them back to retrieve them.</p>



<p>The drive has the advantage of supporting backward compatibility on older ports of version 2.0. However, data transfer rates on these ancient interfaces become 30 to 40 MB/s. The power gadget uses wall current as opposed to drawing power from the universal bus. As such, the drive has unrestricted access to 7200 RPM on 3.5-inch disks without reducing laptop power without overstressing the power output on USB connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>data recovery services from Seagate come free</strong> with every purchase for professional data recovery needed in the worst of circumstances of drive failure and comes at an added cost of $500-$2,000. The limited lifetime hardware parts and labor warranty given by the company insures that the buyer can get a replacement should anything fail within a year of purchase.</p>
<p>The competitive pricing of this offer makes it even more impressive since Western Digital’s 20TB drives usually starts at $400 and enterprise-oriented solutions from companies like G-Technology cost $400-$500. In comparison to that, the lowest-priced category of drives like the <strong>reviewed Seagate solution offers the same capacity and speed at a way more affordable price</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-60000mah-power-station-is-cheaper-than-a-budget-no-name-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies-2000639627</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-60-000mah-power-station-is-cheaper-than-a-budget-no-name-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies.1337647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your phone dies at the worst moments. Your laptop battery gives up mid-presentation. Power outages leave you sitting in the dark scrolling through a phone at 5% battery. Generic power banks help a little but they barely charge your phone twice before needing a recharge themselves. The Anker <em>PowerCore Reserve</em> changes the game with 60,000mAh of capacity that can <strong>charge an iPhone 17 over ten times</strong>. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/"> just dropped this powerhouse to $79, down from $149</a>, hitting an all-time low price that costs barely more than a no-name 10,000mAh power bank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Battery Technology That Lasts a Decade</h2>
<p>The power bank uses LiFePO4 battery types. Although it may sound complicated, it’s actually very important: In normal Li-ion batteries used by those cheap power banks that last only a year at most, the charging cycle ends at 500 to 1,000 cycles. The power bank from Anker uses 3,000 cycles: That’s three thousand charging cycles or complete discharge cycles before the battery’s capacity reaches 80%. <strong>That’s around a decade of normal life</strong>.</p>
<p>The true advantage of LiFePO4 over a standard lithium ion battery is more than endurance: This form of battery prevents thermal runaway. In technical terms, LiFePO4 <strong>prevents overheating of a battery</strong> that eventually leads to it exploding in a fire. The high temperature tolerability of LiFePO4 ranges from –4°F to 140°F which makes it ideal for winter camping or summer road travel.</p>



<p>The <strong>192Wh battery capacity translates to 60,000mAh with a cell voltage of 3.2V</strong>. The battery provides enough power to charge a MacBook Air 2.9 times or power an LED light of 3 watts for 42.3 hours. The LED power duration comes in handy during prolonged power outages of several days when you may require constant illumination without having to recharge smartphones. The <strong>power bank comes with four charging ports</strong>: These include <strong>two charging sockets of 27W and 60W</strong> through the USB C charging sockets.</p>
<p>The <strong>XT60 input port supports the connection of solar panels</strong> with a capacity of up to 60W: The Anker power station can now become a sustainable off-grid power solution (the solar panels are not included). The power station takes around four hours to recharge with a 60W USB C wall charger.</p>



<p>The <strong>digital smart display</strong> takes over the face of the front panel and comes with information such as battery life, input power level, output power level, and estimated remaining life. This provides real-time data that helps you determine perfectly the amount of power being used and the remaining life based on current power levels. No need to guess whether you’ll have enough power to last the night.</p>
<p>The device measures <strong>4.59 inches wide, 4.59 inches deep, and 8.17 inches high</strong>: That’s comparable in size to a large water bottle. Weighing 5.1 pounds makes it heavy enough to be substantial but light enough to throw into a backpack or emergency kit. The green cloth exterior provides good traction that won’t slide off and comes with a flat-folded handle.</p>
<p>For $79 for a 60,000mAh LiFePO4 power bank that can recharge from the sun’s power, you’re paying pennies – 0.001 per milliamp-hour. That’s a fraction of what each power bank on the market costs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbls-mini-bluetooth-speaker-is-selling-for-pennies-now-cheaper-than-an-old-dumb-radio-2000639597</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl%E2%80%99s-mini-bluetooth-speaker-is-selling-for-pennies-now-cheaper-than-an-old-dumb-radio.1337644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tiny speakers get no respect, but they solve a real problem. Your phone’s speaker sounds terrible. Your laptop barely projects past your keyboard. You need music in places where dragging a full-size speaker makes zero sense: the shower, the kitchen counter while cooking, your workbench in the garage, or clipped to your backpack on a winter hike. Amazon just dropped the JBL Go 3 to $29, down from $39, hitting an all-time low price that puts this rugged Bluetooth speaker cheaper than most wired alarm clocks. At this price, you’re paying less than a dollar per hour of battery life for a speaker that can survive getting dropped in a snowbank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4565/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pocket-Sized Power That Survives Everything</h2>
<p>The JBL Go 3 has a width of 3.4 inches by 2.7 inches high and 1.6 inches deep, and a weight of 0.46 pounds. The speaker has a 43 x 47mm driver that produces 4.2 watts of sound: The sound signature of JBL’s Pro Sound design <strong>includes bass response from the tiny speaker</strong> instead of high-pitched treble on lower-priced models. The frequency response of the speaker includes 110 Hz to 20kHz to encompass the full range of your hearing.</p>
<p>The <strong>rating of IP67 water resistant and dust resistant</strong> provides that it can withstand being submerged in full water, at a depth of a meter for 30 minutes. Place it in your shower as you rinse off the chill. Use it on your countertop as you clean dishes from dinner. Attach it to your jacket as you walk out into the snow and aren’t concerned as freezing rain begins to fall. The speaker won’t slip from the countertop or smooth surface as it sits there. The attached loop of cloth that comes with it enables you to attach it to your shower hooks or carabiners.</p>



<p>The speaker <strong>comes with Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity that connects rapidly to smartphones</strong>, tablets, and laptops and provides a constant connectivity connection from 10 to 15 meters away. The five buttons on top of the speaker control power on/off, pair the speaker with devices via Bluetooth connectivity, play/pause music as well as increase and decrease the sound volume.</p>
<p>Battery life goes an <strong>estimated five hours on a single charge</strong> but it’s been known to extend well beyond that based on overall audio output levels. Charging only takes 2.5 hours via the new USB C port. This leaves behind those days of digging around for a proprietary charging cord only found in your smoking hot new TV or powering a brick-sized micro-USB wall charger.</p>



<p>The internal microphone provides speakerphone capability with noise and echo reduction: This makes it a convenience device for when <strong>you want to take your calls while cooking in the kitchen or showering</strong>. The speaker design provides mono sound that resonates from the front on one side. The rubber on the back of the speaker prevents it from slipping: This particular design trait appears practical for transportability as opposed to stereo sound that you won’t be needing inside a shower or kitchen.</p>
<p>At $29, the speaker may be purchased for less than the average ticket to a movie and provides years of enjoyment. Budget-friendly Bluetooth speakers usually have to cut back on either sound quality, durability, or battery life. The Go 3 doesn’t scrimp on anything in those departments.</p>

              <p>Amazon Game Studios has announced that just four years after release, <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-days-with-new-world-amazon-s-extravagant-food-harv-1847777090">its once-popular MMORPG <em>New World</em></a> will no longer receive content updates as it slowly begins its journey to the end.</p> <p>On October 28, shortly after news broke that Amazon was planning to lay off thousands of employees, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">Amazon Game Studios posted an update on <em>New World’</em>s official website</a> confirming that the game’s recently launched season 10 and Nighthaven update will be its last. In the post, the devs said that after an “incredible journey” with the community, <em>New World</em> has reached a point where it is “no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.” The MMORPG’s last big content drop, Nighthaven, has been made free to all PC players, as has the game’s <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em> expansion, which is needed to play Nighthaven.</p> <p><span>“Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this </span><span><i>New World</i></span><span> adventure an unforgettable journey,” said the devs.&nbsp; “We’re deeply grateful for every moment you’ve spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you. Thank you for helping make this game something truly special.”</span></p>

 <p>To be clear, <em>New World</em> isn’t shutting down today or any time this year. In an included FAQ, the devs claim players will still be able to play the game normally on all platforms, bug fixes will still happen, and you’ll even be able to keep buying in-game currency. The servers will remain open and operating “through 2026” to allow the community “<span>time to continue their adventures in Aeternum.” The studio says it will provide more details on <em>New World’</em>s future in the coming months and promised to provide a minimum of six months’ notice before shutting down the servers and killing the game completely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>While <em>New World</em> isn’t dead yet, the writing is on the wall for the MMORPG, <a href="https://kotaku.com/over-populated-new-world-servers-no-longer-allowing-new-1847790460">which at one point was one of the most played games on Steam</a>. In October 2021, <em>New World</em> launched to over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">900,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. It was a genuine smash hit for Amazon, a company that, up until that point, had struggled (and continues to struggle) to break into the game industry. But by March of 2022, player counts slipped into the mid 30-thousands and continued to dwindle. A console port and some big updates over the years helped keep <em>New World</em> afloat, but it seems like Amazon is finally done spending money on its once-popular MMORPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">as the retail giant rushes to replace people with AI.</a></p>

              <p>Halloween’s around the corner. Got plans? No? I’m not much of a costume party person myself, so I’ll be staying in to play a bunch of spooky games, and one that has recently caught my attention features a lovely injection of PSX-style retro grunge that I struggle to not just stare into for hours as I contemplate the grim realities of existence. Sound up your alley? Good.</p> <p><i>Labyrinth of the Demon King</i> arrived earlier this year on console and PC. At first glance, I just knew it had to be added to my Steam library. It features that kind of grim, low fidelity <i>dread</i> that the original PlayStation was so good at delivering in games like <i>Silent Hill</i>. It’s dark and moody as hell, making it perfect for late night gaming sessions during the autumn months as the world grows dark and cold.</p>

  <p>A first-person dungeon crawler, expect <i>Demon King</i> to put up a fight. It can feel a little <i>Souls</i>-y with its stamina bar and emphasis on timing your attacks and dodges correctly. Enemies also don’t always go down as easily as you want them to.</p>

 <p>I’m still early on in my trip through the titular labyrinth, but the vibes of this retro-horror experience are easily going to drag me in for many more hours. The game defaults to a 4:3 perspective, reminiscent of the days when we all were gaming on square-ish screens. You can change that to 16:9 or 16:10, which makes it a great option for the Steam Deck’s taller screen format.</p> <p>The game also features a demo, so if you’re curious but aren’t sure about thinning your wallet a touch, it’s easy to jump in. Besides, you need a game to play on Halloween and those annoying kids begging for candy at the door aren’t going to ignore themselves.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-boss-explains-xbox%E2%80%99s-controversial-new-approach-to-gaming.1337557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having failed to keep up with PlayStation through two successive hardware generations, Microsoft is <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">pivoting Xbox</a> into something other than a conventional console platform. What exact shape that will take remains to be seen, but CEO Satya Nadella just outlined three of the core principles that will seemingly guide this new era of Microsoft gaming.</p> <p>The executive, who’s currently on track to rake in almost $100 million <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-total-comp-rises-to-96point5-million.html">in fresh equity awards</a>, started by reminding daily business show TBPN that the biggest gaming business in the world remains the Windows business. Everything else, including Steam, is built on top of that. And following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is one of the biggest gaming publishers in the world. In other words, the Xbox brand <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">might be in shambles</a>, but Microsoft Gaming is bigger than ever. From there, Nadella laid out the company’s evolving approach to exclusivity, interactive content, and hardware.</p>

 <p>“We want to be a fantastic publisher, similar to the approach of what we did with Office,” he <a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983231937306354078">told TBPM</a> (via <a href="https://www.threads.com/@stephentotilo/post/DQXXIhPkd65"><em>Game File</em></a>). “We’re going to be everywhere, on every platform. We want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming, or the TV, so we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Satya Nadella says he wants Xbox gaming to be like Microsoft Office: everywhere. </p> <p>Says the best way to innovate is through strong profit margins that can support risk taking. </p> <p>Calls for new forms of interactive entertainment to compete with short form video. <a href="https://t.co/pRbIqncXCc">pic.twitter.com/pRbIqncXCc</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1983264670502006799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Second, we also want to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. And it’s kind of funny that people think about the console-PC as two different things. We built the console, because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. And so I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that’s unparalleled, that pushes I think, the system forward.</p> <p>So I’m really looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming, but most importantly the game business model has to be where we have to invent maybe some new interactive media as well. Because, after all, gaming’s competition is not other gaming. Gaming’s competition is short-form video. And so if we as an industry don’t continue to innovate both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model—best way to innovate is to have good margins. Because that’s the way you can fund.</p></blockquote> <p>For anyone who’s been <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-tiktok-switch-ps5-halo-2000639241">paying attention</a> to Xbox over the last 12 months, none of this should come as a shock, though seeing it come straight from Nadella shows there’s no question that these are the new marching orders for Xbox moving forward. While the idea of a next-gen Xbox that sports a more open PC gaming ecosystem offers a lot of promise, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">even if it’s priced at a premium</a>, the talk of higher profit margins shows this new direction comes at a cost.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has been mandating a 30 percent profit margin target across Xbox, a sprawling gaming division where not every project is a hit and hardware has traditionally been a lossl eader in the hunt for a future upside in the form of platform fees and reoccurring customer spending. While healthy profits might give Xbox room to experiment in the future, over the last 18 months it’s meant many canceled games and shuttered studios, and thousands of layoffs.</p> <p>Treating <em>Halo</em> like Microsoft Office and shipping it everywhere might be exciting to investors but it’s not going to win much goodwill from existing fans who just saw Game Pass nearly double in price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-preservation-program-private-detectives-drm-2000635611">Digital PC gaming storefront GOG</a> has looked outside and noticed all the leaves are orange and falling to the ground. So it’s time for a big ol’ Autumn Sale! This year, GOG has marked down over 4,000 PC games, including a whole bunch of classics that are well worth checking out in 2025.</p> <p>On October 28, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1983173386718019604">as spotted by deals guru Wario64</a>, GOG (formerly known as Good Old Games) <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/autumn_sale_2025?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true&amp;hideDLCs=true">launched its Autumn 2025 Sale.</a> The sale<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-fall-autumn-sale-2025-best-biggest-cheapest-deals-games-pc-steamdeck-2000629959">,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-fall-autumn-sale-2025-best-biggest-cheapest-deals-games-pc-steamdeck-2000629959">which follows Steam’s fall sale back in late September</a>, runs from now until November 4. So you’ve got about a week to pick through the huge list of discounted games and grab one (or more) to help you endure the coming weeks, which bring cold weather, snow, and family gatherings.</p>

 <p>For those curious to hop into the original<em> Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> ahead of (or perhaps after) playing the <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews-round-up-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-it-good-pc-ps5-xbox-2000636600">recently released sequel,</a> you can snag the OG game for just $10. And it, like many of the games on this list, is part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG’s “Good Old Game” preservation program</a>. That means it and others like it will continue to be maintained and supported by GOG for the foreseeable future, letting you easily play the original <em>Bloodlines</em> for years to come. On the flipside, if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tron-ares-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-jared-leto-fortnite-2000632606">new <em>Tron</em> movie</a> has you in a cyber mood, just know that<em> Tron 2.0</em> isn’t part of this program. So if you grab this classic PC game as part of the sale, you may want to download some mods to help make it play and run well on modern PCs.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s a list of good games and deals I spotted in <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/autumn_sale_2025?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true&amp;hideDLCs=true">GOG’s big sale</a>. No need to thank me.
