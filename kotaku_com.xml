              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is out now on PC via Steam and the Epic Store. And the looter shooter sequel is already the biggest <em>Borderlands</em> launch on Steam, with over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/">200,000 concurrent</a> players just a few hours after its release. But reviews on Steam aren’t great, as many players are struggling to even play the co-op FPS.</p> <p>On September 11, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched on PC. The long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">Gearbox’s<em> Borderlands 3</em></a> is a bigger, better, and wilder experience than the previous game, featuring a host of smart changes and additions to the classic looting-shooting formula. However, that’s only the case if you can actually play the game and enjoy it. And on PC, players are reporting lots of performance issues, even on hardware that Gearbox listed as meeting the needed specs.</p> <p>As of 4:30 pm EST on Steam, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Borderlands 4</a></em> has about 2,000 reviews that are perfectly divided between negative and positive, giving the game a 50 percent mixed status. That’s no good! Scrolling through reviews, the biggest complaints seem to be not about the content of the game, but about how poorly it performs on various hardware setups. Players are also complaining about stuttering and hitching, or being forced to use DLSS to play the game at a stable framerate. Others can’t even boot the game up, reporting crashes before they even get into the action.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are also plenty of reviews from people saying they had no issues at all and claiming that people complaining need to upgrade their PCs. This is the internet, so of course it devolved into a war with various sides and factions.</p> <p>In the reviews on Steam, the most popular culprits people are blaming for the bad performance include Unreal Engine 5 and DRM protection software Denuvo. Over the last year or so, Unreal Engine 5 has become a target online as players believe the engine isn’t well-suited to big games and is hard to optimize. The complaints have gotten so loud online that <a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-remake-capcom-2000620968#:~:text=Epic%20boss%20says,can%20step%20in.%E2%80%9D">Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a> even stepped in recently to defend the engine and lay the blame on devs who aren’t focused on optimization early enough in the cycle.</p>

 <h2>My experience playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC</h2> <p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> on PC for the last week, and my experience has been up and down. When I first got the game, I was playing on an RTX 3070 and struggled to run it at 1080p at 60FPS. I upgraded my rig to an RTX 5070 (something I had been planning to do for a few months now), and <em>Borderlands 4</em> ran much better. However, I still found that I needed to run the game with DLSS on and frame gen to reach 120 FPS at 1080 with some settings kicked down to medium.&nbsp; Considering the specs in the machine, I was surprised by how power hungry the game is, and I’ll admit that I continue to be disappointed with Unreal Engine 5 games.</p> <p>That said, ever since I found some settings that worked and downloaded the latest drivers, which weren’t available when I first got access to the game, I’ve been having a great time playing the game on PC. It mostly locks to 120 with my current settings and setup, and it feels great. I should also point out, though, that there’s been some chatter indicating that the day-one patch for the game, which arrived shortly before launch, may have caused problems that weren’t present when critics and content creators were playing it pre-release. In my quick tests, I’ve found the most recent patch, the one people are playing with on Steam right now, seems to bring with it some issues that weren’t present before the day-one patch. But I need to play more to really see if things are broken.</p> <p>I hope Gearbox issues a patch on PC soon to help improve things a bit. Or at the very least, get rid of Denuvo ASAP.</p>

              <p>Have you seen this guy on TikTok playing games in the most serene places imaginable? <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thescenicgamer">The Scenic Gamer</a> travels all over playing games with iconic locations while he is set up in their real-life counterparts (or the closest thing he can find to it). He’s slaying <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>at the beach and&nbsp;<em>Firewatch</em> in the center of Yellowstone National Park — all on an old Toshiba CRT. Dude’s living the dream. But how’s he managing to power that TV and Nintendo GameCube without an outlet for miles? If you want to follow in his footsteps, <strong>you’ll need portable power station such as the Anker 521</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">The mini generator is normally listed at $200, but for a limited time you can get it for 20% off.</a> That brings the price down by $40 so you only have to pay $160.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Anker 521 portable power station comes equipped with six different ports to supply you with all your power needs when out in the wild. Along the front of the unit, you’ll find two AC ports, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a car outlet. You can recharge or power up to six devices at once.</p>

<p>The power station is capable of fast, reliable charging. The Anker 521 can keep a 40W mini fridge running for over five hours. Keep a fan going for nearly six. Or recharge a 13Wh camera more than 15 times over. A 12Wh smartphone can be brought back from zero to 100% 16.5 times over. Power times can be extended further by using power-saving mode. Featured on the front of the power station is a LED display providing info on the power output and remaining battery life of the anker 521 itself.</p>



<h2>Optional Solar Panel</h2>
<p>Then when the power station itself needs a recharge, it can be brought back up to at least 80% in just two and a half hours when plugged into the adapter that’s packaged with it. If you’re taking the power station on an extended getaway in the outdoors, you can also recharge it via solar energy. As an optional add-on, you can bundle your Anker 521 with a 100W solar panel. It can be adjusted to four different angles so you can maximize the energy it’s able to take in based on the sun’s position overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">For a limited time, you can save 20% on the Anker 521, grabbing it for just $160.</a> If you choose to bundle with the solar panel, it’s 30% off from $499 which brings it to just $350.</p>

              <p>The next <em>Mario Bros.</em> movie is out April 2026 and it still doesn’t have an official title. Unofficially, however, the titles has seemingly leaked thanks to recently registered domain names, and all signs point to a riff on <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476">Per Wario64</a>, the domain name supermariogalaxy.movie was registered by NBCUniversal earlier this month, followed by&nbsp;supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com and supermariogalaxy-lapelicula.com on September 10. They <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/">redirect to Universal’s homepage</a> and match up with the conventions used for the domains for the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/EHknBYD082">https://t.co/EHknBYD082</a> (Super Mario Galaxy film) domain also registered by NBC Universal on Sept 3rd.</p> <p>For the first movie, Universal used <a href="https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS">https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS</a> for the movie's website (now points to VOD/Disc links since it's been out for years) <a href="https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI">https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI</a> <a href="https://t.co/2uvjPnIwJQ">pic.twitter.com/2uvjPnIwJQ</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This backs up a leak from months ago when a photo of labels featuring the title <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> on Old Spice deodorant <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1m2k08v/super_mario_2_old_spice_leak/">started making the rounds online</a>. It wasn’t clear at the time if it was an elaborate fake or not, though the renders showing Yoshi and Luigi looked authentic. The latest information about the domain names suggests it was legit.</p>

 <p>“Can’t believe that the <em>Mario</em> movie sequence was leaked by an Old Spice merch, of all things,” the YouTube account NintendoFan <a href="https://x.com/NFan_Official/status/1966200638213337371">posted on X</a>. “What a crazy timeline! I loved Yoshi’s look on that little can. Now it’s just a matter of waiting to see it in 4K.”</p> <p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> ended with Bowser defeated and Mario and Luigi returning to their lives in Brooklyn while a post-credits sequent revealed a hatching Yoshi egg somewhere in the sewers. There weren’t any other strong leads on where the second movie would take things, but the apparent title suggests at the very least the gang is headed into space. Maybe to try and find a home for Yoshi?</p>

   <p>2007’s <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> for the Wii sees the plumber hopping from planet to planet in order to free magical stars for Rosalina’s ship, called the Comet Observatory, which got messed up by Bowser. The game features a star character, Lumalee, who already appeared in the first movie. At the same time, <em>The Super </em><em>Mario Bros. Movie</em> was a reimagining of the series lore more than a remix of it, so <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> will likely have its own twist on the elements of the game, if it borrows directly from them at all.</p> <p>One last thing worth noting is that the Old Spice art showed a Tostarenan from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> hanging behind Luigi. So whatever Nintendo and Minions studio Illumination Entertainment are planning, it’s likely much bigger than any one <em>Mario</em> game. The second movie hits theaters on April 3, 2026.</p>
