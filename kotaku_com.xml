              <p><span>I’m always saying that Raichu, the evolution of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s mascot, is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>constant target of disrespect</span></a><span> from both The Pokémon Company and the community at large. Well, now some collectors with far more expendable cash than I’ll ever fathom are in a high-stakes bidding war to buy one of the electric mouse’s rarest cards. The fabled “Prerelease Raichu” card is up for auction, and the bids have already surpassed six figures.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000624736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624736"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624736">© Heritage Auctions</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For those that don’t know, the “Prerelease Raichu” card is the stuff of legend. According to reports dating back to the late ’90s, around 11 copies of the original Raichu card with “PRERELEASE” text stamped in the corner of the artwork were accidentally produced by Wizards of the Coast employees. These cards were mixed in with pre-release Clefable cards that were given out at events in the ’90s, and they were supposed to have been destroyed, though a few were supposedly saved by WOTC workers. Back in 2023, CGC Cards </span><a href="https://www.cgccards.com/news/article/12277/"><span>certified two of the Raichu cards</span></a><span>, confirming that they were indeed legitimate. Now, one of these legendary cards is up for auction on </span><a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-raichu-14-unlimited-base-set-prerelease-psa-trading-card-game-ex-mt-6-wizards-of-the-coast-1999-holo-rare/a/7424-36062.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515"><span>Heritage Auctions</span></a><span>, and as of this writing, its current bid is a whopping $135,000.</span></p> <p><span>It’s certainly not the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633"><span>most money anyone’s ever paid for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card</span></a><span>, but it is a pretty cool piece of history that probably should go somewhere other than a WOTC employee’s attic. As of right now, only a couple of these rare misprints are accounted for. It’s entirely possible some of these Raichu cards have been lost or destroyed in the past 25 years, but at least someone might be able to save and preserve one of them. Someone with more money than I’ll probably see in this lifetime. What do you think it’s like to be so rich you can just drop six figures on a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card? At least it’s being spent on my underappreciated favorite. $135,000 isn’t nearly enough for you, Raichu. Someone raise the bid. Put your money where your mouth is.</span></p>

              <p>After seven long years, <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> has finally left the realm of games we’re always hoping to see at some event or showcase. Silkpost no more. We can all finally play <i>Silksong–</i>and for just 20 bucks at that!</p> <p>With a few days of playtime under their belts, folks have flocked to the internet to opine, elating over finally getting to play such a long-awaited game, and despairing over a surprisingly steeper learning curve than some were expecting.</p> <p>So let’s turn our attention to the Steam reviews section of <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> to see how it’s faring with the chorus.</p> <p>At the time of writing, <i>Silksong</i> is enjoying a “Very Positive” status for its English-language reviews. Fans have rushed in to share their enthusiasm for the long-awaited game. Those who aren’t as excited, as you might expect, are frustrated with not merely the difficulty, but how various challenges seem to feel like unfair “gotcha” moments. Many positive reviews, however, echo back that the game is much more manageable once you get deeper into the story and have amassed some more powerful skills.</p> <p>So let’s jump into some standout reviews, both of the silly and (somewhat) useful kind.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000624693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624693"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624693">©

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-75w-car-charger-with-dual-device-support-goes-for-peanuts-in-a-trending-amazon-deal-stock-moving-quickly-2000624524</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-75w-car-charger-with-dual-device-support-goes-for-peanuts-in-a-trending-amazon-deal-stock-moving-quickly.1293840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Forgive us for making a sweeping assumption, but we’re going to take a stab and say your car’s phone-charging situation could use a massive upgrade. Maybe your USB ports are located in that impossible to reach compartment behind the shifter, or your overly long cord is constantly getting in the way. Any shortcomings you might be dealing with are instantly fixable for a tiny price while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/">Amazon is running this limited-time $25 deal on the 75W Anker Nano Car Charger</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker Nano plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter and charges two devices independently, one via the 45W built-in retractable USB-C cable, and another via the open 30W USB-C port. The retractable cable extends to 29.5 inches, so anyone in the first 2 rows of your vehicle can access it. It’s also not just for smartphones — any USB-C device from your wireless earbuds to your laptop can get a rapid charge while you drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>NoMore Cable Drama</h2>
<p>Finding the perfect USB-C cable to reach from your car charger to your hands-free phone mount must be some kind of dark art, because they all seem to be either too short to reach or so long that they get in the way of your car’s touchscreen or other parts of the console. The retractable USB-C cable built into the Anker Nano Car Charger is, to put it mildly, an ingenious way to keep the car’s cockpit neat and organized, and it’s tested to endure over 10,000 retractions.</p>
<p>The second port in the Anker Nano Car Charger is tailor made for the front passenger, which beats having to split charging time on long drives. No matter how you share the two fast-charging ports of the Anker Nano Car Charger, there’s enough juice to take an iPhone 15 Pro from 0% to 50% in just 25 minutes, and a 2022 MacBook Air from 0% to 50% in 34 minutes. Android devices with USB-C charging ports are also compatible.</p>



<h2>Power Delivered Safely</h2>
<p>Anker bolsters the fast-charging power of the Nano Car Charger with the safety features they are famous for. Built-in ActiveShield 3.0 technology protects your devices from damage caused by overcurrent, overvoltage, and under-voltage, and also constantly monitors its own temperature and the temperature of your devices.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this whole deal isn’t the fast charging or the even the retractable cable. It’s the price — even without this Amazon deal, the Anker Nano Car Charger’s regular price is a modest $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/">But with this limited-time deal taking that down by 38%, it’s safe to say the Anker Nano is the best $25 charger you can find.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’re coming up on the first anniversary of Nintendo’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124"><span>lawsuit against Pocketpair</span></a><span>, the developer of the edgy “</span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>with guns” survival game </span><i><span>Palworld</span></i><span>, on the grounds of patent infringement. Though many people called out </span><i><span>Palworld</span></i><span> for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580?_gl=1*21id2z*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjcwMzk2My4xODguMS4xNzI2NzA0MDI1LjYwLjAuMA.."><span>suspiciously familiar character designs</span></a><span>, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went after Pocketpair not for the appearance of its creatures but for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965"><span>in-game mechanics</span></a><span>, such as aiming and firing an “item” at a character in a field to trigger combat, capturing creatures in the wild, and riding on creatures you can swap between easily in an open world. These are extremely broad and non-specific, and if Nintendo felt like it, the company could easily go after plenty of other games beyond </span><i><span>Palworld </span></i><span>on those grounds. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company aren’t done patenting vague concepts in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series, though, as the companies have just patented more mechanics in a development that could affect the entire monster-taming genre.</span></p> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/"><i><span>Games Fray</span></i></a><span>, a site dedicated to reporting on patent law and other legal issues in the video game industry, reports that Nintendo has received a U.S. patent for the mechanic of “summoning a character and letting it fight another.” The step-by-step breakdown of what this entails reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>(1) A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein a game program, the game program causing a processor of an information processing apparatus to execute:</span></p> <p><span>(2) performing control of moving a player character on a field in a virtual space, based on a movement operation input;</span></p> <p><span>(3) performing control of causing a sub character to appear on the field, based on a first operation input, and</span></p> <p><span>(4) when an enemy character is placed at a location where the sub character is caused to appear, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a first mode in which the battle proceeds based on an operation input, and</span></p> <p><span>(5) when the enemy character is not placed at the location where the sub character is caused to appear, starting automatic control of automatically moving the sub character that has appeared; and</span></p> <p><span>(6) performing control of moving the sub character in a predetermined direction on the field, based on a second operation input, and, when the enemy character is placed at a location of a designation, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a second mode in which the battle automatically proceeds.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Again, this is a pretty general idea that is utilized in plenty of other games, from monster-taming rivals like </span><i><span>Digimon</span></i><span> to more general games like </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> that include summonable creatures. It seems unlikely that Nintendo would suddenly start going after partners like Bandai Namco or Square Enix, who have released games on Nintendo platforms without issue, but on principle, Nintendo patenting vague mechanical ideas as a means of monopolizing a genre is a shitty look, and rubs against the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise’s image as something wholesome and joyful. Not that the facade hasn’t already fallen multiple times at this point. The Pokémon Company has so many problems with things like the quality of its games and with making decisions that enable scalpers to capitalize on its merchandise, problems it never really addresses because it’s too successful to fail. It sure has time to patent fairly standard video game mechanics to help it corner the market, though.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Palworld </span></i><span>lawsuit is ongoing, though Nintendo did </span><a href="https://screenrant.com/nintendo-palworld-lawsuit-update-pantents/"><span>make some changes to the phrasing of the suit</span></a><span> back in July.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! It’s cooling down where I live, which makes me so damn happy. Anyway, welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we got a big update for a classic indie game, a way to get <em>Borderlands 4</em> for free, a hidden mode in <em>Silksong</em>, and Treyarch making more changes to what will and won’t transfer into next year’s <em>Call of Duty.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Treyarch Changes Its Plans With (Some) <em>Black Ops 6</em> Skins Again</h2> <p>The <em>Call of Duty</em> wacky cosmetics saga continues. Last month, following a large online<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-call-of-duty-wacky-weird-skins-dev-explains-1851719188"> backlash against ugly crossover skins</a> and serious competition from<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s popular and grounded beta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Activision and Treyarch announced that <em>BLOPS6′</em>s skins won’t carry over into </a><em>Black Ops 7.</em> The idea was to give the upcoming sequel a fresh start and not have people running around as Stan Smith from <em>American Dad</em> on day one. A lot of people liked this change, but not everyone was happy that the skins they’d worked hard for would not be moving forward. So uh, Treyarch is making some more changes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">That's not all! The Guild Override camo is joining the Zombies Main Quest Reward &amp; "New Orders" Operator skins, and will be available at the launch of Black Ops 7 for those who digitally Pre-Order 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/Jz3GoZZyTq">pic.twitter.com/Jz3GoZZyTq</a></p> <p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1965567701574975757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1965567701574975757">On September 10, Treyarch announced on social media</a> that some zombie-related skins would now carry over into<em> Black Ops 7</em>. Specifically, the Operator Skin rewards earned by completing main quests and the New Orders Prestige Level 1000 cosmetic items. So no, it doesn’t seem like all the wacky crossover skins from last year will be showing up in <em>Black Ops 7</em>, but who knows? Treyarch and Activision are changing things up so fast right now that in a few weeks, this might all be out the window. It’s almost like Activision is a bit nervous about how much of a bite <em>Battlefield 6</em> might take out of it this holiday season.</p>

 <h2>Drink Enough Beers, And You Might Get A Free Copy Of <em>Borderlands 4</em></h2> <p>Do you like drinking beer? Do you like <em>Borderlands 4</em>? Do you like free video games? Are you tired of answering my questions? Well, I’ll stop and explain that Gearbox, 2K, and beer maker Voodoo Ranger have teamed up for a new promotion. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-beer-includes-a-copy-of-the-game-if-youre-lucky/1100-6534578/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">As spotted by <em>GameSpot</em></a>, a bunch of specifically branded Voodoo Ranger beers will contain various <em>Borderlands 4</em> rewards, including 1,000 free copies of <em>Borderlands 4.</em> So to have a decent shot, all you need to do is buy like 200 beers, and that probably isn’t very expensive, right? I don’t drink booze, so let me do a quick search online and…oh my god!</p> <h2>There’s A Hidden, Much Harder Mode In <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p>Since the moment it was released earlier this month, popular 2D action platformer <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has been at the center of quite the discourse around video game difficulty. Some people say it’s too hard, others say it’s not too bad, and still others are just skipping all of this and modding the game to make it easier. Well, don’t worry, there’s a secret difficulty option hidden in the game behind the Konami cheat code. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n8d1xc/cheat_code_discovery_not_joke/">But this newly discovered secret mode</a> actually makes <em>Silksong</em> much, much harder as you can only die once. Good luck with that!</p> <h2>The 14-Year-Old <em>Binding Of Issac</em> Just Got A Massive Update</h2> <p>Yeah, sure, the creator behind 2011’s roguelike classic<em> The Binding of Issac</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-years-after-it-was-announced-binding-of-isaac-creator-finally-shares-a-release-date-for-his-next-game-2000623148">recently announced </a>the release date for his long-awaited next game, but that doesn’t mean he can’t keep working on his OG hit. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/521976260528701584">On September 9, Edmund McMillen announced a big new update for </a><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/521976260528701584"><em>Isaac</em></a> that includes many, many changes and tweaks to the beloved indie game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s new hard mode, Deep of Night, is about to go live, and publisher Bandai Namco has released a new explainer on YouTube helping to onboard fans to the multiplayer roguelite’s most challenging content yet. Combined with reams of datamined clues over the past month, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect heading into it. FromSoftware will no doubt have a few surprise curveballs hiding up its sleeve, but the announced changes alone should be enough to make even veteran Nightfarers feel like naïve grist for the Soulslike mill all over again.</p> <h2>When does Deep of Night go live?</h2>  <p>In keeping with all past updates, <em>Nightreign</em>‘s new mode is set to be available in the game starting around 9:00 p.m. ET on September 10 across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</p> <h2>Nightlords and shifting Earth events will be completely random</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624683">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>In Deep of Night, players wont get to pick which bosses they face ahead of time, or choose which Shifting Earth events are active. Relic choices and builds will all have to be adapted to on the fly. You’ll want to have multiple relic presets ready so you can choose after seeing what Nightlord you’re facing before the match loads.</p>

 <h2>Enemies hit way harder</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624682"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624682">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>A clip from the Deep of Night trailer shows trash mobs taking several more hits to fall at the start of a run. According to datamines, most enemies in the first depth will have around double their normal health and power, with stats only ramping up from there.</p> <h2>Items come with more buffs and debuffs</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624680" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624680"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624680">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Players will have to be a lot more careful about what they pick up when they’re running around Limveld. While gear comes with extra buff slots, it also comes with a debuff that will make it easier to die. Examples shown include status ailment buildup upon getting hit and taking more damage from the Night’s Tide.</p>

 <h2>New red mutated enemies are extra tough but drop new rare gear</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624681"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624681">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>These variants will be even stronger, potentially stopping a run dead in its tracks. Hoping to swoop through a mine for a quick crafting stone? Thought you could demolish that Cathedral golem all by yourself? Not this time! But with the greater risk comes greater rewards. It seems like these red enemies will also drop red gear with new powers that will probably end up making or breaking runs.</p> <h2>Additional Deep Relic slots expand buildcrafting</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624678" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624678"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624678">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Players will have access to three additional relic slots that can only be filled with relics earned from Deep of Night. That’s because these will each come with negative stats as well as positive ones. According to datamines, examples include ones that completely invert character’s usual stat progressions. Fighters can become spell casters, squishy glass cannons can become tanks. It looks like Deep of Night will completely turn the established build metas on their heads.</p>

 <h2>Sometimes the map will be completely empty</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624677"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624677">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>There are at least two randomly occurring events we currently know about in Deep of Night. The first will hide the Nightlord icon for the entire run so you have no idea who you’re facing at the end. The other will erase every icon from the map so you have no idea what camps are where. Players will just have to wing it or rely on their memorization of the probabilities from the hundreds of randomized seeds a run can pull from.</p> <h2>Completing runs earns rank points to unlock challenging depths</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624684"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624684">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>This scoring system will double as a skill-based matchmaking system for grouping you with other Deep of Night players. Once you progress out of Depth 1 you can never go back, but every Depth after that can see you pushed back to an earlier one if you keep failing.</p>

 <h2>Everdark Sovereign bosses can appear</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624675"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624675">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>That’s right, ED Libra and the gang could be what greets you at the end of an already harrowing run. Good thing you’ve spent months practicing each of those variants, right? Right??</p> <h2>The Bell Bearing Hunter just got scarier</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624679" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624679"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624679">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>The game’s hardest field boss can also be one of its red variants. Have fun! I’m sure wasting five minutes trying to kill him will be totally worth it. If you want to find out more about what to expect out of Deep of Night before embarking on your own run, YouTuber Scavinjx <a href="https://youtu.be/Lj6hgSh2AxM">has a great breakdown</a> of many of the new relic effects, passives, and exact damage and health multipliers based on recent datamined info.</p>
