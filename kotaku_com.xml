Casting pretense aside, he took his anti-vigilante stance to dictatorial levels by killing the police commissioner and trapping opposing political figures as well as the Punisher (Jon Bernthal) in an underground wine cellar, and placing the greatest city in the world under martial law. D’Onofrio took to X hours after the Season 1 finale was released to inform fans that shooting for the next season has already begun, and sharing a behind-the-scenes photo of Fisk in his cocaine-white power suit. In his <em>Variety</em> interview, he also revealed how Punisher escaping Fisk’s cage will affect the next season.</p><p>“I think that he does know that he’s gone. Eventually, he knows that he’s not there anymore. So far it’s a small part of the second season. We have to see what the one-off thing that they’re planning on doing with the Punisher, that should be interesting to see.” </p><p>The “one-off thing” he’s referring to is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jon-bernthal-punisher-special-marvel-disney-1236146371/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jon-bernthal-punisher-special-marvel-disney-1236146371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standalone special presentation</a></span> centered around the Punisher, which Bernthal will be co-writing.

What we seemingly shouldn’t expect is for his captor to make an appearance, as D’Onofrio says it would be “news to me” if Kingpin appeared. <br></p><p>Then again, I’m sure Kevin Feige and the Marvel brain trust have taught their lead talent how to hide future plans behind lies. So don’t be surprised if Punisher and Kingpin finally square off when the<em> Punisher</em> special feature is released in 2026, around the time of the second season of <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They then allegedly received a response that said this: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>remastered is set to release on April 21, 2025. It is confirmed to be a day-one launch title on Xbox Game Pass which strongly suggests that it will be available for cloud gaming.</p></blockquote><p>When pushed for more evidence, as DM screenshots can be faked, the user shared a video showing the entire conversation and seemingly confirming that, yeah, the Xbox support account actually spilled the beans. Oops! </p><p>At first I wanted to chalk this up to a bot accidentally confirming info before it had been announced. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912510613634379868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912510613634379868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But as pointed out by Raven on Twitter</a></span>, at least <em>one </em>of the messages seems to have come from a “live service agent” aka a human being. So maybe this is actually human error? Or a bot pretending to be a human made a very human-like whoopsie? </p><h2 id="h24977"><a id=""></a>We tried asking the Xbox support account for info</h2><p>After seeing the DMs, I decided to give it a shot myself and see what happened. I reached out to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/XboxSupport&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/XboxSupport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox support account</a></span> and asked about <em>Oblivion </em>as well, and after a lengthy wait, a live service agent sent me this reply: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Hello Zack, thank you for contacting Microsoft. Unfortunately, there is nothing officially announced regarding this matter. We will keep you updated using our social media channel.</p></blockquote><p>I didn’t give up that easy. Instead, I replied with “MENU” as I had done earlier. This had previously provided me with a bot and options to ask different questions about my Xbox account and games. However, this time, I didn’t get a menu. Instead a few minutes later another message from a live service agent popped up in my inbox. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> At this time, there is no official information available regarding the release or availability of this title. We understand the excitement and interest, but as of now, nothing has been formally announced. We encourage you to keep an eye on Xbox’s official channels, including our website and social media platforms, for any future updates or announcements. As soon as there is confirmed information, it will be shared publicly through those outlets</p></blockquote><p>It seems the bot has been shut down and the live service agents running the account have been told to stop sharing details about a remaster that hasn’t even been announced yet. Anyway, it looks like we all might be playing <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remastered next week on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Game Pass.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
