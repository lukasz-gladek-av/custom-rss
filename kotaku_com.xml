              <p>Govee had great deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but those sales are over now. However the company <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/">just put this TV backlight (<em>3 Lite</em> model) on sale for a short time, bringing the price down to $58, down from $89</a>, which is the <strong>lowest price we’ve ever seen</strong>, matching the best Black Friday price. Amazon shows that 10% of stock has already moved, and these flash sales typically disappear fast once word gets out.</p>
<p>This lighting system fixes the problem of wanting immersive bias lighting that changes color with what’s on screen instead of just glowing a static color behind your TV. The camera-based sync technology<strong> reads what’s on your screen and projects those colors onto the wall behind your TV.</strong> This makes the room feel more inviting and makes movies and games more immersive.</p>

<h2>How Fish-Eye Correction Makes Sync More Accurate</h2>
<p>The camera on top of your TV records what’s on the screen and analyzes it in real time to<strong> figure out what colors should be on each part of the LED strip</strong>. Traditional ambient lighting systems have trouble being accurate because cameras distort the images they take, especially at the edges where fish-eye warping makes it hard to tell what color it is.</p>
<p>This <strong>model has built-in fish-eye correction</strong> which means that the camera applies inverse distortion to the image it takes before it analyzes colors. This means that the lighting matches what is happening on screen instead of showing vague approximations: You can see this more clearly in scenes with clear color zones, like a sunset on one side of the screen and dark shadows on the other.</p>



<p>The<strong> RGBICW LED setup has red, green, blue, independent cool white, and warm white chips</strong> in each lamp bead. This lets you choose from four different colors for each segment along the strip. This multi-chip design makes the system better at making whites and pastels than RGB-only strips, which make white by mixing red, green, and blue at full brightness. The separate white chips also let you use these lights as functional bias lighting with the right white temperatures when you’re not watching something that needs color sync. The <strong>11.8-foot length is long enough to cover 55-65 inch TVs</strong> with enough strip to run along three sides of the display which makes the wrap-around effect without the need for complicated multi-strip installations.</p>
<p>It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to set up: You just have to clean the back of your TV, stick the LED strip along the edges, put the camera on top of the display, and plug everything into the adapter that comes with it. To accurately detect colors, the camera needs to be able to see your whole screen clearly. So, you should place it in the middle and make sure that soundbars or other equipment don’t block it.</p>



<p>You can also<strong> control the lights through the Govee Home app if you have Wi-Fi</strong>: The app lets you choose from different scene modes, colors, and sync sensitivity settings that change how quickly the lights respond to changes on the screen. You can turn down the reactivity during fast-paced action scenes that would otherwise cause distracting strobing effects, or turn up the sensitivity for subtler content where you want even small color changes to show up in the ambient lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to screen sync, <strong>the system has several preset modes</strong>: These include music sync, which changes colors to the beat of the music, static colors for ambient lighting, and scene modes that are meant for certain moods or activities. In music mode, your phone’s microphone picks up beats and rhythms and makes lights that react to the sound in the room. These other modes make the strip useful for more than just watching movies.</p>
<p>This $31 discount is 34% off which means that premium TV bias lighting is now in the impulse-buy range, where you can try it without making a big financial commitment. For less than the cost of basic RGB strips that don’t have any sync features, you get camera-based screen sync with fish-eye correction, RGBICW color capabilities, and smart home integration.</p>
