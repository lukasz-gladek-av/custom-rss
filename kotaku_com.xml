When you finally get your hands on the new game, you’ll be destroying everything at 60FPS, and that’s because Nintendo believed it was necessary for this latest Donkey Kong adventure. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196698" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 15, Nintendo posted a lengthy and interesting three-part interview</a></span> with <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>’s lead developers. Topics discussed in the interview include redesigning Donkey Kong, figuring out the game’s tone and mood, and more. But one part that caught my attention is when Daisuke Watanabe, the game’s art director, and Wataru Tanaka, another director on <em>Bananza</em>, discussed voxel technology and the Switch 2 hardware. </p><p>The entire discussion around voxel tech, which allows the ground and terrain in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-direct-diddy-1851784735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-direct-diddy-1851784735"><em>Bananza</em></a></span><em> </em>to deform and break apart dynamically, is surprisingly deep and worth reading. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/#:~:text=Tanaka%3A%20From,the%20game%20possible.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/#:~:text=Tanaka%3A%20From,the%20game%20possible." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The key moment came at the end</a></span>, when Tanaka explained that after experimenting with pushing voxel tech on the OG Switch, they discovered it wasn’t powerful enough to let them go as wild as they wanted. So the game hopped over to Switch 2 and suddenly was running at a smooth 60FPS. </p><p>“With the move to Switch 2, we gained not only more memory but also greater processing capacity,” said Tanaka. “That gave us the freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas we’d previously abandoned because they were too demanding. When we got down to trying it, we discovered that not only could it handle the heavy processing requirements, but it also ran at 60 FPS. Things we’d given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible.” </p><p>Watanabe further added that with <em>Bananza </em>running at 60FPS, smashing up the world became a lot more “satisfying” and was a big improvement over 30FPS. </p><p>“The physics of smashing involve lots of things all happening at once,” explained Watanabe. “Donkey Kong throws a punch, the terrain and objects break apart, and visual effects show debris flying outward. All of that is packed into a single moment. At 30 fps, we couldn’t fully capture everything that happens in that instant. But at 60 fps, we saw that sense of destruction coming through much more clearly.” </p><p>Watanabe added: “Not only did Switch 2 enable the game to run well, it unlocked the game’s full potential – no, it made the game possible.”<br></p><p>As a self-described video game tech snob who values high framerates, I’m very, very happy that the team behind <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>decided to focus so much on nailing 60FPS. Now, I just have to wait until July 17 to play the <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> team’s next big 3D platformer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303]]></content:encoded>

Pikachu here will cost you a whopping $525, making it hugely more costly than those even-bigger plushies you can find on the Pokémon Center. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10192-101/pikachu-poke-plush-26-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10192-101/pikachu-poke-plush-26-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu over there</a></span> is 27" tall, and will “only” set you back $200. And you can cuddle <em>him</em>.</p><p>However, damn, the statue looks really good. It’s a fantastic pose, and unlike the squishy teddies, doesn’t look like a Pikachu that’s gone through a washing machine. As ridiculous as terms like “life-size” and “lifelike” are about a plastic (well, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://help.sideshow.com/article/163-a-list-of-materials-used-in-sideshow-items&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://help.sideshow.com/article/163-a-list-of-materials-used-in-sideshow-items" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polystone</a></span>”) model of a fictional cartoon character, it’s really lifelike! I don’t even care much for Pikachu and I’m wishing I were a rich man who could afford to spend the month’s mortgage on a fun toy.</p><p>Pikachu represents the first of a new range of licensed collectibles the company will be making in conjunction with Pokémon. It can be pre-ordered now, although isn’t expected to ship until at least the end of this year, presumably because they’ll be making them to order.</p><figure id="" data-id="30c1008295c990694e7bb1a85573615a" data-recommend-id="image://30c1008295c990694e7bb1a85573615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Charizard and a Pikachu statue next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Charizard and a Pikachu statue next to each other." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sideshow / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30c1008295c990694e7bb1a85573615a" data-recommend-id="image://30c1008295c990694e7bb1a85573615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Charizard and a Pikachu statue next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up from the range will be Charizard, which tragically <em>won’t</em> be life-size. I checked <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charizard_(Pok%C3%A9mon)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charizard_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Bulbapedia</a></span> and apparently canonically, the ‘Zard measures over five-and-a-half feet. Imagine having <em>that</em> in your living room. Instead, an early glimpse suggests the figure will measure about the same height as Pikachu, although given its fiery base taking half the height, it’s depicted considerably smaller than ol’ electric cheeks. It’ll still be a very impressive piece of completely needless nonsense to own, but unlikely to scare away unruly children.</p><p>Charizard isn’t open for pre-orders yet, so this is looking like a measured roll-out, perhaps even a careful testing of the market. Sideshow makes its money selling premium figures, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/marvel-venom-hot-toys-912829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/marvel-venom-hot-toys-912829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this astonishing one-sixth scale Venom</a></span> for an eye-watering $460 (although it is over 20 inches tall), so this is their stock-in-trade. But might Pokémon skew a little young for its audience? It’ll be interesting to see.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-statue-figure-life-size-sideshow-1851786279]]></content:encoded>
