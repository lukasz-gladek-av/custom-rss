On the series’ 20th anniversary, there are now dozens of sequels, upgrades, ports, and spin-offs that have introduced new creatures, iterated on the core boss fighting design, and expanded the lore in fascinating ways. To help explain what the franchise’s universe is all about, Capcom turned to none other than <em>Star Wars</em>’ Rey:</p><p>“Since ages long forgotten, one word has defined our very existence: balance,” Ridley says at the beginning of the brief history of <em>Monster Hunter</em>. “From the humble Felon to the ferocious Tigrex, every living being across this vast land plays its part in the great cycle, including us.” She explains why players spend all their time killing stuff in the game, as well as the hierarchy of beasts, from weak packs of Jaggi to all-powerful Elder Dragons. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>has always walked an uncomfortable line between the necessities of repetitive arcade action loops and the narrative repercussions of the ensuing carnage. “There is no thirst for violence, just an appreciation of life,” Ridley explains. More so than any previous entry in the series, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> seems intent on trying to convey the need for harmony, exploration, and curiosity as motivating virtues in its nevertheless brutal boss-slaying world. </p><p>The series’ first mainline entry built from the ground-up for the current generation of consoles, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 28 along with a slew of other big games in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/february-2025-too-many-games-assassins-creed-civ-7-ps5-1851657731?_gl=1*1q0b6l0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDM1NzkwMy4xMzUuMS4xNzM0MzYxOTc4LjQzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/february-2025-too-many-games-assassins-creed-civ-7-ps5-1851657731?_gl=1*1q0b6l0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDM1NzkwMy4xMzUuMS4xNzM0MzYxOTc4LjQzLjAuMA..">what’s already a super-packed month</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On average, it will take players anywhere between 50-100 hours to max out a class through various end-game activities, depending on your playstyle and any assistance you receive. That’s a lot of playtime if you’re intent on trying out everything on offer. Let’s go over which classes are the best options for new <em>Path of Exile 2</em> players. </p><figure id="" data-id="8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-recommend-id="image://8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-recommend-id="image://8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you should always play whatever class speaks to you the most, from a playstyle and preferences perspective, <strong>choose the Mercenary as your first class if you want to see everything <em>Path of Exile 2</em> offers</strong>. It’s one of the all-new classes designed for the ARPG sequel, and as such, developer Grinding Gear Games spent a lot of time refining its abilities, gems, and passive skills, making for an exceptionally strong playstyle.</p><p>The Mercenary primarily utilizes crossbows with various round-based attachments and unique grenades to deal damage. One of the first skills you’ll unlock as part of the game’s prologue is Fragmentation Rounds, which essentially turns your crossbow into a close-range shotgun loaded with Dragon’s Breath rounds. Every shot, while slow to fire and reload, unleashes a burst of fire that deals significant up-close damage to enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-recommend-id="image://8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-recommend-id="image://8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From there, you’ll gain access to the game’s skill panel to unlock additional abilities once you receive an Uncut Gem. There are a few choices for the Mercenary’s best starting skills, but there’s nothing wrong with experimenting. You’ll receive countless gems throughout your playthrough, allowing you to mix and match or outright remove and replace abilities depending on the zone or your preferences. You’re not locked into a single build!</p><p>One crucial aspect to consider when selecting a class in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is how it plays solo. Many people play the game alone, though the sequel allows up to six players to cooperate while clearing bosses and zones. After spending approximately 30 hours playing through the main storyline as a Mercenary, I can attest that, while weak against certain bosses, the class does exceptionally well for the most part. It keeps enemies at range with diverse abilities designed to reduce movement capabilities, AoE (area-of-effect) attacks that make clearing small mobs of standard enemies a breeze, and single-shot damage attacks designed for elite enemies, like bosses and named mobs.</p><figure id="" data-id="670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-recommend-id="image://670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-recommend-id="image://670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Furthermore, the ability to wear various armor types, from leather to plate, makes the Mercenary a stalwart choice. If you don’t mind moving slowly, becoming a mobile tank, then heavy armor locks down your defense. But if you want to keep moving, use run-and-gun tactics with the crossbow, wear light armor, and dodge-roll away from danger with relative ease.</p><p>There’s a lot to love about Path of Exile 2, from its classes to the many tough-as-nails boss fights you’ll encounter, but it appears there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-notes-dodge-roll-rewards-mods-1851717522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-notes-dodge-roll-rewards-mods-1851717522">loot problem the devs intend to solve</a></span>.

As a lifelong Shadow the Hedgehog stan, I’m glad to hear that. I rewatched the first two movies last week as a refresher, and that first one is actually a lot better than I remembered. These movies still have their problems, like an overreliance on pop culture references and too much of the human characters for my liking, but it sounds like the third movie is addressing some of those issues. We’ll have our full review on <em>Kotaku</em> when the film launches later this week.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

More than anything, though, there’s a letting go of illusions. The games nominated this year were all exceptional, but honestly, I still can’t figure out what the criteria were for Game of the Year. I feel like I came all the way here for nothing!”</p><p><em>Wukong</em>, which won both the Players’ Voice award and Best Action Game, might be considered rather successful at the awards. It was beaten to GOTY, however, by <em>Astro Bot</em>, Sony’s self-congratulatory and adorable third-person platform game, and faced some serious competition with the likes of <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> and <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> also nominated. And while Ji recognized that all these games are “exceptional,” this apparently did not stop reactions at the ceremony from being so strong that some sitting nearby say they saw Game Science developers crying when the game failed to win.</p><p>Ji’s Weibo post goes on to say that he was so confident of winning this trophy that he wrote his acceptance speech <em>two years ago</em>. He explains that he was more optimistic than some of his colleagues, and states that the game’s success commercially and with players was not a fluke, but rather “an inevitable outcome of Chinese culture.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mp1st.com/news/chinese-players-review-bomb-baldurs-gate-3-steam-black-myth-wukong-loses-goty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mp1st.com/news/chinese-players-review-bomb-baldurs-gate-3-steam-black-myth-wukong-loses-goty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MP1st</em> reports</a></span> that some Chinese fans took the loss no better. In a grim turn of events, furious <em>Wukong</em> stans decided to review-bomb <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, of all games, after Larian boss Swen Vincke’s wonderful three-minute introduction to the GOTY award. During this speech, Vincke took the opportunity to argue for an industry that looks after its developers rather than exploits them, and that makes games for art as well as profit, but this may have been misunderstood by a contingent of <em>Wukong</em>’s Chinese fans. <em>MP1st</em> claims it’s a result of a poor translation read by Chinese players, but doesn’t point to where this may have happened.</p><p>When someone has poured their life and soul into a project, it’s extremely understandable for them to become emotionally involved in the rewards and awards that follow. It’s also the case that award ceremonies are subjective popularity contests, in which wholly dissimilar things (like a 3D cartoon platform game about a robot and a tough-as-nails action game based on Chinese mythology) are artificially pitted against one another, with results based on the voting whims of a small group of individually partisan industry representatives. It must feel lovely to win, but it’s also entirely daft.</p><p>If your favorite game of 2024 was <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, then you need not craft a trophy out of tin foil, but instead just recognize that that’s enough entirely on its own, and doesn’t require the validation of a few strangers who got to vote in the Dorito man’s yearly shindig.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
