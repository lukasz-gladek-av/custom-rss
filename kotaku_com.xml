              <p>Running out of storage space on your phone, Nintendo Switch, or camera creates that frustrating moment where you have to delete old memories to capture new ones. MicroSD cards solve this problem by expanding your device’s capacity and let you hoard thousands of photos or hours of 4K video without compromise.</p>
<p>The Samsung EVO Select with 512GB capacity provides enough room for approximately 124,000 photos or 60 hours of 4K footage, essentially future-proofing your device against storage anxiety. And Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/">just dropped the price from $46 to just $37, hitting a new all-time low</a> just before Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed Meets Capacity for Real-World Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>160 MB/s read speed makes file transfers fast and smooth</strong>: Copying a full 4K movie to your card takes less than a minute, unlike slower cards that can take five to ten minutes. Good news is, <strong>write speeds match the demands of continuous 4K video recording</strong>. This prevents dropped frames and stuttering that can ruin important footage when slower cards can’t keep up with the data. The UHS-I interface offers the bandwidth these speeds need and connects through the standard microSD slot found in nearly all modern devices.</p>



<p>The A2 application performance class means <strong>this card can run apps and games directly from its storage:</strong> This avoids the lag that older microSD standards often had. The rating shows minimum random read speeds of 4000 IOPS and write speeds of 2000 IOPS, which results in quick app launches and smooth gameplay on devices like the Nintendo Switch. Games load faster, transitions between levels are smooth, and you bypass the frustrating delays that come from using slower storage.</p>



<p>The i<strong>ncluded SD adapter increases compatibility</strong>: It works with laptops, desktop card readers, cameras and the original Nintendo Switch dock. This simple adapter <strong>changes the tiny microSD size to standard SD</strong> so you don’t need to buy separate adapters or search for specific readers. You can easily insert the card into your computer’s SD slot to transfer files without needing cables or wireless connections that use up battery.</p>
<p>Samsung’s six-proof protection guards <strong>against water, extreme temperatures, X-rays, magnets, drops, and wear from repeated insertion and removal</strong>. These durability features mean the card can survive an accidental trip through the washing machine, withstand desert heat or winter cold outdoors, and pass through airport security scanners without corrupting data. The <strong>10-year limited warranty</strong> supports these protection claims with reliable manufacturer backing that goes beyond standard consumer electronics coverage</p>
<p>At $37, the card costs about seven cents per gigabyte, which is great value for Samsung’s premium EVO Select line.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build-2000640003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build.1338877/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO Architecture sets rarely go on sale which makes this London Skyline deal something special. The 4.8-star rating (across more than 13,000 reviews) speaks to the quality and satisfaction <strong>this 468-piece set</strong> delivers to builders who want an iconic city skyline on their desk or shelf. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/">has dropped the price from $39 to just $31, which marks an all-time low</a> that won’t last long given how quickly these sets disappear during promotional windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Iconic Landmarks Come Together in Miniature Form</h2>
<p>The set captures<strong> five of London’s most recognizable structures</strong> in carefully scaled brick form. It starts with the National Gallery’s neoclassical facade which anchors Trafalgar Square, then Nelson’s Column rises with its distinctive proportions (honoring the admiral who secured British naval dominance at Trafalgar in 1805). The London Eye appears as a functional rotating observation wheel made from transparent and gray elements that showcase its modern engineering style. Big Ben’s clock tower displays the Gothic Revival architecture that makes it easily recognizable in photographs and films worldwide. Last but not least, Tower Bridge completes the collection with its twin towers and suspended walkways.</p>



<p>The Thames river flows through the scene, and uses transparent blue baseplate tiles to create a convincing water effect beneath the landmarks. This smart design choice grounds the buildings in their geographic setting while adding visual depth to the display. The transparent elements catch and reflect light in various ways throughout the day. This gives the model a dynamic quality that shifts with your viewing angle and the ambient light. The <strong>baseplate measures about 11 inches wide</strong> and provides a stable foundation that keeps all elements securely connected during transport or dusting.</p>



<p>The<strong> set includes 468 pieces</strong> and hits the sweet spot between being challenging enough to feel rewarding and manageable enough to complete in one satisfying evening or weekend session. LEGO Architecture sets differ from standard LEGO builds by focusing on architectural accuracy and the proportions between structures rather than play features: Each landmark uses specialized pieces and smart building techniques to replicate distinctive architectural elements at this smaller scale.</p>
<p>Display potential makes this set especially appealing for offices, home libraries or anywhere you want decor that sparks conversation and reflects sophisticated interests. The monochromatic color scheme, using mainly gray, black, and tan bricks, creates a cohesive look that appears professional rather than toy-like in adult spaces. Its compact size means it fits on crowded bookshelves, desks, or window sills without overpowering the area.</p>
<p>The <strong>recommended age of 12 and up</strong> reflects the patience and fine motor skills needed for smaller pieces and detailed assembly steps. However, younger builders with LEGO experience can succeed with adult guidance. This set makes an excellent gift for Anglophiles, architecture enthusiasts, travel lovers reminiscing about London visits.</p>
<p>At $31, it offers great value given the piece count, display quality, and lasting appeal of the Architecture series.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/philips-clears-hue-bulb-starter-kit-stock-now-selling-at-all-time-low-for-early-black-friday-2000639968</link>

              <p>Smart lighting transforms how you experience your home, <strong>turning ordinary rooms into spaces that adapt to your mood, schedule, and activities</strong> with just a tap or voice command. The<em> Philips Hue</em> starter kit delivers this transformation in minutes and requires nothing more than screwing in bulbs and plugging in the bridge to unlock millions of colors and automated lighting scenes. This bundle includes the <strong>essential Hue brige and two 60W A19 color-changing bulbs</strong> that work in standard E26 fixtures throughout your house. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/">has slashed the price from $142 to just $99 for early Black Friday</a>, which marks a new all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Bridge Makes Everything Possible</h2>
<p>The Hue bridge acts as <strong>the main hub for your smart lighting system</strong>: It connects your bulbs to your home network and offers features that standard Bluetooth bulbs can’t. This hub creates a special Zigbee network and keeps your smart lights responsive without slowing down your Wi-Fi or hurting connection quality. The bridge also allows for automations: You can set your lights to turn on before you wake up or turn off automatically when you leave home.</p>



<p>The two included A19 bulbs deliver 800 lumens each: This provides <strong>brightness similar to traditional 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong> while using much less energy. These <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs cover a range from warm candlelight tones at around 2000K to cool daylight at 6500K,<strong> plus offer access to 16 million colors for fun lighting effects</strong>. The <strong>E26 base fits standard lamp sockets</strong> and ceiling fixtures: You can install them in table lamps, floor lamps, or overhead lights without needing adapters. Dimming is smooth through the app or voice commands, and gives you fine control over brightness levels that wall switches can’t achieve.</p>



<p>Preset scenes take the hassle out of choosing colors: They provide <strong>ready-made lighting combinations tailored for different activities and moods</strong>. The 24-hour natural light scene mimics the sun’s movement throughout the day. It begins with energizing cool tones in the morning and shifts to calming warm hues as evening approaches. <em>Focus</em> modes provide bright, clear lighting to help you concentrate during work hours, while reading scenes offer comfortable light that reduces eye strain. <em>Relaxation</em> and sleep scenes gradually dim to warm amber tones, signaling to your body that it’s time to unwind.</p>
<p>Voice control with Alexa and Google Assistant lets you <strong>adjust your lights without reaching for your phone</strong> or getting off the couch. Simple commands like <em>“turn on the living room lights”</em> or <em>“set bedroom to 50 percent”</em> become routine after a few days. The Hue app guides you through setting up voice control with easy instructions that take only a few minutes. You can also create custom voice commands for specific scenes, like saying <em>“movie time”</em> to automatically dim your lights to theater mode.</p>
<p>At $99, this starter kit is an easy way to enter the Philips Hue ecosystem. It provides everything you need to experience smart lighting in two rooms right out of the box.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Those tiny 20W chargers work fine for a single phone but they crumble under the weight of modern device ecosystems where laptops, tablets, and phones all need power simultaneously. The <strong>Anker Prime Charger delivers a massive 160W across three USB-C ports</strong> while staying roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and solves the cable chaos and outlet shortage that plagues anyone who travels with multiple devices. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/">early Black Friday deal drops the price from $149 to $109, hitting an all-time low for Anker’s most advanced charging technology</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GaN Technology Packs Professional Power Into Pocket Size</h2>
<p>Gallium Nitride technology allows this charger to deliver 1.35W per cubic centimeter of power density. This <strong>figure explains how Anker fits 160W into a size that easily fits in your hand</strong>: Traditional silicon-based chargers would have to be three times larger to provide the same power.</p>
<p>The compact design lets you slip this charger into a side pocket of your laptop bag without the bulk of carrying multiple chargers. <strong>Three USB-C ports eliminate the hassle of managing adapters</strong> for those who need to charge a laptop, phone and tablet at the same time.</p>



<p>The <strong>140W single-port output provides steady power</strong> without reducing speed: This means your laptop charges quickly even when other devices are plugged into the other ports. This feature is crucial during work sessions when you need your MacBook Pro charged up fast before a meeting or flight. Anker claims <strong>you can charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from empty to 50 percent in just 25 minutes</strong>. Any of the three ports can deliver the full 140W so you won’t have to remember which port is the fastest or worry about plugging into the wrong one. The <strong>charger automatically adjusts power distribution based on the devices connected</strong>&nbsp;so that each one gets the right amount of current without manual adjustments.</p>



<p>The <em>AnkerSense View</em> display <strong>shows real-time wattage for each port</strong>, and allows you to see exactly how much power each device gets at any time. Touch controls on the charger allow you to switch modes instantly between different power distribution settings based on your needs. Bluetooth connectivity links the charger to Anker’s mobile app which offers custom charging modes you can set up for specific device combinations you use often.</p>
<p>Build quality reflects Anker’s reputation for durable charging gear: The sturdy port construction can withstand repeated plugging and unplugging for years of daily use. The 24-month warranty provides solid support coverage and protects your investment. Foldable prongs keep the charger compact during transport and shield the plug from damage in bags. The charger is <strong>compatible with any USB-C device</strong>&nbsp;including MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, Android phones, Steam Decks, Nintendo Switches, and many other gadgets that charge via USB-C.</p>
<p>At $109, this Anker charger is cheaper than buying three separate charging blocks while providing better power density and smart features.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming on the go has always meant compromising on screen quality or lugging around bulky equipment, but portable monitors have changed that equation completely. The KYY 15.6-inch portable display solves a real problem for console gamers who want to play their Switch, PlayStation, or Xbox anywhere without hunting for an available TV. This compact screen transforms your gaming setup into something truly mobile, turning hotel rooms, friends’ houses, or even your backyard into viable gaming spaces. Amazon has dropped the price from $99 to just $69, hitting an all-time low that makes this accessory almost too good to pass up for serious gamers who value flexibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Gaming Fits in Your Backpack</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel provides a 1920×1080 resolution</strong> with a 178-degree viewing angle: This keeps colors true, even when watching from the side. HDR technology adds depth to darker scenes and prevents bright areas from losing details which is important during intense gaming sessions. The screen measures 8.8 inches tall and 14.2 inches wide, and gives you plenty of space for immersive gameplay without the bulk of a traditional monitor. <strong>Blue light reduction and flicker-free operation</strong> allow for hours of gaming without the eye strain often caused by cheaper displays. This IPS technology ensures consistent color accuracy across the entire screen.</p>



<p>Connectivity meets all your needs with <strong>two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini-HDMI port</strong>. The USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 3 and 3.1, and allows you to power the monitor and send video through one cable from compatible laptops or phones. Your Switch connects directly through USB-C for a clean setup with minimal cable clutter. The HDMI port works with the PS4, Xbox and older devices that lack USB-C outputs. The one-cable solution avoids the hassle of carrying multiple adapters and dealing with complex setups when you just want to plug in and play.<strong> Two built-in stereo speakers and a 3.5mm audio jack</strong> give you sound output options based on your environment and preferences.</p>



<p>The <strong>ultra-slim 0.3-inch profile and 1.7-pound weight</strong> make this monitor very portable: It fits easily into laptop bags or backpacks without adding noticeable bulk. The included smart cover serves as both a protective shell and an adjustable stand. It has two grooves that let you choose your preferred viewing angle. The PU leather exterior resists scratches and bumps during transport, and the frameless magnetic design keeps everything secure without clunky clasps or zippers.</p>
<p>The monitor works in <strong>both landscape and portrait orientations</strong>: This opens up fun possibilities beyond gaming, like reading documents, browsing social media on your phone’s extended screen, or watching movies in different aspect ratios. The premium gray metal finish looks professional enough for work presentations while still keeping the gaming aesthetic that console players enjoy. A simple menu control wheel on the side allows you to adjust brightness, contrast and other settings without navigating complicated on-screen menus.</p>
<p>At $69, this portable monitor costs less than many wired controllers and greatly expands where and how you can enjoy your console games. The $30 discount turns this affordable accessory into an impulse purchase that pays off each time you want to game away from your main TV.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-offloads-surface-pro-512gb-ssd-x-plus-at-a-new-low-black-friday-starts-early-2000639973</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-offloads-surface-pro-512gb-ssd-x-plus-at-a-new-low-black-friday-starts-early.1338781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The laptop versus tablet debate has frustrated professionals for years, forcing compromises between portability and productivity that never quite satisfy either need. Microsoft’s Surface Pro eliminates that choice by delivering a fantastic <strong>2-in-1 device that excels as both a full-powered Windows laptop and a sleek tablet</strong> you can hold with one hand.</p>
<p>Early Black Friday deals have hit the entire Surface Pro lineup hard with discounts ranging from 20 to 30% across all configurations including LCD and OLED displays, Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors, and every storage and RAM combination. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5092/">particular model with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage has dropped from $1,199 to $949</a>, which marks an all-time low for Microsoft’s latest Copilot+ PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5092/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Snapdragon Revolution Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon X Plus processor with 10 cores</strong> marks a major change in Windows computing: It offers performance that competes with Apple’s M3 chip while using less power. This ARM-based design runs cooler and more efficiently than traditional Intel or AMD processors. It <strong>leads to a 14-hour battery life</strong>&nbsp;which makes all-day work sessions feasible without searching for outlets.</p>
<p>The integrated NPU processes AI tasks locally on your device: It <strong>handles Copilot+ features without sending your data to the cloud,</strong> and keeps your information private and providing quick responses. Native ARM apps perform well and Microsoft’s updated emulation layer ensures that most x86 Windows software runs smoothly even if it hasn’t been recompiled. With 16GB of RAM, you can multitask easily across many browser tabs, multiple Office documents, and background apps.</p>



<p>The 1<strong>3-inch touchscreen boasts sharp 2880 x 1920 resolution</strong> at a comfortable 3:2 aspect ratio which shows more vertical content than typical 16:9 laptop displays. This extra height is important for reading documents, browsing the internet or working in spreadsheets as vertical space determines how much information is visible without scrolling. The display <strong>allows for use with the Surface Pen</strong> which is great for drawing, note-taking, and precise editing tasks.</p>
<p>The <strong>512GB SSD provides ample storage for your operating system</strong>, applications and files, so you won’t have to constantly manage cloud storage or external drives. This capacity easily holds your entire photo library, video projects, and software installations with extra space for future needs. Its read and write speeds far surpass traditional hard drives, making file transfers, app launches, and boot times feel instantaneous.</p>



<p><strong>Copilot+ PC features</strong> change how you interact with Windows through useful AI capabilities, rather than mere gimmicks: Windows Studio Effects improve video calls by enhancing lighting, canceling background noise and automatically blurring distractions without needing additional software or manual tweaks. <strong>Real-time translation offers subtitles in 44 languages during</strong> video calls or streaming, bridging language gaps for international work or entertainment. <em>Cocreate</em> generates artwork from text descriptions or image prompts, giving creative professionals quick tools for brainstorming and developing concepts.</p>
<p>The <strong>unique kickstand adjusts to almost any angle</strong> from nearly flat for digital art to steep angles ideal for watching movies on a plane tray table. This flexibility allows the Surface Pro to fit whatever space you’re using rather than forcing you to work within rigid laptop constraints. Fast charging through the proprietary Surface Connect port or standard USB-C adds options for power sources, and the 65W power supply can quickly recharge the battery during short breaks.</p>
<p>At a price of $949, this configuration offers fantastic value for early Black Friday shoppers seeking premium build quality and advanced AI features.</p>

              <p>Gaming has evolved into a visual spectacle where every frame matters and your graphics card is the engine that powers those immersive experiences. The Asus TUF gaming <strong>GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</strong> brings professional-grade performance to your setup, and right now, early Black Friday deals are making this powerhouse more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4923/">has slashed the price from $999 to $849 which marks an all-time low</a> for this recently launched GPU that’s built on <strong>Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell architecture</strong>. This is your chance to future-proof your gaming rig with 16GB of blazing-fast GDDR7 memory and DLSS 4 technology that transforms how games look and perform.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5090/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Blackwell Revolution Comes to Your Desktop</h2>
<p><strong>Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture</strong> marks a real advancement in graphics processing. The <strong>RTX 5070 Ti uses that power with 16GB of GDDR7 memory</strong>&nbsp;which provides the bandwidth that modern games need. <strong>DLSS 4 revolutionizes gaming</strong> by using AI to generate frames intelligently. This allows you to increase ray tracing settings without seeing a drop in frame rates. The card runs at 2588 MHz in default mode and can reach 2610 MHz in OC mode. This gives you extra performance when you need it. These <strong>specs translate to smooth 1440p gaming at ultra settings and good 4K performance</strong> in most games.</p>
<p>Asus put a lot of thought into the <strong>cooling solution</strong>: They designed a 3.125-slot card with three Axial-tech fans that move a lot of air through a large fin array. The phase-change GPU thermal pad is a smart engineering choice. It lasts longer than regular thermal paste and keeps temperatures optimal, even during long gaming sessions that push the card hard. This design keeps your GPU cool and quiet, and avoid the loud noises that cheaper cards make under load. The extra slot width may seem like a compromise, but it is really an investment in durability. Cooler components last longer and maintain their performance over the years.</p>



<p>Durability is a priority with military-grade components that provide solid power delivery and a longer lifespan compared to standard designs: The protective PCB coating offers another layer of <strong>defense against moisture, dust, and debris</strong> that can cause short circuits. These features matter a lot, especially if you’re building a system you want to keep for several years.</p>



<p>Connectivity is also strong, with <strong>PCIe 5.0 support, multiple DisplayPort 2.1 outputs, and HDMI</strong> for maximum flexibility with monitors and VR headsets. The GPU Tweak III software allows you to control performance easily. You can adjust clock speeds, voltages, and fan curves without getting into complicated BIOS settings. Thermal monitoring helps you keep an eye on temperatures in different GPU areas.</p>
<p>At $150 off, this deal is a real value in a market where graphics card prices can often feel unrealistic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Desktop Defender</em> is a confoundingly compelling mix of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fuck-me-i-cant-stop-playing-cookie-clicker-1847794400"><em>Cookie Clicker</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. The game sits in a little corner of your computer screen whether you’re emailing people for work or paying your bills for the month. The action consists of a tiny triangle shooting other blips that arrive from offscreen to destroy it. It levels up and earns loot, briefly interrupting your other work as you choose upgrades and look for synergies to help the lo-fi automated ship survive its hostile confines a little bit longer, or at least until you power down your PC. Indie developer Conrad Grindheim made it on a whim in just a month. It wound up being one of the 50 most downloaded games <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-october-2025-might-magic-yapyap-half-sword-2000637407">during the October 2025 Steam Next Fest</a>.</p> <p>“We launched the demo with 200 wishlists and I was hoping for maybe 20 concurrent players,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> over email. “When we reached 36 I was super happy because we had basically doubled our goal. Lo and behold…we ended up reaching over 1,500, landing us in the top 4 most played Steam demos, as well as getting a special commendation and a feature from Steam. To say that this was unexpected would be selling it short, but I could not be happier.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">1 week ago we had 3 players, today I got this e-mail.</p> <p>Thank you all so much ♥️ <a href="https://t.co/AcG7Q9ltXi">pic.twitter.com/AcG7Q9ltXi</a></p> <p>— Conradical (@ConradicalGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConradicalGames/status/1980339314740588692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Desktop Defender</em> is part of a recent wave of Steam games that mostly play themselves while you do other stuff on your desktop. Some, like <em>Bongo Cat</em>, are minimally interactive. Others, like<em> Bao Bao’s Cozy Laundromat</em>, can be more complex. While some are just fun distractions, others play off the satisfaction many people innately get from watching a fictional measure of progress continually tick upwards. Grindheim wanted<em> Desktop Defender</em> to be slightly more engaging.</p>

 <p>“I made <em><span>Desktop Defender</span>&nbsp;</em>because I really enjoyed this new wave of “screen sitting” idlers, but I hadn’t found one with more integrated long-term strategies,” he said. “I’m thinking more like <em>NGU Idle</em> or <em>Cookie Clicker</em>‘s endgame. In combination with the extra tactility that the shooting tower adds, I felt that I could really bring something new to the genre. To many, the appeal of these games is to see numbers go up while doing something else, but I feel there’s an extra section of the playerbase that also really enjoys strategizing over long periods of time.”</p>

 <h2>Turning idling PCs into productive escapes</h2> <p>Grindheim (who you may remember <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/indie-dev-files-dmca-takedown-against-his-own-game-as-dispute-with-publisher-continues/">trying to DMCA his own game</a> during a public spat with the publisher back in 2023) spends much of his time working on the monster-taming action-RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2421080/Synth_Beasts/"><em>Synth Beasts</em></a> which was Kickstarted with over $20,000 in pledged funds earlier this year. But he also finds time to experiment with shorter releases to try to understand how popular genres and tastes are evolving on Steam. He worked on <em>Desktop Defender</em> solo for about a month, only purchasing some assets for music and icons while making the rest of the UI elements, characters, and enemies in-house.</p>

 <p>“The aesthetics are really inspired by <em>SNKRX</em>, and the gameplay mechanics as well to a certain extent, although the two games still feel very different,” he said. <em>SNKRX&nbsp;</em>uses the elements of <a href="https://kotaku.com/auto-chess-took-over-my-life-in-a-single-afternoon-1835710673"><em>Auto Chess</em></a> to reimagine the classic arcade game <em>Snake</em>, and is a precursor to games like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. “I really enjoyed playing <em>Rusty’s Retirement</em> and I felt like combining something like that with my interest in games with synergistic loadout building (e.g. roguelikes or RPGs) would make for a super fun time.”</p>

  <p>Where<em> Vampire Survivors</em> demands your full attention, <em>Rusty’s Retirement</em>, in which you occasionally help robots automate a <em>Stardew Valley-</em>like farming sim operation, provides bite-sized bursts of problem-solving nestled neatly beside real-life productivity. “These games can offer a happy medium between not staring at a textbook for eight hours straight and the mental exhaustion that can come with constantly getting ourselves back into the productivity zone,” mental health researcher Natalie Coyle recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/arts/desktop-games-rustys-retirement.html">told <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>

 <p>It’s the natural evolution of brief, session-based buildcrafting grindfests like <em>Balatro</em> which conveniently let players accrue little nuggets of satisfaction while waiting in line at the store or while sitting on the bus during a commute. But instead of punctuating the mundane moments in our lives, games like <em>Desktop Defender</em> interrupt our existing work flows with extra layers of progress.</p> <h2>The game you play while queuing for other games</h2> <p>Think of them as Pomodoro timers that double as Tamagotchi pets you can min-max in-between Excel sheet macros and anxiety-inducing Slack alerts. “I envisioned myself playing an idle game between work sessions or while compiling my games and how fun it would be to have a strategic throughline through that,” Grindheim said.</p> <p>But <em>Desktop Defender</em>‘s 15 minutes of Steam fame also points to the changing ways people play and discover games as the market becomes more and more flooded with them. “You look at games like<a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591"><em> Megabonk</em></a> and while they launched with a sizeable wishlist count, it punched miles above its weight,” he said. “I think we’re seeing that smaller games, if designed well, can achieve more than before if they get that spark of visibility.”</p> <p>Grindheim credits an unexpected micro-community that popped up around the game for helping give it an extra bump, in addition to events like Steam Next Fest. “Tons of players on our Discord server and in community groups are constantly discussing the game’s most optimal builds and there’s a social aspect to that,” he noted. “Because people can play <em><span>Desktop Defender</span></em> and other idle games while in queue for online games, I feel it slots perfectly into how people are playing nowadays.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-battlefield-6-honeymoon-is-over.1338718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched on October 10 to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042">huge player numbers on Steam</a> and a lot of momentum from a super successful and well-received open beta. It seemed like most people were excited for the game and its future. Now, just a little over two weeks later, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-update-redsec-season-1-download-free-ea-ps5-steam-2000639598">the game’s first season and its battle royale mode have launched</a>, and for many online, the honeymoon is over.</p> <p>There’s no one single issue or change to blame for the angry fans and negative Steam reviews. Instead, it’s a mix of problems. Some fans are disappointed about colorful new skins and the battle pass, claiming it’s ruining the game’s launch vibes. Others are mad that the latest map added to <em>BF6</em>, Blackwell Fields, is yet again a fairly small map, and the new mode added in season one is tiny, too. And then there are the <em>Battlefield 6</em> players who hate the game’s new battle royale mode, which features a big ol’ map, and fear that it might pull resources from the main game and its classic modes.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6’s</em> season one battle pass and new skins</h2>   <p>Before<em> Battlefield 6</em> even launched, the topic of its cosmetics was a hot one. Many players, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919">myself included</a>, were tired of devs and publishers shoving crossover skins and other ugly cosmetics into nearly every modern online game. And the <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs promised that the then-upcoming game wouldn’t go down that road. This whole skins saga became such a big deal that eventually, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Activision announced the upcoming <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em></a> would not let players bring skins over from <em>Black Ops 6</em> in order to prevent the FPS from instantly being flooded with goofy crap.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">Now, with the launch of season one,</a> <em>BF6</em> players online have access to the game’s first new skins since launch, and the reaction has been mixed. Some find the skins far too colorful or argue they don’t fit the military vibes. There are also some new skins that can be used with every class, which has frustrated players as they fear it will make it hard to quickly identify different classes during combat. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oi9wvl/they_made_the_system_override_skin_more_toned/">EA seems receptive to the feedback</a>, as at least one skin’s bright green details were toned down with the season one patch. Funnily enough, there are also some people who find the new skins boring and ugly, lacking any reason to chase after them via <em>BF6</em>‘s new battle pass. Trying to thread the needle with <em>BF6</em>‘s cosmetics is going to be a nightmare.</p>

 <p>Speaking of the battle pass, a lot of players aren’t happy with it, either. I get the feeling a lot of players online don’t like how it changes the vibes of the game. Now it feels like a real live-service shooter, something more akin to a modern<em> Call of Duty</em>, with ads encouraging players to buy the new battle pass, goals to chase, and limited-time rewards to unlock. And for some, this isn’t what they wanted. A highly rated post on the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit is a screenshot of a Steam review saying: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oj8hzd/lool/">“This whole season 1 update feels like ad blocker stopped working.”</a></p>

 <h2><em>Redsec</em>, <em>BF6</em>‘s new battle royale mode, has a negative rating on Steam</h2> <p>The biggest new addition in <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s first season is <em>Redsec</em>, EA’s stab at a large-scale free-to-play battle royale game. Anyone can now download <em>BF6</em> <em>Redsec</em> and start playing the game’s new battle royale mode. The general consensus seems to be that <em>Redsec</em> is pretty good. I’ve not played much of it yet, but it does seem fun enough. However, over on Steam, the new <em>Redsec</em> mode <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1983566801913925824">has an overall negative review rating</a>. But a lot of people aren’t mad about the mode; instead, they’re upset about how it has been integrated into <em>BF6</em>.</p>

 <p>You see, the new battle pass brought with it weekly challenges. And some of these challenges require players to hop into <em>Redsec</em> to complete them. This isn’t going over well with some <em>BF6</em> fans who feel like EA is requiring them to play something they never wanted in the first place. While <em>BF6</em> lets you reroll a limited number of challenges, for those never planning on playing <em>Redsec</em>, it means they have to burn all their rerolls on challenges for a mode they have zero interest in. This has led to a lot of anger around <em>Redsec</em> and the new battle pass, too.</p>

 <p>And then there’s the issue of <em>Redsec</em>‘s map. It’s very, very big. This isn’t a bad thing at all. In fact, <em>Battlefield 6</em> players have been longing for bigger maps since the open beta. Battlefield Studios and EA promised bigger maps were coming. And then season one arrives, and the first new map added post-launch is a barren, bland oil field that feels overly cramped and isn’t what a lot of the online community wanted. Meanwhile, the free-to-play <em>Redsec</em> features a massive map. As you might expect, this hasn’t gone over well with many players clamoring for bigger maps.</p> <h2>The new map and mode are small and not very good</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647">The game’s first new map is Blackwell Fields</a>, a not-very-big level that is currently not much fun to play. You’ll likely get killed over and over again by snipers or blown up by AA guns if you try to fly around its limited skybox. Running around on foot is a chore, and the new map lacks any real landmarks or memorable spaces. And for many who were waiting for a bigger map to arrive post-launch, Blackwell Fields has shaken their confidence in the game’s future.</p> <p>A new mode, Strikepoint, also added in season one, is essentially<em>&nbsp;Call of Duty</em>‘s popular seek-and-destroy. Two teams of four compete in multiple rounds to capture an objective. And once you die, that’s it until the next round. This kind of mode can be a lot of fun in shooters like <em>Counter-Strike.</em> But in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, Strikepoint feels out of place. The game already supports some smaller, infantry-focused modes, like team deathmatch and king of the hill. I’m not sure it needed yet another small mode. In a franchise known for big and epic warfare, the new small map and tiny mode feel like misfires and have disappointed many players.</p>

 <p>It might be easy to write off a lot of this as just a small but vocal group of players online being angry about a video game. And that’s certainly part of what’s happening here. But anecdotally, I know some folks who play <em>BF6</em> and aren’t very online. These people don’t troll Reddit or share angry social media posts. Yet even they aren’t sure about this new season.&nbsp; None of them seem to like Blackwell Fields, the new mode, or how the battle pass was implemented. And most of them are confused about <em>Redsec</em>, as they already have a few battle royales they play from time to time. The last thing they needed was one more.</p> <p>So, where does that leave<em> Battlefield 6?</em> There will be those who claim the game is dying and done. That’s not the case. It still has a huge playerbase across console and PC who are playing the game daily. But it’s clear that the mood has shifted. <em>Battlefield 6</em> is no longer a just-launched FPS harkening back to<em> Battlefield 3</em> and older shooters. Instead, it’s now an active live-service game with multiple components, battle pass options, and even a full in-game cosmetic store. That might mean more money for EA, but it also means a lot more criticism and pushback from players. The question now is: Will EA be willing to change its roadmap for <em>BF6</em> to appease these angry players, or will the publisher move forward as planned?</p>

              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, the next game from <i>The Finals </i>developer Embark Studios, launches on October 30, 2025 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>As a PvPvE extraction shooter, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> sees you setting out to explore and loot the remains of a fallen civilization still under control of a lethal artificial intelligence system known as “Arc.”</p> <p>The game has already been in the hands of players via a few technical tests and the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Still, you might not know much about <i>Arc Raiders</i> or extraction shooters as a genre, and as someone who’s pretty excited about the game, I’d like to do what I can to make it as approachable as possible for potential players. So let’s break down everything you need to know about this game ahead of its release, from how many maps the game provides to the overall flow of your average match.</p>

  <h2>It’s you versus them, and also <i>them</i></h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> is a PvPvE extraction shooter. That means you and a team of up to three are fighting real humans as well as the game’s computer-controlled bots, but your main “goal” is to leave the map alive within a certain time–which in theory you could do without firing a single shot. You can leave via multiple elevators on the map, each of which have a timer on them. You can also find or buy keys to escape hatches that make for an even speedier getaway.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-server-slam-pvpve-extraction-2000637774">Check Out This Really Awesome Moment From <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Server Slam</a></p> <p>With both people and patrolling enemy AI in the mix, there are a wide variety of emergent possibilities as different players, each with their own playstyles and agendas, intersect with the threats on the map. It makes for an intense game in which you need to think a few steps ahead of each action you take, and always keep an escape route in mind should you realize you’ve gotten yourself in over your head.</p>

   <p>Get out alive, and you keep everything you came in with, plus whatever you found. Die, and you’ll lose everything. You do have access to a “safe pocket” in your inventory, however, where you can stash a lone precious item to make it to the other side should you perish.</p>

 <p>As you explore the maps, you’ll find countless places to loot. Abandoned cars, file cabinets and desk drawers from empty offices and facilities, storage containers, and much more.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639951"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639951">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll also have a variety of quests you can take on, some of which ask you to loot specific items, while others ask you to take down some of the game’s bots, or “Arc” as they’re referred to in-universe. Quest progress is maintained even if you die, and you’ll earn XP after each match which can be used to improve your character’s stats, so death is not a total loss.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-server-slam-embark-studios-ferro-2000638324"><i>Arc Raiders’</i> Dev Addresses Graphics Downgrade, Enemy Difficulty, And More Ahead Of Release</a></p> <p>When you’re not out on the field scavenging for parts from a fallen world, you’ll be at home in “Speranza,” your hub for launching games, crafting, and trading. <i>Arc Raiders</i> has a thorough crafting system; you can build weapons, gadgets, restorative items such as shield rechargers and bandages, and more. You can also trade with a variety of NPCs.</p>

 <p>You als0 have a pet rooster named Scrappy who’s always happy to see you after a match, giving you some minor crafting supplies when you return. If you’ve had a bad streak of losses, Scrappy will give you extra crafting materials as a consolation for your repeat losses.</p> <p>Zoom out, and we see the loop of the game: Venture out onto the maps, find what you can, avoid or engage in battles with humans or machines, return home and build better gear for your next run.</p> <h2>A closer look at <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ maps on launch</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> launches with four main maps, each set in a post-apocalyptic Italy with their own unique difficulty levels and points-of-interest. These maps are: Dam Battlegrounds, Buried City, the Spaceport, and the Blue Gate. There’s also a practice range and a mysterious location called “Stella Montis” which we don’t know a whole lot about ahead of release.</p>

 <p>The maps offer up a nice level of variety. Dam Battlegrounds, with its thick swamps and forests, makes for some brutal, <i>Predator</i>-esque battles and chase scenarios.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639952"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639952">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Buried City is a smaller, more urban setting with some excellent sightlines across the tops of its roofs (there are going to be some intense sniper battles here, I can already tell).</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639946"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639946">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Spaceport is another large map. My time on this map during a preview event was cut short due to, well, some very aggressive players. It’s very pretty though!</p>

 <p>Lastly, the Blue Gate is a gorgeous, mountainous map with tons of rolling hills that makes for some excellent battles with other players. It’s easily the toughest map, however, with aggressive Arc presence. There are also some lovely, labyrinthine mazes of steel and concrete under the surface to get lost in.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639947" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639947"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639947">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Dam Battlegrounds is perhaps my favorite at the moment. As someone who prefers stealthy tactics, having bushes and trees to fall back to and hide in works well with my style. But I’d be lying if I said hunting down other players in the mountainous terrain of the Blue Gate didn’t give me a rush.</p> <h2>Which is worse, machines or other players?</h2> <p>The titular “Arc” come in <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/ARC">a variety of forms</a>. With threats ranging from the different drone types who survey the ground below for human threats, to smaller patrolling orbs and little spiders (or “Ticks” as the game calls them) that monitor the insides of abandoned buildings, you’ll have to keep your eyes peeled. And they’re not afraid to just insert themselves into a skirmish with players, so don’t be surprised if you get swarmed by some once they see or hear you trading shots.</p>

   <p>There are also larger threats. The spider-like Leapers can, as the name implies, leap across incredible distances in their pursuit. There’s also the Queen, which often guards precious loot, particularly on the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p>   <p>These machines are resilient and aggressive in their desire to eliminate human threats, and you’ll have to place your shots well to destroy vulnerable parts and take them down.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639950"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639950">© Gif: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Speaking of those human threats, you also have other players to contend with, who pose a challenge equal to their skills with the game and the quality of their gear. Kill a human and a flare launches up into the air, letting just about anyone nearby know that a fight just went down and there’s gear for the taking.</p> <p>Without universal objectives for every player, extraction shooters can make for some truly unexpected encounters with other humans. And admittedly, it can feel a little unfair when someone kills you from an unexpected hiding place.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">I Asked <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">Speaking with <i>Kotaku</i></a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ design director Virgil Watkins said that the game is designed in such a way that “you should always have time to understand and react to what is happening to you.” With a longer time-to-kill (TTK) than most games in the genre, the game is designed to give you time to react. On combat with other players, Watkins said:</p> <blockquote><p>On even footing, the way TTK is balanced, if you’re full health and full shields, and so am I, and you attack me first, there’s a very solid chance that I will probably be able to back away, disengage, and do something to mitigate that situation. We really like when our fights have a lot of back and forth rather than just instantaneous [death].</p></blockquote> <p>Each map is also full of opportunities to hear other players nearby. Players make noticeable sounds not only while walking or running, but also when breaking into loot caches, tripping security cameras and metal detectors in abandoned interiors, scaring birds in the wild who take flight, and attracting attention from Arc. All of these can signal to you that another player is nearby, or give your presence away to someone else.</p>

 <p>This all complicates any approach to stealthily moving through a map. But it also means that you can set up some solid ambush opportunities by keeping your ears open for nearby threats, especially with the generous hiding spots on the game’s maps.</p> <h2>Is <i>Arc Raiders</i> too hardcore?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639896">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve long been <a href="https://kotaku.com/extraction-shooter-dmz-tarkov-cycle-battle-royale-1850287778">a fan of the extraction shooter genre</a>. It brings together a variety of different game systems in a unique way that makes for an unpredictable and irresistible experience. But I get that the genre is not everyone’s cup of tea, especially given how lethal and mean it can be. Losing all of your gear can be a painful setback that isn’t easy to bounce back from. Embark Studios is aware of this and has built <i>Arc Raiders</i> to be a more approachable take on an otherwise hardcore genre.</p>

 <p>“Approachability was a key design tenet,” Watkins told me during our interview. Maintaining quest progress even after defeat, earning crafting supplies from Scrappy, and having multiple ways to extract means that it’s very doable to plan your way to victory at your own pace while also having a solid safety net to fall back on should you lose.</p> <hr> <p>Defeat is a crushing experience in an extraction shooter. But <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">as I’ve said before</a>, those deep lows make for exhilarating highs when you come out alive from a tense battle or manage to get away with a sweet amount of loot.</p> <p>Ahead of release, however, we’ve only gotten a taste of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ maps, its arsenal, and its threats. How the full experience will evolve over time remains to be seen, but based on my time with the game during its technical previews, I’m eager to see what wild, unexpected moments will happen out there in post-apocalyptic Italy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>2017 was one of the all-time great years for video games, with major tentpole games like </span><i><span>Super Mario Odyssey</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>dominating GOTY conversations. So if you missed out on some of the hidden gems of that year, I wouldn’t blame you. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/battle-chef-brigade-the-kotaku-review-1820617722"><i><span>Battle Chef Brigade</span></i></a><span> is one of those precious games that might have gotten lost in the shuffle, and Trinket Studios’ match-three/brawler/cooking game still holds up in 2025. However, the studio didn’t just try and make lighting strike twice with its latest project that’s out now on PC, PS5, and Switch. </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces </span></i><span>is a much different game than its predecessor, but it’s no less stylish, endearing, and compelling.</span></p> <p><span>I want to rely on some easy lexicon to describe </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span>, but I fear calling it a deckbuilder might give you the wrong impression. The game’s strategic battles are played with a deck of cards, each representing a different member of its mech-piloting crew, but these conflicts are less about getting mired in the mechanical complexities of individual cards than they are solving a puzzle with a randomized set of tools. Each card pulls from a different set of colored energies that replenish each turn to unleash attacks on the opposing team, and they all have different attack patterns on the game’s 5v5 field. So card placement on the board is just as important as your deck composition, and can be the difference between gaining the upper hand in a match or being outplayed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Firepower isn’t enough to win every time, though, and that’s where secondary effects and synergy come into play. Each pilot has additional perks, such as how Felix, the carefree white-haired hottie whom I’ve been lusting after my whole playthrough, is able to unleash a more powerful attack after his teammates destroy a certain number of enemy units. Yan’s mech is able to pierce through enemies, meaning it can fire a beam through an opposing card while also directly hitting their ship, which is similar to attacking your foe’s Life Points directly in a game of </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>. If you can destroy an enemy ship, you automatically win a duel. You don’t need a piercing ability to do it, as leaving any of the five spaces on the field empty leaves you and your enemies vulnerable to a direct attack. So, having units that can attack multiple spaces or really take advantage of an opening is a pretty reliable strategy, but more often than not, your foes will have more cannon fodder to put between your crew and their ship.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639933"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639933">© Trinket Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At first, I didn’t quite see the depth of </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span> until I started playing around in the simulations on my ship that would give me only a few cards and challenge me with something like winning the fight it set up in one turn. These typically required me to take advantage of passive perks in order to set off a chain of attacks that relied on precise positioning and an order of operations to activate. I could read the card descriptions, such as the explanation of Daciana’s passive ability to proc a free attack every time one of her allies destroyed an enemy, but seeing the cards in action is what made the game click for me. These plays are why I’m more inclined to describe </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span> as a turn-based strategy game rather than a deck builder, because you only have a handful of units, and the game doesn’t make you create decks of dozens of cards with a ton of minutiae to memorize. Once you see a lot of these characters playing off each other on the field, those bespoke mechanics naturally weave themselves into your strategies without the game becoming too overwhelming.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the five or so hours I’ve put into </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span> so far, the game has pretty gently eased me into its whole deal, and the simple but satisfying card battles are only one slice of it. Those cards have names and faces, and the crew you’ll recruit into your deck is a big reason the game is so breezy. </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces </span></i><span>stars Heathcliff, the captain of a starcraft called the USS Zephyr. In his spaceflight adventures, he and his crew meet several other mech pilots who are all typically game to join their cause as they investigate ancient cosmic secrets. Recruiting these characters gets you a new card for your deck, but it also puts another misfit on your ship. They chat with you, but also with each other, so there’s a constant sense of camaraderie and community between the group. Thus far, everyone’s pretty likable, and I’m interested to see their relationships grow not only with me as the player, but with each other, as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639932" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639932"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639932">© Trinket Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These relationships are elevated by </span><i><span>Battle Suit Aces</span></i><span>’ incredible character art and best-in-class voice acting. The anime-inspired art style looks straight out of classic mech anime like </span><i><span>Gundam </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Evangelion</span></i><span>, though its chipper tone helps differentiate it from the latter. Everyone is hot and wearing a plug suit, so there’s something for everyone here. The game is full of memorable performances from some talented voice acting veterans, and I’ve really enjoyed listening to their interactions between duels, which help give the whole thing an authentic classic anime feel.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Battle Suit Aces </span></i><span>has a lot to offer without ever getting too in the weeds that it becomes overwhelming. Much like </span><i><span>Battle Chef Brigade</span></i><span>, it manages to hit the sweet spot between tactical and approachable without ever veering too far into one or the other. Its skill expression is vast, its characters are easy to love, and it marries both sides of its world in a way that keeps me playing for just one more match. I’m looking forward to seeing where the USS Zephyr’s crew takes me as our journey through space continues.</span></p>
