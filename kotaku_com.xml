              <p><span>Netflix is still playing catch-up after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>the runaway success</span></a><span> of its animated musical </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>, and that means a lot of the merchandising and collaboration deals that should probably have been in the works a long time ago are still trickling in. We’ve gotten </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><span>a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>crossover</span></a><span>, cast </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-tonight-show-golden-performance-ejae-2000633180"><span>appearances on late-night</span></a><span>, and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>limited theatrical run</span></a><span> for people to sing along to all the movie’s bangers. But now, some of the bigger toy manufacturers want in on that Huntr/x hysteria, including Hasbro. Yeah, that probably means dolls, but it also very likely means </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>is about to get another Secret Lair drop in the coming months.</span></p> <p><span>Hasbro and Netflix </span><a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fans-netflix-goes-golden-forging-unprecedented-kpop-demon"><span>announced their new partnership</span></a><span> yesterday, October 21, and say they plan to release “toys, collectibles, games, role-play products and more” featuring Rumi, Mira, and Zoey. The announcement goes on to say that Hasbro is working on “dolls, action figures, accessories, collectibles, playsets, [and] collaborations with co-brands.” That last one is interesting, considering Hasbro also notes a few of its brands, and says it will be “leveraging the strength of its iconic portfolio” for more </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>products. That portfolio includes Hasbro Games (which is making a </span><i><span>Monopoly</span></i><span> board game featuring the characters and iconography from the film), Wizards of the Coast, Nerf, and…Furby. Pushing the image of a Rumi-themed Furby from my mind with the strength of the Honmoon, the brand that is the most interesting in that line-up is Wizards of the Coast, the company behind </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering</span></i><span>. The trading card game has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><span>essentially become </span><i><span>Fortnite: The Card Game</span></i></a> <span>with its myriad crossovers and collaborations bringing characters and artwork from properties like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245"><i><span>Sonic</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-playstation-last-of-us-god-of-war-ellie-2000629350"><span>PlayStation Studios’ portfolio</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817"><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i></a><span> to its booster packs.</span></p> <p><span>While the actual </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>community is pretty split on WOTC’s focus on crossovers, people who don’t play the game, like myself, are more likely to get in a digital queue for a Secret Lair drop if it has characters we know. I have the Shadow the Hedgehog card sitting on my shelf right now. Would I throw down some cash for cards of my demon-slaying queens? Yeah, fucking probably. I played </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>for the first time so I could skydive to “How It’s Done” and headshot some fools. You think I won’t pay money for a high-quality card? I’m a mark. I can complain about the crossover slop all day, but I’m just as bad as anyone. I’ll clap and cheer for cards with bespoke holographic patterns made to look like the Honmoon. You think you’re better than me? I can’t hear you over the sound of me ordering tickets to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-theater-return-halloween-2000635744"><span>my third sing-along showing next week</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> has revealed its final two characters and its long-awaited release date. The comic book brawler arrives December 1 with Iron Man (Tony Stark) and Phoenix (Jean Grey) rounding out its roster of gorgeously pixel-art-animated superheroes.</p> <p>Dotemu released one last trailer to celebrate the impending launch which includes brief looks at the newly revealed additions and the gang fighting in front of a giant Master Mold Sentinel like the ’90s <em>X-Men</em> cartoon was turned into a <em>Mega Man X</em> spin-off.</p>

  <p>The full roster, for anyone who hasn’t been keeping track at home, includes the 15 following fighters:</p> <ul> <li>Beta Ray Bill</li> <li>Black Panther</li> <li>Captain America</li> <li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li> <li>Nova</li> <li>Phyla-Vell</li> <li>Rocket Raccoon</li> <li>She-Hulk</li> <li>Spider-Man</li> <li>Storm</li> <li>Silver Surfer</li> <li>Venom</li> <li>Wolverine</li> <li>Iron Man</li> <li>Phoenix</li> </ul> <p>There’s a nice range of household names and Marvel back-benchers sporting a variety of different attack styles and abilities. That’s the one thing that the demo, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663">still free to try on Steam</a>, really drives home. Each of these characters plays surprisingly distinctly for a beat ’em up, especially when you account <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">for mid-battle character switching and team-up attacks</a>.</p> <p><em>Marvel Cosmic</em> <em>Invasion</em> is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch 1, and PC. Is December 1 enough time for me to go back and Platinum the excellent<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em>? We’ll see.</p>
