Then rumors spread and people go, “Huh, is that true?” That leads to more people downloading the game and spending some money on it.

A train station schedule appears with the numbers 03 12 20:24 as the inbound column turns into PlayStation symbols. Some fans wonder if it’s meant to hint at a potential December 3, 2024 event. Perhaps one last State of Play or bigger livestream event pointing to what’s ahead for the PS5?</p><p>It’s a reach, but there are a couple of things that make it feel within the realm of possibility. First, commenters have noted that there is precedent for Sony holding December events. Once upon a time during the PS4 generation, it hosted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/there-won-t-be-a-playstation-experience-event-this-year-1829398961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/there-won-t-be-a-playstation-experience-event-this-year-1829398961">fan-oriented PlayStation Experience events</a></span>. And while those were retired many years ago at this point, Sony did hold a special <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzV3MFs2ok&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzV3MFs2ok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December State of Play in 2019</a></span> to mark the 25th anniversary of PlayStation. It included announcements for <em>Resident Evil 3 </em>remake, <em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em> DLC, and a <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> tease. This December, meanwhile, marks the 30th anniversary. </p><p>It’s also felt like a a weird year for PS5 announcements overall. Sony’s standard 2024 summer showcase was downgraded to a State of Play, and despite plenty of exclusives hitting the console this year, players still don’t have a ton of insight into what’s shaping up for 2025. A December showcase would be a perfect time to tease more of Sucker Punch’s <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, Hideo Kojima’s <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, and potentially a release date for Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em>. The company recently promised at least one big new first-party single-player exclusive every year. </p><p>There’s another big event happening next month as well: Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards. Scheduled for December 12, we could very well see a big reveal from Sony at that show, which continues to draw bigger and bigger crowds each year. Or, maybe the company wants to set the stage with its own State of Play at the beginning of the month before using Keighley’s show for a second, deeper dive into something already revealed. </p><p>Or maybe a couple of still frames from a random PlayStation ad aren’t actually meant to signal anything. Either way, we’ll find out soon enough. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you want an easy way to play the old games on modern hardware with some quality-of-life improvements, like autosave and a weapon wheel, then the <em>Trilogy </em>is better than ever and a solid option. If you want perfect emulation of those old games, then the <em>Trilogy </em>is still not close to offering that. </p><p>Sadly, if you play on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch, you don’t have access to the update yet and are still stuck with the older versions. Ultimately, the <em>Trilogy </em>is still a bit of a mess, but it’s a lot better now than it was in 2021. And that’s nice! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has since seen two mainline sequels, <em>Metro: Last Light</em> and <em>Metro Exodus</em>, which have continued to expand its story set in an apocalyptic Russia. Now, the franchise has returned with a VR-exclusive game called <em>Metro Awakening</em>, which lets you experience this tattered world as if you lived there yourself.</p><p>If you’ve been eagerly awaiting a new game in the franchise, a VR-only title may not have been on your bingo card. But luckily, <em>Metro Awakening</em> doesn’t abandon what came before it, but expands upon it instead with a side story that may shock long-time <em>Metro </em>enthusiasts with some incredible revelations about a fan-favorite character.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmetro-awakening%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmetro-awakening%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metro Awakening</em></a></span>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-recommend-id="image://d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-recommend-id="image://d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is a spin-off prequel to the first game in the series, <em>Metro 2033</em>. Unlike the main games, players no longer control beloved protagonist Artyom, and instead take on the role of a doctor named Sedar, who is on a mission through the Moscow tunnels to find his wife—even if it leads him to darker and more mystical places than he could’ve ever expected.</p><p>Don’t worry, though: Everything you’ve loved about the mainline games is largely here (albeit in VR form), including all of the tense and claustrophobic thrills of exploring the dark and dreary underground subways humans call home in the <em>Metro </em>universe. And yes, you still have to survive with limited ammo, engage in stealth, and wear gas masks to avoid radiation if you want to reach the end of your journey. In other words, if you’re a fan of the previous entries in the franchise, rest assured that <em>Metro Awakening</em> hasn’t strayed far from the path.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-recommend-id="image://3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-recommend-id="image://3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is developed by Vertigo Games, an award-winning studio known for other well-received VR titles like <em>Arizona Sunshine</em>, <em>A Fisherman’s Tale</em>, and<em> After the Fall</em>.

It’s doubtful that Vertigo Games will ever expand the game with any type of multiplayer, so make sure you’re prepared to enjoy this title alone before picking it up.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-recommend-id="image://fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-recommend-id="image://fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The <em>Metro </em>series is popular around the world, so Vertigo Games has ensured that language barriers are mitigated as well as possible in <em>Metro Awakening</em>. As such, the game supports English audio, as well as subtitles for English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian.</p><hr><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is available now. If this kind of post-apocalyptic survival shooter is your kind of thing, make sure to also keep an eye on the long-awaited sequel <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl </em>launching November 20.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
