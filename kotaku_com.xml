              <p>Netflix is bidding <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">over $80 billion to buy Warner Bros.</a>, and it’s probably not doing it for the games. But the company will still come away with a ton of them if the merger goes through. Warner Bros. Games is one of the few major publishers left in the U.S. following years of big acquisition deals. What might be closer to a rounding error relative to the larger movie and TV portfolio still marks a huge shift for the industry. And Netflix’s incredibly chaotic fumbling of gaming over the last several years raises some alarm bells.</p> <p>The king of streaming confirmed during a conference call presentation about the newly revealed deal that games would be part of the transaction, but <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">never discussed them outright</a>. Instead, they were relegated to the smallest square on a presentation slide outlining the various components of the merger. They were lumped in with “Games &amp; Consumer Product &amp; Experiences” alongside much bigger brands like HBO, DC, Harry Potter, and Superman.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650991"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650991">Netflix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Even with its massive success, the best-selling game of 2023, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, was clearly nowhere close to top-of-mind for Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters. The open-world wizarding game already has a sequel in development at Avalanche Software, and it’s supposed to have <a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-hbo-harry-potter-tv-release-date-1851690168">some level of crossover</a> with the upcoming HBO <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot. The first <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> sold over 30 million copies. In revenue terms at least, that puts it way ahead of the global box office for something like James Gunn’s first<em> Superman </em>movie.</p>

 <p>Then there’s TT Games, the UK-based maker of the recent hit <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>. It announced a new adaptation of <em>Batman</em> earlier this year called <em>Lego Batman: The Legacy of the Dark Knight,</em> which acts as a best-of sizzle reel for the comic book hero’s peak movie moments <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994">in an<em> Arkham</em>-style open world</a>. There’s no release date yet, but it seems likely to arrive sometime in 2026. If it’s anything like the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, it’ll be another top-seller.</p>

 <p>Netflix will also become the new home of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. While a new movie launches next year, fans have been waiting for NeatherRealms to return to the DC universe with <em>Injustice 3</em>. The studio <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810">announced earlier this year</a> that it was done shipping new DLC for 2023’s <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> and would switch to focusing on its “next project” instead. Unless Ed Boon’s team is quietly at work on a completely new cross-over fighting game, a return to the alternate DC universe where Superman is bad still seems like the safest bet.</p>

 <h2>The fate of Rocksteady Studios</h2> <p>After that, things at Warner Bros. Games start to get really messy, thanks to years of seemingly short-sighted and chaotic executive decisions. Rocksteady Studios, once the team behind premier blockbusters like <em>Batman: Arkham City</em> and<em> Batman: Arkham Knight,</em> has been licking its wounds after the dismal failure of last year’s live service spin-off,<em> Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Encouraged by publisher leadership</a> despite misgivings from the studio floor, the multiplayer loot shooter lost over $200 million, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">according to<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The studio is reportedly back to focusing on the Arkham franchise that made it famous, but a new entry would still be years away during a time when AAA development is more expensive and precarious than ever. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games took an ax to many of its other studios, including <em>MultiVersus</em> maker Player First Games, WB San Diego, which was making a free-to-play AAA game, and Monolith Productions, which was working on a long-in-development adaptation of <em>Wonder Woman</em>. The latter had a storied history, including developing the <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> series, but <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/103578/full-backstory-revealed-on-why-wb-games-axed-monolith-productions/index.html">lost key leadership</a> after it was forced to pivot from a new IP to adapting <em>Wonder Woman</em>.</p>

 <p>All of this turmoil resulted in publishing head David Haddad being fired from Warner Bros. Games after a decade-plus tenure. The game division’s struggles may have also been compounded by whip-lash from above, amid Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s ongoing whirlwind tour through the unraveling conglomerate. Despite casually trampling on marketing plans by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23612615/mortal-kombat-12-announced-2023-release-date/">revealing projects early</a> during investor calls, Zaslav never seemed to be interested in providing Warner Bros. Games with a clear mission or mandate other than “help make stock price go up.”</p> <h2>The Netflix Gaming debacle</h2> <p>News of the sale might be more reassuring if Netflix management didn’t seem equally at a loss when it comes to games. The streamer snatched up a bunch of small studios, including notable indie darlings like<em> Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio and <em>Cozy Grove</em> maker Spry Fox over the years. It loaded up its mobile app with tons of critically-acclaimed games from<em> Hades</em> to <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em>. It sought big-name additions like the<em> GTA Trilogy Remastered</em>. It even plunged ahead with an AAA studio called Team Blue that pulled veterans from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>.</p> <p>But despite bundling top games with its standard subscription service, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/23/netflix-takes-slow-approach-to-video-games.html">almost nobody played them</a>. It started abandoning indie game deals, cutting resources, and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">quietly shuttered</a> its AAA team last year. Just this week, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">Netflix announced</a> it was selling off Spry Fox, which it bought only three years ago, though the ambitious 3D Studio-Ghibli-meets-<em>Animal-Crossing</em>-chillfest called <em>Spirit Crossing</em> will remain in development. Instead, the company’s big focus moving forward will be party games and quick-turn-around licensed junk for its biggest streaming hits like <em>Squid Games</em> and <em>Bridgerton</em>. It’s the latest example of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122">tech company racing into gaming and falling flat on its face</a>.</p>

 <p>So where does that leave Warner Bros. Games and its checkered portfolio of major games and studios? It’s hard to say. In some ways, it complements all of the areas of gaming where Netflix has already failed or retreated. It may not be high up on the list of synergies, but maybe the possibility of an eventual <em>Lego Stranger Things</em> anthology is still part of the streaming platform’s overall ambitions for the merger. Or maybe gaming, and AAA blockbuster gaming in particular, is so peripheral to Netflix’s broader business that Warner Bros. Gaming will find itself in an even more precarious position.</p> <p>Giant acquisitions are rarely as neat and tidy in practice as they appear on paper or in a PowerPoint presentation, even in the best of times, let alone when they’re thrown together in the midst of bidding wars, tumultuous legacy media transformations, and a race toward industry consolidation in order to achieve monopoly pricing power. The only thing worse is the alternatives: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/i-wanna-blow-this-up-how-bari-weiss-is-trying-to-overhaul-cbs-news-7c222dcd?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf__sU79yafyMQJEMfHCSs4fmigQ3B1FDTDxd4VSdFIXnEqE9fLO4kOIFOfdrE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693321bd&amp;gaa_sig=YVIiDhsSG8Saq0NhdsXVZfrJk7xIcIWtlf4iFEqprJZt9Q0pE5poRMAJo7dIKNvDDygD-VXenQ654oZeVxoqcQ%3D%3D">the Bari Weis network</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">Microsoft</a>, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Saudi Arabia</a> aren’t great options either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fnaf-2-five-nights-freddys-2-movie-trailer-teaser-foxy-1851786887">Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</a>,</em> out now in theaters, doesn’t sound like a good movie. And sure, the first film wasn’t a cinematic masterpiece, but according to critics, the sequel is even worse. It’s already one of 2025’s worst-rated movies, beating out some real stinkers.</p> <p><em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is the follow-up to 2023’s <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> and, like that movie, is a live-action adaptation of the popular horror game franchise that features a lot of evil animatronic figures and tons of confusing and bizarre lore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddys-fnaf-movie-review-box-office-1850974086">The original film was a big hit at the box office</a>, but took a beating from critics and ended up with an abysmal <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys">33% on</a> <em>Rotten Tomatoes.</em> I bet Blumhouse and Universal would love for the newly released sequel to have that score. Instead, critics seem to hate this new entry even more, with <em>Freddy’s 2</em> sitting at a truly awful 12% on the review aggregate site. Ouch.</p>

 <p>Here’s what various critics think about this latest horror sequel:</p> <blockquote><p>“Clunky, overstuffed, and strangely lifeless, <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> trades genuine scares for incoherent lore. Even the animatronics can’t save a sequel that feels more like brand maintenance than an actual movie.” – <strong>Dionar Hidalgo, <em>Algo Más Que Cine</em></strong></p> <p>“[Its] sole imperative appears to be boring its audience to death.” – <strong>Nick Schager, <em>The Daily Beast</em></strong></p> <p>“<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> plays best for die-hard fans; for everyone else, it’s a stitched-together sequel with few scares and even fewer surprises.” – <strong>Allison Rose, <em>FlickDirect</em></strong></p> <p><em>“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is one of Blumhouse’s worst sequels, nothing more than a cynical cash grab that treats its audience and fanbase like mindless children.” -T<strong>yler Taing, <em>Discussing Film</em></strong></p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys_2/reviews">And it goes on and on and on.</a> The consensus is that the movie is primarily designed to appeal to younger teens who are already obsessed with the franchise and will pick up on all the lore, Easter eggs, and secrets buried in the PG-13 horror flick. So it will likely make a lot of money, like the last one. But for everyone else, including people who like good movies, <em>Freddy’s 2</em> sounds like a bad time and one to avoid.</p>

 <p>Compared to some other stinkers released this year, <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is up there. It has a worse <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_section_31">Rotten Tomatoes score than the awful <em>Star Trek</em> movie</a> we got this year, which most people thankfully don’t know about. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie">It also has a worse <em>RT</em> rating</a> than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">utterly awful Jack Black led <em>Minecraft</em> film</a>, which is wild. It even has a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disneys_snow_white">worse score</a> than <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney’s terrible <em>Snow White</em> remake</a>, which, yes, came out this year. Remember that movie? Probably not.</p> <p>Oh, and if you are wondering, no, according to <em>Rotten Tomatoes, Freddy’s 2</em> is better than the <em>Borderlands</em> movie. But just barely, as that disaster of a flick from Eli Roth has <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands">a 10% rating.</a> Better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912"><em>Borderlands</em></a> isn’t much, but it is something to brag about, I guess?</p>

              <p>Of the many progression paths to follow in extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i>, perhaps one of the most rewarding are blueprints. They expand your arsenal by giving you access to craft all sorts of new weapons, gun mods, grenades, and more. Once you hit max level, finish all your quests (you get blueprints for many of these!), and even wrap up the expedition project, collecting blueprints is the true end-game grind.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-screenshots-photo-mode-hud-binoculars-2000650620">One Player Turned 2025’s Hit Extraction Shooter Into A Stunning War Photography Sim</a></p> <p>But blueprints are often quite tricky to find. Outside of the ones you earn for completing quests, most players come across blueprints randomly, without much rhyme or reason as to why they’re found in certain areas.</p>

 <p>In my extensive time with the game, blueprints can be very hard to source reliably, unlike much of the game’s loot, which typically is found in specific environmental categories. It truly feels random.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-kill-spaceport-trials-into-the-fray-2000649665">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Way To Kill A Leaper In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>But don’t despair, there are some clear strategies that can amplify your chances of finding new blueprints. Let’s get into it.</p>

 <h2>Blueprint hunting? Prioritize Night and Electromagnetic Storm Raids</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000650972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650972"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650972">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ five unique maps see a regular rotation of activities, such as Night Raids, raids with intense lightning storms, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-hidden-bunker-wall-hack-glitch-keys-2000650571">Spaceport’s exclusive Hidden Bunker activity</a>. These activities have fewer extraction points, as well as environmental conditions that can prove more dangerous than a normal run.</p>

 <p>But in my experience, they seem to dramatically improve your chances of finding blueprints. Also, running an activity like a Night Raid will double the amount of trial points you get for completing certain activities, and it’s not uncommon to earn a blueprint from completing a trial.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">The Hoarder’s Guide To Managing Your <i>Arc Raiders</i> Inventory</a></p> <p>These activities are dangerous, however, so you want to go in well-equipped <i>or</i> without much to lose. Whether you want to bring in your valuable weapons or minimize your losses is up to you, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned by hitting Night Raids and similar activities, it’s to avoid running with a Free Loadout when possible.</p>

 <h2>Don’t use Free Loadouts when hunting for blueprints</h2> <p>Free Loadouts are wonderful. They’re a quick way to warm up without much risk of loss. But they don’t include a safe pocket, which lets you stash away a single item (that isn’t a gun or shield) to be preserved even if you fail to extract with it.</p>

 <p>So yes, while rolling into a Night Raid with a Free Loadout situates you with nothing to lose and everything to gain, scoring a blueprint on a run won’t do you much good if you get taken out without the ability to safely secure that item.</p> <p>By the time you start&nbsp; grinding for blueprints and hitting up the more challenging map conditions, you should have enough loot to at least put together a basic loadout with an augment that includes a safe pocket.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">The Best Guns For Every Possible Situation In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>Remember, you can always trade a Free Loadout augment for any of the starting augments from Lance in the Traders tab of the main menu.</p>

 <p>Once you find a blueprint, toss that thing into your safe pocket immediately. Don’t take any chances.</p> <h2>Now that you have a safe pocket for blueprints, where should you look?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000650971" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650971"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650971">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There might be a blueprint hiding in some random hood of a car in a parking lot. There could be one in a trash can tucked away in an alley somewhere. They’re exceedingly random in their hiding spots, and it’s hard to predict just where you’ll find one.</p> <p>For that reason, you’re going to want to prioritize locations with <i>tons</i> of loot containers, especially office buildings that have no shortage of desk drawers, lockers, and cabinets to rifle through.</p>

 <p>In my experience, it’s not so much that things like desk drawers and lockers have a higher likelihood of containing a blueprint, but it’s that in a room filled with them, you’re simply opening far more containers and are thus increasing your odds of finding a blueprint by numbers alone. Think of them like loot boxes (that you don’t pay for). Do you want to open one or two with the chance of finding something good? Or a dozen of them?</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheat-sheet-crafting-guns-ardb-wiki-2000644449"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Best Cheat Sheets And Third-Party Resources</a></p> <p>I recommend searching the following locations as they’re filled with lockers and drawers:</p> <h3>Spaceport</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Arrival Building</li> <li aria-level="1">Departure Building</li> <li aria-level="1">Control Tower A6</li> </ul> <h3>Dam Battlegrounds</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Research &amp; Administration</li> <li aria-level="1">Control Tower</li> <li aria-level="1">Testing Annex</li> </ul> <h3>Buried City</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Plaza Rosa (especially the locked pharmacy)</li> <li aria-level="1">Library</li> <li aria-level="1">Space Travel</li> <li aria-level="1">Research</li> <li aria-level="1">Hospital</li> </ul> <p>As for the remaining two maps, you can certainly end up finding blueprints on them, but Blue Gate, in my experience, doesn’t have as many office suites filled with tons of drawers to improve your lottery chances. That said, the Reinforced Reception area is pretty good, but that location is likely to be hot with other players as there’s some great weaponry to be found down there.</p>

 <p>Similarly, Stella Montis, the game’s tiniest map, has quickly made a name for itself as a slaughterfest. It’s basically the unofficial PvP map. So, while you might stand to find some good blueprints here, expect some overwhelming fights. If you’re dead set on going here to hunt blueprints, you probably want to prioritize Medical Research, Loading Bay, or the many discarded suitcases in Lobby. Still, Stella Montis is typically such a dangerous map that I wouldn’t advise going here unless you’re looking for a brawl. You might find a blueprint, only to be killed moments later without a chance to even stash it away in your safe pocket.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>Finally, trash cans <i>seem </i>like they have a higher percentage of containing a blueprint. Don’t worry, that doesn’t mean you need to run up to every single trash can you see. You can tell if a trash can has loot if it has an extra cover on top, making it appear taller than other receptacles.</p> <h2>Search <i>everything</i> in key rooms</h2> <p>In general, it’s best to loot the locked rooms during Night Raids and similar activities. But as with the locations listed above, be <i>thorough</i> in your searches of these rooms. I recommend bringing Door Blockers and Barricade Kits, as well as other items to booby trap these rooms once you get in. That will buy you time to sift through every possible loot container in case <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">another player tries to jump you</a> while you’re looting the now-unlocked room.</p> <hr> <p>Blueprints are essential for piecing together a new <i>Arc Raiders </i>loadout that’s powerful and effective after a crushing loss.</p> <p>Happy hunting!</p>

              <p>The&nbsp;<em>Postal</em> games have always been what you might call “slop.” Running With Scissors’ series of puerile, drearily unfunny action games have somehow regularly been released since 1997, relying entirely on their hamfisted “shock factor” to try to impress an audience that delights in “politically incorrect” or “anti-woke” dross, without also remembering the important elements of “fun.” But the most recently revealed entry in the 30-year series, <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise</em>, earns the “slop” mantle for a different reason, after massive backlash against its prolific use of AI has seen it canceled in the same week it was announced!</p> <p>Revealed just two days ago, on December 3,&nbsp;<em>Postal: Bullet Paradise&nbsp;</em>was due to be a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-like spin-off from the franchise, developed by a separate team called Goonswarm Games. Described as a “bullet-heaven shooter with online co-op,” Running With Scissors promoted the upcoming game with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162690/POSTAL_Bullet_Paradise/">a Steam page</a>, YouTube trailers, and a <a href="https://runningwithscissors.com/postal-bullet-paradise-brings-nonstop-action-pc-consoles/">section on its own website</a>. Of them all, the only thing that fully remains two days later is the post, with the Steam page delisted and the game removed from RWS’s and Goonswarm’s pages.</p>

 <p>Based on the game’s cancellation announcement <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1pdenph/rws_using_ai_is_incredibly_disappointing/">on Running With Scissors’ X page</a>, it seems potential fans launched a sizable backlash after noticing&nbsp;<em>Postal: Bullet Paradise</em>&nbsp;allegedly contained AI-generated material. Users on the franchise’s Reddit were complaining about AI art appearing in the trailer, and alleging Goonswarm had used AI in its previous work. “You see can very clearly that all the pixel sprites are ai generated,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1pdenph/rws_using_ai_is_incredibly_disappointing/">claimed on Reddit poster</a>, adding, “It just sucks that rws is going down the path of ai since they’ve been so supportive of art for a long time.”</p>

 <p>Then came the announcement declaring the entire project flushed. “After revealing <em>POSTAL: Bullet Paradise</em>, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing,” says the statement, “we’ve been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned&nbsp;<em>POSTAL</em> Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">After revealing POSTAL: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned POSTAL Community.

 <p>This is especially embarrassing for the publisher, given that it had only a few days ago publicly disagreed with Epic’s Tim Sweeney over the need to declare AI use in game development.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Customers deserve to know if a game was crafted with creativity, soul and actual talent rather than some machine that craps out anything from a prompt.</p> <p>We don't know what the future holds, but AI apologists like Mr. Sweeney are making this shit unbearable already. <a href="https://t.co/eHszQu5STP">https://t.co/eHszQu5STP</a></p> <p>— Running With Scissors (@RWSstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/RWSstudios/status/1994033855934644492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Postal</em>, a top-down shooter about playing a postal worker who goes on a mass murder spree throughout the town of Paradise, Arizona, went out of its way to court controversy and notoriety when it first appeared. Its final level was set in an elementary school (albeit where the main character, Postal Dude, has a complete breakdown after none of his weapons work on the children), and its deliberately crass approach was designed to get as much negative attention as possible, presumably to drive sales. However, the mediocre game never sold all that well, and after an equally crap 3D sequel five years later, the company began outsourcing development to Russian studios. 2011’s <em>Postal III</em> was made by Trashmasters, and was so terrible RWS apologized for the game in the aftermath, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130629223127/http://runningwithscissors.com/main/index.php?topic=625.0">eventually deleting it from their store entirely</a>. A 2016 redux version of <em>Postal 2</em> sold so poorly on PC that console versions were canceled (until years later), until RWS finally returned to making their own game with 2022’s <em>Postal 4: No Regrets</em>.</p> <p>It’s probably not a good thing when your franchise’s highlight is a Uwe Boll movie. And to be clear, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/postal/">that too was atrocious</a>.</p>

              <p>I love winter, but I am definitely the complaining type. Anything below 15 degrees is a bit too cold for me, and the same is the case during summer; above 30°C is basically the boiling point. If you can relate and are looking for a year-round solution that offers both focused and diffused modes, the Dyson Hot plus Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">Right now, you can pick it up for just $350 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping $150 off its usual price</a>. It’s a post Black Friday deal that made it through the main event, but it won’t be around forever. It won’t be long before the price shoots back up, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly.</p>

<h2>Uninterrupted Airflow</h2>
<p>It’s Dyson, so as you’d expect, the overall design is quite minimal. The solid base makes it easy to place it just about anywhere, from the middle of the lounge to a corner of your room. Year-round comfort is made possible with its dual capabilities; cools you in summer and warms you up when things start to get chilly.</p>
<p>The fan uses an Air Multiplier technology that amplifies the surrounding air to give you a smooth, uninterrupted airflow. There are two operating modes to choose from. The Focused mode delivers fast, personal heating or cooling, while the Diffused mode gently adjusts the temperature of your entire room. Speaking of temperature, you can adjust it anywhere from 32 to 98.6°F. For instance, in winters, if you’ve just come home after spending time with friends on a chilly evening, go for the focused mode to relax your body a bit, and then switch to the Diffused mode to warm the entire room up. The ceramic plates heat up fast, so you won’t have to wait too long for the thing to work, either. When using the diffused mode, the fan oscillates at a 70° angle to direct airflow around the room evenly.</p>



<p>It also works fairly quietly, which is great if you want to take a nap with it running. What’s more, you can create sleep timers to program the fan to turn off after pre-set intervals. These can range anywhere from 15 minutes to 9 hours​. The included remote makes it easy to do this and more. You can adjust the temperature, switch modes, create schedules, etc. It’s also magnetized, so you can store it neatly on the fan itself and never lose track of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">This deal brings the price of this smart, multifunctional fan to just $350, saving you $150 on your purchase.</a> It can be used in both summer and winter, doesn’t make an annoying sound while working, and even lets you set timers for added convenience. The Silver finish gives off a premium look, so it can blend into any setup with ease. And since the fan isn’t cordless, you don’t have to worry about running out of power when you need it the most. Just plug it into an outlet, and enjoy an uninterrupted stream of airflow for hours. Again, the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, so we don’t expect it to last long. In fact, it might not even make it through the weekend. If you’ve been after a unit that works as both a heater and a fan, now is the time to make the move.</p>
