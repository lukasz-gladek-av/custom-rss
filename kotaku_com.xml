              <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio recently released a new demo for<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami,</em> an upcoming remake of the original PS3-era <em>Yakuza 3.</em> And a single alleyway in the demo has become the center of an online debate about whether<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> is a visual downgrade when compared to the OG game.</p> <p>On January 21, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3948220/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties_Demo/">Sega released a demo for <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</a> It didn’t take long after the demo’s launch for people to start complaining about the remake. Some aren’t happy that, like in the OG game, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qj4cdi/damn_kiwami_3_is_crazy_faithful_to_yakuza_3/">every character you fight is an expert at blocking.</a> Others claim that the remake’s map is smaller than the original’s and are unhappy about it. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/yakuza-3-remake-backlash-blows-up-again-as-actor-guilty-of-sexual-harassment-stars-in-new-trailer">There’s also the crappy decision by RGG to recast a character with actor Teruyuki Kagawa</a>, a man who has been accused of sexual assault against a hostess in 2019. While he apologized in 2022, people are still upset that he’s included in the remake. But the newest and biggest controversy surrounding <em>Kiwami 3</em> involves an alleyway found in the demo.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/wj9u8chpW5">pic.twitter.com/wj9u8chpW5</a></p> <p>— Yakuza Spain 🐉 (@SpainYakuza) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpainYakuza/status/2014115748491252142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 21, a user on Twitter shared a post comparing an alley in the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> on PS3 with how it looks in the remake’s demo. While the original looks realistic and inviting, the remake’s version looks garish and ugly. However, the original account claimed that the rest of the demo looked better and was on par with recent RGG games. Another user pointed out that the alleyway looks fine when you aren’t inside of it, and <a href="https://x.com/Kami_No_Okami/status/2014382700677706178">someone else suggested it was tied to a technical issue involving the game’s lighting</a>. This is a problem that has plagued past <em>Yakuza/Like a Dragon</em> games, including <em>Pirates in Hawaii.&nbsp;</em></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yakuza Kiwami 3 lighting issues are an auto-exposure bug.</p> <p>When in a dark area, the game brightens to make things easier to see, which overexposes bright areas and makes things look fullbright.</p> <p>The fix is as easy as disabling this, but Pirates in Hawaii had the same issue. <a href="https://t.co/hVu5OaUYzw">pic.twitter.com/hVu5OaUYzw</a></p> <p>— MeovvCAT (@osu_MeovvCAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/osu_MeovvCAT/status/2014364282725474705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That information didn’t stop the original post comparing the old and new game from going viral online, <a href="https://x.com/kitsuneredFES/status/2014250516977492350">leading to more people sharing footage</a> and <a href="https://x.com/exblackwater/status/2014149801554633074">screenshots of the ugly alleyway</a> on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mcyuyh2ylk25">social media sites like Twitter and BlueSky</a> as well as Reddit.</p>

 <p>Thankfully, the playerbase is already fixing the ugly lighting issues in <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/yakuzakiwami3/mods/16">There’s already a mod</a> for the demo online that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qjuwsf/a_quick_original_filter_vs_no_filter_comparison/">apparently removes a visual filter RGG has implemented in the game and in other recent <em>Yakuza</em> titles.</a> And yeah, seeing the game both with and without the filter makes it clear that this isn’t an ugly game. Instead, it seems that the filter, as well as some shading issues, are causing it to look worse than the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> in some specific circumstances. Hopefully the devs add a toggle to remove the filter, but considering they are shipping <em>Kiwami 3</em> with an actor who allegedly sexually assaulted a woman, I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pathways</span></i><span>, a “bespoke interactive learning” game developed in collaboration with the “political literacy” platform Shout Out UK and funded by the British government, has inadvertently spawned a “cute goth e-girl” meme. The game was meant to fight anti-immigrant extremism, but now its character has been turned into a pro-right-wing symbol.</span></p> <p><span>Developed by the Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire council in collaboration with Shout Out UK, </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><span>is a barebones visual novel web game that puts you in the shoes of Charlie, a college-aged boy or girl who has a terrible habit of running into bizarre political radicalization scenarios. It’s </span><a href="https://www.shoutoutuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pathways-teachers-guide-extremism-youth-radicalisation.pdf"><span>being touted</span></a><span> as a tool that teachers can use to combat the “promotion or advancement of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The "worst" ending btw <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Amelia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Amelia</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pathways?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Pathways</a> <a href="https://t.co/v7kZ3N9oMi">pic.twitter.com/v7kZ3N9oMi</a></p> <p>— Bee CrayZee (@Bee_CrayZee) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bee_CrayZee/status/2010603633826750834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The level-headed critique of </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><span>is that its content and choices are sparse. The idea that a minute-long PowerPoint slideshow-style narrative could fully address extremism and radicalization is laughable, but the railroaded, overly domineering choices will doubtlessly also come off as ham-fisted to the same people it’s meant to reach.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, it’s the online right that’s propelled </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/amelia-pathways/"><span>into memedom</span></a><span>. The result has been the sudden influx of AI-generated “cute goth e-girl” fan-art (if you can call it “art”) in some corners of the internet, based on Amelia, </span><i><span>Pathways’ </span></i><span>racist, yet alternatively-styled, antagonist.</span></p>

   <p><span>She’s exploded in popularity on alt-right leaning subreddits like r/Asmongold, who immediately saw a vision of </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/1qff3jv/authright_be_like/"><span>their perfect woman</span></a><span> in Amelia. As a result, the meme spread to X. Since then, users have been making </span><a href="https://searchlightmagazine.com/2026/01/how-purple-haired-cartoon-amelia-became-a-far-right-icon/"><span>Grok work overtime</span></a><span>, generating hundreds of Amelia images for the platform’s far-right crowd to enjoy.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the blame here lies with whoever designed </span><i><span>Pathways’ </span></i><span>artwork. Making a goth-adjacent female racist be the only character in your game with a distinctive design, and then having them become more attached to the protagonist if they choose to support anti-immigration ideas and policies, was certainly a choice. I can’t help but feel that whoever designed Amelia has clearly never met a teenager before. That being said, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainsawfolk/comments/1qfhs8y/british_government_isnt_even_trying_bro/"><span>Reze/Amelia meme</span></a><span> on the r/Chainsawfolk subreddit is very, very funny.</span></p>
