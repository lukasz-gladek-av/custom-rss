            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sophie Turner, best known for her roles as Sansa Stark in <em>Game of Thrones</em> and Jean Grey in<em> X-Men: Dark Phoenix</em>, is the new Lara Croft for the streaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">adaptation of <em>Tomb Raider</em></a>. Amazon MGM Studios revealed a first look at the actor in costume and, yup, I think she nailed it.</p> <p>Does that mean the show itself will be any good? Who knows. But it should help limit any skepticism about whether Turner is cut out to take over the English archeologist who moonlights as a puzzle-solving treasure hunter. The role was previously played by Angelina Jolie in the early 2000s and later by Alicia Vikander in the 2018 reboot. Here’s the first photo of Turner in costume, which essentially recreates Croft’s look from the 1996 game beat-for-beat:</p>   <p>The show has already started filming but we still don’t know what the live-action adaptation, helmed by <em>Fleabag</em>‘s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, will entail. Jason Isaacs will play Croft’s Uncle, Atlas DeMornay, while Martin Bobb-Semple plays Croft’s side-kick, Zip. Bill Paterson, meanwhile, will play her butler. Celina Imrie is also onboard as a museum curator while Sigourney Weaver plays someone “keen to exploit Lara’s talents,” according to Amazon.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date for the show yet, but given the production schedule I wouldn’t be surprised to see it pop up sometime in 2027. It follows Amazon’s success in spinning another hit game franchise, <em>Fallout</em>, into a streaming hit, and is part of Hollywood’s broader goldrush to exploit gaming IP instead of creating new ideas. It couldn’t be coming at a better time for the franchise, though.</p>

 <p>A reboot of the 1996 game called <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-tomb-raiders-new-lara-croft-2000652781"><em>Tomb Raider Atlantis</em></a> will launch later this year, followed by the next sequel sometime in the years ahead. That game has been in production for a while. The last new entry was <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> back in 2018.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-offloads-mini-5-pro-drone-bundles-now-at-a-record-low-with-rc2-controller-and-three-batteries-2000659926</link>
            <guid>1406917</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been thinking about adding aerial shots to your creative toolkit, the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo makes a compelling case for taking the leap. Designed to balance performance with portability and ease of use, this drone <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/">bundle is currently available for $1,099 (down from $1,599) which is a sizable 31% reduction from its usual price</a>. That discount alone makes it eye-catching, but the real value lies in how complete the package is for anyone eager to start flying immediately.</p>
<p>Inside the box, you’ll find multiple intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated RC2 controller, a charging hub, and a travel-friendly carrying bag. Whether you’re heading out for a weekend hike or planning a more deliberate filming session, everything you need comes along without added hassle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Drone for Every Skill Level</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 5 Pro’s capability comes from its compact, lightweight body. It’s small enough to toss into a backpack, yet powerful enough to record sharp 4K HDR video at up to 60 frames per second. The camera’s Dual Native ISO helps maintain image quality across a wide range of lighting situations, so footage stays clean and detailed whether you’re filming under bright midday sun or chasing golden-hour shots.</p>
<p>Performance in the air is equally impressive. A long-range video transmission system delivers a smooth HD feed over great distances, while strong wind resistance and a 3-axis mechanical gimbal help ensure stable, shake-free footage. Even when conditions aren’t perfect, the drone remains reliable and controlled.</p>



<p>The included DJI RC2 controller adds to the seamless experience: Its <strong>built-in 5.5-inch HD screen</strong> provides a clear, responsive view of your live feed, removing the need to rely on a smartphone. This makes flying more intuitive and lets you focus on framing the perfect shot rather than juggling devices.</p>
<p>Content creators will also appreciate the drone’s flexibility when it comes to framing. With support for both landscape and vertical shooting, it’s easy to tailor footage for different platforms. From cinematic YouTube videos to vertical clips optimized for Instagram Reels or TikTok, the DJI Mini 5 Pro drone can adapt to how and where you want to share your work.</p>
<p>Extended flight time is another major advantage. With three batteries included, you can spend hours in the air across multiple flights, rather than cutting sessions short. When it’s time to recharge, the two-way charging hub keeps downtime to a minimum.</p>
<p>Add in generous internal storage and fast wireless transfers to your phone, and the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo becomes an all-in-one solution for aerial photography. At its current discounted price, it’s a smart investment for beginners and a capable upgrade for experienced pilots.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Hellboy Himself Was Paid ‘$40 And A Sandwich’ To Voice Fallout‘s Most Iconic Line]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-ron-perlman-s3-intro-sandwhich-war-2000660136</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ron Perlman has been in every<a href="https://kotaku.com/how-a-dark-time-traveling-fantasy-game-became-the-origi-1845870322"><em> Fallout</em> game</a> but he’s never played them. He seems to barely even remember narrating the now iconic line “War. War never changes,” when the first game launched back in 1997. He says he was paid basically nothing and never bothered to find out what the game, which would spawn one of the biggest franchises, was about.</p> <p>“I’m not a gamer,” Perlman said in a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/m5iSCL4o61w?si=nYsivF6kTSkD4y34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">Joe Vulpis Podcast</a> interview (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/ron-perlman-says-he-did-the-fallout-intro-for-usd40-and-a-sandwich-hes-never-played-it-and-hes-not-interested-in-trying-the-whole-fallout-thing-is-a-mystery-to-me/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “I wouldn’t know how to put a game—I wouldn’t know which game goes into which piece of hardware. I’ve never played any of the games. The whole <em>Fallout</em> thing is a mystery to me.”</p>

 <p>The Hellboy actor has had character roles in some of the games but is most known for narrating the openings in which he outlines the geopolitical rivalries that precipitated a mass nuclear war. “In 2077, the storm of world war had come again,” he says at the beginning of <em>Fallout 1</em>. “In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise.”</p>

 <p>While the lines have stuck in fans’ heads for years, Perlman doesn’t appear to have ever given them a second thought. “They invited me to do the very first Fallout back in the ’90s, I think,” he said on the podcast. “They gave me $40 and a sandwich. And a year and a half later, I get a call. ‘Hey, you remember Fallout?’ ‘No.'”</p>

 <p><em>Fallout</em> is now not just one of the biggest game series around but also one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">most popular TV shows on streaming</a> thanks to the Amazon Prime adaptation. “I didn’t see that coming,” Perlman notes. He hasn’t appeared in the show yet, and there’s no indication that he will, but it would be pretty cool. Season 3 starts filming later this year so there’s plenty of time to make it happen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Drops Prices on Iconic Millennium Falcon Sets, Now One of the Cheapest in the Star Wars Line]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-drops-prices-on-iconic-millennium-falcon-sets-now-one-of-the-cheapest-in-the-star-wars-line-2000659923</link>
            <guid>1406869</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="705">There’s a reason LEGO has remained relevant for generations. Few brands can appeal equally to children discovering creativity for the first time and adults rediscovering it decades later. Opening a LEGO box feels like an invitation to slow down: the soft rattle of pieces, the clean instruction book, and the promise that something meaningful will emerge from a pile of plastic bricks. Forget everything out there that’s causing you stress. Just sit down and <em>build</em>. Personally, I love to just pop on a podcast and let the time slip by as I put a set together, piece by piece.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="705">Few vehicles in film history carry the same instant recognition as the Millennium Falcon Star Wars set. The legendary ship that carried heroes across the galaxy and legendarily made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. Right now, that legend is more affordable than usual: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is currently discounted by 20%, dropping from $85 to $67</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="705">Built for Display</h2>
<p data-start="1407" data-end="1915">Unlike play-focused sets built for constant handling, this LEGO Millennium Falcon is designed primarily for display. Mounted on the included display stand at a subtle angle, it gives the impression of movement, as if it’s mid-turn in the vacuum of space. Its dimensions—just over five inches tall, about nine and a half inches long, and roughly seven and a half inches wide—make it ideal for a desk, bookshelf, or display cabinet. It commands attention without overwhelming the space.</p>


<p data-start="1917" data-end="2399">The set is made up of 921 pieces. LEGO captures the Millennium Falcon’s signature exterior while also sneaking in interior references fans will appreciate. Because of the scale, characters aren’t represented by traditional minifigures, but by abstract stacked elements that still convey the idea of the crew aboard. Small details, like the holographic dejarik chess table, serve as thoughtful callbacks that reward close inspection.</p>
<p data-start="2401" data-end="2931" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The set commemorates the 25th anniversary of LEGO Star Wars, a collaboration that began in 1999 with the release of <em data-start="2570" data-end="2590">The Phantom Menace</em>. From those early X-Wings and Landspeeders, the partnership has expanded into one of LEGO’s most successful and enduring lines. Through all of that growth, the Millennium Falcon has remained central—an enduring symbol of adventure, creativity, nostalgia, and $68 that’s just burning a whole in your wallet. With its current discount, there may be no better time to bring that symbol home.</p>

            <guid>1406836</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="716">Data has become one of the most powerful tools for athletes looking to improve their performance. From shaving seconds off your pace to building endurance and staying consistent with training, having access to the right metrics can make all the difference. That’s where a quality running watch comes in. Whether you’re training for a marathon or just preparing for a local 5K, a reliable device helps you measure progress and stay motivated. The Garmin Forerunner 55 is designed specifically for active lifestyles and fitness-focused individuals, and right now it’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/">even more appealing thanks to a limited-time Amazon deal that drops the price by $50, bringing it down to just $149</a>.</p>
<p data-start="718" data-end="1280">At its core, the Garmin Forerunner 55 acts as your personal fitness coach right on your wrist. Its built-in GPS accurately tracks your running routes while providing essential data such as distance, pace, and time. The watch also features wrist-based heart rate monitoring, making it ideal for runners who train using heart rate zones to optimize performance and recovery. Beyond running, it supports a wide range of activities, including HIIT, cycling, strength training, and other workouts, making it a versatile option for athletes who like to mix up their routines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="718" data-end="1280">Daily Suggested Workouts</h2>
<p data-start="1282" data-end="1756">Through the Garmin Connect app, users gain access to free adaptive training plans created by expert coaches. These plans sync directly to the watch and adjust based on your progress, removing much of the guesswork from training. Instead of wondering whether you’re doing too much or too little, the watch helps ensure you’re following a structured and efficient path toward your goals.</p>


<p data-start="1758" data-end="2207">The Garmin Forerunner 55 doesn’t stop working when your workout ends. It continuously tracks your heart rate throughout the day and monitors overall health metrics. I find myself constantly checking my Garmin’s Body Battery score, which estimates your energy levels using factors like heart rate, stress, and daily activity. This insight helps you determine when to push hard and when it’s smarter to rest. Train with intent and avoid burnout.</p>
<p data-start="2209" data-end="2534">Speaking of battery, the watch’s actual battery life is another major advantage. With GPS enabled, the watch can last up to 20 hours, making it suitable for long runs or race days. Without GPS, it can go up to 14 days on a single charge. For most runners, if you’re running multiple times per week, you’ll likely end up means charging it about once a week. That’s far more convenient than many smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch which basically require daily charging.</p>
<p data-start="2536" data-end="3001" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Even though its focus is fitness, the Garmin Forerunner 55 still offers other useful smart features. When paired with your phone, it can deliver notifications for calls, texts, and emails right to your wrist, keeping you connected without distraction. Normally priced at $199, the current 25% discount makes it an excellent value. Choose between three band color options including black, white, or aqua.</p>

            <guid>1406797</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>January is often a quiet month for big video game releases. So this cold, wintry month becomes a perfect time to evaluate your ever-growing backlog of video games and start chipping away at it. That’s what many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are doing right now, and so we figured hey, let’s turn our lives into content for the website.</p> <p>Welcome to the start of <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week</a>, a way to celebrate, critically evaluate, and document those massive lists of games we all have. Those lists of games we need to get around to…one day. Games we want to play. Games we want to finish. Games we want to give a second or even third chance to in the hope that maybe this time it will stick. Looking at you, <em>Cyberpunk 2077!</em></p>

 <p>So what should you expect over the next seven days? We’ll have new blogs from us and some talented freelancers about finally playing backlog games, dealing with that dreaded list, what a backlog even is in 2026, and some remastered old posts from our <a href="https://kotaku.com/welcome-to-backlog-month-1846621879">Backlog Month in 2021</a>. And with comments back, feel free to tell us about any games you’re finally getting around to after they lingered on your backlog for weeks, months, or even years.</p>

 <p>And yes, we are starting a theme week in the <em>middle</em> of the week and not on a Monday. It will even run over the weekend. We’re rebels. And like, a week is just seven days, baby. We can start that whenever we so please. And so we are starting…now. Well, actually, we started like four paragraphs up, but whatever, welcome to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/backlog-week-2026">Backlog Week 2026</a>!</p>
