              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/easy-halloween-costume-party-1851676907">October is a spooky month</a>. It’s that time of year when everyone starts watching horror movies, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-october-2023-rdr2-pc-ps5-1850879972">playing scary games</a>, decorating their houses with giant skeletons, and listening to “Monster Mash” a few too many times. But on <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-not-scary-games-to-play-on-halloween-1844512015">Halloween</a> night, we remember the real reason for the season: Candy. And lots of it.</p> <p>But while any candy is better than no candy, not all of these delicious and sugary sweet treats are equal. In fact, some downright suck while others are heavenly pieces of joy wrapped and packaged in plastic. So fellow <em>Kotaku </em>writer Ethan Gach and I sat down and used a very complicated and scientific process, trust us, to rank 38 different candies to find out what is truly the best (and worst) Halloween treat around.</p> <p><strong>Update 10/27/2025:</strong> This list was originally published on October 23, 2024. We’ve updated this ranking to add even more candy to the list.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In its last few levels, 2001’s <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> virtually turns into a survival horror game as you battle your way through hordes of twisted, undead enemies in dimly lit corridors, pressed to make every shot count and desperate to preserve your health as you press forward. Perhaps no level in <i>Halo</i>’s storied campaign presents such a sudden change of tone and intensity as “The Library,” a long set of spacious corridors in which you first meet the sentient undead lifeform known as the Flood, and must face an almost inexhaustible supply of them while equipped with the game’s most powerful weapons.</p> <p>“The Library” has once again become topical as we look toward the release of the upcoming <i>Halo: Campaign Evolved</i>, a remake of the original Xbox launch title. Unlike the anniversary edition of the game which shipped in 2011, <i>Campaign Evolved</i> sets out to tweak existing level structures, as well as the weapon sandbox. And the level whose potential changes fans are speculating about the most is “<a href="https://kotaku.com/halos-worst-level-is-getting-changed-in-the-new-ps5-remake-2000638963">The Library</a>.”</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/halos-worst-level-is-getting-changed-in-the-new-ps5-remake-2000638963"><i>Halo</i>’s Worst Level Is Getting Changed In The New PS5 Remake</a></p> <p>That’s because “The Library” is a notorious level, widely considered a low point, a blemish on <i>Combat Evolved</i>’s otherwise outstanding campaign. But I disagree with the sentiment that “The Library” is some broken level that desperately needs remixing to fix. After recently replaying the level, I am convinced it remains a tense, brutal section of the game that tests you in everything you’ve learned about <i>Halo</i>’s combat thus far, equipping you with the skills necessary to finish the remaining levels, which only amplify the threat by tossing Covenant back in the mix with the Flood.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639368"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639368">© Gif: Halo Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The arrival of the Flood dramatically steps up the difficulty in <i>CE</i>. After several levels spent fighting the Covenant, the introduction of these swarming parasites forces you to learn some new playstyles and find new strengths and weaknesses in each of the game’s weapons. The last few levels could’ve just been more of the same. But the Flood dramatically change the pace and scope of the game. Their introduction is when <i>Halo</i> evolves. And evolution is often painful, and full of surprises.</p>

 <p>The Flood swarm the player in vast numbers wielding <i>both </i>human and Covenant weapons; they can leap incredible distances; their melee attack is brutal; the bulbous carrier form explodes with an AOE attack and spawns in several tiny enemies which can collectively swarm you to death if you’re careless. Oh, and they can basically rise from the dead at least once, usually when you least expect it.</p>

 <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://youtu.be/Q_nsjC8BItc">25 Years Later, <i>Halo</i> Is Finally Coming To PlayStation</a></p> <p>They’re a challenge to fight. Critically, they’re a challenge to <i>survive</i>. And that’s what makes “The Library” such an engaging level; it’s a test of endurance, knowing which fights are worth engaging in, and which ones are better left in your dust.</p>

 <h2>“The Library” is tough, but it has a logic</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639367"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639367">© Gif: Halo Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>“The Library” asks three things from you: Equip yourself well, use your enemy against you, and <i>keep moving</i>. While there are a few segments in which you’re asked to stand your ground while 343 Guilty Spark takes his sweet time to open a door, that last challenge—keep moving—is the most important of all. Standing still in “The Library” is guaranteed to lead to death, so mastering circle strafing, bunny hopping, and crouch jumping to get on to the elevated platforms is essential for maintaining distance.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i>Halo</i> Gets Sucked Into ICE’s Recruitment Meme War</a></p> <p>The Flood are nasty but they also have critical vulnerabilities, all of which “The Library” asks you to manage. Take the bulbous carrier forms which explode. Not only can their explosion work against them when they’re in a dense crowd of Flood, displacing or destroying their own comrades, but they can also trigger chain effect grenade explosions from any explosives dropped by the standard infantry. Again, the challenge is to spot those opportunities, creating more problems for your enemy than they do for you.</p>  <p>And because virtually every weapon in the game is available in the Library by way of the Flood carrying both human and alien firepower, your challenge is to keep yourself stocked. My preference is for a shotgun and plasma rifle combo, occasionally picking up a rocket launcher or needler if I feel I need to take out larger hordes.</p> <h2>In the darkness, terror</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639364"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639364">© Screenshot: Halo Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>“The Library” is ominously dark, almost bland, utilitarian. It doesn’t feel like it was made to bedazzle you, the player. It feels purpose-built by some ancient alien intelligence that wasn’t concerned with baroque, sci-fi trappings. It’s a dreary, barren set of massive corridors turned into a hellscape by the swarm of undead after you.</p>

 <p>All the while, as you fight for your life, 343 Guilty Spark’s comments on the inefficiencies of your weapons and his strange fascination with the Flood as a life form are reminiscent of Ash’s speech about the xenomorph in <i>Alien</i> being a “<a href="https://youtu.be/VA8jv1M6Y2g">perfect organism</a>.” It feels absurd, almost hilarious, how 343 is more pre-occupied with miscellaneous facts about the function of the parasitic life form than on your actual struggle as you fend off the terrifying swarm.</p> <p>I’m always reminded of <i>Alien, </i>particularly <a href="https://youtu.be/Q_nsjC8BItc">its opening scenes</a>, when I play “The Library,” with which it shares a haunting austerity and ever-present darkness. Dimly lit corridors seem to stretch on forever, revealing an indecipherable architectural language lit only by a passing flashlight.</p>

 <h2>What’s at risk of getting lost when Halo Studios changes “The Library”?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639366"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639366">© Screenshot: Halo Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I remain skeptical of the need to remake <i>Halo</i> at all. To be honest, I think we’re still living in an era of first-person shooters that, especially on console, was largely shaped by <i>Halo</i> to begin with. Tweaking the original <i>Halo</i> to include sprint, ADS, new weapons, and some new level layouts isn’t going to be as substantial an evolution as we saw in, say, the remake of <i>Resident Evil 2</i> a few years ago.</p> <p>What is to be gained by altering “The Library”? Does it just become a more casual stroll through an amusement park of sci-fi architecture?</p> <p>The difficulty of “The Library” speaks to the unstoppable brutality of the Flood in <i>Halo</i>’s narrative: They are such a threat, we’re told, that a previous civilization had to destroy (almost) all sentient life in the galaxy to stop them. Nothing else would do. And in surviving them, Master Chief’s heroism is equally amplified.</p>

 <p>Is <i>Halo</i> the same story if “The Library” isn’t a trip through hell? Is the Flood truly such a terrifying foe if it isn’t given the spacious emptiness of the Library to swarm around in?</p> <p>“The Library” is a demonstration, both narratively and through its challenging gameplay, of why the Flood are so feared. Pare those elements back, and <i>Halo: Campaign Evolved</i> risks being something more generic than the groundbreaking shooter it’s based on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Throughout </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, the citizens of Lumiose City worry about the potential consequences of having wild monsters living alongside humans, with the monsters in designated Wild Zones. What if a powerful Pokémon escapes these fenced-in areas and wreaks havoc on the populace? That’s a perfectly valid fear, actually, because fans have become so scared of one of these zones that they’re warning other players not to go in there without a powerful water Pokémon on their team. I’m talking about Wild Zone 17, and its literal lion’s den full of Pyroars.</span></p> <p><span>This small area was once a simple park, and now that Lumiose City has made it a Wild Zone, untamed Pokémon roam it. The local Diggersby is making tunnels in its earth. Skarmory flies over the area. When you go there after the sun goes down, you might find a Lampent’s flame lighting up the night. Those are pretty manageable, however. What’s got players spooked is that an entire pride of Pyroar hangs out in the upper area. As best as I can tell after repeated trips to Wild Zone 17, the spawn is fixed to have one Alpha-sized male Pyroar and several regular-sized female ones. If even one of these fire-breathing lions sees you, the entire pack is going to pounce on you before you can even throw a Poké Ball. These felines seem to target the player’s trainer character almost exclusively, and after a few attacks, you’ll get knocked out and sent back to where the humans roam. They’re territorial, powerful, and can overwhelm you quickly. The experience of getting your shit rocked by these Pyroars has become such an infamous skill check while trying to complete the Pokédex that fans are posting their Ls online and turning Wild Zone 17 into a new meme like it’s the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>equivalent of the Shadow Realm.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">help <a href="https://t.co/Pdfy2MwVA1">pic.twitter.com/Pdfy2MwVA1</a></p> <p>— 🌷Thea🌷 (@Flak0ps) <a href="https://twitter.com/Flak0ps/status/1980669582181560365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">earth powering you <a href="https://t.co/YVqkVONy2r">pic.twitter.com/YVqkVONy2r</a></p> <p>— HT1 8️⃣▶️🍉 (@BrocTaeshi4ever) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrocTaeshi4ever/status/1981045295845900428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enter wild zone 17</p> <p>— Pyroar (@DittoImposter) <a href="https://twitter.com/DittoImposter/status/1980945005775565082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">wild zone 17 piss me the fuck off so i caught this guys whole pride. fuck you <a href="https://t.co/5v6wrK6TMW">pic.twitter.com/5v6wrK6TMW</a></p> <p>— Bubbly Mar 🏳️‍⚧️ 🦊 (@bubblymarmar) <a href="https://twitter.com/bubblymarmar/status/1982222363669209592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wild Zone 17 <a href="https://t.co/MNW5GgmYjt">pic.twitter.com/MNW5GgmYjt</a></p> <p>— TheKingVillager (@TheKingVillager) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheKingVillager/status/1979612554650689668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey. hey come to wild zone 17. we promise we wont jump you dawg we got skarmory and chespin here its all cool we dont even know earth power <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyroar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pyroar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/0MxYw3LSto">pic.twitter.com/0MxYw3LSto</a></p> <p>— Art honse (@CrypticKelpie) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrypticKelpie/status/1980727429946830954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trying to catch fucking Skarmory with the pack of lions trying mauling you</p> <p>— AlfLandonFan (@AlfLandonFan36) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlfLandonFan36/status/1979772143178297629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wild Zone 17 in Z-A has proven to me that a billion lions might actually win</p> <p>— Solosis (@Solosis0o0) <a href="https://twitter.com/Solosis0o0/status/1980999404564967499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">The Most Difficult parts of Pokémon:</p> <p>1.
