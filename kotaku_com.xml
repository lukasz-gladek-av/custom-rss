            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s tough being a </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>fan when Square Enix drops an announcement trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> then mostly disappears for three years. These days, those waiting to hear more about Goofy and company’s next foray into the Disney/</span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>crossover universe will lap up even the smallest of crumbs in hopes that it means a full-course meal could be waiting for them at the end of development. This week’s crumb is an Instagram story from Haley Joel Osment, the voice behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-best-games-ranked-2-3-birth-by-sleep-1851494518"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>’</span></a><span> key-wielding hero Sora, that implies he’s recording…something!</span></p> <p><span>On November 5, Osment posted a photo to his Instagram story of a big red sign that says “RECORDING” with the caption “Back to work” in what looks like a recording studio. Now, this could be for anything. Osment has done plenty of voice work over his decades-long acting career, and most of it’s not limited to playing Sora in the </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>series since the PS2 era. Take a cursory look at his acting credits, and you’ll see he’s done a lot of voiceovers for tons of animated Marvel, DC, and </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>projects over the past few years. So it’s entirely possible he’s just doing another routine gig.</span></p>

 <p><span>But we also don’t know that this </span><i><span>isn’t</span></i><span> him gearing up for another monologue about how Sora’s friends are his power, right? </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>still in an uncertain point of development</span></a><span>, but if Square Enix is considering a re-reveal of sorts, it’s entirely possible Osment is doing a session or two for a trailer. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Nobody would ever get themselves in a tizzy over a simple, nondescript Instagram story, right?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>35 years later, Warner Bros has finally announced it’s making a <em>Gremlins 3</em>. The new sequel will be executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, <a href="https://kotaku.com/spielberg-call-duty-movie-activision-medal-honor-2000623436">who reportedly was denied a chance to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie</a>, so why not help produce a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/gremlins-2-the-new-batch-1"><em>Gremlins</em></a> movie instead?</p> <p>On November 6, Warner Bros. Discovery chief David “I’m Bad At My Job” Zaslav <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/warners-gremlins-3-steven-spielberg-chris-columbus-1236419932/">announced during the company’s third-quarter earnings call</a> that a third <em>Gremlins</em> movie had recently been greenlit and had some big names attached. As mentioned, Spielberg is returning to the franchise to once again be an executive producer and will be producing the sequel through his company, Amblin Entertainment. Meanwhile, the writer behind the OG 1984 <em>Gremlins</em> movie, Chris Columbus, is returning to produce and direct the flick.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gremlins-3-final-destination-screenwriters-1236371957/">As reported by<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>,</em> Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein are working alongside Columbus to help write the script for <em>Gremlins 3</em>. The duo previously directed this year’s smash hit horror sequel <em>Final Destinations: Bloodlines.</em></p>

 <p>Warner Bros. has set a November 19, 2027 release date for its new <em>Gremlins</em> sequel. That is 37 years after the last <em>Gremlins</em> movie, making it a true legacy sequel.&nbsp; Arriving in theaters in 1984, the original <em>Gremlins</em> was a massive box office success. On a budget of just $15 million, the Joe Dante-directed comedy-horror movie about evil little creatures who show up after some rules are broken while taking care of a cute furry mogwai made over $150 million in the US alone.</p>

 <p>However, six years later, <em>Gremlins 2</em>, also directed by Dante, only made $41 million, was ravaged by critics and fans and basically killed the franchise. In 2023, WB produced an animated series based on the dormant property and it seems the response to that was strong enough to convince the studio that <em>Gremlins</em> is still a worthwhile franchise. Let’s hope the third movie sticks to puppets and doesn’t go full CG.</p> <p>And I hope working on <em>Gremlins 3</em> will help Spielberg get over Activision denying him the chance to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-its-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-now-cheaper-than-a-mini-bluetooth-speaker-2000641681</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-its-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-now-cheaper-than-a-mini-bluetooth-speaker.1345807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>TVs are getting thinner and that’s terrific for aesthetic purposes but disastrous for audio quality. Those razor-thin screens don’t have any physical room for decent speakers which means most integrated audio sounds flat, tinny and lifeless.</p>
<p>Amazon definitely noticed this gap in the market and decided to create a solution that’s largely inspired by premium brands like Bose and Samsung – except the Fire TV soundbar <em>Plus</em> costs two to three times less than comparable models from those manufacturers. At the moment, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">you can score this soundbar for just $174, down from its usual $249 sticker</a>, which puts it at an <strong>all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Audio Upgrades</h2>
<p>The Fire TV soundbar Plus is a fantastic soundbar that houses <strong>real home theater technology inside a single sleek unit</strong> sitting neatly below your television. This is a 3.1 channel system which means you get three forward-firing speakers combined with a built-in subwoofer for bass in one compact unit. The dedicated center channel <strong>takes care of dialogue specifically</strong> so that if people are talking in movies or shows, the conversations come across sharp and clear rather than being blurred with background music and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos support brings 3D audio into the mix</strong>&nbsp;with the sensation that sound is moving around and above you rather than just blasting straight ahead. Action scenes feature helicopters flying overhead, atmospheric dramas rain from above, and much more. <strong>Support for DTS:X multi-dimensional audio processing</strong> for filmmakers and sound designers gives multiple ways to create immersive experiences that this soundbar can actually reproduce.</p>



<p>Special attention is given to the <strong>built-in subwoofer as most soundbars in this price range either forgo bass altogether or use a separate wireless subwoofer</strong> that requires floor space and its own power outlet. Amazon manages to house the sub directly within the chassis of the soundbar and with it, you gain deep, punchy low frequencies for everything from explosions to music and ambient rumble-all without adding another component to your setup.</p>



<p>Setup couldn’t be any easier since you only have to hook up the included HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. The same cable carries both audio and control signals, which means the remote from your television can change the soundbar’s volume for you with no unnecessary controller cluttering up your coffee table. Audio sync issues that plague some soundbar setups simply don’t happen here, since the HDMI connection keeps everything perfectly timed.</p>
<p>It’s compact enough to fit under most TVs without blocking the screen or the remote sensor and has an understated design that lets your entertainment take center stage. For the price, you’re getting tech and performance that’s regularly between $400-$600 from other established audio brands which makes this one of the single best value propositions in home audio at the moment. And for an all-time low price, it’s an even easier decision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><span>coming on December 10</span></a><span>, and the $30 expansion is bringing new Pokémon to Lumiose City that weren’t in the base game. Some of these monsters are getting Mega Evolutions, and we already know Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur will definitely be getting these powerful transformations next month. And because these three were confirmed in today’s trailer, we also probably know all the others that will be added thanks to fans datamining the game.</span></p>  <p><span>The supposed list of new Megas that began circulating last month included Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur, so it stands to reason that it’s at least a partial view of what new Mega forms will debut in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. Notably, some Pokémon who already have Mega Evolutions in the base game are supposedly getting a second Mega Evolution that fans are calling “Z” forms, but it’s unclear at the moment what they’ll actually be called in-game. The full list reads as follows:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu X</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu Y</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Chimecho</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Absol</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Staraptor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Garchomp</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Lucario</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golurk</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Meowstic</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Crabominable</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golisopod</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Magearna</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Scovillain</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Glimmora</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tatsugiri</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baxcalibur</span></li> </ul> <p><span>I’m not holding my breath, but it would be cool if there were even more Mega Evolutions that we don’t know about. Corviknight, the armored bird from the Galar region, is shown in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>trailer, and one of my favorites, so I would love it if he got a surprise Mega form as well. I can’t get too greedy, though. Raichu is finally getting a Mega Evolution after a decade of disrespect, so I should probably just shut the fuck up.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>appears to take place in the post-game, so you will likely have to beat the main story before you can play it. You better get to grinding up those Z-A Royale ranks if you haven’t </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>seen the credits yet</span></a><span>.</span></p>
