As translated by Google, one anonymous employee commented, “There’s a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack,” going on to say that Reddit threads, YouTube videos, and other mentions of the game are monitored for potential abuse. “Unlike what we’ve had before, this is serious.”</p><p>Ubisoft did not directly confirm or deny the reporting when asked about the situation. “Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own,” a spokesperson for the publisher told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.”<br></p><p>Ubisoft has taken varying approaches to the culture war noise around <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> over the last nine months as its impending release has become more and more of an apparent make-or-break moment for the company. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last June</a></span>, CEO Yves Guillemot condemned attacks targeting his staff “in the strongest possible terms” and called on others in the industry to do so as well.

Kern shared and quoted a post from the account earlier this month, calling on players to boycott <em>Shadows</em> and dunking on the post for having comments turned off, saying, in part, “We get Ubisoft to change, the other top publishers will notice!” When the <em>Shadows</em> X account took the unusual step of responding, Kern’s original post was quickly ratio’d. “Thank you for considering us a top publisher!” The <em>Assassins Creed Shadows</em> social team replied. “While our media ads typically don’t allow comments, our regular posts do.” It was a nice reminder that lots of other people are fed up with “anti-woke” grifters, too.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
