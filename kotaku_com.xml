            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign is bad</a>. So it’s a shame that the coolest bit of <em>Black Ops 7</em>, a new co-op RPG-meets-extraction-shooter mode called Endgame, is locked behind completing said not-very-good campaign. But that’s changing very soon, according to the game’s developer, Treyarch.</p> <p>The latest entry in Activision’s long-running FPS franchise,<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"> <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, launched earlier this week to mixed reviews from fans and critics. While many praised the game’s visuals and zombies mode, its multiplayer feels long in the tooth, and its campaign is a wild, incomprehensible mess that is only fun to play through if you like experiencing expensive trainwrecks. And for some odd reason, Treyarch decided to lock perhaps the best, coolest mode in<em> Black Ops 7,</em> Endgame, behind completion of the campaign.</p>

 <p>Currently, you have to complete the campaign to play Endgame <em>or</em> get invited to a lobby created by someone who has already finished the story. It feels like a bad decision, and many players have likely not touched Endgame yet because they don’t want to play (or finish) this year’s terrible campaign. And Treyarch seems to get that it was a regrettable design choice, and will be removing the restriction on November 21.</p>

 <p><span>“We’ve seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who’ve already been dropping in,” <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519">tweeted Treyarch.</a> “So we’re making it available to everyone in </span><em><span>Black Ops 7</span></em><span>.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who've already been dropping in, so we're making it available to everyone in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> starting Friday, Nov. 21.</p> <p>Team up with other players to complete objectives, increase your power, earn unique Weapon Camos, and take on… <a href="https://t.co/2igahTPHv6">pic.twitter.com/2igahTPHv6</a></p> <p>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p>Endgame is set on the same open-world island map that is found in the campaign. But this time around, you land with nothing and have to complete various challenges, missions, and quests dotted around the large island, either alone or with a few pals.</p>

 <p>As you kill enemies, find new loot, and complete activities, you get more powerful and can explore more of the island, with the end goal being to reach the most challenging enemies and powerful loot and then extract before time runs out. Do so, and you can return with all your stuff. Die or fail to leave, and you start over. It’s a very fun mode that takes the excellent and snappy combat of <em>Black Ops 7</em> and transplants it into a new experience inspired by extraction shooters like <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, but which doesn’t feel as punishing as those games tend to be.</p> <p>As a bonus reward, Treyarch will send out a bunch of XP boosters and Gobblegum packs to players who beat the campaign and started playing Endgame before this change. And that’s cool; I think it’s just nice to give players who suffered through the campaign some sort of gift for their trouble. Regardless, I’m excited to play more Endgame with more people later this week and check out more of the island and what it has to offer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-bets-big-on-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-selling-at-new-record-low-to-crush-iphone-sales-2000645542</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-bets-big-on-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-selling-at-new-record-low-to-crush-iphone-sales.1358644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flagship smartphones keep getting more expensive but Amazon just threw down a record low price on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra that makes the decision easier: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">powerhouse with 512GB storage drops to $1,057 from its usual $1,419 price tag</a>&nbsp;and puts it in direct competition with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro that launched in September.</p>
<p>Samsung loaded the S25 Ultra with arguments that might<strong> just make it the best smartphone of 2025</strong>. This Black Friday deal represents the lowest price we’ve seen on Samsung’s absolute best phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Smartphone</h2>
<p>The<strong> Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</strong> inside the S25 Ultra represents a real leap in mobile computing power. Qualcomm built this chip on a 3nm process that gives faster speeds while using less power than previous generations. You get desktop-class performance in a phone that fits in your pocket with benchmark scores that embarrass Apple’s A18 Pro chip. The processing power handles intensive tasks like 4K video editing, complex photo processing, and demanding games without breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>The <strong>camera system of AI Night Mode</strong> takes low-light photography to a whole new level. Samsung’s AI algorithms analyze scenes in real-time and auto-optimize settings based on what you are shooting. The phone captures multiple exposures and combines them in an instant to churn out bright, clear photos in conditions where other phones would produce grainy messes. You can shoot in near-darkness and still get a usable photo with correct colors and sharp details. The AI recognizes different subjects like food, pets, landscapes, and people, then adjusts the processing to make each shot look its best without any manual tweaking.</p>
<p>With 512GB of storage, you finally have room to actually use your phone – not constantly manage it. Store thousands of photos, hundreds of video clips, and dozens of apps without the stress of running out of room. This storage tier is prohibitively expensive in iPhones, making Samsung’s pricing much more consumer-friendly. The fact that this is unlocked means you can switch carriers anytime without buying a new phone or dealing with carrier restrictions.</p>



<p>The<strong> built-in S Pen turns the S25 Ultra from just a great phone</strong> into a real productivity tool. You can take handwritten notes directly on the screen, annotate PDFs, sketch ideas, and have precision that your finger simply can’t match. The pen stores inside the body of the phone magnetically, so you never need to carry a separate stylus or have any fear of misplacing it. Samsung’s software converts handwriting into text instantly, making note-taking in meetings or during lectures infinitely more useful.</p>
<p>A 5000mAh battery keeps the phone running <strong>through full days of heavy use without needing a midday charge</strong>. You can stream video, browse social media, shoot photos, and make calls all day while still having juice left by bedtime. In addition, fast charging brings this phone’s battery from empty to 50% in about 30 minutes, saving you when you forget to charge it overnight. <strong>Wireless charging is also supported</strong> so you can simply drop your phone on a charging pad instead of fumbling with cables.</p>
<p>What’s more, it boasts a <strong>6.8-inch display diagonal, with colors and blacks delivered by an Dynamic AMOLED panel</strong>. Scroll through apps and websites with incredibly smooth and responsive kinetic performance given the<strong> 120Hz refresh rate</strong>. Peak brightness is sufficient to keep the screen readable in direct sunlight, a problem that plagues cheaper phones. The screen will work with Samsung’s S Pen perfectly, with ultra-low latency making writing feel natural and immediate.</p>
<p>Flagship performance from this Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with 512GB of storage can be had for $1,057 down from $1,419 and that undercuts Apple by a serious margin. The combination of cutting-edge specs and this record Black Friday price makes the S25 Ultra impossible to ignore if you’re in the market for a premium smartphone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m not happy that I have to write about <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>‘s new map, Eastwood. I’d rather be playing it. I’ve already put around five hours into the map in a single night, and I’m here to say: It good.</p> <p>On November 18, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s latest major season one update</a> landed on all platforms. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news?page=1&amp;type=game-updates">It added a new game mode</a>, Sabotage, which is too small and not very good. But more importantly, it added a whole new map. And unlike the last map added earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647">the dreadful Blackwell Fields,</a> this big new warzone set in a rich California suburb is amazing, providing the perfect blend of open warfare and close-quarters chaos that makes good <em>Battlefield</em> maps so damn enjoyable.</p> <p>First off, Eastwood is big. Or at least it feels big. I’m sure if you were to take it and compare it directly with other maps from past <em>Battlefield</em> games, it wouldn’t appear massive. Heck, I’m not even sure it’s the biggest map in <em>Battlefield 6.</em> But raw acreage isn’t the key to making a map feel big.</p>

  <p>Instead, what Eastwood does is provide lots of spaces to play around in and a variety of locales to destroy. While playing on Eastwood you’ll run into multiple houses with fully explorable interiors, pools, and garages; a large golf course complete with a fancy clubhouse; undeveloped sections of nature; and more. Crossing Eastwood on foot or in a vehicle just feels like such a journey because you’ll pass by so many different locations and landmarks. That helps it feel big.</p>

 <p>That variety also makes the map a blast to play. The first night it was in the game, my pals and I played it non-stop for nearly five hours. And I never got bored because matches often felt like smaller battles spread across different tiny maps. Perhaps, at first, we’d fight hard in the dense suburbs, going house to house and dodging tanks. Later, we’d be assaulting the clubhouse in drivable golf carts and avoiding snipers. And we might end the match in a tank war up near the hills as our allies flank via the golf course.</p> <p>Eastwood has quickly become one of my favorite <em>Battlefield 6</em> maps and already feels like a classic map that people will talk about years from now. This new level also makes me excited for <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s future. It shows that the teams working on the game can make maps that feel big and dense, and offer loads of exciting locales in which to fight. More of this, please.</p>

              <p>We’ve just entered the sixth year of the latest console generation. Can you believe it’s already been that long? The Xbox Series X and S are now fully matured. Their libraries are more robust than ever, full not just of cross-gen ports and sequels but brand-new series as well. How do the games measure up?</p> <p>While platform barriers are starting to come down and it’s getting harder to tell the consoles apart in many respects, the Xbox Series X/S still has a few remnants left of a unique identity. We compiled this list mindful of the nuances around exclusivity and first-party games while also wanting to acknowledge the great games that are playable on Xbox Series X/S whether they originated there or not. Simply put: if you just got your first Xbox Series X/S and haven’t already played these games before, what follows are the top “must plays” for the platform.</p>

 <p>Yes, the Xbox Series X and S are basically souped-up Xbox Ones, which means you’ll rarely be pressed for awesome games to play. A good rule of thumb is this: If it was playable on the Xbox One, it’s playable on the Xbox Series X and S. (To that end, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-for-the-xbox-one-1500422046">here’s our list of the best games for the Xbox One</a>.) There’s also the matter of a little service called Game Pass.</p> <p>For $30 a month, you can also access Microsoft’s subscription library, including first-party exclusives and a rotating slew of third-party hits. (Hey, look, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-on-xbox-game-pass-1841477023?_ga=2.146372340.1373133010.1689166215-2090935794.1654779924">here’s our list of the best games on Game Pass</a>.) With all that in mind, here are the best games for the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-your-idol-saja-boys-demo-rumi-ejae-2000645529</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ music</span></a><span> comes from the mind of Ejae, who also provides the singing voice for Rumi, the lead singer of the movie’s titular girl group. As such, there are demos for every song in the film with Ejae singing just about every part. This includes songs like “Your Idol,” which Rumi doesn’t perform at all in the finished film, so when we get to hear these demos, it’s like listening to an alternate version of the movie in which the girls of Huntr/x were the demons singing songs to capture the hearts and minds of the masses.</span></p> <p><span>Ejae has played snippets of the demo version of “Your Idol” before, but this is the first time we’ve heard this much of it. The singer/songwriter was </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM2qmgJZPek"><span>part of an event</span></a><span> where she and co-songwriter Mark Sonnenblick talked about the making of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ soundtrack and played a couple of demos for the audience. This included the Grammy-nominated “Golden” and the original “Your Idol” recording, which has some different lyrics than those heard in the film. Even if it only includes the first verse, it’s really cool to hear Rumi’s voice singing a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346"><span>Saja Boys</span></a><span> song. I’d take an EP of the Saja Boys singing Huntr/x songs and vice versa, but I’d settle for full releases of Ejae’s original demos as bonus tracks.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ soundtrack did get a Deluxe Edition release, but its new additions are mostly just acapella and instrumental tracks. If Taylor Swift can release dozens of versions of her albums, what’s the harm in Netflix and Sony putting out another version of the soundtrack that includes these old demos?</span></p> <p><span>For now, Ejae seems to be gearing up for her own solo debut after the success of the film. She released </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-new-song-ejae-in-another-world-video-2000638832"><span>her first single, “In Another World,”</span></a><span> last month, and will hopefully be writing songs for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>sequel</span></a><span> in the near future.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Deadpool VR Is A Game For Deadpool Fans And Nobody Else]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else.1358491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one thing I really appreciate about <em>Deadpool VR</em>, out now exclusively on Quest 3 and Quest 3S virtual reality headsets, it’s how the first-person action-shooter lets you know right away what it is.</p> <p>The opening minutes of the game feature Neil Patrick Harris as Wade Wilson aka Deadpool, carrying out his wild plan to use a jeep filled with explosives to blast open a hole in a large aircraft taken over by an evil group of ninjas. If you like what this opening offers, the rest of the game only gets better. But if you can’t stand Deadpool or prefer VR games that feature interactivity, you’ll likely be ripping the headset off in minutes.</p> <h2>What is <em>Deadpool VR</em>?</h2> <p>Developed by Twisted Pixel and published by Meta, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is, as the name very clearly states, a virtual reality game in which you star as Deadpool as he gets sucked into a bonkers intergalactic reality show and quickly agrees to do evil villain Mojo’s bidding while getting as many viewers as possible. If he pulls it off, he’ll be a famous star. If he fails, he’ll be canceled, which in Mojo’s world equals death.</p>

  <p>Well, actually, to get to this part of the game, you’ll have to slog through the opening level set inside an occupied Shield helicarrier that Deadpool is being paid to rescue from the Hand Clan. And this part sucks, and is the worst bit of <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Prepare for a lot of dark grey corridors filled with the same enemies. And because Deadpool is very hard to kill, you rarely feel in danger in this section.</p>

 <p>The game is also very, very slow about offering up more ways to kill and interact with stuff during this elongated intro. So you spend a lot of time flailing your swords at baddies and watching them crumple in unsatisfying ways, or slowly walking around empty rooms. At one point, Deadpool himself pipes up to point out how dull the ship is and how easy the enemies are, and while it did make me chuckle, it didn’t change the fact that this part sucked a lot.</p>

 <h2>Swords are great, guns are bad</h2> <p>Thankfully, after a fun boss fight that combines all the tools you acquire during the intro, like a grappling hook and grenades, you are sucked into Mojo’s World. This is when the actual game starts. From here on out, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is about tracking down targets for Mojo, fighting lots of baddies as stylishly as possible to gain more viewers, and then using the cash you earn from your antics to buy new weapons and cosmetics.</p>

 <p>While combat in<em> Deadpool VR</em> isn’t groundbreaking for virtual games, it works well enough and has some solid mechanics. I especially liked being able to toss a gun at a bad guy, which reloads it and bounces it back to Deadpool. Fun stuff! I also liked being able to divekick stunned enemies to pop their heads off. Oh, and flinging Deadpool’s swords at enemies is wonderful. They fly with a lot of speed, autotarget just enough that you always feel cool doing it, and pin their targets to nearby walls.</p>

 <p>However, all the guns feel weak, and enemies don’t respond to hits in a way that feels satisfying. Picking up a shotgun, I was excited to blast fools away. But it doesn’t do that at all, and it often took more than one shot with it to take down people, who then didn’t go flying back in an explosion of blood. Boo! This is a <em>Deadpool</em> game, guns should blow people up and feel awesome and powerful.</p>

 <p>And you’ll get your fill of all the good and bad of <em>Deadpool VR’</em>s combat and then some because many fights go on way, way too long. At least during these bigger encounters, you can easily fill your special meter, letting you activate a special attack that uses various Marvel character weapons, like Gambit’s cards. During these sections, the game plays different licensed tracks, and I’ll admit I bobbed my head and smiled as I used playing cards charged with energy to slice down a dozen ninjas in a level set in Japan.</p> <h2>Shut the hell up, Deadpool</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645535">©Marvel / Meta</figcaption></figure> <p>But throughout all of this, Neil Patrick Harris is voicing Deadpool, and it is a drag. He often sounds as if he walked into the booth and did one take while reading the script for the first time and called it a day. Often his voice sounds lifeless, his quips lack emotion, and he delivers jokes as well as a kid trying to explain why that one moment in the latest MrBeast video was so damn funny.</p> <p>What’s odd is that there are times when NPH actually delivers some genuinely funny lines with emotion and care. But they happen so infrequently that it makes me think he or whoever was in charge of directing his performance decided that for most of the game, Deadpool should be disconnected and nonchalant. It doesn’t work and just makes the few moments where he does come alive feel out of place. And the writing doesn’t help, with a lot of jokes and material being the kind of dialogue that would get cut from the first draft of a Ryan Reynolds-led <em>Deadpool</em> movie. I’d say the ratio of jokes that actually got a laugh out of me was about 1 in 5.</p>

 <p>I don’t even hate Deadpool! In fact, I really liked the last two movies and that Xbox-360-era game. If someone like me was struggling with some of the writing and with NPH’s performance, I’m not sure how people who truly despise Deadpool will handle playing <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Having your head strapped into a hot machine that screams Deadpool lines directly into your ear for hours might be like torture for them.<em> *shudders.*&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Ultimately, if you mostly like Deadpool, you own a Quest 3 or Quest 3S VR headset, and you don’t mind playing through levels that lack the interactivity seen in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, I’d recommend <em>Deadpool VR</em>. But be prepared for a bleh intro, bad jokes, and performance hiccups that can make the game chug hard. I have a strong VR stomach and powered through these moments, but others might not make it without feeling sick. And if you hate Deadpool, well, you’ll probably feel sick for a whole other reason. So to Deadpool haters, I’d advise staying away from <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Doubt I needed to warn you anyway.</p>
