              <p>Fall is nearly here. People around my place are putting up Halloween decorations already. I’m leaving my windows open and going outside more. But I’ll try to stay in and enjoy some of the new games being added to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog this month, like <em>The Invincible </em>and <em>Persona 5 Tactica.</em></p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-wwe-2k25-persona-5-tactica-green-hell-fate-samurai-remnant-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On September 10, PlayStation officially announced</a> the next round of PS Plus Extra and Premium games that will be added to the subscription service’s game catalog. All of these newly revealed games will be available to start downloading and playing on September 16.</p> <p>I’m really happy to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em> on here. This indie lo-fi retro survival horror game</a> caught my attention last year when it launched, but I never got around to playing it because there were (and still are) too many damn games. That made me sad, but now that it’s waiting for me on my PS5 as we enter Spooky Season, I’m going to try and play it. Another horror game included here, <em>Conscript</em>, also seems like a perfect Halloween game. Heck, even<em> Legacy of Kain: Defiance, </em>this month’s classic game<em>,</em> has some creepy, gothic horror vibes, too.&nbsp; If PlayStation is giving out two horror games in September, I’m hopeful that next month’s offerings will include even more spooky titles!</p>

 <p>Remember, to access, download, and play these games, you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber. Essential tier subscribers don’t get access to the game catalog. And if your subscription runs out in the future, you’ll no longer be able to play these games.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s the full list of games being added to PS Plus and its various tiers next week:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>WWE 2K25</em> – PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Persona 5 Tactica </em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Green Hell&nbsp;</em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Fate/Samurai Remnant&nbsp;</em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Crow Country – </em>PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Invincible – </em>PS5</li> <li><em>Conscript –&nbsp;</em>PS5</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Plus Premium Only</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance –&nbsp;</em>PS5, PS4</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m always saying that Raichu, the evolution of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s mascot, is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>constant target of disrespect</span></a><span> from both The Pokémon Company and the community at large. Well, now some collectors with far more expendable cash than I’ll ever fathom are in a high-stakes bidding war to buy one of the electric mouse’s rarest cards. The fabled “Prerelease Raichu” card is up for auction, and the bids have already surpassed six figures.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000624736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624736"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624736">© Heritage Auctions</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For those that don’t know, the “Prerelease Raichu” card is the stuff of legend. According to reports dating back to the late ’90s, around 11 copies of the original Raichu card with “PRERELEASE” text stamped in the corner of the artwork were accidentally produced by Wizards of the Coast employees. These cards were mixed in with pre-release Clefable cards that were given out at events in the ’90s, and they were supposed to have been destroyed, though a few were supposedly saved by WOTC workers. Back in 2023, CGC Cards </span><a href="https://www.cgccards.com/news/article/12277/"><span>certified two of the Raichu cards</span></a><span>, confirming that they were indeed legitimate. Now, one of these legendary cards is up for auction on </span><a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-raichu-14-unlimited-base-set-prerelease-psa-trading-card-game-ex-mt-6-wizards-of-the-coast-1999-holo-rare/a/7424-36062.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515"><span>Heritage Auctions</span></a><span>, and as of this writing, its current bid is a whopping $135,000.</span></p> <p><span>It’s certainly not the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633"><span>most money anyone’s ever paid for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card</span></a><span>, but it is a pretty cool piece of history that probably should go somewhere other than a WOTC employee’s attic. As of right now, only a couple of these rare misprints are accounted for. It’s entirely possible some of these Raichu cards have been lost or destroyed in the past 25 years, but at least someone might be able to save and preserve one of them. Someone with more money than I’ll probably see in this lifetime. What do you think it’s like to be so rich you can just drop six figures on a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card? At least it’s being spent on my underappreciated favorite. $135,000 isn’t nearly enough for you, Raichu. Someone raise the bid. Put your money where your mouth is.</span></p>

              <p>After seven long years, <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> has finally left the realm of games we’re always hoping to see at some event or showcase. Silkpost no more. We can all finally play <i>Silksong–</i>and for just 20 bucks at that!</p> <p>With a few days of playtime under their belts, folks have flocked to the internet to opine, elating over finally getting to play such a long-awaited game, and despairing over a surprisingly steeper learning curve than some were expecting.</p> <p>So let’s turn our attention to the Steam reviews section of <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> to see how it’s faring with the chorus.</p> <p>At the time of writing, <i>Silksong</i> is enjoying a “Very Positive” status for its English-language reviews. Fans have rushed in to share their enthusiasm for the long-awaited game. Those who aren’t as excited, as you might expect, are frustrated with not merely the difficulty, but how various challenges seem to feel like unfair “gotcha” moments. Many positive reviews, however, echo back that the game is much more manageable once you get deeper into the story and have amassed some more powerful skills.</p> <p>So let’s jump into some standout reviews, both of the silly and (somewhat) useful kind.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000624693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624693"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624693">©

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-75w-car-charger-with-dual-device-support-goes-for-peanuts-in-a-trending-amazon-deal-stock-moving-quickly-2000624524</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-75w-car-charger-with-dual-device-support-goes-for-peanuts-in-a-trending-amazon-deal-stock-moving-quickly.1293840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Forgive us for making a sweeping assumption, but we’re going to take a stab and say your car’s phone-charging situation could use a massive upgrade. Maybe your USB ports are located in that impossible to reach compartment behind the shifter, or your overly long cord is constantly getting in the way. Any shortcomings you might be dealing with are instantly fixable for a tiny price while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/">Amazon is running this limited-time $25 deal on the 75W Anker Nano Car Charger</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker Nano plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter and charges two devices independently, one via the 45W built-in retractable USB-C cable, and another via the open 30W USB-C port. The retractable cable extends to 29.5 inches, so anyone in the first 2 rows of your vehicle can access it. It’s also not just for smartphones — any USB-C device from your wireless earbuds to your laptop can get a rapid charge while you drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>NoMore Cable Drama</h2>
<p>Finding the perfect USB-C cable to reach from your car charger to your hands-free phone mount must be some kind of dark art, because they all seem to be either too short to reach or so long that they get in the way of your car’s touchscreen or other parts of the console. The retractable USB-C cable built into the Anker Nano Car Charger is, to put it mildly, an ingenious way to keep the car’s cockpit neat and organized, and it’s tested to endure over 10,000 retractions.</p>
<p>The second port in the Anker Nano Car Charger is tailor made for the front passenger, which beats having to split charging time on long drives. No matter how you share the two fast-charging ports of the Anker Nano Car Charger, there’s enough juice to take an iPhone 15 Pro from 0% to 50% in just 25 minutes, and a 2022 MacBook Air from 0% to 50% in 34 minutes. Android devices with USB-C charging ports are also compatible.</p>



<h2>Power Delivered Safely</h2>
<p>Anker bolsters the fast-charging power of the Nano Car Charger with the safety features they are famous for. Built-in ActiveShield 3.0 technology protects your devices from damage caused by overcurrent, overvoltage, and under-voltage, and also constantly monitors its own temperature and the temperature of your devices.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this whole deal isn’t the fast charging or the even the retractable cable. It’s the price — even without this Amazon deal, the Anker Nano Car Charger’s regular price is a modest $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/">But with this limited-time deal taking that down by 38%, it’s safe to say the Anker Nano is the best $25 charger you can find.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’re coming up on the first anniversary of Nintendo’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124"><span>lawsuit against Pocketpair</span></a><span>, the developer of the edgy “</span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>with guns” survival game </span><i><span>Palworld</span></i><span>, on the grounds of patent infringement. Though many people called out </span><i><span>Palworld</span></i><span> for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580?_gl=1*21id2z*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjcwMzk2My4xODguMS4xNzI2NzA0MDI1LjYwLjAuMA.."><span>suspiciously familiar character designs</span></a><span>, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went after Pocketpair not for the appearance of its creatures but for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965"><span>in-game mechanics</span></a><span>, such as aiming and firing an “item” at a character in a field to trigger combat, capturing creatures in the wild, and riding on creatures you can swap between easily in an open world. These are extremely broad and non-specific, and if Nintendo felt like it, the company could easily go after plenty of other games beyond </span><i><span>Palworld </span></i><span>on those grounds. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company aren’t done patenting vague concepts in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series, though, as the companies have just patented more mechanics in a development that could affect the entire monster-taming genre.</span></p> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/"><i><span>Games Fray</span></i></a><span>, a site dedicated to reporting on patent law and other legal issues in the video game industry, reports that Nintendo has received a U.S. patent for the mechanic of “summoning a character and letting it fight another.” The step-by-step breakdown of what this entails reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>(1) A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein a game program, the game program causing a processor of an information processing apparatus to execute:</span></p> <p><span>(2) performing control of moving a player character on a field in a virtual space, based on a movement operation input;</span></p> <p><span>(3) performing control of causing a sub character to appear on the field, based on a first operation input, and</span></p> <p><span>(4) when an enemy character is placed at a location where the sub character is caused to appear, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a first mode in which the battle proceeds based on an operation input, and</span></p> <p><span>(5) when the enemy character is not placed at the location where the sub character is caused to appear, starting automatic control of automatically moving the sub character that has appeared; and</span></p> <p><span>(6) performing control of moving the sub character in a predetermined direction on the field, based on a second operation input, and, when the enemy character is placed at a location of a designation, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a second mode in which the battle automatically proceeds.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Again, this is a pretty general idea that is utilized in plenty of other games, from monster-taming rivals like </span><i><span>Digimon</span></i><span> to more general games like </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> that include summonable creatures. It seems unlikely that Nintendo would suddenly start going after partners like Bandai Namco or Square Enix, who have released games on Nintendo platforms without issue, but on principle, Nintendo patenting vague mechanical ideas as a means of monopolizing a genre is a shitty look, and rubs against the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise’s image as something wholesome and joyful. Not that the facade hasn’t already fallen multiple times at this point. The Pokémon Company has so many problems with things like the quality of its games and with making decisions that enable scalpers to capitalize on its merchandise, problems it never really addresses because it’s too successful to fail. It sure has time to patent fairly standard video game mechanics to help it corner the market, though.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Palworld </span></i><span>lawsuit is ongoing, though Nintendo did </span><a href="https://screenrant.com/nintendo-palworld-lawsuit-update-pantents/"><span>make some changes to the phrasing of the suit</span></a><span> back in July.</span></p>
