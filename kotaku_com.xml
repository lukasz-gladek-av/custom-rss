              <p>Later this year, <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> will end support on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One after eight years of service as the developers focus on improving the game on current-gen hardware.</p> <p>On August 13, the development studio behind the extremely popular online battle royale game <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> announced that the multiplayer shooter will no longer be playable on PS4 or Xbox One after November 13. The first console port of <em>PUBG</em> arrived in late 2017 on Xbox One and was followed by a PS4 port the next year. According to the team behind <em>PUBG</em>, sharing this news with players “weighs heavily on” the team.</p> <p>“This was not a decision made lightly,” said the <em>PUBG</em> team in a blog post sharing the news. “It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of <em>PUBG</em> Console. We kindly ask for your understanding.”</p> <p>The devs claim the reason for ending support on PS4 and Xbox One after nearly a decade comes down to the team wanting to improve the game’s performance, visuals, and stability on console. The team also knows players have long dealt with the game crashing and hope this new version of <em>PUBG</em> on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 won’t collapse as often.</p>

 <p>Players on PS4 and Xbox One should be able to log into a new console and find all of their account progress and purchased items waiting for them. PS5 users will have to download a new version of <em>PUBG</em>. Meanwhile, on Xbox, the game will be updated automatically via Smart Delivery. The new version of <em>PUBG</em> will support 60FPS on all platforms, including Xbox Series S, though at a lower resolution on that device. (Players on Xbox’s weaker console can select a quality mode that runs at 30FPS as well.)</p> <p data-renderer-start-pos="9191">“This transition to current-gen consoles is not only aimed at providing a more stable environment, but also at preparing for larger updates in the future,” said the devs.&nbsp; “It marks an important step forward for the long-term growth of <em>PUBG</em> Console, and will allow us to respond more swiftly to the evolving needs of the console ecosystem. We sincerely thank you for your continued interest and support in <em>PUBG</em> Console, and we remain committed to providing you with the best possible gameplay experience going forward.”</p>

              <p><em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> will once again be free for paid PS Plus subscribers to play when the hit open-world superhero adventure returns to the service later this month. In fact, August is looking like another decent haul for the Game Pass competitor, with<em> Mortal Kombat 1</em> and<em> Resident Evil</em> PS1 classics also joining the fray.</p> <p><em>Spider-Man</em> had originally been on the service’s subscription library until it was removed in April 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ps5-marvels-spider-man-ps-plus-extra-ps4-1850328471">shortly before the sequel was released for PS5</a>. Originally going head-to-head with Microsoft’s Game Pass strategy, which included day-one first-party exclusives, it’s no longer a guarantee that Sony games will cycle into PS Plus library and stay there even years after they’ve released. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-ps-plus-may-2025-gta-5-resistance-batman-1851778091"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> exited just last year ahead of its own remaster arriving.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-august-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-sword-of-the-sea-earth-defense-force-6-and-more/">full list</a> of games joining the PS Plus Extra tier in August 2025:</p> <ul> <li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Sword of the Sea</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Earth Defense Force 6</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Unicorn Overlord</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Atelier Ryza 3 Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Indika</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Harold Halibut</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Coral Island</em> | PS5And here’s what’s joining the Premier tier:</li> <li><em>Resident Evil 2</em> | PS5, PS4 (PS)</li> <li><em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> | PS5, PS4 (PS)</li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> free game trial | PS5Everything will become available starting August 19, including <em>Sword of the Sea</em> which is a day-and-date release. It’s the latest atmospheric adventure from Giant Squid, which also made <em>Abzu</em> and <em>The Pathless</em>, one of the PS5’s more underrated launch games. <em>Sword of the Sea</em> has a lot of Journey-style dune surfing in it so I’m excited to check it out.There are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1m16p8q/games_leaving_ps_extradeluxepremium_on_august_19th/">notable games leaving PS Plus</a> on that day as well, however. <em>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</em> is ending its latest tour on PS Plus, and 2023’s excellent <em>Monster Hunter</em>-like <em>Wild Hearts</em> will be departing as well. <em>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em>, <em>UFC 5</em>, <em>TopSpin 2K25,</em> and<em> Bugsnax</em> will all be gone as well.</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>On August 13, Konami confirmed that <em>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater Delta</em>‘s new multiplayer mode–<a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-online-1851784404">Fox Hunt–</a>won’t support crossplay on PC or consoles. It’s not the only game to lack the popular feature this year. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> doesn’t support crossplay and arcade soccer hit <em>Rematch</em> launched without it, too. But in 2025, it is weird that some games are still lacking what feels like an industry standard for multiplayer games.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462">In a small post on Twitter on Wednesday</a>, Konami announced that its upcoming <em>MGS</em> remake won’t feature crossplay multiplayer in Fox Hunt. It’s the latest bit of bad news about the game’s online mode after Konami confirmed last week that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/metal-gear-solid-deltas-fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode-just-got-delayed/"><em>MGS Delta: Snake Eater </em>multiplayer won’t be available at launch</a>. Instead, it will be added to the game via a free update in the fall. Many players are now worried that when Fox Hunt finally arrives, the mode, which was likely to have a small playerbase compared to more popular online games anyway, might suffer from long wait times and will feel dead soon after launch. Crossplay could have united the small groups of players spread across PS5, Xbox, and PC, but now that won’t happen. And the upcoming <em>MGS</em> remake isn’t the only big-name game to skip crossplay in 2025.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">【ご案内】<br>『METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER』のオンライン対戦モード 「FOX HUNT」につきまして、異なるプラットフォーム間でのクロスプレイは非対応となります。</p> <p>対応機種<br>PlayStation®5、Xbox Series X|S、Steam®<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MGSDelta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MGSDelta</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetalGearSolid?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetalGearSolid</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AE%E3%82%A2%E3%82%BD%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%83%89?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#メタルギアソリッド</a> <a href="https://t.co/sGsv3CjyhW">pic.twitter.com/sGsv3CjyhW</a></p> <p>— メタルギア公式 (METAL GEAR) (@metalgear_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> has received rave reviews from players and critics and has consumed the lives of at least five different people I know, including my wife and <em>Kotaku</em> reporter Ethan Gach. But the game launched without crossplay, and FromSoftware is unlikely to ever add it. Sure, some players might be annoyed by crossplay in competitive games like <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;because it allows PC hackers to screw with console players easily. But in something like <em>Nightreign</em>, that would have been a non-issue. Most people are playing the online, run-based RPG with friends, and the game is all PVE co-op. Another 2025 game that lacked crossplay at launch is the fantastic soccer game <em>Rematch</em>, though <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/sloclap-rematch-dev-update-july-18th-2025">according to the devs,</a> it is being added in the near future.</p>

 <p>It wasn’t that long ago that crossplay was a novelty that we rarely saw in console games. Then, around 2019, <em>Fortnite</em> became mega popular, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/cross-platform-gaming-has-been-great-1845804328">Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo were all forced to play ball</a> as it became clear that players wanted to play with their friends regardless of platform. Nowadays, a game announcing crossplay isn’t news. Instead, it’s only the lack of the feature that catches people’s attention, like with the <em>MGS Delta: Snake Eater </em>announcement.</p> <p>So why are some games still avoiding crossplay? There’s definitely some tech reasons behind the decision. Even if it’s easier today than before to implement crossplay, it’s still extra work for devs and adds more complications to big games that are already complex pieces of software. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/sony-charges-for-crossplay-support-to-protect-psn-revenue-documents-show/">There’s also the claim that Sony is reportedly</a> still charging publishers fees to add crossplay to games ported to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-cross-play-ps5-xbox-borderlands-1848649295">PS4 or PS5.</a> That extra cost might make a publisher pass on supporting crossplay, especially in co-op-only games like <em>Nightreign</em> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-online-mgo-2-rpcs3-fox-hunt-delta-remake-2000616716">niche online modes like <em>MGS’s</em> Fox Hunt.&nbsp;</a> Whatever the reason, it is now very odd not to include crossplay, and it’s only going to get weirder to do so as a new generation of gamers grows up in an era when almost every game supports cross-platform multiplayer action.</p>
