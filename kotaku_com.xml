            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During the first day of Xbox’s big <em>Halo</em> esports event, a previously rumored remake of the original <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>leaked ahead of a reported announcement. And surprise, surprise, after over two decades of being an Xbox-only series, Halo is making the leap to PlayStation in 2026.</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611">This new remake, officially titled <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved, </em>was previously teased at last year’s HWCS via a tech demo</a> that looked to contain remade assets from <em>Halo CE</em>.&nbsp; There have also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBaqo2AZxRY">multiple reports</a> of this newly announced remake of the very first <em>Halo</em> game, which is the first new game from Halo Studios since 2021’s<em> Halo Infinite</em>. Despite positive reviews, the open-world spin on <em>Halo</em> failed to achieve the long-term success that Xbox had hoped for. Two years later, the studio suffered layoffs in 2023 and was then completely rebranded in 2024. The studio has also ditched<em> Halo Infinite’</em>s custom-made engine, Slipstream, and is now using Unreal.</p>

 <h2>Here’s What The New <em>Halo</em> Remake Looks Like In Action</h2> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>&nbsp;totally different game from the <em>Halo Combat Evolved</em> remaster we got back on the Xbox 360. As seen in this extended gameplay trailer, which Xbox published shortly after the store page went live, this is a brand new game based on the OG title with incredible visuals and new features. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20also%20just%20the%20campaign%3B%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20multiplayer%20mode%2C%20which%20will%20ruffle%20some%20feathers.%20Previously">According to a preview from <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, <em>Campaign Evolved</em> doesn’t feature any competitive multiplayer modes. It will support two-player split screen and four-player online co-op, though.</p>

  <p>In the gameplay video above, we see someone playing through one of the game’s best levels, The Silent Cartographer. And at the end of that 13-minute gameplay trailer, it’s confirmed this upcoming remake of the classic FPS is coming to PlayStation 5 as well as Game Pass, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Xbox Cloud. What a world we live in. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-ps5-remake-remaster-halo-forza-port-1851779186"><em>Forza, Gears of War, </em>and now <em>Halo</em> are all PlayStation games. Wild.</a> The game will support both crossplay and cross progression across all platforms.</p>

 <p>Here’s the game’s description via an <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010">Xbox Store listing</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Discover the Ringworld After crash landing on a mysterious ringworld known as Halo, the Master Chief is tasked with helping the remaining humans survive against overwhelming Covenant forces. Alongside his AI companion Cortana, he uncovers Halo’s dark secrets and fights to avert the annihilation of all life in the galaxy.</p></blockquote> <h2>The New Stuff Being Added To Halo: Campaign Evolved</h2> <p>In a PlayStation Blog post from Halo community director Brian “ske7ch” Jarrard, he welcomed PS5 gamers to the Halo universe and outlined some of the new content being added to this remade version of the 2001 classic. This remake features improved combat and nine new weapons pulled from other Halo games. It also includes “three brand-new prequel missions starring the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson.” According to both the PlayStation post and Xbox store listing, these missions are “set before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved” and will add “new environments, gameplay, and characters” to the remake.</p> <p>Players will be able to hijack vehicles, a feature introduced in Halo 2, in this new remake. This means you can even hijack the powerful Wraith tanks and drive them around, something that wasn’t possible in the first <em>Halo</em>. This new version of Halo also contains the largest number of “Skulls” in the franchise’s history, letting players remix missions with various effects, like, yes, the Grunt Birthday Party skull.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Set in Japan in the 1960s, <i>Silent Hill f</i> is notable for being the first full <i>Silent Hill</i> game set outside of America, far from the series’ titular troubled town. Hinako, the protagonist, is one of four teenagers whose lives get turned upside down by terrifying supernatural events that also double as an all too relatable metaphor for the rampant harms of misogyny and the way society devalues the lives of women. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__cnp_/">Actress Konatsu Kato</a> provides the voice of the character in Japanese, and also did the motion capture for her. She recently took to YouTube to stream the game for a little over an hour and a half (reaching Hinako’s arrival at the Dark Shrine). And hopefully she’s planning to stream more, because her reactions to the various freaky nonsense packed in <i>Silent Hill f</i> are priceless.</p> <h2>‘How could someone come up with something like this?’</h2> <p>You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ek5c3sQygs&amp;t=1507s">whole stream here</a>, but there are some standout moments worth jumping to if you’re a bit impatient.</p> <p>Here’s Kato encountering one of the game’s first fightable monsters, to which she says (based on auto-translate), “How could someone come up with something like this?:</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0Ek5c3sQygs?t=1492">Another great moment</a> comes early on when Kato has to run from the fog monster, which she does while screaming “Oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.” If you don’t have time to watch the whole stream, it’s also worth jumping into about 55 minutes or so when she comes across the bloody mask with the key lodged inside. The monster chase that follows is good fun too, as Kato frantically tries to find out how to escape while saying “I can’t take it anymore! Eh, wait a minute. This way? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, which way, which way? Ah, I’ve done something weird.” And yes, like many of us likely did during this part, she totally goes for the wrong door.</p> <p>The video is titled “<i>SILENT HILL f </i>#1” so here’s hoping we get to see more!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The theatrical version of <em>Star Wars: A New Hope,</em> released as just <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em></a> back in 1977, is seemingly being restored in 4k by Disney for a future release, according to new leaks. This version of George Lucas’ sci-fi blockbuster hasn’t been officially released by Lucasfilm since 2006, and that was a crappy transfer from a Laserdisc.</p> <p>Over the last few months, rumors and leaks have been circulating online about Disney working on a remastered and fully restored version of<em> Star Wars</em>. Then, recently, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ysOeFio">video clips surfaced</a> of this not-yet-officially-announced 4K restoration of the theatrical version of <em>Star Wars</em>. Those clips were promptly deleted, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1o52vaa/star_wars_theatrical_ot_leaked_restoration/">but leaked screenshots are still floating around</a> and show new, highly detailed scans of <em>A New Hope</em>, and also <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and<em> Return of the Jedi,</em> implying the entire OG trilogy is being restored. And the best part? The leaked information claims that these restorations are being done properly, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ctHBnCF">using original film negatives</a> and with an effort to preserve grain and color grading. This doesn’t appear to be a quick 4K AI upscale like we’ve seen in recent years.</p>

 <p>This is a big deal because the last time Lucasfilm officially released the original theatrical version of the films, without all of Lucas’ special edition tweaks and changes, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Original_unaltered_trilogy">was way back in 2006</a>. The DVD versions of<em> Star Wars</em> released back then included the original theatrical cuts as a bonus feature. Sadly, these were poorly transferred copies from the Laserdisc versions of the S<em>tar Wars</em> movies. And the transfers on Laserdisc weren’t great either.</p>

 <p>And while fans have done incredible work restoring the original cuts of<em> Star Wars</em> via projects like <a href="https://www.thestarwarstrilogy.com/project-4k77/"><em>4K77</em>,</a> these efforts have always been limited by having to work with old film stock and not having access to the original negatives or higher-quality prints. So it’s very exciting that Lucasfilm and Disney are properly restoring the OG cuts of the original trilogy, as they alone have access to the best source material around and the resources to pull this off.</p>

 <p>We already know that Disney plans to bring back <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-50th-anniversary-theatrical-release"><em>A New Hope</em> to theaters in 2027, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the franchise</a>. In the announcement of those plans, Disney didn’t specify which version would be shown. But it looks like it might actually be the long-awaited theatrical cut. If that’s the case, I’ll be there for sure. I also hope these versions get proper 4K UHD releases and are made available on Disney+.</p> <p><em>Star Wars</em> is one of the most influential films in history, and it deserves to be seen in its original form in the best quality possible. I’m happy that Disney, possibly looking to win back old fans, is finally doing this after decades of Lucas not caring. Now, let’s just hope this is all real and the company doesn’t fuck this up between now and release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I consume a firehose of online content every day as part of my job. At some point in the last week, through a post, comment, or video I can no longer remember, I became aware of a shortcut for tinkering with the brightness on my Switch 2. Turns out this existed on the original Switch as well. All you have to do his hold down the home button to instantly bring up the slider. Eureka!</p> <p>I’ve had the old Switch since it launched back in March 2017. I still remember passing through the food court at the mall to pick it up from GameStop. Thousands of hours later, it feels slightly embarrassing to report that I never knew about this settings menu shortcut.</p>

 <p>I change my brightness settings a lot depending on where I’m sitting, the time of day, how bright it is outside, and who’s around me. To cut down on the glare in my porch room, I boost it to the max. To save battery on long car rides with the kids, I toggle it way down. In bed with my partner and two-year-old while grinding runs of <em>Hades 2</em>, I also keep the screen dim to not wake them up.</p>

 <p>And every damn time I did it, I was going back to the home screen, clicking on the settings, and going to the screen brightness bar. Was this the biggest hassle in the world? Obviously not! But I love games and I love gaming hardware and one of the cornerstones of that hobby is min-maxing and I felt a little pang of humiliation when I realized I’d been using my Switch sub-optimally all these years.</p> <p>No longer! Don’t be like me! Take the knowledge of this home button shortcut and go control your screen brightness the way Nintendo intended.</p>
