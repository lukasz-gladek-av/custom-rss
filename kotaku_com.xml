              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-movie-remake-theater-release-january-2026-1851784778"><em>Return to Silent Hill,</em></a> a live-action film adaptation of Konami’s beloved <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, hits theaters later this week. Early reviews for the horror flick are as scary as any monster from the games.</p> <p>First announced in 2022, <a href="https://kotaku.com/return-to-silent-hill-pyramid-head-first-look-1851482793"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> releases on January 23. It isn’t connected to the past two <em>Silent Hill</em> movies, even though it was directed by the first film’s Christophe Gans, and is instead a loose adaptation of the PS2-era survival horror classic<em> Silent Hill 2.</em> Marketing for this film has been minimal to say the least, partially because it seems the executives involved realized it wasn’t great back when it wrapped filming in 2023, and the movie is only seeing the light of day after that recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake did so well. But after the delay and the lack of marketing, perhaps this is a very good horror film? Nope. Doesn’t seem like it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661969" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661969"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661969">©Rotten Tomatoes / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">As of January 21, there are 15 reviews for <em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> on critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. And the new movie has an abysmal seven percent Tomatometer score. For those not familiar with Rotten Tomatoes, that ain’t a great score. In fact, if this seven percent score holds, <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/worst-movies-of-all-time/"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will go down as one of the worst-reviewed movies ever</a>. Yikes.</p>

 <p>The general consensus from critics is that while parts of <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> look great, the film is a boring, sloppy, confusing, and (perhaps worst of all for the genre) not-very-scary movie about a main character that is hard to relate to and who seems more confused than terrified.</p>  <p>“This powerful survival horror story has been turned into an ugly, laughable adaptation that proves that maybe we should’ve never gone back to Silent Hill,” said Ross Bonaime over at <em>Collider</em>.</p>

 <p>“Christophe Gans’s film does away with all the psychosexual nuance of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>,” claims Justin Clark at <em>Slant Magazine.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I found the experience difficult to sit through and nonsensical from moment to moment, with its confounding story and shoddy CGI matched only by its lack of entertainment value,” said critic Brian Eggert.</p>

 <p>At the moment, there is only one non-rotten score, from Dominic Baez at the <em>Seattle Times</em>, and it doesn’t read like a loving endorsement of the movie. Instead, it seems like Baez found most of the movie bad, but enjoyed the ending. The end credits are apparently very “stylish.” When critics are praising your credits and not much else, that’s a bad sign.</p>

              <p>A teenager in Pittsburgh was forced to fight a man armed with a knife after he allegedly broke into the teen’s family home and falsely claimed to be an <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent</a> before trying to steal some electronics, including a PlayStation console.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/man-accused-posing-ice-agent-allegheny-county/70051847">As reported by local news network WTAE 4</a><em>,</em> according to a recently filed criminal complaint, 35-year-old William Gregory allegedly broke into a house in the Beltzhoover neighborhood outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and began shouting that he was an ICE agent and demanded that the reportedly Hispanic family show him identifying paperwork. He was carrying a large pocket knife and threatened a 17-year-old boy living in the home as he tried to steal a PlayStation console and grabbed the boy’s phone. The outlet didn’t specify what kind of PlayStation was nearly stolen by the robber.</p>

 <p>Police report that the teenager fought back against the fake ICE agent and eventually punched Gregory in the face hard enough to knock him out cold. Police later arrived on the scene and found the intruder still unconscious.</p> <p>“I believe that is a Hispanic home, you know, and our neighborhood is very diverse,” Crystal Calloway, who lives next door to the house where the robbery happened, told WTAE 4. She also told the outlet that she was concerned about someone pretending to be part of ICE.</p>

  <p>Gregory has been charged with ethnic intimidation and burglary and is currently in jail. He was also wanted for a previous robbery charge.</p> <p>“It’s a great thing that the young man, his adrenaline went through going and action and went to defend his family, you know, thank goodness for that,” said Calloway.</p>

 <p>As ICE continues to send thousands of masked and violent officers into states like Minnesota, we have seen many people injured by their aggressive tactics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Ren%C3%A9e_Good">On January 7, Renée Good was fatally shot by ICE agent Johnathan Ross</a>. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">Department of Homeland Security</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308">federal officials</a> claim Good hit the officer with her car, but many news agencies and experts who have seen the footage dispute this claim.</p> <p>This incident in Pittsburgh isn’t the first example of a criminal claiming to be an ICE agent to do nefarious activities. ICE agents continuing to act recklessly and dangerously while often hiding their identities has made it easy for some bad actors to pretend to be ICE agents, <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/galveston-texas-fake-ice-officer-arrested/285-c3bb0b78-6ed6-43a8-bc43-cd17e5db35ad">as seen in Texas earlier this month.</a> Perhaps we shouldn’t have thousands of armed, masked goons tossing teens and innocent people around?</p>
