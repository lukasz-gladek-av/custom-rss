              <p>Is your Christmas tree missing a little bling? It’s time to add some smart lighting to brighten it up. Govee makes some of our favorite solutions out there, and we just spotted its smart RGBIC Christmas tree lights going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/">On a regular day, these lights would run you around $140, but the retailer just slashed the price by 36%, offering them for just $90 right now</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen them drop to in a long while. It was also originally a Black Friday discount, which managed to survive the main event. You’ll enjoy free delivery on your purchase, which ultimately brings the total down even further. Snap it up quickly, though. Christmas is just around the corner, and we’re expecting these lights to be a popular pick, so both the discount and the stock could run out soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>The box includes 24 string lights, with a total of 480 LED beads. Each line is 6.6ft long and features 20 LEDs, making it great for most trees from 6.5ft to 8ft. There’s an 11.5ft power line attached, which allows you to place the lights anywhere without feeling limited. Installation couldn’t be simpler. The lights come with everything you need to put these up, including mounting rings, bar support, cable ties, and U-shaped straps.</p>
<p>Once up, the upgraded LED design, paired with the densely arranged beads, makes for a much smoother, uniform lighting effect. You can choose from 16 million color options (you read that right), plus over 60 versatile preset modes that have something appropriate for every occasion. If you already have a vision in mind, go DIY using the dedicated app, picking your own colors and styles. You can overlap layers, draw a sketch on the app to get specific patterns on the lights, edit patterns, or share your ideas with the AI bot to create unique effects. Don’t have the time for all of that? The preset modes make it easy to choose one within seconds. The Christmas lighting show, for instance, is bright and offers a nice mix of holiday-appropriate colors. Similarly, the “New Year’s” mode is a bit more vibrant, while the “Winter Warm” option brings cozy energy into your space.</p>



<p>The timer section in the app lets you create specific schedules for your lights. There’s a Sleep option to dim them, and a Wake Up to turn them on gradually. What’s more, the lights can also turn on when you clap your hands. Turn it into a game and see who can light them all up in the shortest time!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about these smart lights that can be used for multiple events. You can pick from a range of colors and preset modes, which means you’re no longer stuck with the basic yellow lighting. Maybe go for something bright during the day, and switch to warmer tones at night; the possibilities are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/"> Amazon is now letting you grab them for just $90, after taking a whopping 36% off their retail price.</a> Make sure you act fast to grab them, because we’re not expecting the discount or the stock to last long. That said, there are plenty of other lighting solutions by Govee going for less, as well. Now is a great time to stock up on everything you’ve had your eyes on, before the prices shoot back up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fans Think Mario Kart World Might Get A Big Donkey Kong DLC Any Day Now]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-dlc-donkey-kong-bananza-game-awards-2000650892</link>
            <guid>1374361</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been six months since <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> launched alongside the Switch 2. There have been some notable patches during that time but no big content updates. Could the game’s first paid DLC be right around the corner? Here’s why some fans think so and why it will feature tie-ins to <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>.</p> <p>Before we go on, here’s a spoiler warning for those who haven’t finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> yet.</p>  <p>So, Nintendo Today news app <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong">dataminers</a> recently discovered an interesting entry for December 15 (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/im-convinced-nintendo-might-be-gearing-up-for-a-mario-kart-world-dlc-announcement-as-it-prepares-to-spotlight-a-donkey-kong-bananza-character-its-been-refusing-to-publicly-acknowledge-since-launch/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). It’s an animation featuring <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/File:NT_Day_15_DK.mp4">King K. Rool</a>. He’s a familiar enough Nintendo character at this point, even making it into <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, but the post is also clearly a nod to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza,</em> in which the reptile serves as <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-ending-final-boss-odyssey-1851787178">the surprise final boss</a>. While King K. Rool has been in <em>Smash Bros.</em>, he’s never been in a <em>Mario Kart</em> before.</p>

 <p>What makes this theory extra convincing is that <em>Mario Kart World</em> and<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> already share <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/">credits for two voice actors</a>: Yuu Hayashi (Void Kong) and Tsuguo Mogami (King K. Rool). Those two characters are obviously in<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. They are not in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Yet. Hmmm.</p>

 <p>Adding fuel to the speculation is a lot of other circumstantial stuff, like the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards</a>, where Nintendo has often announced big DLCs in the past, is right around the corner, and the base version of<em> Mario Kart World</em> is surprisingly light on costumes and music for <em>Donkey Kong</em>. With Nintendo making such a big push behind the big ape—a big launch year exclusive for the Switch 2, <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">a rumored movie spin-off</a>, and a remaster of an old Wii game—it wouldn’t be shocking to see the first big Mario Kart World expansion be DK-themed.</p>

 <p>Diddy Kong, for example, has been in and out of the series <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-mario-kart-games-worst-to-best-1842892038">since <em>Double Das</em>h</a>. He didn’t launch with <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> but was later added in the Booster Pass Course DLCs. Funky Kong, too. I would expect them and more to get added <em>eventually</em>. Now, whether that’s this month or farther down the road is a different question. December totally makes sense for <em>Mario Kart World</em> DLC, but Nintendo doesn’t always do something just because it makes sense.</p> <p>And if we read into every little Nintendo Today news app drop like this, well, fans would be expecting all sorts of wild announcements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splitgate 2 Launched, Flopped, Unlaunched, Relaunched, And Renamed All In The Same Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-arena-shooter-beta-1047-games-2000650903</link>
            <guid>1374316</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Splitgate 2</i>, the “what-if-<i>Halo</i>-but-also-<i>Portal</i>” shooter, had <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742">a rocky launch</a> this year following a controversial Summer Game Fest appearance and aggressive monetization practices. But the game is hoping to open a new chapter with players after it went <i>back</i> into beta status in July 2025, after launching just a month prior. It’s marking that new chapter with a name change. The game will now be known as <i>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</i>. A promotional video describes it as being rebuilt “from the ground up.”</p> <p>He’s changed, babe. For real this time.</p> <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/hrcUZ_F7vX8">a video posted</a> to the official <i>Splitgate</i> YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-returning-to-beta-splitgate-2-is-coming-back-with-a-new-name">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), 1047 Games’ design director Josh Watson describes the game as a tribute to classic arena shooters such as <i>Unreal</i>, <i>Quake</i>, and of course, <i>Halo</i>. To that end, <i>Splitgate </i>has ejected factions and unique abilities to hopefully lock into that old-school arena style gameplay, just with fancy portals. The full experience is expected to launch for free on December 17, 2025. Check out the gameplay <a href="https://youtu.be/hrcUZ_F7vX8">here</a>:</p>

   <p><i>Splitgate</i> managed to really step in it this summer after director Ian Proulx took to the Summer Game Fest stage in 2025 to deliver <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">an obtuse rant about the state of modern shooters</a>, all while sporting a “Make FPS Great Again” hat. As if that wasn’t enough, <i>Splitgate 2</i> featured many uncomfortable trappings of modern shooters: aggressive microtransactions and costly cosmetic bundles. And for a game that promised to return to a classic style of shooter gameplay, the inclusion of a battle royale mode was odd.</p>

 <p>As such, the release of the sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-preview-impressions-1851624294">didn’t go over well with fans</a>. In response, 1047 Games pulled its shooter back into an indefinite beta status to rework the experience five months ago. Whether it will be enough to smooth things over with folks remains to be seen.</p> <p><i>Splitgate</i> impressed early on in 2019 with its fusion of classic arena shooter gameplay with portal shenanigans. They could be prone to gimmicky plays, but tossing portals into the mess of traditional arena-shooter action often proved to be a nice change of pace. Let’s see if its second emergence from beta and the new name will be enough for the sequel to make waves again.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roku-goes-into-clearance-mode-on-streambar-and-subwoofer-bundle-at-record-low-while-amazon-fire-tv-soundbar-returns-to-full-price-2000650673</link>
            <guid>1374313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="138" data-end="634">Still got a “dumb” TV lacking all the smart features we’ve seen become a standard over the last decade? No need to upgrade just yet if it’s still working fine. Maybe just need to bring it into the modern age with the help of a Roku. They’re budget-friendly and simple to set up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/">And conveniently enough, Amazon is currently offering the Roku 4K HDR Streambar SE and Wireless Bass Bundle at a 35% discount.</a> It’s usually listed at $230, but for a short period you can grab it for only $150—meaning you keep an extra $80 in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="636" data-end="1261">Whether you’re trying to start streaming on a non-smart TV or you’re just not a fan of your smart TV’s clunky interface (looking at you, LG), plugging a Roku into one of your free HDMI ports is can make for a better experience. You’ll be able to access all the apps you rely on to stay caught up with new releases. Every Roku streaming device includes Bluetooth support and works with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, letting it smoothly integrate into your broader smart home setup. Its remote also features a built-in voice assistant, making it simple to search for whatever content you’re looking for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1263" data-end="1704">And speaking of the remote, it’s rechargeable, so you no longer need to stock AAAs. The backlit buttons make it easy to navigate in dim lighting without the usual fumbling around. Of course, you can also just say “Hey Roku” and control everything via voice commands instead. If the remote ever goes missing, Roku even provides a lost-remote finder. Though, it’s probably slipped somewhere between your couch cushions. Maybe just check there.</p>
<p data-start="1706" data-end="2210">The home screen is completely customizable, allowing you to keep your preferred streaming apps front and center. An interesting bonus—Roku actually has its own original programming. Alongside the apps you already subscribe to like Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, and Max, you can switch over to enjoy Roku’s free original series such as <em>Dinner Budget Showdown</em>, <em>Celebrity Family Food Battle</em>, <em>Martha Cooks</em>, and <em>Emeril Cooks</em>. I promise, there’s more than only cooking shows. I just have food on the mind.</p>


<h2>Better Sound</h2>
<p>This holiday season bundle isn’t the standard Roku streamer. This is a multimedia player and speaker in one. This Roku soundbar sits under your TV so you can enjoy upgraded sound with all your shows and movies. The soundbar—or Streambar, rather—is both your sound output and the source of the Roku interface itself. It just needs to plug into your TV over HDMI and you’re set.</p>
<p>The bundle is also throwing in the Roku Wireless Bass. This can kick your already great sound up a notch by bringing a subwoofer into the mix.</p>
<p>Go grab some snacks and let everyone know that the next movie night will be happening in your living room—<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/">thanks to the Roku Streambar SE and Wireless Bass bundle, now available for just $150</a>. I’d recommend putting that $70 you’re saving toward a popcorn machine.</p>

              <p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was an actor that everyone would immediately recognize, but perhaps many would struggle to name. Known best for his portrayal of Shang Tsung in 1995’s ridiculous <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie, and then for voicing the character in the games since 2013, Tagawa had multiple other defining roles across an extraordinary career. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a> he died on December 4, following complications from a stroke.</p> <p>It’s hard to think of a more iconic role than Shang Tsung, the evil sorcerer in Paul W.S. Anderson’s hokey and adored 1995 adaptation of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> video game series, as well as 2013’s web series <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy</em>&nbsp;(then once more in 2015’s <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Mortal_Kombat_X:_Generations_(lost_production_material_for_unreleased_web_series_based_on_game_franchise;_2015)">abandoned promotional web series, <em>Mortal Kombat X: Generations</em></a>). But Tagawa had broad range, known more recently for his leading role as the noble and conflicted Nobusuke Tagomi in Amazon’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, as well as roles as diverse as Krull in Tim Burton’s <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, Hiroki Watanabe in&nbsp;<em>Lost in Space</em>, and multiple guest roles on a number of popular TV series. He also displayed a splendid lack of brand loyalty when he appeared in 2010’s atrocious movie version of <em>Tekken</em>! (As well as its straight-to-video sequel.)</p>

 <p>Tagawa was also a voice actor, portraying Valco in <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, The Swordmaker in Netflix’s animation <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>, and Alrich Wren in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Rebels</em>, among many others. He was a contributor to video game voice roles, too, again most notably reprising his role as Shang Tsung in various <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, including&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> and its various DLCs. The actor is also heard in <em>World of Warcraft: Legion</em>, and 2003’s <em>Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu</em> as the eponymous criminal. Oh, and rather brilliantly, he appeared in the extraordinary mess of 1997’s FMV game <em>Soldier Boyz</em>, a game that claimed to be co-directed by Darren Aronofsky, given the footage was lifted from an HBO TV show.</p> <p>The Toyko-born actor trained in martial arts as a child, before studying karate at university. His first movie appearance was Bernardo Bertolucci’s Oscar-winning <em>The Last Emperor </em>in 1987, before going on to appear in 150 other roles. Tagawa died on Thursday morning, surrounded by his family, aged 75. RIP.</p>

              <p>Upgrading your work or everyday laptop doesn’t have to break the bank; especially if you know where to look for one. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are over, but there’s still one last chance left to save big on a premium laptop, and bag some freebies with your purchase while you’re at it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/">The 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which usually sits well over $2,600, is currently going for just $770 at Amazon, after a whopping 70% off its usual price.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in a month, and the retailer is also throwing in a bunch of useful accessories for absolutely nothing. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro</a> also comes pre-installed, so you’re saving a good chunk on that front, too. Be sure to grab yours fast, as we don’t expect the discount to stay around for long. In fact, it might not even make it into the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Display, Fast Performance</h2>
<p>You’re getting a massive 17.3-inch Brightview HD+ touch display that brings content to life in stunning 1600 x 900 resolution. 1.4M pixels come together to deliver every detail with incredible accuracy, while the slim bezel and 16:9 aspect ratio offer quite a lot of room to work and play. You can stream your favorite shows, create presentations, and even play some of your favorite titles; all without feeling cramped. There’s an HP TrueVision 720p HD, paired with temporal noise reduction and an integrated dual array digital microphone for better video calls. Additionally, audio quality is just as great, thanks to the built-in Dual-stereo speakers.</p>
<p>For power, HP has packed the laptop with a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 7530U Processor that is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.5 GHz. It’s more than enough to speed through a bunch of work and creative tasks without a hint of lag. The 16GB RAM isn’t massive, but still modest enough to keep things running smoothly, especially when you’re trying to multitask. You will be able to work with different applications at the same time – think catching up on Slack, hopping on a meeting with Zoom, working on a PowerPoint project – without slowing down. Storing all your important data in a single place is made easy with the built-in 512GB SSD. It should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re trying to store an entire gaming library on it. And since the storage is expandable, you always pair it with an SD card or an external hard drive to get the space you need. SSDs are also much faster than traditional drives, so you’re going to enjoy faster boot and load times as well.</p>



<p>The battery is solid, and HP Fast Charge gets it back up and running in no time when you’re running low. As for the freebies, you’ll get Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a CD/DVD drive, a cleaning cloth, a wireless mouse, and a 256GB Micro SD. That’s everything you need to get started right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/">If you’ve been looking to grab a solid laptop without blowing your budget, this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price</a>. You’re paying $770 for features that are usually reserved for high-end models. We recommend the machine to work professionals, students, creatives, and even casual users. Make sure you get your orders in quick, because the deal could expire at any moment now.</p>

              <p><span>December 4th is Dragon Age Day, the unofficial day fans of BioWare’s fantasy RPG anthology celebrate the series. Last year, the studio earnestly participated. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>was only about a month old at the time, so BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-free-download-1851713224"><span>released the game’s incredible character creator for free</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-popular-choice-stats-romance-1851713958"><span>broke down early player choices</span></a><span> on social media. This year? There wasn’t a peep from the studio on the matter. Not even a single mention of the franchise that once won “Best Game” at the Game Awards.</span></p> <p><span>If you look at BioWare’s </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>social accounts, the last time the studio used the game’s </span><a href="https://x.com/dragonage"><span>X account</span></a><span> was to repost an ad for </span><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i><span> on the EA Play subscription service on August 28. The developer’s </span><a href="https://blog.bioware.com/"><span>official blog’s</span></a><span> last post was on November 7, celebrating </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>’s equivalent “holiday,” N7 Day, which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><span>had a small update on the upcoming fifth game</span></a><span> and the Amazon television series. You’ll find no such post about </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. BioWare has admitted it’s become a one-game studio after massive layoffs </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>back in January</span></a><span>, so there is no fifth </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>game in the works, but the silence also casts a shadow on the RPG series’ past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re only passively paying attention, it might make sense for the studio to not make a big deal about a series without a sequel it’s actively promoting. But for fans and the developers who spent decades working on </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>, it’s another insult to beloved games that seemed to sometimes get the short end of the stick over their troubled development.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the months since BioWare was gutted of veteran talent and </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was </span></i><span>thrown under the bus by parent company Electronic Arts, developers have been candid about how the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team felt like it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>wasn’t treated fairly by the broader company</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i><span>’s messy production saw the game rebooted from a live service no one wanted into a single-player RPG that, miraculously, came out feeling like the character-driven epics BioWare is associated with despite being a decade in the works.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After the game didn’t reach internal projections out of the gate, EA downsized BioWare and has focused the company exclusively on </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>, and implied that </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>may have reached a broader audience if it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169"><span>had stayed a live service game no one asked for</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>So perhaps it’s for the best that BioWare didn’t acknowledge</span><i><span> Dragon Age </span></i><span>this year. If the company had even made a tweet or blog post expressing its love for the world of Thedas and pride in having brought it to life, the messaging would have come across as tone-deaf after the hell its team reportedly went through.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At least this way, the fans and creatives who made these games get the day to themselves, without it being co-opted by a studio and publisher that treated them like second-class citizens. Now, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team gets the final word</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p>There are so many great games out there to play but so little space on the Nintendo Switch to download them all. The system’s built-in capacity fills up quickly, especially if you prefer digital purchases. Fortunately, expanding your available space is not only possible, but simple, affordable, and officially supported. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/">Samsung’s microSDXC memory card, designed specifically for the Nintendo Switch family of systems, is currently part of a limited-time sale at Amazon.</a> The 1TB model, normally priced at $122, has dropped to just $85, giving players a substantial 30% discount on one of the best storage upgrades available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="824">Support a Massive Library of Nintendo Switch Games</h2>
<p data-start="826" data-end="1187">If you’ve owned a Switch for a decent length of time, you’ve likely hit your storage limit. Even the Nintendo Switch OLED model, released in 2021, includes only 64GB of internal storage. The original 2017 Switch offers just 32GB, and with a portion of that dedicated to essential system files, you really have only about 25GB free for games.</p>
<p data-start="1189" data-end="1601">To put that into perspective, <em data-start="1219" data-end="1262">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> comes in just over 16GB. That’s a reasonable file size compared to blockbuster games on other platforms, but on a Switch, it takes up a significant chunk of your available storage all by itself. Two or three larger games can easily fill an entire console, forcing you to constantly delete and redownload titles as you want to revisit.</p>
<p data-start="1603" data-end="2132">This is why a large-capacity microSD card is almost mandatory. By adding the Samsung microSDXC card, you expand your Switch’s storage by up to 1TB. That’s more more than 30 times the internal space of the base model system. With that much room, you can download huge first-party adventures, tons of indie favorites, and even bulky third-party releases without worrying about shuffling files around. For most players, it’s enough space to last for years.</p>


<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">The Samsung 1TB microSDXC card delivers read and write speeds of up to 180 MB/s, which is more than sufficient for the Nintendo Switch. It’s reliable, fast, and optimized for smooth performance while launching games or transferring data.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">And we haven’t even talked about the best part yet. This SD card has Shadow the Hedgehod on it. This whole lineup of Samsung microSDs features a Sonic character. The 128GB model is marked red with Knuckles, the 256GB one marked orange for Tails, and the 512GB card is accented blue with Sonic. And then at the full 1TB, we have the ultimate lifeform himself in black—Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">It’s inherently very silly to me to put anything remarkable on the outside of a microSD card designed for the Nintendo Switch. That’s mainly because you’ll look at it once, pop it into your console, then never look at it again. I guess you can rest easy knowing Shadow is looking after your digital copies of <em>Super Mario RPG</em> and <em>Snipperclips</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2706" data-end="3132">Do note that this microSD card is&nbsp;<strong>not compatible</strong> with the newly released Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires faster read and write speeds that you can find on an express microSD. This particular lineup of microSD cards are, however, still compatible on any of the first generation of Nintendo Switch consoles. This includes the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch Lite, and the Nintendo Switch OLED.</p>
