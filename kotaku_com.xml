This reimagination is now structured to fit the way people play on mobile, making it effortless to enjoy in short bursts. It’s what audiobooks wish they were.” Okay, <em>Disco Elysium </em>is apparently covering ground the entire audio storytelling industry can’t, according to ZA/UM. Havel also says:</p><p>“Mobile players deserve deep, story-rich experiences, like <em>Disco Elysium</em>. With profound respect for the original’s artistry and meaning, we move forward as both custodians and creators, bringing this masterpiece to new and returning players alike.

Instead of telling me how to do a thing in a game, maybe it could just do it for me, like a more experienced friend would if they were playing with me. Maybe the Copilot can show my kid how to grow food to keep his workers from starving during the winter in <em>Overthrown</em> instead of him asking me every five minutes. </p><p>The use cases quickly snowball from there, however, and probably not in a direction Microsoft wants. Why stop at helping me control my console more easily or bypass a frustrating part of a game? Why not have the Xbox Copilot do my dailies for me and grind random encounters in my favorite JRPG while I scroll TikTok? Let the AI grind the battle pass and pop achievements. One reason not to do that might be that I don’t want Copilot spying on me and my family. Or, if it eventually becomes a paid service like it will presumably have to be in order to be financially sustainable, even the cheevos it could earn for me wouldn’t be worth it.<br></p><p>We’ll see how useful, frightening, or silly the tool ends up being once it’s out. In the meantime, Microsoft also revealed that over 1,000 games like <em>Balatro </em>are now Play Anywhere between Xbox and PC, and the number is expected to keep rising.
