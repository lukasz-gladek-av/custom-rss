              <p>Dell has built its reputation on reliable laptops that get the job done and the brand offers an incredibly wide range of options for everyday computing needs. Right now, though, there’s a deal that’s so aggressive it barely seems real: This Dell <em>Vostro</em>&nbsp;which <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4713/">is a 15.6-inch business laptop packed with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, has dropped to $699 from its typical price of $1,699</a>. That’s a <strong>63 percent discount</strong>, and honestly, Amazon is likely operating at zero margin here or possibly even taking a loss. This wasn’t even close to happening during last week’s Prime Day, which makes this deal all the more surprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4713/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Laptop for Actual Work</h2>
<p>The Vostro series is aimed at small business users/freelancers/entrepreneurs who require computers that are able to meet intensive work requirements without having to shell out for high-end consumer laptops. This model offers just such no-nonsense performance: Intel’s 13th Gen Core i5-1334U processor is at its heart with a five-core hybrid architecture <strong>consisting of a 4.5GHz up to turbo boost performance core</strong> and four 3.3GHz up to turbo boost efficiency cores.</p>
<p>The 32GB of DDR4 RAM is where this laptop stands alone among budget competitors: Most budget laptops come with 8GB or perhaps 16GB, which is sufficient for minimal web surfing but begins to grind when you have a dozen browser tabs open, a Zoom conference running and a few Office apps open in the background. With 32GB,<strong> you can have virtual machines up and running, edit giant photos, work with complex XLS files</strong> and have your whole digital workplace open without the machine grinding to a halt.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides both speed and capacity: <strong>PCIe drives read and write data significantly faster than traditional SATA SSDs</strong> which translates to quicker boot times, faster application launches and snappier file transfers.</p>
<p>What’s more, the <strong>15.6-inch Full HD 1920×1080-resolution screen refreshes at 120Hz</strong>. You’ll appreciate that 120Hz difference even if you are not a gamer. Up and down movement in documents and web pages is smoother, as is cursor motion. Eye health during long work days is taken care of by the anti-glare treatment, and 250-nit brightness is more than enough for indoor applications, although direct sunlight may be a problem.</p>



<p>Connectivity options have their bases covered with <strong>two USB-A ports (one USB 3.2 Gen 1, one USB 2.0), two USB-C ports, HDMI 1.4 for external displays</strong>&nbsp;and a standard RJ-45 Ethernet jack for wired network connectivity. Having both WiFi and Bluetooth allows connecting wireless peripherals such as keyboards and mice with stable Internet connection at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Professiona</strong>l is already installed and this offers enhanced security functionality and administration tools compared to the Home version.</p>
<p>For $599, you are receiving a configuration that would be three times that amount under a typical situation.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-qv-35a-is-nearly-40-off-roborock-clears-out-prime-day-leftovers-at-a-record-low.1329064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re tired of spending your weekends pushing a vacuum around or constantly emptying dustbins, you’re not alone. Roborock has built its reputation as the premium brand in robot vacuum technology and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/">the QV 35A model is available for just $429, down from $649 on Amazon</a>. This is an all-time low price, and here’s the kicker: <strong>Roborock has extended its Prime Day pricing exclusively on Amazon</strong> for just a few more days which means you won’t find this deal anywhere else, not even on their official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The piece de resistance of this machine is its extremely advanced<strong> all-in-one dock station that makes your vacuum maintenance-free for up to two months</strong>. Take that in for a minute: no emptying dustbins, no washing mop pads, no wrestling with tangled hair wrapped around brushes. The dock eliminates all that automatically, washing the mop pads at the finish of each cleaning cycle and slotting detritus in a high-capacity bag that you’ll simply have to change every seven weeks or so.</p>
<h2>Accuracy and Power that Actually Delivers</h2>
<p>The <strong>Roborock QV 35A has 8000Pa of suction power</strong>, which is a nice upgrade from the previous Qrevo S version. Put another way, this amount of suction allows the robot to extract embedded dirt from carpets, pick up tiny dust particles off hard floors and tackle anything from a spilled bowl of cereal to pet hair without batting an eye. The <strong>dual spinning mops rotate at 200 RPM and applies consistent pressure</strong> to scrub away stuck-on messes rather than just pushing dirty water around like some competing models do.</p>



<p>What makes this model unique (and this is very specific to Roborock) is the <strong>anti-tangle brush system</strong>: If you’ve ever had a robot vacuum, then you understand the pain of turning it upside down every several days to hack away at hair that is bound up around the roller. Roborock has redone the brush design to positively prevent tangles in the first instance by deploying a series of rubber fins and very specifically angled bristles that direct the hair straight into the dustbin rather than wrapping up around the mechanism.</p>



<p>The intelligent obstacle avoidance employs sophisticated LiDAR navigation and reactive AI to <strong>map your living space with accuracy and avoid common obstacles</strong> such as charging cables, shoes and pet toys. Whereas simple infrared sensors merely bounce off walls, this device makes a detailed 3D map of your room, learns your floor plan with time and even recognizes specific rooms for localized cleaning.</p>
<p>The <strong>auto-mop washer function kicks in between floors</strong> and at the completion of every cleaning cycle so that the mop pads remain clean and do not just redistribute dirty water from floor to floor. The chute employs freshwater to clean the pads, and then at high rpm, they are spun to extract excess water. Your floors are dry sooner and that damp or musty odor that can build up with perpetually moist mop heads is averted.</p>
<p>At $429, you are getting technology that is regularly in the $600-1,000 bracket, and with the Prime Day sales extension running off the clock, this is the time to snap it up prior to the full price resumption.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-jackery-1500w-power-station-at-a-record-low-no-more-winter-power-issues-2000636942</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-jackery-1500w-power-station-at-a-record-low-no-more-winter-power-issues.1328947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter power outages are becoming more frequent and unpredictable and leave households scrambling for backup solutions when the grid goes down. Portable power stations have surged in popularity as<strong> reliable alternatives to noisy gas generators</strong> and they provide clean, quiet electricity for appliances during emergencies.</p>
<p>Jackery offers models with varying capacities to suit different needs, but the <strong>Explorer 1000 model</strong>&nbsp;is the sweet spot for most households: It delivers serious power (1500W) without breaking the bank, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">Amazon just dropped it to $429, down from $799</a>. This all-time low makes it the <strong>best value in Jackery’s lineup</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1500W Output Powers Essentials</h2>
<p>The <strong>1500W continuous AC output with 3000W surge peak</strong> ensures this power station will power devices cheaper units can only aspire to. Space heaters, refrigerators, medical equipment such as CPAP machines, and window air conditioners use a high amount of wattage and the Jackery Explorer 1000 doesn’t disappoint. The surge capacity is also important since appliances require a power surge to boot up, such as refrigerator compressors that may require 2 to 3 times running watts to initiate. That <strong>3000W buffer guarantees that your device actually boots up</strong> rather than triggering overload protection and shutting down the power station.</p>



<p>The 1070Wh LiFePO4 battery bank capacity<strong> equates to about 8 to 10 hours of operating your refrigerator</strong> and preserve food during extended outages. <strong>You can recharge laptops 12 to 15 times</strong>, light LED bulbs for days, or power a CPAP machine for nights. The LiFePO4 chemistry is a great upgrade to the standard lithium-ion batteries used in cheaper power stations: The cells are more intrinsically safe with better thermal stability, so they’re much less likely to catch fire and go into thermal runaway. They also last much longer, with Jackery projecting this unit for over 4000 charge cycles with 70% original capacity.</p>
<p>Emergency<strong> charging from 0 to 100% within one hour is provided by ChargeShield 2.0 technology</strong> upon activation through the Jackery app. This charge rate is simply unbelievable because most power plants of this scale take 6 to 8 hours to completely charge. The system defaults to a 1.7-hour charging time to maintain the utmost battery life, which is still incredibly fast. When during winter storms electricity may flash on for an instant, that instant recharge ability allows you to refill in a flash before the next blackout hits.</p>



<p><strong>Seven outlets altogether provide any piece of equipment you may want to use</strong> during an emergency. Three pure sine wave AC outlets enable you to supply clean power safe for sensitive items such as medical equipment, laptops, and newer appliances with digital controls. The cheap generators’ modified sine wave power will kill these items or cut their life short. Two 100W Power Delivery fast-charge USB-C ports will power new laptops and tablets at full speed without the inconvenience of clunky power adapters. There is one USB-A port to charge old devices and a provided DC car port powers whatever takes a 12V car adapter.</p>
<p>At only 23.8 pounds with a collapsible handle, this power station is extremely lightweight considering its size. You can carry it in one hand and transfer it from room to room or pack it in a car for camping or tailgating adventures. The LED lights along the front act as emergency lighting during a blackout, so you won’t have to use other flashlights or lanterns.</p>
<p>At $429, this power station offers fantastic peace of mind at a cost that aligns with most budgets. Winter blizzards don’t announce their arrival with polite timing, and standby power available makes the difference between weathering an outage in comfort or huddling in the dark.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell Goes 4x Cheaper Than a MacBook, Now Listing Its Windows 11 Pro 1TB Laptop for Nearly 70% Off]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-goes-4x-cheaper-than-a-macbook-now-listing-its-windows-11-pro-1tb-laptop-for-nearly-70-off-2000636937</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell has earned its reputation for building business-grade laptops that balance performance with durability. The company rarely discounts its machines by more than 20-25% on its official site, and maintiens premium pricing that reflects the quality. Amazon changes that equation by pushing deeper discounts that Dell would never advertise directly: Right now, the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4854/">with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and a touchscreen display just hit an all-time low of $779, down from $2399</a>. That’s a <strong>68% discount on a laptop with specs</strong> that typically cost a lot more, and it comes with <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> pre-installed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4854/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intel 10-Core Processor Delivers Real Performance</h2>
<p>The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor <strong>boasts 10 cores divided into 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, boosted up to 4.6GHz</strong>. The hybrid design saves intensive workloads for the performance cores and executes background workloads on efficiency cores, keeping you responsive even when you’re multitasking with many apps. Intel’s 13th generation is marked by major efficiency gains over 12th gen which also equals improved battery life and reduced heat under load. Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics <strong>allow for light gaming, video editing at 1080p, and multi-monitor configurations</strong> without an additional GPU.</p>



<p>The 32GB of RAM is a blessing for whoever uses memory-hungry programs or has many programs opened at the same time. It gives you sufficient space to use virtual machines, deal with massive photo albums, use gigantic spreadsheets or use professional software suites like Adobe Creative Suite (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-photoshop">like Photoshop, etc.</a>) without running into performance constraints. Most laptops in this category come with 8GB, so this 32GB option is a massive plus that makes the laptop still useful for several years to come.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD offers plenty of room to save with read and write that makes the whole system stay responsive: The<strong> apps start in seconds, files save immediately, and the notebook boots Windows 11 Pro in less than 10 seconds</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen with 1920×1080 resolution</strong> provides crisp images with exact touch response that renders Windows 11’s touch-enhanced interface completely functional. Anti-glare coating diminishes reflections and eye fatigue over prolonged use, and the broad viewing angles maintain colors and brightness even while the device is used sideways. The <strong>60Hz refresh rate creates everyday tasks smoothly as well</strong>. Dell’s ComfortView software also diminishes the blue light emission, without the orange color cast some blue light filters include.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro includes enterprise functions such as BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, group policy support and Hyper-V virtualization that Windows 11 Home does not have. Such features are worth it to business users or anyone who requires professional-level security and management features. <strong>Microsoft’s integration of Copilot AI</strong> provides intelligent help in Windows itself, assisting with work, research, and productivity.</p>
<p>At $779 for all of these features, this Dell laptop provides performance and build that would be twice or triple the price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/formula-1-cars-are-selling-for-pennies-lego-offloads-remaining-stock-during-the-austin-gp-2000636932</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/formula-1-cars-are-selling-for-pennies-lego-offloads-remaining-stock-during-the-austin-gp.1328878/</guid>

              <p>Formula 1 fans know the thrill of collecting memorabilia, but official F1 merchandise usually comes with hefty price tags. LEGO sets tied to racing deliver that collecting satisfaction while giving you something to actually build and display. With the Austin Grand Prix happening today, LEGO is capitalizing on the F1 buzz by dropping this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/">6-pack of collectible F1 race cars to an all-time low of $20 on Amazon, down from $29.</a> That works out to just over $3 per car which is ridiculous pricing for official LEGO F1 builds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mystery Box Format Offers Collecting Thrill</h2>
<p>The <strong>collection includes 6 randomly chosen mini F1 cars</strong> from a total of 12 different models, and every box is an opening surprise. The roster includes real 2024 F1 teams such as <strong>Red Bull’s RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, and Haas</strong>, along with an F1 car and F1 Academy car. Every model comes with the unique livery and color of its team, right down to the exact team logo and sponsor decals that immediately identify them with anyone who’s a sports fan. The surprise is that <strong>you don’t know what six you’re receiving until you open the box</strong>&nbsp;which introduces the aspect of collecting that kids and adults alike find actually fun.</p>
<p>Every vehicle has a team-specific helmet inside the cockpit, mimicking the actual drivers’ equipment. The wheels even spin, so they are not just for show. Children are able to roll them over surfaces and set up their own racing, re-creating passes and duels they’ve watched on television. The spinning wheels are just a little detail, but it makes these go from flat-out collectibles to toys that invite make-believe play and storytelling.</p>



<p><strong>With 174 pieces in total across all six cars</strong>, the build complexity is exactly between the ages of 6 and older. Each individual car is probably 10 to 15 minutes to build, so they’re all good fast builds without consuming hours of build time. Each car costs about 29 pieces, sufficient to make comprehensible F1 forms with the characteristic halo cockpit cover, front and back wings, and aerodynamic body style that are trademarks of contemporary Formula 1 design.</p>



<p>The small size makes them perfectly aligned to be displayed on bookshelves, desktops, or shelves without taking up much space. Display the six of them to present a miniature grid setup, or combine them with other Lego F1 sets if you are collecting a massive collection. The size is perfectly aligned for dioramas or race environments if you prefer to customize your own display. As the total of 12 cars is available in the full set, there is a clear accomplishment goal completionists are striving for, and double-trading with friends provides a social collecting aspect.</p>
<p>For die-hard F1 enthusiasts who don’t want to expend vast sums of money on diecast models or clothing, this set provides official branding and proper team representation for pennies compared to the cost. As LEGO, it’s something with wide appeal across the board to everyone from young children just getting into F1 to older adult fanatics who are collectors of racing memorabilia. At $20 for a half-dozen cars, <strong>it’s the most affordable means of getting official F1 team merchandise since Austin’s GP puts people in racing mode</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-mini-pcs-apple-quietly-clears-stock-of-the-latest-mac-mini-at-a-new-record-low-2000636927</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-mini-pcs-apple-quietly-clears-stock-of-the-latest-mac-mini-at-a-new-record-low.1328863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple has a reputation for keeping prices locked at full retail, especially on their latest releases. The company never discounts anything directly which makes finding deals on new Apple hardware feel like spotting a unicorn. That’s why the current situation with the 2024 Mac Mini is worth your attention: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">just dropped the latest 256GB M4 model to $499, down from $599</a>, and this is the lowest price we’ve seen on Apple’s newest compact desktop. For this level of performance in such a compact package, there’s really no point looking at Windows alternatives right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance That Matters</h2>
<p>The M4 chip in this <strong>Mac Mini features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU</strong> which means serious computation from an object that’s hardly larger than a coaster. Apple’s chip design means these cores operate differently than standard Intel or AMD processors. The CPU is divided between performance and efficiency cores and uses heavy tasks such as video or 3D rendering on the performance cores and background tasks on efficiency cores without draining power and heat.</p>



<p>The total 16GB of RAM comes into play here as Apple’s architecture divides RAM between the GPU and the CPU instead of having independent ones like in the ancient machines. The <strong>system dynamically allocates memory</strong> depending on what you’re doing in this integrated manner so 16GB is more than enough compared to the same in the case of Windows. You can trim 4K video, have several creative programs open at once, or seriously multitask without the system bogging down. The <strong>256GB SSD offers speedy storage</strong> that’s light years ahead of the hard drives still found in value PCs.</p>
<p>This Mac Mini <strong>coexists nicely with Apple’s ecosystem</strong> in ways Windows mini PCs don’t: The Continuity features allow you to begin writing on your iPad or iPhone and resume where you stopped on the Mac Mini. AirDrop shares files from one device to another in an instant and hassle-free process. You can use your iPhone as a webcam for FaceTime, reply to messages directly from your desktop or even use your Apple Watch to control your Mac by unlocking it.</p>



<p>Wired Gigabit Ethernet is the standard with you getting to enjoy wired network speeds that blow WiFi for massive file transfers or streaming video. WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless connectivity is also available on the Mac Mini. Port alternatives are also ample with various <strong>Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports</strong> providing up to 40Gbps data transmission speeds, up to 6K resolution support for external displays, and speedy charging of devices. <strong>Two USB-A ports</strong> are included for legacy peripherals, and the headphone port is capable of driving high-impedance headphones to provide high-quality audio without an attached DAC.</p>
<p>Its small size allows it to <strong>vanish on a desk or be screwed behind a monitor</strong> with a VESA adapter. It is only 7.7 inches by 7.7 inches and 2 inches in height, occupying less space than most external hard drives. The <strong>fanless design makes it silent to operate</strong> which is ideal for recording studios, bedrooms, or offices where fan noise becomes irritating.</p>
<p>Priced at $499, this Mac Mini offers performance that would run much higher in a run-of-the-mill desktop or mini PC of this size. If you’ve been waiting for Apple to budge on pricing, this is as good as it gets.</p>
