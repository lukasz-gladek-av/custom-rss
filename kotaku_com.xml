            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget laptops usually force you to compromise on something important whether that’s skimping on RAM, settling for slow storage or accepting some dim screen that strains your eyes. <strong>HP’s 2025 laptop breaks that pattern by packing 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U</strong> processor into a package that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/">currently offers for $799, slashed from the typical $2,999 price</a>. This 73% discount is an all-time low and brings professional-grade specifications to a price point where you’d normally find an entry-level machine with half the memory and storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Workloads</h2>
<p>The base frequency of the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U is 2 GHz with <strong>up to 4.5 GHz turbo, 8 cores, and 16 threads for powerful computing</strong> that will make short work of even the most demanding applications. This multi-core architecture is great for running parallel workloads such as video encoding, 3D rendering, or virtual machines. With 16 threads, the processor can support twice as many simultaneous operations as it has physical cores, meaning smoother multitasking when you’re working with dozens of open browser tabs along with office and productivity programs in addition to background applications.</p>



<p>The 32GB of high-speed RAM includes generous headroom for memory-intensive workflows that would choke on the 8GB or 16GB found in most budget laptops. Professional software like Adobe Creative Suite, statistical analysis tools, or development environments utilizing multiple running containers all benefit from this expanded memory capacity. You can keep numerous applications active simultaneously without experiencing the slowdowns that occur when systems run out of physical RAM and resort to slower disk-based virtual memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes via a 1TB PCIe SSD which affords rapid boot times and near-instant application launches compared to traditional hard drives or even older SATA SSDs. PCIe solid-state drives connect directly to the motherboard through high-speed lanes that enable transfer rates often exceeding 3,000MB/s, meaning large file operations complete quickly rather than devolve into progress bar watching sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>display is a 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen that operates at 1920×1080 with IPS technology</strong> so colors are accurate and viewing angles are wide. The micro-edge design minimizes the bezels around the screen to create a more immersive viewing experience and makes it feel larger than its actual diagonal measurement. Touch functionality adds another input method that feels natural for certain tasks like scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, or interacting with the touch-optimized interface elements under Windows 11.</p>
<p>For $799, this laptop is priced lower than many mid-range options, yet has specs typical of laptops costing between $1,500 and $2,000. The 73% discount places it in the unusual position of actually getting you legitimately premium components at budget pricing, not the other way around, where you pay premium prices for budget hardware.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-roadmpa-renegades-star-wars-2000644453</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2%E2%80%98s-roadmap-is-still-missing-as-it-tries-to-dig-out-from-under-its-worst-year-ever.1354348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Edge of Fate</em> was supposed to be a bold new foundation for <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future</a>. Instead, it was the beginning of the decade-old sci-fi shooter’s most disappointing stretch yet. Back in September, Bungie promised a roadmap laying out the vision for the live-service MMO in the year ahead. Two months later, the plans are still in flux. Bungie now says it won’t be ready to reveal what <em>Destiny 2</em> looks like moving forward until early 2026. In the meantime, it’s scrambling to engineer a 180 with its upcoming <em>Star Wars </em>expansion.</p> <p>“As we continue to act on your feedback, we’re taking additional time to craft our long-term strategy for the future of <em>Destiny</em> before we share a full State of the Game and multi-year roadmap next year,” the studio revealed this week. It treated fans to what it’s called a new “Content Calendar” instead. No big ideas. No major overhauls. But it did preview everything fans can expect from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-star-wars-renegades-lightsaber-x-wing-ash-iron-2000624489">December 2 <em>Renegades</em> expansion</a> and its first significant update.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Destiny 2: Renegades Content Calendar has been published.</p> <p>We need more time for the roadmap, plain and simple. Expect a true Roadmap, and State of the Game, next year.</p> <p>Again, many apologies. <a href="https://t.co/fw9R49MriX">https://t.co/fw9R49MriX</a> <a href="https://t.co/eKkSURkpjE">pic.twitter.com/eKkSURkpjE</a></p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1989091556884889623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The big takeaways? All players will be able to hit the new Power cap just by playing <em>Renegades</em> activities, vault capacity will go up to 1,000 slots to accommodate all the new loot, and all Exotic Armor ornaments can now be swapped between gear of the same class and slot, giving a big boost to <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s fashion meta. The seasonal Dawning, Iron Banner, and Call to Arms events will also be returning. Any lapsed players probably have no idea what to make of Bungie saying stuff like “Vanguard Alerts will bring back some Nightfall vibes,” but long story short: <em>Renegades</em> should hopefully cut a lot of the grindy bullshit <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415">fans faced in <em>Edge of Fate</em> back in July</a>.</p>

 <p>Here’s Bungie’s brief postmortem on what feels like <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s least played, most panned expansion since launch:</p> <blockquote><p>With <em>Edge of Fate,</em> we presented a different vision for the future of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards.</p> <p>Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was the wrong path for <em>Destiny</em>.</p> <p>Even if our execution had been perfect, and we see plainly that it was not, it is clear that grinding Power will never be a substitute for earning a trophy. Climbing though throwaway tiers en-route to the gear you want to build around isn’t aspirational. And the Portal itself surrenders too much of <em>Destiny</em>’s feeling of place and exploration. These lessons, and many others besides them, have been taken to heart by our team over the last three months.</p></blockquote> <p>I have no doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097">Bungie has taken</a> all of the negative feedback to heart. I imagine this has probably been one of the toughest stretches, purely in terms of morale, in the game’s post-launch life. But it remains to be seen if the studio can still engineer a way out of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s 2025 nosedive. The challenge, as ever, is in how you make doing the same stuff over and over again still feel fresh more than a decade later. Maybe you can’t. Or maybe<em> Destiny 2</em> just needs a humble back-to-basics reboot, at least for its progression and weekly grind. I’m still rooting for it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheat-sheet-crafting-guns-ardb-wiki-2000644449</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> is dense. That happens to be part of why I love it so much. But there’s no way around it: There’s a lot of stuff to keep track of in this game, from craftable materials, to weapon mods, to the weapons themselves, not to mention quick use items and your augments and shields. It feels endless sometimes–especially given that we so often interface with them one item at a time while we pick ‘em outta random bins or lockers we’ve broken into, or scavenge them from the innards of mechanical menaces we’ve shot down (or biological ones).</p> <p>That’s where cheat sheets and other resources come in. <i>Arc Raiders</i> has been out for a couple of weeks and already there are a bunch of fantastic user-made tools out there.</p> <p>Whether your preference is for images, spreadsheets, or websites, I’ve tracked down a few impressive and wildly useful resources to help you break down the game. Some of these address very specific parts of the sandbox of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ toys, while others are more comprehensive. Let’s take a look.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders </i>Database: The GOAT</h2> <p>Let’s kick things off with what I think is currently the best third-party resource for looking up info and tracking your progress as you collect your way to supremacy. Enter <a href="https://ardb.tools/"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Database</a>. Ardb.tools really is a one-stop shop for details on just about any item, map, and even enemy you’d need information about. Looking for a specific resource? Each item gets its own page, complete with all the info you need including locations on each map where you might be likely to find it. You can also directly compare the stats of guns and their various upgrade tiers. It rocks.</p>

 <p>There’s not much else I can say about it other than to encourage you to head on over and start clicking around. The tricky thing with these websites is that they’re only as good as their information is relevant, and as a live-service game, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a moving target for these kinds of projects. But for now at least,</p>

 <p>this is perhaps the most comprehensive and thorough third-party resource for <i>Arc Raiders</i> thus far, and I also think its UI is very well done. Bookmark it; let it live on a second screen, or use it on your smartphone.</p> <h2>A more comprehensive weapon breakdown</h2> <p>As I said in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">my weapons overview</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a tricky game to figure out metas for. There are so many ways to enter and leave a match, and so many ways to get into or out of trouble, that simple DPS or TTK stats only give you one part of the picture of an <i>Arc Raiders</i> gun battle.</p>

 <p>But if you want a deep dive, all the way down to headshot multipliers and how many shots it takes to kill someone, have a gander at <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/personal/4c1e78b900b3bf5d/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9253d3f8-679e-4b41-90be-f4f0e67f74f8%7D&amp;action=default&amp;redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0VmalRVNUtlWjBGTGtMNzA4T1pfZFBnQmtXbXRMNW52dS1NLUZvdllUdTRIWFE_ZT1zeVR6WGU&amp;slrid=f660d9a1-f07e-0000-17be-eeccdf68937c&amp;originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0lRRDQwMU9Tbm1kQlM1Qy05UERtZjNUNEFaRnByUy1aNzd2alBoYUwyRTd1QjEwP3J0aW1lPWNQemV1YlVqM2tn&amp;CID=e5a5ee82-eb40-4380-a467-656d8059d225&amp;_SRM=0:G:39">the Anvil Community’s Weapon Metrics spreadsheet</a>.</p> <p>As an .xlsx, you can even download the <a href="http://spreadsheet.it/">spreadsheet</a>. Clearly, it will work better in Excel or Microsoft’s live office tools. I’ve been able to download it and add it to my Google Drive, and it seems to work alright. The tabs on the bottom of the page refer to shield strength, so it will recalculate TTKs based on what your target is potentially wearing.</p>

 <p>This information might be wildly subject to change given <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ live-service nature, but for now, it’s one of the only ways to drill down to specifics such as headshot multiplayers and specific numbers of shots-to-kill.</p> <h2>Just the crafting resources</h2> <p>Two resources stood out to me when considering a cheat sheet focused entirely on resources (in addition to the excellent PDF/PNG cheat sheet I shouted out in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">my inventory management guide</a>).</p>

 <p>First up is the humbly named “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">Scrap” Google spreadsheet</a>, created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">by Redditor s1munsayz</a>. This is a very simple spreadsheet laying out all of the crafting resources you can recover, with a simple layout of what they can be recycled/salvaged into. Resources like ARDB are amazing, but a straightforward spreadsheet is sometimes a better visual learning aid.</p> <p>Be sure to make your own copy in your Google Drive to use its search functions appropriately.</p> <p>I also want to shout out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1otpx0o/inventory_manager_manage_your_inventory_easier/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Redditor Legal_Squash_195’s</a> “Inventory Manager,” a standalone Python app you can <a href="https://github.com/dev-boog/Arc-Raiders-Inventory-Manager">download from Github</a>. You’ll need to have Python installed on your machine to get it to work, but it’s a handy app–and if you’re like me and enjoy a good standalone, community-created piece of software, Inventory Manager is pretty awesome.</p>

 <h2>Honorable mention: arcraiders.wiki</h2> <p>While I think ARDB takes the cake with its vast amount of options, <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/">arcraiders.wiki</a> was an early resource for me and it remains a solid way to sort through and look up the nature of various crafting materials, weapons, enemies, and maps.</p> <hr> <p>Time will tell how useful these resources remain over time, especially as <i>Arc Raiders</i> continues to get updates and potential changes to its meta math under the hood. For now, bookmark, download, do whatever you need to, because having these resources at the ready dramatically improves the overall flow of a healthy session of <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p>
