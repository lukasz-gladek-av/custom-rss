              <p>Apple’s A16 iPad has never really gotten the love it deserves. With brand-new Air and Minis also being released in 2025, along with killer competitor models from Samsung and even the Kindle Scribe, the A16 (aka 11th Gen) iPad might have gotten short shrift in the praise department. But that’s just creating a great buying opportunity, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">the 11-inch A16 iPad is marked down by $50 right now at Amazon, down to just $300</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the wide gulf between the price point of the A16 iPad compared to the elite-level tablets from Apple and its competitors, this $300 Amazon deal is a major score, because the performance and features gulf is nowhere near as large. Many of the features of the higher-priced tablets also exist in the A16 iPad, and at a literal fraction of the price.</p>

<h2>Goldilocks Tablet</h2>
<p>The A16 iPad sits in the perfect spot between elite-level features and great price. It easily outperforms other accessibly priced tablets, working smoothly and reliably for games, streaming, and everyday productivity chores like email and browsing. And it does it without the hefty price tag of the top-tier tables which may deliver more of a laptop-like performance, but at a laptop-level price. Not too expensive, not too chintzy with the features — it’s just right.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be an iPad if it didn’t have that super-primo display. It’s an 11-inch Liquid Retina with 2360×1640 resolution and True Tone tech that detects the ambient lighting and automatically adjusts the color temperature. It not only looks incredible, but it’s easier on your eyes. Pair that screen with the Wi-Fi 6 connection and excellent camera setup (12MP in both front and back), and the A16 iPad is a great tablet for FaceTime calls and video conferencing. Apple’s new Center Stage tech also keeps you centered in the frame, automatically adjusting the view as you move.</p>



<h2>Expansion Options Galore</h2>
<p>Another smart tablet-buying tactic: Take some of the money you’re saving by opting for the A16 iPad and invest in an Apple Pencil (1st Gen or USB-C; not the Apple Pencil Pro) and Magic Keyboard Folio and transform the tablet into a mini-laptop and premium note-taking device. All the tools for creative work are already built into the A16 iPad; adding the Apple Pencil is a great way to complete the package.</p>
<p>I like to call the A16 iPad the unsung hero of the iPad family. It checks off so many boxes while keeping the price tag exceptionally accessible despite often flying under the radar. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon’s current $300 price is a jackpot for anyone looking for a super-steady tablet.</a></p>
