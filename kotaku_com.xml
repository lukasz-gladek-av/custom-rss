According to Kojima’s post, he liked the film’s animated opening segment and seemed to enjoy the sequel’s “meta-perspective.” </p><p>“In the [film’s] trial that follows, the question of his multiple [personalities] is argued from beginning to end. Is the Joker Arthur? Is the Joker another personality (his shadow)? Who exactly is Arthur? This revelation eventually transforms into a meta-perspective,” he said on Twitter.  </p><p>“In the previous film, <em>Joker</em>, was it really Joker who captivated audiences around the world? Or was it Arthur? This question is constantly raised to Lee and even to the people of Gotham City within the film. We live in an age of mass production of ‘poetic justice’ heroes, a battle between good and evil. Lately, many spin-off films with a focus on the villains have been made. Can villains be superheroes too? Is this question posed on the big screen as a DC movie, too avant-garde? Was it the Joker that audiences around the world loved? Was it Arthur? This is where the reviews have diverged.”</p><p>Kojima suggests that over the next “10 or 20 years” the <em>Joker 2</em>'s “reputation” will change as well as future superhero flicks. </p><p>“It may take some time for it to become a true ‘folie à deux.’ But there is no doubt that everyone in the audience loved Joaquin and Gaga in this film,” concluded Kojima. Will someone check back in on this post in 10 years and ping me to see if people love <em>Joker 2</em> by then? Cool, thanks! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While I’m sure there are plenty of games that folks already have their eyes on, there’s always a bunch of smaller games that inevitably fly under the radar. I’m here to correct that for you. </p><p>To that end, Xbox is currently hosting a sale on titles published through the ID@Xbox brand, which benefits independent developers and publishers trying to get their own games out there. One such publisher is Annapurna Interactive, which accidentally wound up taking up most of this list. Whoops! Anyways, here’s just a few of the best games available on that sale, <strong>which concludes on November 14. </strong><br></p></div></div><div><p>The last few years have brought with them a veritable bounty of wonderful puzzle games, and few of them are as good as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cocoon-review-puzzle-steam-switch-limbo-inside-1850883069&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cocoon-review-puzzle-steam-switch-limbo-inside-1850883069"><em>Cocoon</em></a></span>. An entirely wordless game, <em>Cocoon</em>—developed by a team that previously worked on games such as <em>Inside</em>—follows a bug-like protagonist’s odyssey through several different worlds within worlds, divining how to interact with distinctly alien structures and technologies to commune with while perhaps overthrowing some hostile force. <em><strong>Cocoon </strong></em><strong>is currently $12.49 and is well worth that price of admission. </strong><br></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ashen-is-a-dreamier-dark-souls-1830985170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ashen-is-a-dreamier-dark-souls-1830985170"><em>Ashen</em></a></span><em> </em>is one of the best indie attempts at a <em>Souls </em>game. It is restrained and quiet. It is elegant and magical. It is all these things and simultaneously thoughtful and somber. But more than any of that, it is about home. It accomplishes so much while remaining a visual feast with striking minimalist graphics art direction. <strong>You can play the game solo or cooperatively, and I really do encourage you to grab a partner and dive into </strong><em><strong>Ashen</strong></em><strong>, which will run you about $10 right now.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>The best people in your life believe that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654"><em>Outer Wilds</em></a></span><em> </em>is the best game of 2019. How can they be wrong? This space-faring adventure posits a simple but intriguing mystery: What waits for us at the center of the universe? The game fully delivers on that promise (and then some), but the best part of the game is the journey it’ll take you on. The solar system of <em>Outer Wilds </em>is teeming with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-haunting-discoveries-of-outer-wilds-1837299985&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-haunting-discoveries-of-outer-wilds-1837299985">mysteries</a></span> and as you bounce from planet to planet in search of answers, you’ll learn of what a rich tapestry you belong to—even as the whole system implodes in a supernova every 22 minutes. It is simply one of the most heartfelt stories I’ve ever experienced, wrapped up in one of the most astounding puzzle games I’ve ever played too. <strong>I’d hate to give too much away about <em>Outer Wilds</em>, so instead you should just pick it up while it’s discounted to $15 and thank me later.</strong></p></div><div><p>A lot of the reason for my love of <em>Thirsty Suitors </em>is that, as the title suggests, I too was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/thirsty-suitors/ive-got-a-huge-crush-on-jala-from-thirsty-suitors&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/thirsty-suitors/ive-got-a-huge-crush-on-jala-from-thirsty-suitors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">down bad for the main character</a></span>, Jala, the brown (specifically South Asian) alternative skater girl of my dreams. She is hilarious, hot, and most importantly, a colossal failure just like me. She too struggles with her place in two different worlds, that of her family and their cultural upbringing and the drastically different world that she was raised in outside of her home. She’s one of the most relatable protagonists I’ve encountered. And the way that she does psychic turn-based battles against her exes and overbearing family is aspirational. <strong>If you’re looking for a short RPG with a lot of fun banter, generational trauma, and some of the best style around, it’s hard to go wrong with <em>Thirsty Suitor</em>, which is available for $18 right now. </strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-remains-of-edith-finch-the-kotaku-review-1794562388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-remains-of-edith-finch-the-kotaku-review-1794562388"><em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em></a></span><em> </em>is, effectively, a short story anthology in video game form. As the titular character, you return to the immense home of the Finch family, who has supposedly been cursed, and explore what remains of them around the house. Along the way, Edith literally trips and falls headfirst into the distinctly styled tragedies of her family members, which are all rendered as unique vignettes with their own mechanics. It’s a game so good you’ll tear through it in a single evening, but the night that you spend with <em>What Remains of Edith Finch </em>will stick with you for years after you’re done with it. <strong>You can have your own fateful night with </strong><em><strong>What Remains of Edith Finch </strong></em><strong>by picking it up for $5 while it’s on sale. </strong></p></div><div><p>Demagog Studio is a small team making narrative games about the collapse of the world as we know it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golf-club-wasteland-is-a-post-apocalyptic-golf-platform-1847058499&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golf-club-wasteland-is-a-post-apocalyptic-golf-platform-1847058499"><em>Golf Club Nostalgia</em></a></span>, despite the name, is exactly one of those titles and is in fact the team’s first effort. In it, you play golf among the remains of the world following an ecological collapse. In the time since, Earth has been abandoned by the rich, who’ve fled to Mars, and you only come back to Earth to play one final game of golf and discover what the hell happened.The premise sounds pretty far-fetched, but the more that our way of life is eroded by greed, the more realistic a vision of our future it appears to be. <strong>You can bear witness to the existential horror of <em>Golf Club Nostalgia</em> for yourself for just $2. </strong></p></div><div><p>Here’s the greatest endorsement I can give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sayonara-wild-hearts-the-kotaku-review-1838219679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sayonara-wild-hearts-the-kotaku-review-1838219679"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a></span>, a rhythm action game from 2019: I do not skip any of the tracks that emerge on my shuffle all these years later. At times, I even live with a song or two as if I’m listening to them for the first time, enthralled by the propulsive set pieces of the game they’re wrapped in. “Parallel Universes” is just one of my favorite songs in any game ever, but it’s surrounded by bangers like “Begin Again” and “Night Drift.” I can’t even begin to write about what “A Place I Don’t Know” means to me without welling up.<br></p><p><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts </em>is like an interactive pop album. If that doesn’t sell you on the game in which you ride motorcycles, cars, flying swords, and even a dragon through neon-soaked fantasy environments, well then hopefully <em>this </em>sentence did. <strong>You can pick up </strong><em><strong>Sayonara Wild Hearts </strong></em><strong>for just $7.79 and you won’t regret it.</strong><br></p><hr><p>There’s a lot of different experiences to choose from here. If I had to narrow it down to make it easier for you all, <em>Outer Wilds </em>is one of my all-time favorite games. It features a stirring narrative, a wonderful central mystery, a score that’ll bring you to tears, and best of all, a horror-themed expansion that came out a few years later, in case you’re still in the mood for some scares. <em>Outer Wilds </em>has got it all.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well we have all the info you need to go into season two.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-recommend-id="image://5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="950" data-height="535" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-recommend-id="image://5ea1426854f2b37a9085f687a4764e4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="950" data-height="535" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jinx holds up a shark-shaped rocket launcher, preparing to fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Great question! We have no idea! Season one didn’t really wrap up any of the larger conflicts at play in the world of <em>Arcane</em>. Instead, it left things on the precipice of all out war. To that end, Jinx launched a rocket directly into the chambers of Piltover’s ruling council. That leaves a lot of major players from season one with a big question mark over their heads. Jayce, Mel, and Caitlyn’s mother Cassandra are all within the council at the time. Trailers for season two have kept the fallout of this attack underwraps but Caitlyn appears on the warpath, so it is likely her mom was a casualty of the attack. Whatever the death toll is revealed to be, you can be sure this battle will be the match that lights the powder keg of season two.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central conflict around which all of <em>Arcane </em>revolves is the growing tension between the cities of Piltover and Zaun. The former is a thriving city full of wealth and technology and home to people like Caitlyn and Jayce. The latter is an undercity beneath it that is a relative slum in comparison to the grandeur of Piltover. Due to the constant pollution of Zaun it has become the home of the poor and disenfranchised, which also means crime runs rampant. As a result, Piltover heavily polices the area and has created a major class divide. This is where Vi and Jinx grew up.</p><p>Season one saw these class tensions come to a head in a huge skirmish on the streets of Zaun that ended with the death of de facto leader and crime lord Silco. Season two teasers tell us that the production of the drug Shimmer is still occuring in Zaun, even without Silco, so Caitlyn and a group of Enforcers are coming in to put an end to it all. I’m sure nothing bad will happen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While <em>Arcane </em>is a tale of two cities, it is even more a tale of two sisters. Vi and Powder (who grows up to be Jinx during the events of season one) are the heart of the show. Act one of season one focused on the pair’s upbringing in Zaun, which ended in their separation with Vi thinking Powder was dead and Powder being taken under the wing of Silco. The rest of the season revolved around Vi’s attempt to save her sister (now going by the name Jinx) from the influence of Silco.</p><p>That didn’t end up working out and by season one’s end Vi had come to terms with the idea that Jinx is no longer her sister. Season two positions their final confrontation as the main event, with Vi even admitting her sister is gone and that only Jinx remains. Along with Caitlyn, she’s ready to take down Jinx no matter what. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At the start of season one Caitlyn is shown to be a Piltover citizen whose heart is in the right place, even if she doesn’t understand the realities of the world. As a rookie enforcer she wants to uphold justice and the law, but quickly finds after teaming up with Vi and falling into the city’s larger conflict that no side is without blood on its hands. Vi opens her up to the humanity of Zaun’s inhabitants, while betrayals from crooked enforcers above her show her that maybe this isn’t all black and white. Even after the final skirmish of season one, Caitlyn seems like a person who truly wants to change the relationship between Zaun and Piltover to change for the betterment of both sides.</p><p>Of course if her mom is dead that changes things. Season two already looks to put Caitlyn on the warpath, but grief may be blinding her temporarily. With the council attacked, Caitlyn seems to be something of a leader for the city now, and Jinx has fallen into a similar role in Zaun. Maybe the two will still find a way to overcome the cycles of violence their cities have been stuck in for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mel’s mother played a relatively small part in <em>Arcane </em>season one, but that will likely change in the final season. When she arrived in Piltover, Ambessa quickly showed herself to be a cunning political and military mind who is very interested in guiding the city in a way that benefits her. Specifically she wants in on weaponized Hextech, the technology Jayce invented. With the council potentially out of the way, Ambessa is in a great position to grab control of Piltover, which would only mean bad things for the relationship between it and Zaun.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>League of Legends</em> is full of magic wielders, but <em>Arcane </em>has almost none in its first season. The closest thing we have is a mysterious mage saving Jayce in his youth as well as the understanding that Hextech is essentially using science to harness magical potential. Throughout season one, Viktor’s experiments with Hexteach leaned closer and closer to unlocking the mysteries of the arcane. With the promise that <em>Arcane</em>’s end will open the path for more<em> LoL</em> adaptations in the future, it’s a pretty sure bet that these loose ends will be tied up soon. This show is called <em>Arcane </em>after all.</p><hr><p>The final season of <em>Arcane </em>will air on Netflix in three acts. With the first releasing on November 9, the second on November 16, and the third on November 23.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
