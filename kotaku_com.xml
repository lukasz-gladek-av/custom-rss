              <p>Ridley Scott is one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ridley-scott-movies-ranked-gladiator-ii-1851701914">most prodigious directors</a> working in Hollywood right now. Every movie studio seems content to lavish him with massive budgets no matter how tenuous the pitch. But the filmmaker behind <em>Blade Runner</em> and other classics has grown unimpressed with what everyone else around him is producing. ‚ÄúThe quantity of movies that are made today, literally globally‚Äìmillions. Not thousands, millions,‚Äù he said during an interview this weekend. ‚ÄúAnd most of it is shit.‚Äù</p> <p>The choice comments came during a retrospective on his career at the BFI Southbank in London, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/ridley-scott-hollywood-drowning-in-mediocrity-1236570875/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a>. Scott, whose 2024 blockbuster <em>Gladiator II</em> at one point featured a mostly green-screened sea battle within a colosseum with massive sharks, lamented that too many bad films are ‚Äúsaved‚Äù with digital effects added in post-production instead of relying on solid scripts.</p>

 <p>Scott was asked if he has any movie comfort foods. Why yes, yes he does: his own movies.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I watched Alien with his commentary last night and every other scene he said something along the lines of ‚Äúdamn that‚Äôs good‚Äù or ‚Äúit hasn't aged at all‚Äù and I just nodded in agreement every time. <a href="https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj">https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj</a></p> <p>‚Äî Barto (@bartonovopolis) <a href="https://twitter.com/bartonovopolis/status/1975050651299426475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúWell, actually, right now, I‚Äôm finding mediocrity‚Äìwe‚Äôre drowning in mediocrity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd so what I do‚Äìit‚Äôs a horrible thing‚Äìbut I‚Äôve started watching my own movies, and actually they‚Äôre pretty good! And also, they don‚Äôt age.‚Äù</p>

 <p>He continued, ‚ÄúI watched&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk</em>&nbsp;[<em>Down</em>] the other night and I thought, ‚ÄòHow in the hell did I manage to do that?‚Äô But I think occasionally a good one will happen, [and] it‚Äôs like a relief that there‚Äôs somebody out there who‚Äôs doing a good movie.‚Äù</p> <p>It‚Äôs unclear if he went on to mention what those ‚Äúgood ones‚Äù are. It would be hard to top 2023‚Äôs <em>Napoleon</em>, after all. Scott‚Äôs next movie is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller called <em>The Dog Stars</em>. It‚Äôs out March 2026.</p>

              <p>Any creator that wants to be taken seriously needs to start focusing a lot more on their audio. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your doing simple vlogs from your couch or conducting those man-on-the-street styled videos. Your viewers, whether they are conscious of it are not, are going to notice your sound quality. Cheap audio reduces the production value of your work, even more so than poorly shot or low quality video does, at least in my opinion. The good news is that it‚Äôs easy to take your audio up from sounding bad to sound pretty good. The DJI Mic Mini is a wireless lavalier microphone that is easy to use and far from expensive.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/"> It normally goes for $60, but right now, Amazon has it listed for 29% off. That saves you $17, bringing the price down to just $42 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable on You and in Frame</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini is an ultra-light miniature wireless transmitter that can be worn comfortably and is aesthetically pleasing on camera.</p>
<p>This mini microphone for creators can be placed on the speaker‚Äôs person in three different convenient ways. It can clip onto the collar of their shirt as well as the inside of a button-up. You can choose to magnetically adhere it. Just slap the mini clip magnet behind the shirt with the DJI Mic on the front. And then lastly, you can use a simple lanyard and have it hang around the speakers neck like a necklace.</p>
<p>All you need is the one transmitter. When fully charged, it has a maximum operating time of up to eight hours. That should give you plenty of time to record interviews, selfie videos, on-stage events, or whatever it is your looking to capture.</p>



<p>The mic utilizes intelligent noise cancelling at two separate levels. The basic mode is made for indoor settings that are relatively quiet but still has some background noise that‚Äôs better off removed. Strong mode is ideal of outdoor noisy environments where you really need to separate the sound of your person speaking from the crowds.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini uses an algorithm to makes sure the audio it picks up is good to use. It‚Äôs automatic limiting feature will lower the volume on its own if it detect audio input is too high. This can help prevent clipping.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/">For a limited time, you can grab the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier for the reduced price of just $42. Save $17 and upgrade your audio recording today.</a></p>

              <p>OpenAI launched its new generative AI video tool, called Sora 2, last week, alongside a TikTok-like social media platform where invite-only users could share <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-sora-2-videos-pokemon-spongebob-dragon-ball-2000631137">all of their favorite copyright-infringing nightmare fuel</a>. There was Mario racing from the cops and Goku fighting the hero from <em>One-Punch Man</em>. But the 9-second clip I can‚Äôt get out of my head is an AI-generated <a href="https://x.com/SHL0MS/status/1973959800754217190">Sam Altman barbequing Pikachu</a> before munching on a slice of the beloved Pok√©mon mascot like it‚Äôs seared tuna.</p> <p>Nintendo and other companies have yet to comment on OpenAI‚Äôs latest legal minefield, but Altman is already backpedaling on Sora 2‚Äôs initial free-wheeling, anything-goes, copyright-holders-be-damned spirit. The company recently announced a change to how the tool is structured so that companies have to ‚Äúopt in‚Äù for users to get Sora 2 to generate videos using that company‚Äôs IP, where previously they had to ‚Äúopt out‚Äù for it <em>not </em>to do so. OpenAI will also be setting up some sort of payment system to give companies a fraction of the revenue generated from their IP-adjacent slop.</p>

We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them. But we want to apply the same standard towards everyone, and let rightsholders decide how to proceed (our aim of course is to make it so compelling that many people want to). There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn‚Äôt, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration.</p></blockquote> <p>He also specified that Sora 2 users were producing a disproportionate amount of meme clips using anime and video game characters. ‚ÄúIn particular, we‚Äôd like to acknowledge the remarkable creative output of Japan‚Äîwe are struck by how deep the connection between users and Japanese content is!‚Äù</p>

Disney, Warner Bros. and other major media companies are already suing competitor Midjourney over the ease with which its users can generate rip-offs of <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, and<em> Batman</em>. Meanwhile, publishers like<em> IGN </em>owner Ziff Davis and <em>The New York Times</em> are suing OpenAI <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/14/nx-s1-5258952/new-york-times-openai-microsoft">over unauthorized copying</a> of their online archives to train its algorithms.</p>

 <h2>What is Nintendo saying about generative AI?</h2> <p>So far, however, most video game companies have have yet to cut deals with OpenAI or accuse it of theft. The notoriously litigious Nintendo recently called a report from a Japanese politician stating that it was lobbying for AI protections untrue. ‚ÄúContrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI,‚Äù the Switch 2 maker <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220">announced over the weekend</a>. ‚ÄúWhether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.‚Äù</p>

 <p>While companies have stayed silent about how they‚Äôre dealing with potential infringement concerns, most are happy to advertise their ambitions to use new generative AI tools to try and streamline production. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/over-50-of-japanese-game-companies-use-ai-in-development-according-to-tokyo-game-show-organizer/">According to a recent survey</a>, roughly half of Japanese game studios are already using some form of AI in game development. Microsoft, an early backer of OpenAI, is one of the technology‚Äôs loudest proponents, though the results so far have been meager at best. When it comes to gaming in particular, the tech giant has rolled out <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">AI chatbots</a> for game help, and is experimenting with quick prototyping of gameplay.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou could imagine a world where, from gameplay data and video, that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,‚Äù&nbsp; Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit">said earlier this year</a>. Who knows if that will ever actually happen? For now we have fake footage of <a href="https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1973152115259482575">Master Chief in <em>Mario Kart 8</em></a> instead.</p>
