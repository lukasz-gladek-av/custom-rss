            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s another new trailer! Look, I’m not going to pretend at professional distance here: I am extremely excited about next month’s new TV series, <em>Alien: Earth</em>. And each new trailer gives me more reason to be. But this isn’t because I think the <em>Alien</em> franchise is some surefire hit generator—goodness gracious it isn’t—but because it’s from Noah Hawley, and I suspect it’s going to be really, <em>really </em>weird.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,197589" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Noah Hawley is perhaps best known for his TV reinterpretation of the Coen Bros. movie <em>Fargo</em>, but the reason I’m so thrilled he’s behind <em>Alien: Earth</em> is because of his 2017-19 show, <em>Legion</em>.</p><p>It’s hard to convey <em>Legion</em>’s brilliance in words, given so much of this unique take on the world of superpowers existed in the most astonishingly vivid visual flourishes. It was also the most extraordinary take on what was, after all, an X-Men story, despite never uttering those words, nor even alluding to the wider franchise. The story of David Haller (Dan Stevens), the schizophrenic son of Charles Xavier (although he is never named either), explored his attempts to come to terms with his powers and his mental illness, accompanied by the unknowable reality of Aubrey Plaza’s Lenny, all while being pursued by the astoundingly sinister Amahl Farouk (Navid Negahban). It was like nothing else on TV. (The above is a genuine scene from the TV show, not a compilation or trailer. It was this fantastic.) And <em>that</em>’s why I’m so hyped for <em>Alien: Earth</em>.</p><p>Hints of the possible weirdness have appeared throughout the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional campaign</a></span> for the series, not least a full three minutes of a cat’s eye view of a Weyland-Yutani ship:</p><p>But somewhat less overtly, there have been multiple trailers featuring shots so distinctive from Hawley’s shows; sparse, symmetrical spaces, intercutting shots of idyllic nature with barren, metallic greys. There’s so much potential here for headfuckery, peculiar flashbacks/forwards that can sit unexplained for episodes at a time, and visual flare that will speak far more potently than the scripts.</p><p>Or, of course, it could be terrible. No one knows yet. But I have such high hopes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..">Last month we had a trailer</a></span> that stopped holding back and introduced us to the idea that the the Weyland ship that crashes into an North America’s Prodigy City isn’t just carrying a Xenomorph, but at least four other alien species. One of them looks like a Metroid. Another is the cutest little evil octopus.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-recommend-id="image://b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-recommend-id="image://b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We also learned that this 2120-set show, taking place a couple of years before the events of the original 1979 <em>Alien</em> film, has a program in which human consciousnesses are transferred into synthetic bodies, and throughout the earlier trailer, there were hints that this will cause issues for those minds: perfect Hawley territory for unreliable narration and ambiguity over reality.</p><p>This latest trailer at first seems to be something of a best-of of what’s come before, but in fact subtly moves ideas forward a step. The young girl whose mind is transferred into a synth body—she’s not questioning her humanity. The alien creatures we know have escaped on board the crashed ship? We now see their eggs, their victims, and a whole lot more blood. And most of all, if you’re me and geeking out about this, we see a constant flip-flopping between sci-fi metallic horror and comfortable, Earthly bucolic nature. Right up until that final shot, the incredibly subtle yet striking image of a Xenomorph lit by natural light.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When did you last see a Xenomorph lit by natural light?</p><p>Oh, and talking of progression between the trailers, we need to talk about the poor goat. The left side of the picture is how it appeared last month, the right side how it appeared today:</p><figure id="" data-id="7fccfefe0aaf55905a60c7a49576de83" data-recommend-id="image://7fccfefe0aaf55905a60c7a49576de83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two shots of the same goat, rather worse for wear in the second." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two shots of the same goat, rather worse for wear in the second." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fccfefe0aaf55905a60c7a49576de83" data-recommend-id="image://7fccfefe0aaf55905a60c7a49576de83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two shots of the same goat, rather worse for wear in the second." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are so many questions. Not least, based on this being set two years before the original movie, you’re forced to wonder how much was known about the Xenomorphs ahead of Ripley’s first encounter in 2122. Now, forgive me, because I’m no expert in this franchise (obviously <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are masterpieces in their own distinct ways, but the rest of the movies really don’t bear all that much scrutiny in my opinion), but I’ve tried to piece this all together. And for the record, the <em>Alien Vs. Predator</em> movies are not canon, as Ridley Scott made sure of by the story he told in <em>Prometheus</em>.</p><p>2012's <em>Prometheus </em>was set in 2093, at which point it’s made clear that Xenomorphs are yet to exist. <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, released in 2017, is set in 2104, just 16 years before this TV show, and now—as a result of experiments with fungal spores on an alien planet—it seems they do. But they’re nowhere near Earth, and it’s unclear whether or not anyone could have reported back about them. The next chronological movie is <em>Alien</em>, which of course was not created to be part of some enormous franchise spanning the timeline in either direction, and so gave no thought to where or why the Xenomorphs existed. But it <em>does</em> reveal that the as-yet unnamed corporation had deliberately sent the Nostromo out to encounter the aliens.</p><p>So, this all suggests that <em>Alien: Earth</em> is going to explain how Weyland-Yutani knew to go look for the buggers: they literally encountered them on the planet’s surface. That’s quite a twist! It also leaves huge questions about those other four species! Why have we never encountered any of these again in the <em>four</em> other films that take place after <em>Alien</em>? Obviously <em>Aliens</em> takes care of itself, in its own contained story, but what about <em>Romulus</em>? That’s set on a Weyland experimental ship, but here they’re only focused on the Xenos. And sure, the more we can forget <em>Alien 3</em> and <em>Alien Resurrection</em> the better, but the latter is set another 200 years later on and <em>still</em> doesn’t suggest other lifeforms are out there.</p><p>It’s obviously tempting to just say, “Dude, who cares? It’s a sci-fi story and they’re just making shit up as they go.” And yes, that’s absolutely true. But people take canon and continuity <em>really</em> seriously, especially in nerdcore like this. It would, I think, be a bit lazy to set a TV show in such a crucial moment in the mythos’ history and act like what comes next isn’t important. It seems very unlikely that’s the plan. Hence why it’s so interesting to speculate!</p><p>The show is going to be on FX and Hulu, starting August 12 with two episodes. After that, it’ll come out on a weekly schedule, like TV used to in the olden days, with eight episodes total finishing on September 23.</p><p>Clearly I’m way too excited for it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-tv-series-trailer-scott-1851786549]]></content:encoded>

This sound was attached to hundreds of videos on my feed before I ever actually saw one of these dolls, but now that the trend has broken containment, I see one of these little guys everywhere I look. Though Labubu were initially just dolls like any other, they’ve seen an uptick as a fashion accessory in the past couple of years, with Lisa, one of the members of K-pop group Blackpink, being cited as one of the major trendsetters who’s sparked the brand’s worldwide success.</p><p>Lisa has been considered one of the first trailblazers for the brand ever since she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted photos of herself sporting a Labubu keychain on her bag</a></span> on social media in April 2024, and then other huge celebrities followed suit. Artists like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dua Lipa </a></span>have also been spotted with these little monsters hanging off their bags, and over the past year the dolls have exploded in popularity. It may seem like Labubu is an overnight success, but the dolls have been in production for a decade. The brand was introduced in 2015 under the company How2Work, based on a character design by artist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasing Lung</a></span>, who illustrated children’s books with the company. The brand had another surge in popularity in 2019 when it started collaborating with Pop Mart, a Chinese blind box store. All of this was a perfect storm for Labubu to become not only a worldwide phenomenon, but the kind of collectathon craze that rivals something like <em>Pokémon </em>cards. How do you make something desirable? Make it harder to find. It’s also made unboxing videos a popular viral trend as people try to track down the rare “secret” doll in a blind box.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The craze has grown so much that Labubu is now collaborating with some huge brands.

I’ve played over 100 hours, and he still keeps me on my toes — and a much tougher version is coming next month.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,195502,196773" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Bandai Namco confirmed the next batch of Everdark Sovereigns will join <em>Nightreign</em>’s weekly rotation starting July 31. “A new Everdark cycle shall begin; the enhanced Nightlords Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will soon unleash their darkest powers upon Limveld,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1946208540416168293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1946208540416168293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the publisher announced on Friday</a></span>. Unlike the first rotation, which only included three, there will be four this time around, though the final boss, Night Aspect, is clearly being saved for later. </p><p>The first Everdark Sovereign was Gaping Jaw, who basically spent the entire fight in a frenzied state, continuously attacking over and over with few openings and a giant thundercloud that starts popping halfway through the encounter. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-gaping-jaw-everdark-sovereign-1851784820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-gaping-jaw-everdark-sovereign-1851784820">He kicked players’ asses</a></span>, and the subsequent Everdark Sovereigns haven’t been nearly as hard. I’m looking forward to finally seeing the FromSoftware ramp the difficulty up again, even if it seems like Equilibrious Beast, also known as Libra Creature of Night, won’t be arriving until around mid-August. </p><p>I’m also beginning to sense a bit of fatigue among existing <em>Nightreign</em> diehards. My friends and I have been taking a break recently after getting the Platinum Trophy on PS5 and killing all the existing Everdark variants. While it’ll be nice to have a reason to come back, I think we’re reaching the point where <em>Nightreign</em> needs more substantial additions to keep players invested. Those might include completely new maps, changing up the current loot and enemy pools, or new classes. Hell, it would even be neat, if terrifying, to see a new mode start throwing multiple bosses at players in the same fight, something that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-finds-a-new-way-to-victimise-players-as-nightfarers-accidentally-fight-2-bosses-at-once-they-were-convinced-i-was-just-being-dumb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-finds-a-new-way-to-victimise-players-as-nightfarers-accidentally-fight-2-bosses-at-once-they-were-convinced-i-was-just-being-dumb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a few have already encountered via online network errors</a></span>. </p><p>None of that needs to come right away. We’re still just a couple months out from launch. But the fundamentals of <em>Nightreig</em>n are so strong that I hope FromSoftware continues to cook with it. Fans are still waiting on a promised duos mode and the recent patches have been mostly just minor bug fixes. Hopefully, that energy is going toward a bigger update by the end of the summer or beyond. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568]]></content:encoded>
