              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647"><em>007: First Light,</em></a> the next game from the development studio behind <em>Hitman</em>, is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC in March 2026, as revealed during Sony’s latest State of Play.</p> <p>On September 3, <a href="https://kotaku.com/james-bond-state-play-wolverine-god-war-sony-showcase-2000622073">as previously announced</a>, Sony and IO Interactive showed off over 30 minutes of <em>007: First Light</em>, giving us our first real look at gameplay following some <a href="https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647">teasers and trailers.</a> And at the end of the showcase—which featured Bond sneaking around, killing people, driving various vehicles, and causing mayhem—IOI revealed that <em>First Light</em> is launching on March 27, 2026 on all platforms.</p> <p>Here’s a new gameplay trailer of Bond in action:</p>  <p>Of course, because in the year 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675">all games must have expensive pre-order versions and early access bonuses</a>, if you pre-order any version of the game digitally, you get to play 24 hours “early.” <a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame">What is more shocking is the $300 special collector’s edition</a> of <em>007: First Light.</em> This pricey package includes a physical copy of the game, some digital goodies, and a replica Golden Gun, as well as gold bullets and a stand to display them with. Seems a bit odd to include such a classic Bond prop in a game that, seemingly, has nothing to do with that era of the franchise, but hey, what do I know?</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-makers-of-hitman-are-working-on-a-new-james-bond-ga-1845713628">First announced back in 2020</a>,<em> 007: First Ligh</em>t is the long-awaited next game from IO Interactive, and it tells the tale of a younger James Bond as he completes some of his first missions. It’s been a long five-year wait for fans of <em>Hitman</em> who are hoping that <em>First Light</em> will play a lot like Agent 47’s franchise. In today’s State of Play reveal, it did indeed seem like this is very much a <em>Hitman</em>-style game, with multiple options for infiltrating areas and a big focus on stealth and problem-solving. However, the gameplay in the presentation also had moments that were marred by some nasty performance dips and a lot of motion blur. Hopefully, <em>007: First Light</em> looks better and runs well when it arrives on Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p>
