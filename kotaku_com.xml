But as time has passed without even a whiff of a PS5 update, some have lost hope. Now, Sony has hit back with the perfect troll that can be read as a either a sign of fresh hope or the final nail in the coffin for the FromSoftware franchise’s future. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Sony could have chosen any game to end the montage on—<em>The Last of Us</em>,<em> Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>—and any vague sentiment—love, friendship, action, adventure—to leave players with. Concluding with <em>Bloodborne</em> and its fans’ relentless calls for more <em>Bloodborne</em> was certainly a choice. </p><p>Some have called using a 30th-anniversary celebration to target <em>Bloodborne</em> sickos “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1863626399568785857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1863626399568785857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pure evil</a></span>.” “Someone at PlayStation woke up and chose violence today,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Hazz3r/status/1863602943246647347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Hazz3r/status/1863602943246647347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another.

Will the notorious 30fps action game finally get a 60fps mode on PS5? Could fans be in for a full-blown remaster with a PS5 Pro enhanced mode like <em>Demon’s Souls</em> received? Or maybe this is just a knowing wink at a community with a penchant for grandiose speculation and perennial disappointment. </p><p>There have been more rumors than usual flying around following a particularly intriguing coincidence. The December 3 anniversary, an easter egg for which seemed to be teasing more announcements <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-state-play-30th-anniversary-sony-playstati-1851696796&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-state-play-30th-anniversary-sony-playstati-1851696796">in a recent PS5 slim trailer</a></span>, also happens to be when <em>Bloodborne</em> servers go <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1m2pi/bloodborne_servers_are_undergoing_maintenance_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1m2pi/bloodborne_servers_are_undergoing_maintenance_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">down for scheduled maintenance</a></span>, which was first announced several weeks ago. Probably nothing, right? Right?</p><p>It’s never been exactly clear what the hold-up is, given the <em>Dark Souls </em>spiritual spin-off’s critical acclaim and sales success (7.5 million copies sold by last count). FromSoftware made it, but Sony owns the rights. Maybe neither party can agree on what it would take to bring the game into the future nearly a decade later. Bluepoint Games, which made the <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Demon’s Soul</em> remakes, felt like an obvious candidate to work on an update but is reportedly in pre-production for its own original IP. </p><p>Whatever the case may be, <em>Bloodborne</em> fans will never give up. Sony’s acknowledgment of that fact means we’ve just entered a brand new phase of “<em>Bloodborne</em> remake when” chants routinely breaking out on social media and PlayStation showcase livestream chats.

Is it because the game is a few days away from launching on December 6?

Or is it just because my relationship with <em>Overwatch </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897">has grown so cold</a></span> that I’m willing to seek comfort in the warm embrace of another hero shooter? Yes to all of the above, but it’s not what’s fueling my newfound hype; it’s the anime OP-ass launch trailer NetEase put out over the weekend.</p><p>The trailer doubles as both a launch trailer and a reveal of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">final five heroes</a></span> joining <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ launch roster. Iron Fist, Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger (think Ice Climbers from <em>Smash Bros. </em>with two characters being one playable entity), Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine will all join the line-up of 33 heroes pushing legally distinct payloads. That’s all well and good, and I’ll probably give comic-accurate short king Wolverine a try, but what I’m most excited by today is how NetEase and vocalist Chrissy Costanza created the kind of hero showcase music video you only see in front of an anime that makes you believe in the power of friendship. Costanza’s vocals on “Rivals ‘Til the End” soar over action-packed scenes of Marvel’s greatest heroes doing hero shit. All the cool team-ups—like Hulk throwing Wolverine and Magik teleporting Psylocke up the side of an exploding skyscraper—are sick, but every cool moment is elevated by how good the song is. It’s peak anime opening, and I hope it plays when you boot up the game, because you will not catch me skipping it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196880" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Luckily, all this excitement isn’t unfounded.

I picked the PS2 theme, and not only did it add all the abstract blue and green objects from the PS2 boot menu to my PS5's dashboard, it also changed all the colors in all the menus and added PS2 menu noises to everything. I didn’t realize until swapping between the different themes how burnt into my brain some of these old PlayStation noises are and how much nostalgia I had for them all these years (decades?!) later. </p><p>However, the big star of this update, in my opinion, and why you should boot up your PS5 as soon as possible is the newly added OG PlayStation 1 boot-up video and sounds. When I restarted my PS5 console after confirming the update and installing it, I was greeted with the techno-operatic and very loud chime of the classic PlayStation boot-up logos, complete with the echo fade out of metal clinking. </p><p>Here’s what the logo looks and sounds like via a phone recording from me: </p><p>I half expected <em>Twisted Metal </em>or <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> to start playing after all the noises had subsided. Later, when I turned off the console to write this post, the PS5 had even updated that screen to add a little message thanking me for playing over the last 30 years. </p><p>Weirdly, while this stuff is rad and awesome, Sony says that it’s just temporary and eventually it will go away. I’m not sure why Sony would remove this stuff from PS5 as it’s a nice way to acknowledge the past and let people enjoy their expensive consoles a bit more. But what do I know? Anyway, if you want to get on this PlayStation nostalgia, don’t wait too long to boot up your PS5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Early classics included the original PC versions of<em> Resident Evil </em>and <em>Diablo</em>. <em>Warcraft I</em> and <em>II</em> are also part of the DRM-free program, and despite being removed from the storefront later this month, GOG says it will still continue to make sure players’ existing copies are updated moving forward. </p><p>“Once a game joins the Program, we pledge to maintain its compatibility even if it gets delisted from the store,” a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new announcement</a></span> from the company reads. “This means that owners of those titles can still expect a seamless experience and tech support for those titles. This also considers potential changes in Windows OS that may impact games’ playability.”</p><p><em>Warcraft I</em> and <em>II</em> will both be removed on December 13th “at the publisher’s request,” GOG notes, meaning that Blizzard, now owned by Microsoft, is requesting GOG stop selling the $15 bundle of ‘90s-era strategy games, presumably because it just released its own remasters for $25.
