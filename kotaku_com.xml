              <p>We’ve cruised on past Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days. If you missed out on Amazon’s huge Fall savings event that stretched from October 7 to October 8, we have good news. You don’t have to wait for Black Friday to start saving some cash again. There are some great deals active right now across Amazon despite the Prime event having ended. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/">Like right now, you can snag this mini PC for 33% off. The Geekom Mini PC AX8 Max has dropped down from $749 to just $499 for a limited time</a>. That discount ends up saving your a solid $250.</p>
<p>Taking a peak at this mini PC’s specs, we’re looking at an AMD Ryzen 7 capable of up to 4.9GHz alongside an AMD Radeon 780M graphics card. It’s got 32GB of RAM and a 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD. If that’s not enough to store all your files, videos, and games, the SSD slot is expandable up to 4TB.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This mini PC can run in three different modes depending on your needs in a given moment. Normal mode is just that. This default is balanced for versatile performance, great for when using office applications or video and photo editing software. Quiet mode can be set when you want to reduce power consumption and noise. Good for late night studying or light office work. Then we have performance mode. This pushes the hardware to its limits to optimize for AAA gaming.</p>
<h2>Why Go Mini?</h2>
<p>A mini PC offers a nice in between option for anyone who can’t decide between a laptop or tower PC. It’s compact in size as not to take up a ton of desk space. It can be a great option for anyone trying to keep a clear desk or optimize the space they’re working with. You don’t have to give up an entire shelf or your foot space under the desk for a solid piece of hardware.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also work great as a secondary computer or multimedia player. Sure, most TVs manufactured today already come with smart features built-in and apps like Hulu or Netflix available to download, but there is still value in choosing a mini PC for your home theater over your TV’s factory UI. For one, they are a full-on Windows computer so they support a much wider array of video formats. This is great setting up a PLEX server or for playing videos you have locally that have been acquired by perfectly legal means.</p>
<p>Similarly, a mini PC makes for an excellent retro gaming machine. ROMs for older gaming consoles need hardly any processing power and a mini PC can be set up to run them all, or at least, all of the ones you have acquired by perfectly legal means.</p>

              <p><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will reach its first birthday at the end of October, giving cause for everyone to look back at the last year and wonder at how it <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-shinedust-trade-token-1851786369">still</a></em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-shinedust-trade-token-1851786369"> hasn’t managed to figure out a workable version of trading</a>. However, with an update due to arrive in time for the anniversary, there are about to be some slight improvements to trades, as well as a new ability to give away spare cards to your friends.</p> <p>Of course, this being&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, it can’t just be a nice simple feature that lets you toss a bunch of dupes to your buddy who’s trying to fill in gaps in their collection. Come the new update, you’ll be allowed to receive one card a day, and only up to 4-diamond rarity (as in, no better than a basic ex). Woooooo. We can hand each other our bulk in the slowest way possible. Bizarrely, this new feature is being called “Share,” although there’s no sharing involved: You don’t get to keep the card after you hand it over—it’s what we humans call “giving.”</p>

 <p>Slightly better is an improvement to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-tokens-broken-feature-1851753735">continuously dreadful trading in&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em></a>. So determined is The Pokémon Company that no third-party money should be able to change hands when organizing trading that it’s ensured it’s all wildly slow and frustrating to use, and until now has only been available for low-rarity cards. The best you can trade right now are the 1-star cards, or what the real-world sets would call Illustration Rares. But after the next update, trading will include 2-star cards (Special Illustration Rares), and 1- and 2-shiny star cards (Shiny Pokémon). Sadly, 3-star cards (the animated Immersive cards) and crown-marked cards (Golds) still won’t be available to trade, and neither will the damn Promos.</p>

  <p>A couple of other tweaks are coming. Wonder Picks will now start to deliberately include cards that are missing from your collection (although they’ll still make you beg, with a one-in-five chance of actually getting the card you want). It’s also going to slightly simplify Flair, by which you add special twinkly effects to your cards, and no longer require you to spend shinedust to apply them—given shinedust is now required for trading, that surely ensured no one was ever bothering with Flair anymore, likely prompting the change.</p>

 <p>And that’s it. It’s a pretty paltry range of improvements for a game that <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">still hasn’t addressed some of its most egregious faults almost a year later</a>. Of the 10 issues I listed last year as being most in need of fixing, a somewhat demoralizing 10 of them remain exactly the same. Instead, with the botched addition of trading, the list of issues has only grown far longer.</p>

 <p>For what it’s worth, the best solution for trading I’ve found so far is a mobile app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.poketrade">PokeHub</a>. It lets you create shareable lists of cards you’re after, and look through others, arranging trades and sharing in-game details with strangers. And it works really well—while you’re still stuck with&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em>‘s abysmal one-trade-at-a-time system, people on the app want super-fast exchanges, so you can swap out a bunch of cards at a fair pace. And no, no money changes hands at all.</p> <p>It would remain far better if&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> just implemented a similar system itself, given it would keep players within its walls and doesn’t involve any elements that would be frowned upon by the developers. It’s bewildering that it hasn’t already happened, and speaks to a situation in which TPCi seems more scared of <em>Pocket</em> than proud of it. It’s certainly bringing in enough cash to fund any improvements/castles they could wish for, but instead everything is so tentative and cautionary, and ultimately reeks of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">gacha greed</a> instead of player happiness.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP’s 2025 Intel N150 Laptop Bundle Is Back in Stock at Almost 80% Off as Amazon Looks to Extend Prime Day’s Hottest Deals]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hps-2025-intel-n150-laptop-bundle-is-back-in-stock-at-almost-80-off-and-its-not-refurbished-2000634011</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Amazon was celebrated Prime Big Deals Days which had extended from October 7 to October 8. It was a great two-day stretch of time to find yourself some excellent savings on just about anything from kitchen appliances to apparel to tech. Had you been hoping to score a new laptop for yourself, but somehow missed the sales event, all is not lost just yet. You can still find some fantastic laptop deals across the website. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/">Like right now, this HP Intel laptop designed for students and businesses dropped its price by a staggering 76%. Amazon has the full price listed at $1,500, so after the discount, it comes down to just $365.</a> That’s a savings of $1,135.</p>
<p>Now before you get too excited, know that this discount — while good — isn’t enormous as it seems. Lots of Amazon sellers tend to jack up the list price of their offerings and then mark the product back down so that it can be labeled with a huge discount. The specs on offer here would really never justify a price of $1,500. The new $365 price tag is a much better reflection of what you’re getting. Still a great value though.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With this 2025 HP laptop, we’re looking at an Intel N150 four-core, four-thread CPU alongside an integrated graphics card. You’ll have solid performance browsing the web and even doing some light photo or video editing. It’s working with 16GB of RAM and a storage capacity of 128GB.</p>
<p>The screen measures in at 14-inch, keeping it compact and portable to easily fit into any bag on your way to and from class. It displays in slightly above 720p at 1366 by 768 pixels. The HP True Vision 720p web camera and dual-array digital microphone allow you have crystal clear video calls, even in low light conditions.</p>



<h2>Bonus Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Included with the laptop is a set of added accessories to get you going. The HP 2025 laptop comes with a wireless mouse and CD/DVD drive which pretty much no laptop comes with on-board any more. You get a 256GB SD card which effectively triples your storage capacity. Then we also have Windows 11 Pro pre-installed as well as a one-year license to Microsoft 365 which will grant your access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel and all the other Microsoft Office apps. Plus that comes with OneDrive so you can save files to the cloud and access them from any device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/">For a limited time, you can get the HP laptop with all these additional accessories for just $365.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is just a few days away and already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717"><span>leaking all over the internet</span></a><span>, but that’s not the only leak coming out of Game Freak right now. It’s been a full year since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> revealed more information about upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games and anime, and now, the same leaker is releasing some new alleged details on even more future projects. This includes information about the 10th-generation games for the Switch 2, but also the next </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game, and a new MMO that might give some fans something they’ve been asking for for years.</span></p> <p><span>The leaks have begun circulating through </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>leak accounts, and include details and concepts for five upcoming games, and a loose timeline for the next five to six years of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> development. But keep in mind that even if these projects are at some stage of development at Game Freak, pipelines shift, ideas can be scaled back from their initial concepts, and some of these games could be internally canceled and never formally announced.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The biggest info dump is for what appear to be the Generation X games: </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Wave</span></i><span>. Game Freak is apparently targeting a 2026 launch for these games, and they will be Switch 2 exclusives. The games will be set in a region inspired by Southeast Asia, which contradicts original reports that Gen X would be based in a Greece-like region.</span><i><span> Wind</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span> will lean hard into the open-world exploration of recent games like</span><i><span> Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, with procedurally generated islands for the player to traverse. There will also be underwater areas that you can dive into and explore further. Game Freak also appears to have DLC in the works that will launch in 2027.</span></p>

The more surprising leaks are those indicating upcoming spin-offs and a new </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game. The third </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game is codenamed Ringo and will be set in the Galar region from </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This game will apparently return to the past like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> after </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s modern-day detour, and will be set 1000 years before the events of </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. Part of the game will focus on the player creating the first Gigantamax Poké Ball, which is used to capture the massive kaiju Pokémon in the Galar region. Game Freak’s pitch documents for the game liken it to </span><i><span>Xenoblade Chronicles X</span></i><span>, implying it may have real-time elements in its combat systems. This may also include boss battles against Gigantamax Pokémon, though the leaks only show concept images of those at this time.</span></p>

The game’s initial pitch documents claim it will be set in a region that connects Hoenn (</span><i><span>Ruby</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>) and Sinnoh (</span><i><span>Diamond</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>), and will allow you to travel between them alongside other players.

While knowing what might be coming is fun, the leaks also give us some insight into things that aren’t in the pipeline, despite long-running fan theories. A </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>remake is apparently not in the works at the moment, with Game Freak noting it wants the eventual project to be a thorough remake.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">From Game Freak docs:</p> <p>“Remakes made for Black and White onwards should have a lot more love and care put into them. I hope that they become good games that will allow people to enjoy eras different from the Legends series.”</p> <p>Note that currently Game Freak has no Unova remake in… <a href="https://t.co/bGKyEYh7rf">pic.twitter.com/bGKyEYh7rf</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977923383623848195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of the more maddening scrapped ideas in the leaks is that Game Freak was, at some point, considering making a </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game set in the Johto region from </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>, and would have released a pair of games rather than just one. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Ho-Oh</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Lugia</span></i><span> were going to be a historical RPG that would have explored the origins of the first Pokémon trainers. Like in</span><i><span> Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, the player would have been transported to the past from modern times. Eventually, Game Freak shelved this in favor of the modern story in Kalos that became </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. I’d like to think the team could revisit this project down the line, but now that it’s been leaked like this, that feels unlikely.</span></p> <p><span>That’s a lot to digest all at once. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>pipeline is a well-oiled machine of nearly annual releases at this point, so it’s not surprising that several projects could be in some stage of development all at once. A lot of these games sound very ambitious, so hopefully the extra year of development Game Freak got by skipping 2024 helps them reach that potential. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16, and was originally planned to launch last year, so we’ll see how much that extra development time paid off.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-bose-skullcandys-anc-headphones-havent-moved-from-that-prime-day-lowest-price-2000633363</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-bose-skullcandy%E2%80%99s-anc-headphones-haven%E2%80%99t-moved-from-that-prime-day-lowest-price.1324432/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s a deal you’ll literally be able to feel: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/">Amazon just dropped a monster post-Prime Day sale on the Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 wireless over-ear headphones, taking the price down by nearly half to just $144.</a> That’s almost $100 off the regular $240 list price, and while you might not be able to physically feel the heft that extra $100 in your wallet, you’ll most definitely feel the heavy-duty Multi-Sensory Crusher Bass sound, probably all the way down to your toes.</p>
<p>Skullcandy’s flagship over-ear wireless headphones may look similar to most other phones, but there’s nothing subtle about the powerful sound they kick out with two extra bass drivers joining the two full-range 40mm audio drivers. Use the adjustable 4-mic active noise cancellation to shut out the few external sounds able to penetrate the sonic wall of the Crusher ANC 2 headphones, and you’re fully immersed in your playlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All About the Bass</h2>
<p>When you have access to deep, heavy bass like what comes from the Multi-Sensory Crusher Bass sound of these Skullcandy headphones, you’re going to want to put it to the best use possible. Cinematic scores when you’re streaming a movie are perfect. So is a high-intensity shooter or battle royal when you use the Crusher ANC 2 headphones for gaming. EDM drops? That goes without saying — the Crusher ANC 2 headphones are absolutely perfect for those.</p>
<p>It should be noted that you’re not completely locked into blasting away with the bass at all times — you can use the Skull-IQ app to fine-tune your EQ, flip the noise cancellation into Stay-Aware mode, and completely optimize your sound with Personal Sound by Mimi. With multipoint pairing, you can connect to two devices at once and easily toggle between them without having to “forget connection” on one before pairing with the other.</p>



<h2>Sound for Days</h2>
<p>If you don’t have the Crusher ANC 2’s active noise cancellation engaged, a single full battery charge is good for a staggering 60 hours. And if you’ve let that charge dwindle and you’re about to run for the door, a quick 10 minutes of Rapid Charge gets you 4 hours of listening time. The Crusher ANC 2 headphones come with an extra 1.6-foot 15W high-speed USB-C charging cable for when you want to use Rapid Charge.</p>
<p>There are times you want to relax with a mellow playlist, and there are times you want to just shut out the rest of the world and blast away with&nbsp; good and heavy mix. The Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 wireless Bluetooth headphones are very good for the former, but they’re unbeatable for the latter. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/">And the Amazon post-Prime Day deal knocking nearly $100 from the price?</a> That’s unbeatable too.</p>
