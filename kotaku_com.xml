              <p>Geoff Keighley may not be opening a portal to hell after all. Roleplaying game fans have desperately linked <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">The Game Awards’ hell statue</a> to a new trademark application filed Tuesday and <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">reported by games publication <em>MP1ST</em></a>. A law firm <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420">filed a European trademark application</a> on Tuesday under the name&nbsp;<em>Divinity,&nbsp;</em>and the symbol in the accompanying stylized graphic certainly does look familiar.</p> <p>Two other trademark applications, showing similar imagery, were filed alongside the&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> one. One looks to be of a person tied up in a spiderweb, and the other has a striking similarity, again, to the symbol overlaid on the Game Awards statue. The trademark application for&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> categorizes it under computer game programs and video game software, as well as books, clothing, board games, and other “entertainment services.” No other information is available in the application to link the trademark to either the Game Awards statue or to <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> and&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developer Larian Studios.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Larian Studios for comment on the trademark application and its connection to the Game Awards statue. A Larian Studios representative did not mention&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>, but said: “We are releasing <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">Divinity: Original Sin 2 on Next Gen</a> but weren’t going to announce it until a bit later, so please keep an eye out!”</p>

 <p>Michael Douse, Larian Studios publishing director, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293">also posted to X addressing the rumors</a>,saying “there aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will.”</p>

 <p>Larian Studios announced in 2024 it’s working on two projects. All founder Swen Vincke would say, at the time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-next-game-excalibur-1851509450">was that one is codenamed Excalibur</a>. The studio is coming off of the massive success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, released in 2023. But before&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, Larian Studios was best known as the maker of the <em>Divinity</em> series, starting with 2002’s <em>Divine Divinity</em> and its 2004 sequel,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Divinity</em>. It’s published six different <em>Divinity</em> games, as well as expansion packs and enhanced editions of the games. The last <em>Divinity</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, was released in 2017. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">Asked about&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em> in 2024</a>, Vincke wouldn’t say anything except that whatever the studio’s next game is was “different than what you think it is,” yet “still familiar.”</p> <p>The Game Awards are just days away, so it’s unlikely that Larian Studios will say much about the trademark application or its potential link to the mysterious statue before the big show. But for many, that doesn’t matter: People are still holding out hope that there’s something more than simply an enhanced version of <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> to be announced at The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake Almost Ruined Cloud’s Sword]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-cloud-buster-sword-remake-2000651766</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>‘s Cloud Strife has two defining characteristics: he suffers from repressed emotional trauma and carries a giant sword. Square Enix almost toyed with ruining one of those when it was originally planning to develop the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">current</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129">remake</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254">trilogy</a>.</p> <p>The Ex-Soldier’s iconic Buster Sword looks like a six-foot butcher’s knife. While fans love it, the RPG publisher was worried it might not look realistic enough for the real-world aesthetic its Unreal Engine homages to the classic PS1 game were chasing. Maybe what looked good with blocky polygons back in 1997 wouldn’t fly in a less cartoony overhaul.</p>

 <p>“While making <em>Remake</em>, there was this aspect of the weight and how Cloud swings [the sword] around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know?” director Naoki Hamaguchi recently recalled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs">in an interview</a> with YouTuber Julien Chièze, according to a translation by <a href="https://x.com/ShinraArch/status/1997787393253118017/photo/1">Shinra Archeology</a>.</p>

 <p>“So at the time, when we were making <em>Remake</em>, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword,” he continued. “But it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it…in the end we stayed faithful to the OG and a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p> <p>It’s hard to know just how serious Hamaguchi is being or just how real the concerns and doubts raised in those original meetings were. Take away his Buster Sword and Cloud is just a spikey-haired emo kid slowly having a psychological break with reality. Much harder for all the fans to cosplay as during conventions.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Geoff Keighley Talks Game Awards: ‘Lots Of Games Get Sold’]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Game Awards just keeps getting bigger and bigger. While viewers sometimes complain about the marathon runtime and nitpick every game announcement trailer they don’t care about, Geoff Keighley’s year-end showcase has become the closest thing we still have to an old-school E3 marketing extravaganza. In the face of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-tgas-geoff-keighley-reviews-trailers-1851720812">annual criticism</a> about not putting the focus exclusively on the awards part of the ceremony, the host recently explained why his show is as much about recognizing art as it is about revealing big game announcements.</p> <p>“There are many different constituents that tune in,” Keighley told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible"><em>The Game Business</em></a> (a newsletter he cofounded with author Chris Dring) in a new interview. “And it is a balancing act. You correctly pointed out that there’s the awards aspect of the show, there’s the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements.”</p>

 <p>He described a virtuous cycle in which more viewership means more attention for the games being celebrated, big and small, which can in turn lead to more sales for the companies or indie teams behind them.</p> <p>“My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show,” he said. “And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they’re seen by a lot of people. Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. <em>Balatro</em> had a huge boost. So hopefully it’s a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don’t always get it right.”</p>

 <p><em>Balatro</em> was already a big sensation in the gaming world by the time The Game Awards 2024 aired, but its prizes that night <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617">helped catapult it to even bigger success</a> in the months that followed, aided in part by a popular mobile port. All of a sudden games that were big among a hardcore group are exposed to a much wider audience.</p>

 <p>Even just getting nominated can help raise visibility in that way. Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliott <a href="https://substack.com/@superhys/p-181156422">recently shared</a> the estimated sales boosts that the Game Awards’ Game of the Year contenders have received over the past few weeks. While the effect was biggest for frontrunner <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, the most nominated game in TGAs history, nominees like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> were also projected to have sold an additional 100,000 copies during the period.</p> <p>Elliott says holiday sales are also a big factor in that. That’s probably why any Game Awards winners cut their price directly after the event to take advantage of the brief spotlight.</p>
