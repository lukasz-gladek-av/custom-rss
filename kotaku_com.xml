              <p>There are two big names when it comes to video game escape rooms, and they’re remarkably similar ones. First you have <em>Escape Academy</em>, a wonderfully bonkers college for escape room artists, with a story that somehow includes murder and time travel. Then you have <em>Escape Simulator</em>, a more straight-faced collection of digital escape rooms, but with a much bigger focus on involved puzzles and deep mystery. Both are excellent, but only one of them has a sequel just released. <em>Escape Simulator 2</em> came out this week, offering even more elaborately themed rooms and even more complex challenges to solve. I spoke to developers Pine Studio to find out more about how to find the balance between emulating real-world rooms, and embracing the impossibilities afforded by video games.</p>  <p>Escape rooms, as a concept, are showing no signs of fading in popularity. On the day&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em> released, I wasn’t playing the game because I was out celebrating my birthday with my family by playing in a real-life escape room (<a href="https://tempo-bath.com/">Tempo</a> in Bath, UK—it was&nbsp;<em>fantastic</em>). And we were spoiled for choice, with more and more buildings in my local area taken over by these hands-on, locked-in puzzle chambers. A well-designed escape room is such a thrill, as you and your buddies scramble to unscramble codes, piecing together clues to cause a bookshelf to reveal itself as a secret door, then squeezing down a passage to find a hidden briefcase and new set of clues…It’s the best. But it’s also pretty pricey, and requires getting together a group of people willing to play. When that can’t happen, that’s when video game escape rooms step in.</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator</em>, released with perfect timing during the covid lockdowns of October 2021, provided a way to play such challenges when leaving the house and gathering in groups was very much a bad idea. And it was utterly splendid, a really superb collection of 16 rewarding rooms. Then came the DLC, and oh boy, there was a lot of it! In the years since, the number of rooms has reached 50, with more still to come. Given this, I wondered how a studio knows when it’s time to stop adding to their previous success and make the decision to create a sequel. “What pushed us toward&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em>,” says Boris Barbir, co-founder of developer Pine Studio, “was the chance to create much larger rooms with a more realistic look. That change opened the door to a whole new kind of puzzles that we could not do before.” That doesn’t mean they’re done with the first game, however. Remarkably, there are still new rooms in development, with Barbir noting, “We will continue supporting it for a long time.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639911" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639911"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639911">© Pine Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Part of Pine Studios’ method is to involve real-world escape room creators when developing their challenges. “For both games we worked closely with real-life escape room designers,” says Barbir. “They start by sketching puzzles on paper, then we curate, adapt, and build them into playable virtual spaces. From there we go through several rounds of testing and adjustments until everything feels right.” For the sequel, the developers had the smart idea to add another group of consultants to the process: the best community creators who had built rooms using the first game’s room creation tools. “Their input,” says Barbir, naming Zesty, Elkondo, and Sade, “helped us keep the puzzles fresh and engaging.”</p>

 <p>But obviously such designs have a delicate path to walk. With the freedom afforded by playing on a computer, these games don’t necessarily have to stick to the laws of reality, allowing for events and sequences that real-life rooms could never deliver. But then, at the same time, if they become too fanciful they can lose that unique sense of being trapped in an elaborate room and the hands-on nature of solving the puzzles. I wondered how Pine Studios approaches this balance. “We always try to keep the game true to being a simulator,” Barbir says. “Our playtests showed that players generally do not enjoy puzzles that work ‘magically’ without logic behind them. We design spaces and mechanisms that feel grounded in reality.” That’s not to say that magic isn’t a part of the games, however.&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em> begins with four puzzles set in a vampire’s castle, involving literal magic mirrors and some rather impossible spells, but there’s always a grounding rationale to their use. “The virtual world still gives us plenty of freedom,” Barbir notes. “We can build a pirate island or a zero-gravity spaceship, things that would be almost impossible to pull off in real life, but the puzzles themselves remain logical and believable.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639912" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639912"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639912">© Pine Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The community certainly became a big part of the original game. Via Steam’s Workshop feature, players were able to add their own creations to the mix, with over 4,000 rooms submitted in the last four years. A pattern Pine Studio noticed was that “a huge number of them leaned into darker, creepier or horror themes.” The same, Barbir says, is true of real-world escape rooms, with horror-themed settings proving the most popular. “In the first game we kept things light and playful,” he adds, “but with the sequel we wanted to explore that darker side.” That’s not to say this is a horror game, and there’s certainly nothing even approaching a jump scare. Instead it has a “moodier” atmosphere, still entirely suitable for younger players, but with a bit more spookiness.</p>

 <p><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> comes with a 2.0 version of its room creator, and the hope the community will get just as engaged this time around with the more elaborate tools and room sizes. Of course, that requires some time, given just how involved it is to build something worth playing. A handful have started to appear, but it’ll be in the next few months that the game’s 12 developer-made rooms will start to be joined by the best creations from players. Talking of which, how long exactly does it take for the developers to create just one room? “Some of our larger rooms,” Barbir says, “take over six months to design, test and polish before they feel ready. It is a lot of work, but the result is worth it.”</p> <p>I’d agree. I’ve played a fair few rooms in the sequel now, and they so satisfyingly scratch that escape room itch. You can play in co-op, too, to really embrace that pleasure of working as a team to crack the mysteries. And completed rooms unlock versions with even more difficult puzzles, giving a genre that’s usually very much one-and-done a reason to replay. Of course, if the previous game is anything to go by, we can expect dozens more official rooms to be added to the game over the next few years (and it’s worth noting plenty of these were free, especially the bizarre crossover packs like rooms themed around&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em> and&nbsp;<em>Among</em> Us, with other DLC adding five new rooms for around $5).</p> <p><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2/">is out now on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding an affordable cordless vacuum that actually delivers professional-grade cleaning feels impossible these days. Most budget options sacrifice suction power or build quality, while premium models from Dyson or Shark demand prices that make your wallet weep. The Shark IX141 Pet Cordless Stick Vacuum sits firmly in the mid to high-end category with its Hypervelocity suction and 40-minute runtime, but Amazon’s early Black Friday discount slashes the price from $299 to $149. This all-time low pricing positions a quality Shark vacuum at entry-level cost, which explains why over 20,000 people grabbed this deal last month alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Hypervelocity Suction That Handles Real Messes</h2>
<p>The Hypervelocity motor provides strong suction that <strong>handles everything from fine dust to pet hair on both carpets and hard floors</strong>. Shark’s bristle brushroll has self-cleaning technology that stops hair tangles, and automatically clears wrapped strands while you vacuum. This feature is essential for pet owners or homes with family members who have long hair since regular brush rolls quickly become ineffective when hair wraps around them.</p>
<p>The <strong>40-minute runtime in standard mode</strong> with no accessories gives you enough battery life to clean most homes on a single charge and this performance surpasses what many competitors provide at this price. The runtime stays consistent throughout the battery cycle, which means it doesn’t weaken as the charge runs low. <strong>Also, charging from empty to full takes about 3.5 hours</strong> which is typical for cordless vacuums in this category.</p>



<p>The LED headlights in the floor nozzle light up hidden debris that you might miss in dim corners, under furniture and along dark baseboards. These bright lights uncover dust, pet hair and dirt that blend into shadows so that you can clean everything instead of just moving mess around. The low-profile design is slim enough to fit under most furniture, reaching spots where dust bunnies gather but traditional upright vacuums cannot access.</p>
<p>The <strong>XL dust cup holds 0.4 quarts of debris</strong> and allows for several cleaning sessions before you need to empty it. The CleanTouch Dirt Ejector lets you dispose of dirt with one touch, keeping your hands clean and stopping dust from escaping into the air. This hands-free system opens the bottom of the dust cup completely, letting compacted debris fall straight into your trash without getting stuck inside.</p>



<p>Switching to handheld mode takes seconds; just remove the wand. This transforms the vacuum into a lightweight tool for above-floor cleaning tasks. The <strong>handheld version weighs only 7.5 pounds</strong>&nbsp;which makes it easy to clean stairs, furniture, car interiors, and ceiling corners without tiring. The Pet Multi-Tool has an anti-tangle conical brush bar designed to lift embedded fur from upholstery, car seats, and pet beds where hair collects stubbornly. The included Crevice Tool reaches into narrow gaps between cushions, along baseboards, and into tight corners where standard attachments don’t fit.</p>
<p>At $149, you pay half the usual price for a vacuum that competes with models priced at $250 or more, making this early Black Friday deal one of the best values for cordless cleaning.</p>

              <p>A good business (or work) laptop should ideally be portable, reliable, and fast enough to deal with everything your busy days throw at it. However, most laptops that check these boxes usually cost a ton, but that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/">Amazon is being generous with a limited-time deal on the 17-inch HP business laptop, now available for just $700 after a massive 75% discount</a>. That’s $2,100 off the original price, which is hard to ignore if you’ve been meaning to treat yourself to a powerful upgrade without blowing your budget. And as if that wasn’t enough, you also get an accessory bundle thrown in for absolutely free!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Run Multiple Applications Without Slowdowns</h2>
<p>The power this laptop packs is more than enough to handle resource-intensive apps and creative projects without slowing down. This is made possible with a 10-core Intel i5-1334U processor that can boost up to 4.6GHz for fast speeds, plus the 16GB of DDR4 RAM that makes it easy to work on multiple projects at once. If your productive days involve some serious multitasking, you’re surely going to appreciate how this laptop makes it easy to power through without frustrating lags.</p>
<p>Storage is taken care of by a 512GB SSD that gets you both fast startup times and ample file storage. It’s not massive, but it should be enough to house your important work files, plus media content like photos, videos, and even a bunch of movies.</p>



<p>The display gives you bright, vivid visuals with its 17.3-inch HD+ BrightView screen. It’s also quite easy on the eyes, whether you’re working in a dim setting or by a bright window. You won’t be left with eye strain at the end of a long day.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, plus a range of ports like 2 USB-A ports, 1 USB-C, HDMI 2.1, and a headphone/mic combo jack. And finally, the free accessory bundle includes a wireless silent mouse, a USB hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, and Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed). All of that is valued at $199, but it’s included here for free. Just keep in mind the accessory pack is shipped separately, so don’t panic if it doesn’t arrive in the same box as the laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going at a discount.</a> The offer won’t last long, so it’s best to jump in on it while there’s still time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-12-in-1-docking-station-goes-for-pennies-and-it-works-as-a-monitor-stand-too-2000640096</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-12-in-1-docking-station-goes-for-pennies-and-it-works-as-a-monitor-stand-too.1339084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk cable management is one of those daily frustrations that slowly chips away at your sanity. You’ve got charging cables snaking across the surface, USB dongles competing for space, and that eternal question of where to actually put your keyboard when you need more room to work. The Anker 675 USB-C docking station tackles this chaos head-on by <strong>combining a monitor stand with a full-featured 12-in-1 hub</strong> that keeps everything connected and organized in one sleek package. Right now, Amazon has dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5119/">award-winning workspace solution to an all-time low of $169, down from its usual $249 price tag</a>, and this early Black Friday deal deserves your attention if you’re tired of wrestling with desk clutter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5119/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The brilliance of this design is in how it turns wasted vertical space into useful storage: Instead of <strong>your monitor resting directly on the desk, the Anker docking station lifts it by 3.54 inches</strong>. This creates the ideal space underneath for your keyboard, laptop, or other accessories you want close but out of sight. This height adjustment not only looks neat but it also raises your screen to eye level. This helps you keep better posture throughout your workday instead of leaning forward and straining your neck. The <strong>unit measures 21.26 inches long and 8.66 inches deep</strong>, and provides ample surface area to support monitors weighing up to 22 pounds.</p>
<h2>Twelve Ports That Actually Matter</h2>
<p>The port selection on the Anker device includes everything you need for a modern workspace without cluttering it with unnecessary connections: The <strong>single USB-C upstream port</strong> on the underside connects to your laptop and supports up to <strong>100W of Power Delivery</strong>. This means it can charge even power-hungry laptops like the MacBook Pro or Dell laptop while managing all your peripherals through one cable.<strong> Two additional USB-C ports on the side share 45W of Power Delivery</strong> between them. They operate at 10Gbps transfer speeds which makes it easy to move large files or back up photos quickly. The<strong> three USB-A ports also run at 10Gbps</strong> with one port providing 7.5W for charging and another offering 4.5W.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K HDMI port</strong> supports resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 at 60Hz, delivering clear visuals for everything from spreadsheet work to photo editing. You’ll need to use this HDMI connection for external displays since the USB-C ports do not support video output, so keep that in mind as you plan your setup. The <strong>SD and microSD card slots</strong> both support UHS-I speeds up to 104MB/s which makes them quick enough for photographers who regularly transfer RAW files. An Ethernet port provides gigabit speeds for wired internet connections. The <strong>3.5mm combo audio jack</strong> handles both input and output for headphones or external speakers.</p>
<p>The <strong>wireless charging pad</strong> in the top right corner delivers 10W for compatible Android devices and 7.5W for iPhones: This matches the output of most standalone Qi chargers. This feature clears another cable from your desk and keeps your phone visible and accessible throughout the day. The pad works reliably even with phone cases on, so you won’t have to remove your device every time you want to recharge the battery.</p>



<p>The<strong> included 180W power supply</strong> provides enough energy to run the entire unit, allowing full charging speeds to your laptop while powering all connected peripherals at the same time. Setup takes just minutes since everything is plug-and-play with Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS systems. The aluminum alloy construction gives the unit a high-quality feel and matches well with modern office equipment.</p>
<p>This docking station won a <em>CES 2023 Innovation Award</em> for a good reason: It addresses multiple workspace problems in one product instead of forcing you to piece together separate solutions. At the current sale price of $169, you save a lot of money compared to buying a quality monitor stand and a similar USB-C hub separately.</p>

              <p>Mario has been a classic for decades, and it’s loved by quite literally just about everyone, no matter their age. The franchise goes back to the early 1980s when Mario made his first appearance in Donkey Kong as the Jump Man before getting his own game, Super Mario Bros., in 1985. Since then, he’s become one of the most beloved video game characters, and you can now bring his adventures home with the Super Mario Kart 8 anti-gravity mini RC racer by Nintendo for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/">On a regular day, it would run you around $40, but today, you can snag it up for just $30 on Amazon after a nice $10 discount</a>. It’s a great pick for some early holiday shopping, but the deal won’t last long. The set was already quite affordable at $40, but the current discount makes it an even better pick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Super Fun Racing Modes</h2>
<p>The kart has a good size and weight. It’s light for kids to carry around easily, but still sturdy enough to take a few bumps. There are two racing modes; standard and anti-gravity mode. The standard mode lets kids race around like a regular RC car, while the anti-gravity mode flips the wheels to perform drifts and tricks. It can even pull off 360-degree spins and wheelies! Switching between both modes is simple and just takes a single press of a button.</p>
<p>The racer runs on a 2.4GHz remote, which gives you a range of up to 100 feet. To give you an idea, that’s enough to race around your living room without slowdowns. The remote is also easy to use, so your kids will be showing off cool stunts and zipping through complicated spots in no time.</p>



<p>It’s designed for ages 8 and up, but we won’t judge if you feel the need to jump in and take a few laps yourself. Mario Kart is for everyone!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/">This deal brings the price down of this already-affordable Super Mario Kart 8 anti-gravity mini RC racer to just $30.</a> It’s practically a steal, and also a great chance to grab more than one if you have multiple young players at home. That way, everyone gets their own kart to race and show off without running to you every two minutes. Just be sure to hurry before the offer wraps up for good!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When the&nbsp;<em>really</em> big sales events of the year get close — Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, etc., one of the big questions is always “What’s Apple going to do?” If this new Amazon deal on the brand-new M5 iPad Pro is any indication, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">Apple’s going to be dipping at least a toe in the Black Friday pond in the weeks to come. For the first time, the 11-inch M5 iPad Pro is taking a price drop — it’s $949 right now, down by $50.</a></p>
<p>Apple fans and creative pros in particular are going to be all over this one, because the new M5 iPad Pro comes closer to full high-end laptop power than any tablet yet. The M5 chip is a game changer in terms of speed and pure power, and the newly released iPadOS 26 is a massive leap forward. The two combine with Apple Intelligence to create a tablet that can do nearly everything a powerful laptop can, especially if you add the Magic Keyboard to complete the experience.</p>

<h2>Faster, Thinner, Better</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the new IPad Pro is lighter than the iPad Air — 0.98 pounds, which speaks to just how much size and weight Apple has cut from their latest tablet design while amping up its power and ability. The M5 chip gets the lion’s share of attention, and deservedly so, but don’t sleep on the N1 wireless chip that’s also in the new iPad Pro, because it makes Wi-Fi 7, Thread, and Bluetooth 6 connections happen.</p>
<p>As with all things Apple, the screen on the M5 iPad Pro is best-in-class. It’s an Ultra Retina XDR tandem OLED screen with anti-glare treatment and an oleophobic coating that cuts down on fingerprints — an essential feature for an elite tablet. The ProMotion adaptive refresh rate ranges from 10Hz to a blistering 120Hz, and the peak performance of 1,600 nits delivers all of the exceptional quality of the screen in its full glory.</p>



<h2>All About the Images</h2>
<p>The M5 iPad Pro’s cameras and what it can do with the images are where this tablet really shines. The 12MP Wide camera at the rear of the tablet can shoot 4K ProRes video, and also be used as a powerful document scanner and AR code unlocking device. The front of the tablet has a powerhouse 12MP landscape Center Stage camera for pristine video calls and conferencing. When you shoot your videos or stills, Apple Intelligence takes over to deliver the best and most powerful range of editing and creative options of any tablet on the market.’</p>
<p>The first price break on this brand-new tablet is definitely an occasion, even if it’s just 5%. That might not be the case with other tablets, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">but the M5 iPad Pro was a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of tablet at its full $999 price, and now that it’s down to $949 at Amazon, it’s a more impressive deal yet.&nbsp;</a></p>
