              <p>Apple’s AirTag is $29 individually or $99 for a 4-pack but those trackers lock you exclusively into the Apple ecosystem while leaving Android users out entirely. The Tile Mate <strong>4-pack works seamlessly with both iPhone and Android devices</strong> which makes it the universal solution for households where not everyone uses the same phone brand. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5897/">At $39, down from $79</a>, this bundle has hit a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday while selling thousands of units daily.</p>

<h2>Universal Compatibility</h2>
<p>The <strong>cross-platform design lets iPhone users, Android phone owners, and tablet users</strong> track their items using the same <em>Tile</em> network, free from compatibility barriers. This universal approach proves essential in mixed-device households when parents use iPhones while kids carry Android phones or vice versa. The Tile Network takes advantage of <strong>its millions of active users running the app to create crowdsourced location</strong> updates when items stray beyond Bluetooth range, which works similarly to Apple’s Find My network sans platform restrictions.</p>



<p>It’s the ability to ring your Tile from your phone that enables the location of keys buried in couch cushions, bags left in another room, or water bottles hiding under car seats within Bluetooth range. This basic functionality covers the majority of <em>“I know it’s here somewhere”</em> situations where items are nearby but obscured. The reverse capability is equally useful: pressing the button on your Tile makes your phone ring at full volume even when set to silent mode, solving the universal problem of misplaced phones that don’t respond to calls because you’ve enabled Do Not Disturb.</p>
<p>Life360 integration provides significant added value <strong>and consolidates family location tracking and item tracking into a single interface</strong>. Instead of having one app to find your family members and another to track your lost items, Life360 displays all on one single map. Parents can see where their kids are while at the same time tracking the car keys of the whole family, a backpack of their teenager, or even a pet’s collar. The consolidated view makes daily logistics simpler and reduces app-switching friction, forcing people to abandon tracking systems that they find too complicated.</p>



<p>Beyond simple item tracking, <strong>the SOS alert feature provides discreet personal safety functionality.</strong> Pressing and holding the Tile button initiates an emergency alert to select contacts along with your location, making a panic button you carry on your keychain. This additional layer of safety is desirable for college students walking alone at night, elderly family members with medical concerns, or anyone working in situations where they may need to summon help quickly.</p>
<p>The four-pack quantity covers the items people lose most frequently: <strong>house keys, car keys, wallet or purse, and backpack or gym bag</strong>. Having multiple trackers lets users comprehensively cover everything that regularly goes missing rather than having to ration a single tracker across multiple items. The compact Mate form factor attaches easily to key rings, slips into wallet card slots, or clips onto bag zippers through the built-in hole. The<strong> 250-foot Bluetooth range</strong> extends coverage across typical homes and offices, though the community finding feature extends effective range infinitely through crowd-sourced updates.</p>
<p>With four Tile Mates for $39, you’re getting cross-platform tracking, bidirectional finding, SOS emergency alerts, and community finding at half the retail price this Black Friday. Apple’s equivalent 4-pack of AirTags costs $99 while locking you into iOS exclusively which makes Tiles both cheaper and more functionally useful for multi-platform households.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-eufy-solar-camera-at-break-even-50-off-means-no-profit-just-to-offload-stock-2000647046</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-sells-eufy-solar-camera-at-break-even-50-off-means-no-profit-just-to-offload-stock.1363492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most outdoor security cameras are constantly draining batteries, require ongoing subscription fees for cloud storage or need complicated wiring/constant recharging that makes maintenance a headache. The eufy security <em>SoloCam</em> S220 eliminates these headaches <strong>through solar charging that keeps the battery perpetually topped up with just three hours of daily sunlight</strong>&nbsp;while local storage removes monthly fees entirely.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/">At $49, down from $99</a>, this wireless camera has hit a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. The 50% discount makes buying individual units more economic than the multi-camera packs also on sale, which is strange since bulk bundles usually offer better per-unit pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solar Power That Works</h2>
<p>Most climates keep the battery charged indefinitely with an integrated solar panel, requiring only three hours of daily sunlight for continuous operation. This threshold is achievable even on overcast winter months in northern latitudes, although it’s obvious that southern, sunny climates easily exceed the requirements. For this reason, the solar capability makes this an install-and-forget solution that runs perpetually without intervention rather than a truly battery-powered camera that requires quarterly recharges.</p>
<p>You avoid the frustrating cycle of climbing ladders every few months to remove, recharge, and reinstall cameras that plague purely battery-dependent competitors. The environmental benefit of solar operation extends beyond mere convenience by eliminating disposable batteries and reducing overall energy consumption compared to wired cameras drawing constant wall power.</p>



<p>The <strong>2K resolution captures significantly more detail than standard 1080p cameras</strong>&nbsp;and allows for digital zoom into footage without losing clarity when reviewing suspicious activity or identifying faces and license plates. In daylight, the sensor resolves fine details of clothing patterns, vehicle makes, and facial features from reasonable distances. The f/1.6 aperture lets substantially more light reach the sensor than cameras with smaller apertures, such as f/2.0 and f/2.4, which directly improves low-light performance before infrared illumination even activates.<strong> Once darkness falls, infrared LEDs invisibly illuminate the scene</strong> to provide night vision that maintains clarity and detail, rather than the grainy, indistinct footage that renders cheaper cameras nearly useless after sundown.</p>
<p><strong>Human detection powered by AI on the device</strong> filters out false alerts from swaying branches, passing cars, or wandering animals that constantly trigger motion-based systems. The intelligence identifies actual people and sends alerts specifically when humans enter your monitored area, which reduces notification fatigue from dozens of meaningless alerts each day. Local processing happens completely on the camera itself without ever sending footage to cloud servers, protecting your privacy while facilitating faster response times since data doesn’t have to travel to remote servers for analysis.</p>



<p><strong>The process of wireless installation takes minutes </strong>where you drill one hole for the mounting bracket and essentially you are done. No running of ethernet cables through walls, no complicated electrical jobs, no coordination with electricians or handymen charging hourly rates. The compact size and wire-free design allow placement in optimal surveillance positions without concern for nearby outlets or limitations on cable routing. You can mount cameras under eaves, on fence posts, or attached to trees if needed, positioning for coverage rather than compromising based on wiring constraints.</p>
<p>In contrast, it is a <strong>no-monthly-fee model</strong> that genuinely gives long-term savings compared to subscription-based competitors like Ring or Nest, at $3 to $10 monthly per camera. Over five years, these subscriptions add up to $180 to $600 per camera just to unlock basic features like video storage and AI detection. The Eufy approach focuses on storing footage locally on the internal memory of the cameras and handling AI alerts on-device, thus removing any recurring costs while retaining full functionality.</p>
<p>The eufy security SoloCam S220 brings solar-powered operation and 2K resolution at a new record low for Black Friday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-dumps-40-inch-smart-fire-tv-at-40-off-your-black-friday-tv-hunt-ends-here-for-pocket-change-2000647056</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-dumps-40-inch-smart-fire-tv-at-40-off-your-black-friday-tv-hunt-ends-here-for-pocket-change.1363480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget TVs traditionally meant accepting mediocre picture quality, sluggish interfaces and limited streaming options that frustrated users daily. Amazon’s <em>Insignia</em> Fire TV line solves these compromises by integrating their proven Fire TV platform directly into affordable displays that prioritize functionality over fancy features. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5898/">At $89, down from $149, this 40-inch model has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday. The combination of <strong>1080p Full HD resolution, Alexa voice control, and access to virtually every major streaming service</strong> makes this one of the most practical secondary TVs available for bedrooms or kitchens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5898/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>integrated Fire TV interface ditches the clunky, outdated menus</strong> that plague generic budget TVs still running basic smart platforms from five years ago. Navigation feels responsive rather than laggy, with apps launching quick and content loading without frustrating delays that make you question your purchase. Access to over 1.5 million streaming movies and TV episodes spans all major services, including Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, YouTube, Apple TV+, Disney+, ESPN+, and countless others, all without requiring external streaming devices.</p>



<p>The included <strong>Alexa Voice Remote transforms TV control from button-mashing frustration into natural voice commands</strong> that actually understand context. Say “Alexa, find action movies,” and it searches across all your installed streaming apps at once rather than forcing you to check each service individually. Say “Alexa, open Netflix,” and it immediately launches the app without you having to swipe through menus.</p>
<p>This <strong>1080p Full HD resolution strikes a great balance</strong> and offers clear and detailed picture quality above 720p displays without the superfluous expense of 4K panels, which most viewers can’t tell the difference from at 40-inch screen sizes and typical viewing distances. If you’re sitting 6 to 8 feet away from the display, the human eye can’t really detect the difference in resolution between 1080p and 4K unless you stick your face right up against the screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>DTS Virtual-X processing on this set creates virtual three-dimensional sound</strong> from the TV’s integrated speakers, expanding the audio beyond the flat, tinny output most budget TVs produce. While this virtual surround can’t compete with a dedicated speaker system or a soundbar, it meaningfully improves dialogue clarity and makes the audio much more spacious, therefore adding to the movie- or show-watching experience.</p>
<p>Connectivity options range from game console and streaming device hookups via two HDMI ports to legacy equipment with composite <strong>AV jacks, digital optical output for audio systems, a USB port for media playback, headphone jack for private listening, and coaxial jack</strong> for cable or antenna connections. The diversity in this port arrangement caters to everything from minimalist, streaming-only setups to advanced home theater configurations that involve many sources.</p>
<p>At $89, this 40-inch Insignia Fire TV comes in at 40% off retail this Black Friday. If you need a capable TV for a bedroom, kitchen, or any space where 4K feels excessive, this record-low price makes Fire TV functionality accessible to everyone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-move-2-at-zero-margin-portable-speaker-better-than-most-home-systems-goes-for-pennies-2000647037</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-offloads-move-2-at-zero-margin-portable-speaker-better-than-most-home-systems-goes-for-pennies.1363462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos represents the high-end tier of wireless audio, and the <strong>Move 2 portable speaker punches well above its weight in terms of sound quality</strong>, considering it’s a <strong>battery-powered mobile unit</strong>. The dual-tweeter architecture combined with the precision-tuned woofer creates a true stereo soundstage that outclasses many dedicated bookshelf speakers that cost hundreds more when the Move 2 is stationary.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5896/">$399, down from $499, this wireless powerhouse has reached a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday. The combination of audiophile-grade sound, 24-hour battery life, and portability makes this speaker phenomenal for anyone that won’t compromise audio quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Acoustic Architecture That Redefines Portable Audio</h2>
<p>The <strong>new dual tweeter setup supplants the original Move’s single tweeter</strong> configuration for a proper stereo soundstage that separates left and right channels for appropriate spatial audio presentation. What this means in terms of architecture is that vocals sit centered and defined while instruments occupy clear positions across the sound field rather than blending together in mono.</p>
<p>Delivering low frequencies with authority and control, the precision-tuned woofer provides deep bass that is physical in nature without a hint of muddiness or distortion, even at loudest volumes. The dynamic range of live recordings captures the emotional charge and energy of performances without compression, like cheaper portable speakers would do.</p>



<p>The automatic <em>Trueplay</em> feature continuously analyzes the acoustic environment of the Move 2 and <strong>adjusts output in real-time to optimize sound</strong> for wherever you place the speaker. Set it on a wood table, and the system compensates for surface reflections. Move it near a wall, and Trueplay adjusts for boundary reinforcement that can boost bass unnaturally.</p>
<p><strong>Battery performance reaches as high as 24 hours</strong> on a single charge, which represents double the runtime of the original Move despite the more powerful acoustic components. That’s long enough for an entire weekend camping, a full day at the beach, or a multi-day event without having to hunt for outlets. Efficiency improvements come courtesy of refined power management that coordinates amplification, processing, and battery draw.</p>



<p>In contrast, <strong>the IP56 rating gives serious protection against real-world conditions</strong>, not just friendly marketing splash resistance. Rain, dirt, dust, and spills will not destroy internal components or affect operation. The rating means complete dust protection and resistance to strong water jets from all directions, which, in other words, means that during beach trips, pool parties, and backyard gatherings where accidents inevitably happen, survival is assured.</p>
<p>The wireless charging base provides elegant docking which charges the speaker by simply setting it down. The upgraded design now includes a detachable power cable and a more compact adapter for easier packing during travel. The base stays at home for daily charging while USB-PD compatibility offers charging on the go with any USB Power Delivery power supply.</p>
<p>If audiophile-grade sound that travels with you anywhere is what you’re after, this record-low price offers premium portable audio without the usually associated Sonos premium.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/identity-protection-service-drops-70-off-for-black-friday-privacy-now-costs-almost-nothing-2000646900</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/identity-protection-service-drops-70-off-for-black-friday-privacy-now-costs-almost-nothing.1363444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday deals are everywhere right now and most of them are pretty forgettable. Another discount on headphones you don’t need, a slightly cheaper subscription to a streaming service you already have-you know the drill. But here’s one that actually caught my attention: NordProtect, the <strong>most popular&nbsp;identity theft protection service</strong>, is running a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/">promotion that drops the price to $4.49 per month, down from the usual $14.99</a>. That’s a 70% discount, and unlike most Black Friday offers, this one addresses a problem that’s getting worse by the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>Here’s the thing about identity theft: it’s one of those problems that feels abstract until it happens to you. You hear about data breaches in the news, shrug, change a password or two, and move on with your life. But the numbers tell a different story: <strong>Every 22 seconds, someone in the United States falls victim to identity theft</strong>. Not every hour, not every few minutes-every 22 seconds. The FTC reported that over 1.1 million people filed identity theft cases in 2024, and last year alone, fraud cost consumers more than $12.5 billion, which is a 25% jump from the year before.</p>
<h2>Same Owner as NordVPN</h2>
<p>NordProtect comes from Nord Security, the same company making <em>NordVPN</em> and <em>NordPass</em> which means they are definitely not new in the security game. What they’ve done here is to create a service that handles all the tedious, anxiety-inducing work of keeping your identity safe-so you don’t have to be thinking about it every waking moment of your life.</p>
<p>It <strong>monitors credit reports from all three major bureaus</strong>, watches bank accounts for weird transactions and even actively scans the dark web for your personal information. That last one is of particular note since the dark web is basically the marketplace where stolen data gets traded around and if your info pops up, you want to know about it immediately. You can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn/nordprotect">check out Gizmodo’s review of the service</a> for more details on how it performs in real-world usage.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000646904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646904"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646904">© NordProtect</figcaption></figure>
<p>The monitoring is only the beginning: What makes NordProtect practical is the fact that it doesn’t just tell you something bad happened –<strong> it tells you what to do about it</strong>. When your data shows up in some breach or suspicious activity gets flagged, you get an alert with concrete, actionable steps to take. No vague warnings that leave you Googling <em>“what to do if my email was in a data breach”</em> in the middle of the night.</p>
<h2>Up To $1 Million In Coverage</h2>
<p>Let’s say monitoring fails and you actually become a victim of identity theft. This is where things start to get costly and time-consuming for most people: hours on the phone with banks, credit card companies, credit bureaus, possibly law enforcement. You may want a lawyer. You may miss out on wages while taking time off work to sort it all out. <strong>NordProtect includes up to $1 million in coverage</strong> for eligible recovery costs-which means attorney fees, lost wages, and other expenses that come with cleaning up the mess. There’s also fraud insurance:<strong> as much as $50,000 for online threats or blackmail situations</strong>, and as much as $10,000 if someone actually steals money from your bank or credit card through an online scam.</p>
<p>But what really sets this apart from those credit monitoring services that send you reports is that you get an assigned case manager-not a phone tree, not a chatbot, but a real, live person based in the United States available any time of day or night. And if identity theft does strike, this person becomes your advocate. They’ll do the paperwork, communicate with financial institutions and credit agencies, make sure deadlines aren’t missed, and generally cut through the red tape on your behalf.</p>
<p>The truth is that most of us are walking around with a dozen potential vulnerabilities. We shop online, we use public WiFi, we have accounts on websites that may or may not have great security practices. Each one of those is a potential entry point for someone looking to steal your information. You can’t eliminate the risk entirely-that would require living off the grid-but you can set up a system that catches problems early and helps you fix them quickly.</p>
<p>At $4.49 per month with this Black Friday deal, NordProtect costs less than a single lunch. The service includes a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong> if you decide it’s not for you, so there’s room to test it out. Given that the average identity theft victim spends months recovering and often thousands of dollars in the process, having this kind of safety net feels less like a luxury and more like basic maintenance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Walt Disney Imagineering—the research and development arm of the Disney parks—will debut a new robot in its Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong parks. </span><i><span>Frozen</span></i><span> fans will certainly be excited to see Olaf the snowman stumbling around the World of Frozen area of Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland early next year, but those of us who have always found the icy sidekick unnerving will not be pleased.</span></p> <p><span>Disney’s dedicated an entire episode to Olaf and its history of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoPN02bmzrE"><span>robots on its Walt Disney Imagineering YouTube channel</span></a><span>. Olaf was created inside Disney Research’s Zurich, and is decidedly smaller than the </span><a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/entertainment/hollywood-studios/character-meet-olaf-frozen/"><span>Olaf’s human-sized character</span></a><span> that goes to Disney meet and greets. He appears to be just under hip height. It seems like he’ll be wandering Disney aimlessly, cursing parkgoers with his unhinged laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our latest Olaf is a fantastic example of representing an animated character as authentically as possible in the physical world—a challenging task because animated characters most often move in non-physical ways,” Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering Research &amp; Development, </span><a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/olaf-robotic-character/"><span>said in a news release</span></a><span>. “For example, to make Olaf’s snowball feet move along his body, we paired state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning with an artistic interface and advances in mechanical design.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Because Olaf is an animated character—and not inherently a robot, like Star Wars droids—Disney had to make “fundamental additions to our reinforcement learning framework to boost the believability of the character by enabling motion at the limit of hardware,” Laughlin said. So, for instance, Olaf’s body is softer, like snow, and you can pull off his nose.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Disney engineers in the video said they used reinforcement learning techniques to teach robots like Olaf and other droids how to act like their characters by ‘watching” artist-made animations. They’ve been through a bunch of iterations throughout the years, starting with a small, humanoid robot that’s shown in the YouTube channel being tripped by a stick. The BDX droids are featured heavily in the episode, too, showcasing how Disney made them more autonomous. They’ve got “eyes” and “ears” to compute what’s going on in the world using AI. So, for instance, if a person kneels down in front of a droid, it’ll move its head to look at the person directly. If they stand up, the droid looks up. It also shows the engineers “choreographing” a performance between three droids that gets recorded to be “played back” as a performance at the parks. And they do that by controlling the droids with what looks like Steam Decks. It’s described as “building blocks for the autonomous show.”</span></p> <p><span>Olaf is the next progression of Disney’s robots, but Disney isn’t clear how Olaf will work—whether it’ll need to be partly controlled by a human or not. The “self” in “self-walking robot” seems to imply that it’ll do a lot of the work itself, though.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-my-video-game-family-is-bringing-to-thanksgiving-1845758556">Thanksgiving</a> is later this week in the United States. Loads of people are going to be traveling across the country to visit family members, some of whom they like, while eating food and cursing the fact that they have to do this all over again in like three weeks for Christmas. But who cares about all that? We are here to discuss the star of Thanksgiving: The food.</p> <p>What makes a perfect <a href="https://kotaku.com/public-school-thanksgiving-feast-the-kotaku-review-1820327714">Thanksgiving plate</a>? It’s a question that will likely get a lot of different answers, and all of them will be wrong unless they happen to match your perfect platter of tasty treats.</p> <p>For me, I have to have turkey at Thanksgiving. It’s the only time of the year when I’m willing to put the effort into prepping, cooking, and then carving up a giant turkey. And no, turkey isn’t dry or flavorless; you’ve just likely had some poorly cooked turkey. I’ve had turkey that was succulent and packed with flavor. The key is to brine, shield the white meat, and don’t overcook that thing or shove stuffing in it.</p>

 <p>Beyond a few big slices of turkey on my plate, I also have to have fluffy, garlic-y mashed potatoes, sweet corn, steamed but still crunchy broccoli (no cheese!), some stuffing that wasn’t cooked in a turkey, and a few Hawaiian sweet rolls. No gravy needed. Salad optional. It’s Thanksgiving. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bobs-burgers-thanksgiving-episodes-list-ranked-best-1851709655">I’m here to load up on carbs and collapse in front of a TV</a>.</p> <p>But that’s <em>my</em> perfect plate. What are you serving or hoping to be served on Thanksgiving? Let us know in the comments below! We’ll then be back later this week with a follow-up post sharing some of your answers.</p>
