Originally called <em>Championship Manager</em>, first released in 1992, there has either been a new game or an annual update disk every year since,  changing names to <em>Football Manager</em> in 2005 after a switch from Eidos to Sega but never missing a season. Until now.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195752" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="195752,195207,196131" data-current="195752"><div><p>Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21263.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Developers Sports Interactive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has put out an official notice</a></span> that, following missing the usual fall release window in 2024, <em>Football Manager 25</em> is never going to happen. A 32 year streak, ended.</p><p>“We know this will come as a huge disappointment,” says Sports Interactive over the surprising announcement. “Especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. ”</p><p>As a Brit living in Britain, what the U.S. so quaintly calls “soccer” has always been an unavoidable aspect of life, despite my absolute lack of interest and dislike of so much of the culture that surrounds it. I would imagine, not least because of its confusing name, <em>Football Manager</em> isn’t quite such a staple of North American gaming life: just think of it as the ultimate fantasy football league, but association football, not your peculiar game of rugby-chess. Every year a new game would be released, sneered at by awful people like me as “a spreadsheet simulator,” but become the obsession of millions.</p><p>The franchise has had enormous influence on real-world soccer. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/manchester-uniteds-new-boss-cut-his-teeth-on-football-m-1832308214&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/manchester-uniteds-new-boss-cut-his-teeth-on-football-m-1832308214">A manager of one of the biggest teams in the world got started by playing <em>FM</em> games in his childhood</a></span>, while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slimy-agents-have-tried-bribing-football-managers-devel-1845751599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slimy-agents-have-tried-bribing-football-managers-devel-1845751599">agents have been alleged to try to bribe the games’ developers to improve the stats of their clients</a></span>.</p><p>As time’s gone on, <em>Football Manager</em> games have obviously become far more complicated and elaborate, with the most astonishingly accurate recreations of the international sport, with eye-wateringly detailed specifications for each and every player from every team in every league, allowing you to be the manager of your favorite team (or imagined one), controlling every aspect to an obsessive degree.</p><figure id="" data-id="2fef19bcc33c81ca45c093a2cee07ce9" data-recommend-id="image://2fef19bcc33c81ca45c093a2cee07ce9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A WIP shot of FM25's potential interface." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A WIP shot of FM25's potential interface." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fef19bcc33c81ca45c093a2cee07ce9" data-recommend-id="image://2fef19bcc33c81ca45c093a2cee07ce9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A WIP shot of FM25's potential interface." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You might think making a new game is just a case of plugging in the new data to last year’s spreadsheets, but the series’ ambition far exceeds this. <em>FM25</em>, originally due to be released in early November 2024, was intended to be a huge overhaul and a new step forward for the game. This proved trickier than hoped, leading to two big release delays, and now the entire cancellation of the game.</p><p>“Due to a variety of challenges that we’ve been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven’t achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team,” says Sports Interactive in the statement. “Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.”</p><p>Overall experience and the interface have not reached a point where the developer or its publisher feels comfortable releasing the game, and despite having found a new focus to improve things, “we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.”</p><p>Just the nature of the football season itself means there’s an unmoveable deadline after which releasing the game at all would be folly. SI says that’s March, “as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year,” and isn’t willing to release the game as is by that point. “We could have pressed on, released <em>FM25</em> in its current state, and fixed things down the line—but that’s not the right thing to do.”</p><p>This means 2025 will be the first season not to see a <em>CM</em>/<em>FM</em> game in over 30 years, but also that SI has an extra eight or nine months to beat the new format into shape, updated with the 2026 season’s statistics. Anyone who pre-ordered the game will be automatically refunded, says SI, and as for why this announcement has come so very, very late in the day,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.</p></blockquote><p>There are also no plans to release the modern equivalent of an update disk for 2025, as SI says “this is a substantial undertaking” and wants to keep all focus on getting the game finished for the following football season. Finally, when it comes to the various subscription platforms that host <em>FM24</em>,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> We are currently in discussions with our various platform partners and licensors and hope to extend our FM24 agreements. We will provide an update on this in due course.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
