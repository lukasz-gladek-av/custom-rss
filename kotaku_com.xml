              <p>A cordless workstation is a clean workstation, and it can also be an efficient one with the right gadget at hand. If your everyday work involves dealing with multiple devices at once, a solid docking station can be an excellent investment.</p>
<p>The best options out there that feature multiple ports and reliable power delivery usually don’t come cheap, but Amazon is currently making it easier than ever to grab one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">Right now, the Anker 14-in-1 USB-C laptop docking station is going for just $43 on the retailer, after a sweet 39% off its retail price.</a> The deal, however, is selling out fast, which means the offer (or the stock) won’t be around for much longer. We highly recommend acting fast to grab yours before it’s too late!</p>

<h2>Multiple Connectivity Options for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>You’re getting 14 connectivity options in a compact, lightweight build. These include two 4K HDMI ports, a 1080p VGA port, a 5 Gbps USB-C port, a 100W USB-C PD-IN port, five USB-A ports, a 1 Gbps Ethernet port, an SD / micro SD slot, and an AUX port. The two 4K HDMI and one 1080p VGA port let you connect up to three external screens at the same time. Windows users will enjoy extended display support, while on macOS, the displays will only mirror what’s going on your main display. Regardless, these are great for adding multiple screens for a bigger, more productive setup. With Windows, you can be hosting Zoom calls on one and present using the other. Or work on one while having reference documents open on the rest; the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>The USB-A and USB-C ports support ultra-fast file transfers at impressive 5 Gbps speeds. This hub also offers up to 80W of pass-through charging, which means all your laptops will stay charged as you power through your productive days.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the hub plays nicely with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt 3/4 laptops, and supports Windows 10/11, macOS (12 and up), and ChromeOS systems. And since it’s quite lightweight, you can carry it around with you easily. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">Anker also throws in an 18-month warranty with your purchase for some extra peace of mind</a>. All things considered, it’s a great option to consider if you’re looking to manage a bunch of different devices in a compact, clean way. The current discount puts the hub in a much more affordable range.</p>
