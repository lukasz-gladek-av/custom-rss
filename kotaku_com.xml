            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> may not have a release date yet, but it does have a demo. The coolest-looking Marvel game in years, and a game many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are excited to play later this year, now has a small demo up on Steam letting you play the superhero brawler alone or with a few pals.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013980/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion_Demo/">Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu announced and released a free, playable demo</a> for the upcoming <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>. The demo contains two full levels with boss fights, supports both local and online co-op, and features nine playable characters: Rocket Raccoon, Nova, Phyla-Vell, She-Hulk, Venom, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Storm, and Captain America. Here’s a new trailer for the demo:</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced earlier this year</a> during a Nintendo Direct,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is a side-scrolling 2D retro-inspired beat ’em up being developed by the same studio behind the extremely tubular and awesome <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler.&nbsp;<em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past games, is a snappy and action-packed retro throwback. I played the new demo on Steam for a few minutes and immediately had a blast smashing baddies as She-Hulk and Spider-Man. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">Swapping between the two, which is this game’s big gimmick</a>, was great as it let me switch between Spider-Man’s fast and agile action during some segments and She-Hulk’s heavy hits during fights with tougher foes. I did encounter some performance dips, which wasn’t ideal, but hopefully those issues get ironed out when the game launches…eventually.</p>

 <p>While there are nine characters in the demo, that’s not the game’s full line-up. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to include a large roster of 15 characters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-new-heroes-marvel-cosmic-invasion-full-roster-black-panther-ghost-rider-2000626521">We know 12 of the 15 characters</a> that will be playable at launch. Three more have yet to be revealed.</p>

 <p>Now the bad news for console players: The new <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> demo isn’t available on Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch. This has understandably disappointed many players online, with some jumping into the comments of the trailer above to share their frustration.</p> <p>Regardless, we shouldn’t have to wait long, as <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to arrive in 2025. Exactly when hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s not much time left in the year so if it’s not getting delayed, the game is likely weeks away from launching on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Although I’ve sought out a handful of cards featuring my favorite monsters and characters, I generally only pay casual attention to the </span><i><span>Pokémon Trading Card Game</span></i><span>.&nbsp; I grew up with a giant cardboard box of old cards under my bed, but as an adult, I can’t imagine putting in half the time or money I did into it as a kid. It just seems like it would be too much hassle, and that’s not to mention everything that happens around the game. When I do hear stories about the TCG, they’re usually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>stories of controversy</span></a><span>. Images of people nearly destroying the Van Gogh Museum in order to get exclusive cards and merchandise to sell online, as well as grown-ass men fighting and camping out for cards outside of GameStops, are seared into my brain. This toxic, predatory side of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>has pushed a lot of people out of the space</span></a><span>, as memories of excitement at finding your favorite card have been replaced by stories of scams and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241"><span>robberies</span></a><span>. That was how it was for me until fairly recently, when I saw a video from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>vendor @beard_dad_cardz having an extremely sweet interaction with a girl named Sophia at a card show.</span></p>   <p><span>As a fan of his streams, Sophia is excited to be at beard_dad_cardz’s booth, and his viewers are so excited about her excitement that they donate so she can get a card she likes. She says she’s a fan of Umbreon and Espeon, and after she finds a card of the dark-type Eeveelution she likes, beard_dad_cardz gives it to her for free. The moment went viral on multiple social media apps and has accumulated over 17.8 million views on TikTok alone.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card vendors have taken up content creation as an extension of their business, and that means several of them livestream from card shows and capture moments like this regularly. You wouldn’t know it from the news, but there’s a lot of kindness, charity, and community in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards that often gets drowned out by the worst bad actors. And as the stigma around the space has grown, creators and vendors like Chris Daywalt, the owner of HLD Cards and Collectibles, are trying to combat these notions by putting these moments of kindness on the internet, where people can see them.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The rise of videos where you’re seeing people scalping Costco for cards or doing things like that, that’s going to happen any time you really shine a spotlight on something, especially something as big as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,” Daywalt told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “When people start hearing money around it, those people are going to come out of the woodwork. They did the same thing to sneakers and to Supreme clothes, video cards, and PSIs, anything else that they feel like they can make a quick dollar on, but I think what makes </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>different is the 30 years of community that’s been built around it.”</span></p>

    <p><span>Daywalt started HLD as a way to connect with his son Henry, whom the shop and channel are named after. Henry returned from a summer camp trip with his first set of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, which led to the father and son bonding over their collections. Daywalt says this ignited a passion in his son to start collecting and gave them a common interest, as Daywalt has been a lifelong TCG player, and grew up playing and trading with others.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I always used to say ‘I play </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> for the gathering,’ and so I really knew the community part of it before I knew the reselling part of it,” Daywalt said.</span></p> <p><span>What started as an opportunity for Daywalt to pass on his values around taking care of something and finding community quickly became a family business after his brother started making content out of their card show appearances, and his wife started handling other aspects of the business. Daywalt says he’s comfortable sharing this with his son because in his experience, the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community sticks to the messages of kindness the franchise touts. There are still some bad actors that try to take advantage of others, though, which is why Daywalt </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hldcardsandcollectibles/video/7545145575449152799?lang=en"><span>doesn’t do “trade-ups,</span></a><span>” or card exchanges in which the card the event attendee receives is of greater value than the one they part with, with adults, but will do them with kids.</span></p>

   <p><span>Promoting those good moments is why a lot of vendors are branching out into content creation. Sure, it’s another extension of the business and also works as viral marketing, but the narrative of bad actors dominating the space has become so prevalent that long-time fans feel protective of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and the space they’ve cultivated, and want to push back. Aaron Lee, one of the co-founders of Duckbird, grew up watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime and has memories of waiting for new episodes to premiere on WBTV back in the day. As such, he’s been in the space long enough to have encountered people engaged in shady practices at card shows time and time again. However, he says a lot of these are less common at in-person events than one might think, and he especially experiences them less in his small North Carolina town.</span></p>

 <p><span>“You’ll see people who you can tell are, like, obviously there to make a quick buck,” Lee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “There will be even kids and adults who are obviously there trying to make money essentially; taking advantage of vendors and whatnot, and have their kids try to do a trade-up challenge to get them a better card. That’s a big one that I’ve seen a lot, and that has come from a lot of influencers or YouTube content creators being able to do that. But if it’s, you know, someone who knows what they’re doing and[is] just trying to take advantage of people, that’s something that’s not so fun.”</span></p>   <p><span>For Lee and his partner, “Duck,” trying to make people feel welcome at card shows is important. Lee says that the pair tries to give free stuff to kids who show up, especially if they seem to be in the early days of their own collection journey.</span></p> <p><span>“We kind of do like a rock-paper-scissors game, but we use Poké Balls with different types [of Pokémon], and we give them free packs if they win,” Lee says. “Even if they lose, we still give them free packs. We’ll do coin flips with kids for free, and then even if they lose, we’ll keep flipping until they win. So it’s stuff like that to just make sure that anybody who we feel like is new to the hobby or is genuinely passionate about collecting is able to have a positive experience when they go to a show or if they stop by our stream. Anything to just let them know,&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>‘Hey, there are still people out there who really enjoy the space and just want to grow the community in the right direction.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Stories of vendors going out of their way to help kids get cards they’re looking for are pretty common at these events. Which is why, despite all the talk of big money in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>these days, a lot of the biggest transactions are completely free.</span></p> <p><span>“I had people who were trying to find a card for a kid who’s looking for, like, a specific Pikachu card,” Lee said. “They’ll tell their buddies and their buddies will tell their buddies, and then the whole show will be searching for a card and bringing it to the kid. Half the time, they give it to the kid for free. It really just depends on where you are and who you talk with, but I would say like 80 to 90 percent of vendors that you see in real life are kind. They go out of their way to help the kid out or help somebody out when they’re looking for something specific. I see a lot of kindness with vendors when, sometimes, you might be trying to trade a card in that might not necessarily move as well. A lot of times, vendors will match the card 100 percent and just give the kid what they want, just to help the kid out. That’s where it starts, when you’re a kid and you don’t really wanna look at this in a monetary way. You just want to collect cards. You can really tell if a kid is just trying to collect cards, you know, versus trying to make some money. And that’s what I like to see.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with all these positive stories, piercing through all the constant reports of crimes and the viral moments showing scalpers acting a fool at major events can feel impossible. When I asked Daywalt what advice he’d give to someone trying to enter the space, he said the average collector and vendor is not going to be making thousands of dollars off these cards, and if you go into the hobby expecting that, you’re likely going to be disappointed.</span></p> <p><span>“If it’s about the money, go trade stocks or work in finance,” Daywalt says. “What I always say to people is that the reason I don’t necessarily worry if the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>market crashes tomorrow is because I’ll look at it as an opportunity to go get all the cards I wanted. They have a value to me outside of what a TCG player says the market value is. Don’t put that pressure on something, you know, buy it because you like it and it’s something that brings you joy intrinsically, not extrinsically, because it could make you some money.”</span></p>   <p><span>Lee echoed the sentiment and said that some of the best cards are ones you won’t find selling for three or more figures, and if you aren’t interested in the art or community, there are easier ways to make money.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We get tons of people coming up asking for particular Pokémon because they want to collect all of that Pokémon,” Lee says. “Then if it’s a less popular Pokémon like Dunsparce, then, you know, the cards aren’t gonna be as expensive, and it makes for a really fun time.”</span></p> <p><span>Daywalt says that even after the time he’s put into buying, selling, and collecting, HLD isn’t paying his family’s bills, and that every dollar they make at these shows is going back into the business. While he admits he does get invested in predicting the market, he encourages people who are hoping to find the golden ticket in a Target booster pack to interrogate whether they’re in it for the right reasons.</span></p> <p><span>“There’s a lot of knowledge and a lot of really sharp people that are already in the space, and you’re not going to catch up to them tomorrow,” Daywalt says. “I don’t care how many YouTube videos you watch or how many articles you read about it. If you want to get into this space, do it because it brings you joy. Do what you like, and make the money a secondary part of it if it’s important to you.”</span></p>   <p><span>After talking to vendors and seeing these kinds of wholesome interactions online, I still don’t know that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card collecting is for me. I have a collection of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371">Raichu</a> and Professor Turo cards on my shelf, and I think that’s probably enough. But after seeing the uptick in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card scams and content mills over the past few years, it was disheartening for a while to know a series that had brought me so much joy had become a symbol of predatory greed. At the very least, it’s comforting to know that some people are keeping the childlike wonder alive, and that they’re posting reminders of it online.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The spooky season is here and it’s packed with a terrifying number of new game releases. October is always a busy month but this year, it feels even more overwhelming than usual. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, the latest prestige open-world blockbuster from Sony, kicks things off this week while the team behind <em>Shovel Knight</em> wraps up the month with <em>Mina the Hollower</em>, their teeny, tiny, cozy homage to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, debuting on Halloween. Trick or treat? Why not both!</p> <p>In between, we’re getting the return of franchises with a lot to prove in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em>, as well as other big sequels in&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. And don’t lose track of some of the top-wishlisted games on Steam coming in October, including <em>Little Nightmares 3</em> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. It’s felt like there are too many games for a while now. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games">That’s a problem for the video game industry,</a> but it offers a bounty of riches (and choice paralysis) for players this month.</p>

 <p>Here are 55 games that are coming out in October 2025, and if you have a favorite upcoming release we missed, please share it in the comments.</p> <h2><em>Silly Polly Beast</em> – October 1</h2>  <p><strong>Platforms:</strong>&nbsp;PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC<br> <strong>Developers:</strong>&nbsp;Anji Games<br> <strong>Publishers:</strong> Top Hat Studio<br> <strong>Genres:</strong> Adventure shooter</p>

The service, which gives people access to a large library of games for a monthly fee, has long been considered one of the best deals in gaming, especially for people who don’t want to buy dozens of games a year. You could theoretically just subscribe to Game Pass and have something new to play every month as games rotate in and out of its catalog. Well, today Microsoft announced it would be raising the price for the Ultimate tier from $20 to $30 a month.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Along with the hefty price increase, the Ultimate tier is getting a lot of new games and perks, including the Ubisoft+ catalog and a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>crew membership that gives you battle pass access and in-game currency every month. The other tiers are also going up in price, and will now include cloud gaming access and an expanded library. The PC Game Pass package, however, is going up from $12 to $16.50 with no new perks. Xbox </span><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/"><span>frames this</span></a><span> as a move toward flexibility and choice, but ultimately, Game Pass’ claim to fame has always been its affordability, and now that its price is going up, the internet has feelings and jokes loaded up.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I said i wanted the 360 era back, I didn't mean $360 a year.</p> <p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973395774709891226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">From the people that brought you the $650 five-year-old Xbox Series X and the $1000 handheld gaming PC, comes…</p> <p>$30 per month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/they-finally-did-it-fallout-76-is-pretty-good-now-1845315294"><em>Fallout 76</em></a> is going to Ohio, and waiting for players in the new region is none other than the Ghoul from the popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138"><em>Fallout</em> TV show on Amazon</a>. This new expansion, which the devs claim is the biggest map expansion they’ve done yet, is out later this year and also adds bounty hunting, new characters, fresh mutated creatures to kill, and more.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7uCbEFtoNrbecM1hMWtY3u/fallout-76-burning-springs-first-look">Bethesda announced <em>Fallout 76′</em>s next big update,</a> Burning Springs. This new update is set to arrive in early December for all platforms and adds a brand new region to the game’s map. The region is named Burning Springs, hence the name of the update. This area is set in Ohio, a location that we’ve not seen much of in past <em>Fallout</em> media, giving the devs a bit of a blank slate to do whatever they want.&nbsp; And according to the people making it, Burning Springs is directly inspired by <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas.</em></p>

 <p>Here’s a big update video from Bethesda going into more detail about the new region, what players can expect to find there, and more:</p>   <p>“The new region is terrifyingly beautiful and will feel very familiar to fans, drawing its main influences from&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3 </em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>,” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76s-burning-springs-draws-its-main-influences-from-fallout-3-and-fallout-new-vegas-as-players-venture-to-a-whole-new-state-ohio/">creative director Jon Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We wanted it to remind folks of what they came to know and love in <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. And so when we set out to make this new region, the three pillars that we gave to the team were, ‘It’s got to have desert, death claws and Raiders,’ and to me, that captures the tone, the essence, and the danger of those games.”</p>

 <p>While it’s neat that the new area is inspired by past <em>Fallout</em> games, the big news with Burning Springs is that it will directly connect to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>. As mentioned, the Ghoul from the show will be an NPC that people can talk to in <em>Fallout 76′</em>s new region. Located in Highway Town, he will hand out various repeatable bounties to players and is even voiced by Walton Goggins himself. Another example of the show and game syncing up: The free update is launching at around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-teaser-deathclaw-new-vegas-gamescom-2000618496">same time season two of the show is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video</a>. And that’s not an accident.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>© Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>“Burning Springs is in total tonal tandem with <em>Fallout</em> season two, “Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em>. “It is poised to be our biggest update ever, and will coincide with the timing of the premiere of the Amazon <em>Fallout</em> series season two that’s coming this December.”</p>

 <p>The new location in <em>Fallout 76</em> will be added to the Western edge of the current map in a similar way to how the last world expansion, <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/fallout-76-skyline-valley">Skyline Valley</a>, was added in 2024 to the bottom of the map. To access this new area, players will travel across the Point Pleasant Bridge, leaving Appalachia and entering Ohio.</p> <p>Console players will have to wait until December to make that journey to Ohio to meet the Ghoul. But PC players willing to check out the update before launch will be able to start visiting the new region as early as tomorrow, October 2, via <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s testing server. Bethesda also says full patch notes for the big update will arrive at that time, too.</p>
