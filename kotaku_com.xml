              <p>I know we’re all at our limit with tech ventures that the financial powerhouses of the world rapidly rally around as more foundational and beneficial resources to civilization wane. I know we don’t have enough ear space to fill with all the promises of utopian computer advancements that in practice require comical amounts of human intervention. That after all of the crypto, NFTs, AI, video pivots and pets.com collapses, the last thing we need is more gambling on speculative futurist nonsense. But hear me out: what if we fucked with the moon?</p> <p>This week, Deutsche Bank said they are fixing their attention to the “moon economy.” Earth’s lonely little celestial satellite, greeting us each night, shifting the tides and summoning werewolves. Though the grand prize of the 1960s space race, it hasn’t really taken center stage in the human imagination for generations. While we love our big floating space rock, it doesn’t have the potential or allure of Mars, our nearest understudy. The richest among us have begun to feel otherwise.</p>

 <p>Deutsche Bank’s focus is on Intuitive Machines, a Houston-based company developing tech for lunar exploration. They’re primed for the windfall of any moon-bound interest, and Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu says the moon economy “may have just gone through a key inflection point.” Which is to say we’re gearing up for a nitwit-off.</p> <p>Through 2025, the White House stated a renewed interest in moon missions. As part of the Artemis program, the U.S.A. is looking to beat China to the moon for military infrastructure and spycraft securities. That space race has kicked off a second, simultaneous one amongst billionaires. Jeff Bezos announced that Blue Origin is aiming to develop lunar landers for the program. It plays into the tension between NASA and SpaceX, whose progress on their contract has been sluggish.</p>

 <p>Incapable of sitting still, Elon Musk, who previously wrote off the moon as “a distraction,” said he is shifting SpaceX’s focus toward building a “self-growing city” there. It’s a screeching pivot for SpaceX, a company whose sole mission is colonizing Mars. “We can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk posted.</p>

 <p>Obviously government contracts are a financial boon in and of themselves. Much of Musk’s fortune comes from federal arrangements. But what’s the long-term economic benefit of chilling on the moon? Never mind establishing the first space city? As far as space campaigns go, it’s much easier to launch off a low-gravity body than fighting to escape Earth’s orbit and barrier of space junk (though new complications will surely emerge). You probably wouldn’t be surprised to hear this moon situation links up with the current AI situation.</p> <p>You’ve probably noticed AI, for all of its promises, is incredibly expensive. Consumer technology is in disarray as firms get first dibs on microchips. Data center construction is the toothpick holding up the American economy. The use of electricity and water cooling is exhaustive to local infrastructure. To set up camp on the moon would solve… some of that. If you think that sounds risky and untested, you’re correct. Just like current AI ventures, a loose promise is enough to bet the house on.</p>

 <p>The original space race ended on a win, something our current futurists are desperate to secure. It came through sweatbox collaborations between technicians, physicists and experts across all disciplines. It was to prove the capitalist west was greater than the USSR and develop some new rockets along the way, but still required putting that glory before short-term gains. The theme of the last decade has been “why we can’t have nice things.” There are strong use cases for the blockchain, language learning models and moon bases alike. But instead of researching and refining how this tech can secure a better future for all, we’re subjected to useless tchotchkes at the cost of breathable air. Our survival into this century is increasingly beholden to refried futurists, addicted to singular persuasive visions that don’t behave well with reality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-4-is-finally-getting-a-port-wont-be-trapped-on-ps3-2000668326"><em>Metal Gear Solid</em>‘s bandana-furrowing Snake</a> is teaming up with <em>Splinter Cell</em>‘s Sam Fisher and the rest of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>‘s roster as the tactical shooter’s newest operator. After teasing the collaboration earlier this year, Ubisoft finally pulled back the curtain with a reveal trailer that has the two heavyweights of video game espionage bro-ing out before taking down some baddies.</p> <p>The Solid Snake Operator arrives in <em>R6 Siege</em> with Operation Silent Hunt in the new season on March 3. One of the big questions facing the crossover was whether David Hayter, the original voice of Konami’s protagonist (created by Hideo Kojima) would be returning for such a weird and unexpected side project. The new trailer reveals that the answer is “yes.” Fans are relieved but wish Sam Fisher could have been voiced by a returning Michael Ironside as well. Still not in the budget, apparently.</p>

 <p>Here’s the<em> R6 Siege</em>‘s version of Solid Snake in action:</p>  <p>The reveal trailer shows Snake doing Snake stuff like hiding around corners and taking enemies out with a silenced weapon before sending in a smoke grenade and handing out takedowns. Sam Fisher pops up at the end, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upsxB_VxWn0">two embrace <em>Predator</em>-style</a>, and Snake quips about “soldiers like us” never getting a moment’s rest as a new alert pops up on his pager.</p> <p><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> currently has over 70 operators with Sam Fisher, codenamed “Zero,” added all the way back in 2020 as part of Operation Shadow Legacy. Outside of playable characters, the shooter’s past crossover collaborations have included everything from <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and <em>Resident Evil</em> to <em>Tomb Raider</em> and<em> Halo</em>. It’s not <em>Fortnite</em> levels of branded content but, like the people behind all modern live-service games, <em>Siege</em>‘s developers at some point realized how much <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">more money there is in licensed cosmetics than in-universe kits</a>.</p>

 <p>Snake’s arrival is perfectly timed to take advantage of excitement over last year’s<em> Snake Eater</em> remake and the upcoming <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster via the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, coming in August. While it’s not clear yet if Konami will ever give Snake a new adventure, the franchise is alive and well on modern platforms. The same can’t necessarily be said for <em>Splinter Cell</em>. A remake is <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-biggest-game-franchises-are-going-backwards-2000668403">still MIA</a> and it’s been over a decade since <em>Blacklist</em> came out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/edgar-allen-poe-cult-classic-horror-steam-pc-2000669201</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Myst</span></i><span> was the first game to show the world what CD-ROMs were capable of. In the wake of its runaway success, countless new teams emerged to capture the public’s enchantment with PC multimedia, including bigwig Hollywood players. From </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg%27s_Director%27s_Chair"><span>Spielberg</span></a><span> to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Warrior"><span>Shaw Brothers</span></a><span>, they correctly assessed that gaming would have a permanent stake in commercial entertainment, though their FMV-forward approach may have missed the mark. It made the mid-90s’ output of PC gaming a particularly interesting slice. One of the most curious bits of software came from a strange union between Time Warner Interactive and poet William S. Burroughs. It returns this weekend with an official Steam release, albeit under a bizarre new handle.</span></p> <p><span>Originally hitting shelves in 1995, </span><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span> is part point-and-click adventure game, part book report. Visiting your eccentric uncle Edwin, you poke and prod around a drafty manor, uncovering salacious family affairs and playing audience to stop-motion renditions of Edgar Allan Poe’s most famous tales. Not puzzles per se, but navigating around the dreamlike estate is cryptic enough. Add in ashen claymation puppets and narration from Burroughs, whose voice itself is like a gust whirling through the rattling doors of places abandoned, and </span><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span> easily secured a cult status. Like most games from Inscape (such as </span><i><span>Drowned God</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Bad Day on the Midway</span></i><span>), it is as adored as it is difficult to find a hard copy of.</span></p>

  <p><span>This weekend, GMedia brings about an official Steam release of the gothic gem. Running off ScummVM, GMedia promises an authentic experience. With one noticeable change: the game has been renamed as ‘</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4289030/Edgar_Allan_Poes_Interactive_Horror_1995_Edition/"><i><span>Edgar Allan Poe’s Interactive Horror: 1995 Edition</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p> <p><span>Why they’d deke around the original title is no mystery. “</span><a href="https://ulisses-us.com/games/tde/"><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i></a><i><span>“</span></i><span> is trademarked by a long-running and immensely successful German tabletop RPG of the same name. That </span><i><span>Dark Eye</span></i><span> has numerous licensed video games, including a couple from Daedalic Entertainment on Steam. The real intrigue is why GMedia would settle on </span><i><span>this </span></i><span>name in particular. Could have called it <em>Poe’s Dark Mind</em>, <em>The Tell-Tale Heart: A Telltale Games Series</em> or <em>The Cask of A-Supermario</em>. SEO-friendly or not, it’d be nice to say a title ten times fast without becoming the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzd11GMBONg"><span>Micro Machines guy</span></a><span>.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span>’s resurrection is part of an altogether pleasant trend. A surge of oddball bygone PC games have been made more accessible lately through fan translations, patches and even official Steam releases. Only four years ago, Tomomi Sakuba’s notoriously menacing </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946430/Garage_Bad_Dream_Adventure/"><i><span>Garage: Bad Dream Adventure</span></i></a><span> reemerged on modern hardware with quality-of-life features and multiple new translations.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can pick up </span><i><span>The Dar</span></i><span>…Sorry, you can pick up</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4289030/Edgar_Allan_Poes_Interactive_Horror_1995_Edition/"><i><span> Edgar Allan Poe’s Interactive Horror: 1995 Edition Colon Computer Software For Home Device This Year Today</span></i></a><span> as of Sunday on Steam.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-layers-fear-3-bloober-team-trailer-2000669193</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It wasn’t their first game, but exactly ten years ago the world was introduced to the Polish studio Bloober Team through </span><i><span>Layers of Fear</span></i><span>. On the heels of the </span><i><span>P.T.</span></i><span> heartbreak, 2016’s </span><i><span>Layers of Fear</span></i><span> was a pared down, first-person psychological horror game concerning a painter suffering from a bout of Poe-inspired madness. Effective visuals and novel jump scares put Bloober Team on the road to a buffet of projects, including the 2024 remake of </span><i><span>Silent Hill 2</span></i><span>. In late January, </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-rose-teaser-countdown"><span>Bloober Team began teasing</span></a><span> a new project. This weekend that curtain pulled back to reveal </span><i><span>Layers of Fear 3</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>The new teaser is live action, featuring a man who splits the difference between Peter Stormare in </span><i><span>Constantine</span></i><span> and Jeff Daniels in </span><i><span>The Martian</span></i><span> (but dubbed like a Disneyland actor’s Hannibal Lecter). At first it appears we’re back to basics. A man huffing roses, reading William Blake poems and enjoying the fireside company of spooky paintings from previous games. A lunchtime alarm from a smart watch betrays the fact that we’re currently set in the present, whereas previous games lingered well into the past.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the original </span><i><span>Layers of Fear</span></i><span> you played as a painter whose descent into his rat-infested estate and collection of grisly paintings suggested your antagonist did some not-so-nice stuff to the people around him. It featured impressive visuals and made frequent use of Bloober Team’s trademark “the room changes like crazy when your back is turned” thing. </span><i><span>Layers of Fear 2</span></i><span> stuck the formula in a new setting, a cruise ship where your mysterious character recounts the cursed production of a 1940s film. The novel setting, nods to early cinema and Tony Todd couldn’t save its tangled, unfocussed plot. A big step down from its predecessor, but their flagship series is hardly the main story for Bloober Team anymore.</span></p>  <p><span>The studio has racked up a huge portfolio in a very short time. They’ve strayed far from their comfort zone with </span><i><span>The Medium</span></i><span> and last year’s dark science fiction game </span><i><span>Cronos: The New Dawn</span></i><span>. Their </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/layers-of-fear-review-2023-release-date-ps5-1850541040"><span>batting average</span></a><span> is just as wily. The 2019 </span><i><span>Blair Witch</span></i><span> video game adaptation is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6jz2gSq7cc"><span>likely their worst</span></a><span>, trading the film’s thick tension and ambiguities for slimy out-of-pocket shock value. That made it all the more surprising when their highest-stakes project, a remake of the most beloved survival horror game of all time, was…good! </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><span>Their </span><i><span>Silent Hill 2</span></i><span> beat the haters</span></a><span>, myself included.</span></p>

 <p><span>With an unexpected </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-townfall-konami-trailer-sony-state-of-play-2000668337"><i><span>Silent Hill</span></i><span> renaissance in full swing</span></a><span> and Bloober Team’s remake of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-remake-2-f-bloober-team-cronos-2000630590"><span>the first game en route</span></a><span>, a countdown from January caught people’s attention. The teaser’s rose pattern motif made some fans speculate that Bloober was gearing to tackle </span><i><span>Rule of Rose</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/moon-designer-credits-toby-fox-with-motivating-western-1844918786"><span>Yoshiro Kimura’s</span></a><span> long-lost and controversial PS2 survival horror game about a most unpleasant orphanage. Kimura, who released </span><a href="https://straychildren.com/en/"><i><span>Stray Children</span></i></a><span> last year, has floated the idea of a rerelease in newsletters while re-emphasizing that it’d be tricky.</span></p>

 <p><span>Instead, “rose” seems to be referring to all manner of subjects in the teaser. A potential object of affection. A pull from the Blake poem. A literal flower. We’ll learn just how bad we’re going to go for this rose when </span><i><span>Layers of Fear 3</span></i><span> eventually drops in the near future.</span></p>
