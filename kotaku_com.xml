              <p>Following <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">a number of high-profile streamers stating they had had enough of a new plague of cheating</a> in extraction shooter hit&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, developers Embark have responded with word that “significant changes” are coming to try to address the issues.</p> <p>Posting to the official Discord for the game, Embark’s community lead OssenJ assured players that the developer was aware of the conversation, and “taking this issue very seriously.” Assuring that feedback was being heard, she continues, “Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters.”</p>

 <p>It seems Embark was a little slow in responding to the growth of cheating due to much of the team being away for winter vacation, and having to play catch-up on their return. However, with everyone back hopefully things will start changing. The plans include “updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans,” and speaking directly to one of the main sources of complaint, “applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the ‘out of map’ glitch.” There are also plans to bring in measures and tools for streamers to “help mitigate stream sniping”—the issue where players can see where streamers are on a map and what they’re doing, and using this to the sniper’s advantage.</p>

Alongside the likes of Ninja and Shroud yelling at Embark to improve things, Nadeshot argued that the only hope he sees is for the studio to put into practice the tactics of Epic, where legal action is threatened (and carried out) against those who supply cheating software and aids. Others pointed out Epic is a multi-billion dollar company with the <em>Fortnite</em> infinite money machine, whereas Embark is a small-ish Swedish developer on their second game. However, Embark is a subsidiary of Korean firm Nexon, which itself is worth around $20 billion, so it’s not&nbsp;<em>impossible</em>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My experience on Arc Raiders over the last week has been hell. Just to be clear, I love this game and think it’s already moved in to my personal top 10 all time.</p> <p>But the egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be worse than peak Call of Duty. I’m not trying to bring…</p> <p>— 100T Nadeshot (@Nadeshot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given the anti-cheating measures are due “over the next few weeks,” we won’t immediately know how much improvement they bring. And for the less violent players, it’s likely you are being matchmade with other PvE-orientated players, and as such completely avoiding any cheating altogether.</p>
