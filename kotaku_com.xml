            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Google's Pixel 9 brings flagship AI, exceptional camera tech and all-day power - at a record low price.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Amazon just delivered a serious blow to Google by chopping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/">the Pixel 9 128GB down to an all-time low of $544 on its own platform</a>. This unlocked smartphone is normally $799, but you <strong>can currently get it for 32% off</strong> which places Google’s flagship in the same price bracket as mid-tier Android devices. The irony isn’t lost here: Amazon is making Google’s premium phone more affordable than Google ever has.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Google’s Flagship Gets the Budget Phone Treatment</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9 is equipped with a <strong>large 6.3-inch Actua display</strong> for sharp visuals-be it when scrolling through social media or watching videos on a commute. This screen size comes as a sweet spot: big enough for comfortable viewing and compact enough to be managed by one hand when you juggle coffee and groceries. Display technology ensures colors pop without the oversaturated look that some phones push just a bit too hard and gives you an accurate representation whether editing photos or simply browsing.</p>
<p>Under the hood, you get 128GB of storage (which works out to about 30,000 photos) or several dozen apps, before you have to start thinking about cloud backup. In many ways, the<strong> 24-hour battery life</strong> lets you leave your charger at home without anxiety for a full workday and into an evening out. Google achieved this by combining power management on its processors with display optimization that adapts to whatever you’re doing, whether that’s reading email or streaming content.</p>



<p>Where the <strong>Pixel 9 really earns its keep is in the camera system</strong>: The heavy lifting is done through Google’s computational photography which means the phone is processing multiple exposures in milliseconds to create shots that look professionally edited straight out of the camera app. Night photography becomes actually useable rather than a grainy mess, thanks to algorithms that brighten shadows while keeping highlights in check.</p>
<p><strong>Integration with Gemini</strong> places Google’s AI assistant right into the core of your workflow: You can ask it to summarize long email threads, draft responses with a specific tone, or pull information from your photos and documents without having to jump between apps. This is not just a repackaged voice assistant; it understands context from your screen and can help with tasks like planning trips by scanning flight confirmations and suggesting activities based on your destination.</p>



<p>What’s great is that <strong>unlocked means you are not tied to any carrier’s payment plan</strong> or restrictions. You can switch providers without dealing with unlock requests or compatibility issues, and international travel is easier, as you can just pop in a local SIM card. This flexibility alone can save you hundreds over a two-year period compared to locked alternatives that charge premium rates for roaming.</p>
<p>Right now, you’re paying just $565 for flagship specs and Google’s best camera tech; that’s less than what many mid-range phones sell for.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-saw-at-playstation%E2%80%99s-japan-centric-state-of-play.1350547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Sony held a State of Play showcase to talk about upcoming PlayStation 5 games, but this one was a little different. This one was specifically focused on Japan-developed games, as well as projects from other Asian studios. The State of Play Japan showcase was hosted by <em>Ys&nbsp;</em>actor Yuki Kaji, and was only streamed in Japanese, even in other territories. It did have English subtitles, though, so if you want to watch the 40-minute presentation, you can do so below. If you just want the highlights, though, we’ve got you covered.</p>

  <h2><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagining</em></h2>  <p>Kicking off the show was&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII Remastered</em>. I don’t know why I was surprised that the trailer was in English. I guess I just assumed the “Japanese audio with English subtitles” extended to the trailers as well. But anyway, we saw a pretty story-heavy trailer of this from-the-ground-up reimagining of <em>Dragon Quest VII</em>. The game is coming out on February 5.</p>

 <h2><em>inKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories</em></h2>  <p>Next up is a management sim&nbsp;called&nbsp;<em>inKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories</em>, in which the player runs a corner store. You’ll manage your merchandise, chat with customers, and collect stuff from the vending machines in April 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Coffee Talk Tokyo</em></h2> <p>The next entry in the coffee shop social simulator series&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk Tokyo</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like. You’ll make coffee for patrons in a cyberpunk Tokyo on March 5.</p> <h2><em>BrokenLore</em></h2>  <p>Two new games in the&nbsp;<em>BrokenLore </em>horror series are coming. The first is <em>Unfollow</em>, which is all about the dark side of social media. It’s coming on January 16. The next entry will be called <em>BrokenLore: Ascend</em>, and will have a focus on vertical climbing movement. It will launch next summer.</p>

  <h2><em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly</em></h2>  <p>Sony decided to get a bunch of spooky stuff out of the way at once, as next up is a remake of <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly </em>helmed by <em>Dead or Alive </em>and <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>developer Team Ninja.&nbsp;Yeah, that shit looks as creepy as it did on the PS2. The remake will launch on March 12.</p>

 <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em></h2>  <p>Koei Tecmo also showed off a new DLC for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>called <em>Visions of Four Heroes</em>. It launches on January 22.</p> <h2><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey, at least one of the teams under PlayStation Studios is here for the show. Polyphony Digital showed up with the <em>Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack</em>, which will add new racing modes to the game later this year.</p>

 <h2>Rapid-fire announcements</h2>  <p>Next up we saw a few smaller games like <em>MotionRec</em>, a sci-fi puzzle platformer,&nbsp;<em>Wandering Sword</em>, an HD-2D RPG set in ancient China, the PS4 and PS5 release of <em>No Sleep For Kadame Date –&nbsp;AI The Somnium Files</em>, and <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2>Bandai Namco’s DLC minute</h2>  <p>Bandai Namco had a few DLCs to announce for some of its games. First up was&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Katamari</em>, which is getting two DLC packs with new levels, cosmetics, and music. <em>Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac&nbsp;</em>is getting&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>levels, which are available today.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>‘s first DLC includes a new story chapter that adds five new Digimon to the roster, and is coming this winter. <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> is getting its first collab DLC, which adds characters from&nbsp;<em>Kamen Rider</em>.</p> <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h2> <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is also getting some DLC. The Free Title Update 4 will launch on December 16, and adds more monsters to hunt and additions to the RPG’s endgame.</p> <h2><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></h2> <p>Because the crossover slop never ends,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds&nbsp;</em>is getting more crossover characters as DLC from&nbsp;<em>Nights</em> and <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>. It’ll also get Tangle and Whisper, some lesser-known <em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters. Oh yeah, and the Spongebob pack is coming on November 19. Blah.</p>

 <h2><em>Never Grave: The Witch and the Curse</em></h2>  <p>Next up is&nbsp;<em>Never Grave: The Witch and the Curse</em>, an action platformer that looks like the kind of thing you’d play if&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>just wasn’t enough torment for you. The game will launch on March 5.</p> <h2><em>Blazblue: Entropy Effect X</em></h2>  <p>I see Arc System Works’ logo and I perk up. The studio is making a new entry in the <em>Blazblue: Entropy Effect </em>subseries with <em>Entropy Effect X</em>. The action platformer has the team’s incredible visual flare and looks super challenging. It will launch on February 12.</p>

 <h2>More rapid fire game updates</h2>  <p>Nextt we got another series of bite-sized looks at some smaller games. First up is twin-stick shooter/platformer <em>Damon and Baby</em>, followed by a new Prinny-infested action RPG from the <em>Disgaea </em>team called <em>Kyouran Makaism</em>.&nbsp;<em>Fate Trigger</em>, a fast-paced hero shooter featuring ten distinct playable characters, wrapped up the segment.</p> <h2><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></h2>  <p>Damn. The host mentioned a beloved Square Enix series and my&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>copium started up. But no, instead we got a new look at <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>. It sure looks like one of those! Square Enix has released a demo that will allow you to carry over your saved data to the main game when it launches on December 4.</p> <h2><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em></h2>  <p>Now that’s the Arc System Works game I wanted to see. The studio’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marvel&nbsp;</em>game is putting an anime fighter spin on the comic book icons.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is getting a new beta test that will include new stages and add Spider-Man and Ghost Rider as playable characters. The test will take place from December 5 to 7.</p>

 <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>  <p>Bandai Namco wasn’t done with DLC, actually.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>got its own special little segment for its&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>expansion. If you and your friends are ready to head back into The Lands Between, you can do so December 4.</p> <p>Oh, that was the end? Alrighty then. RIP to the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>fans who were holding their breath. We’ll do this whole song and dance again at The Game Awards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A highly advanced AI-powered robot took a tumble in Russia during a technology presentation. Unfortunately for the robot and its creators, the fall happened while the <em>Rocky</em> theme song played, and it was all recorded and shared online.</p> <p>On November 11, <a href="https://unn.ua/en/news/in-russia-the-first-humanoid-robot-fell-at-a-presentation-it-was-covered-from-the-audience">AIdol showcased some AI-powered autonomous robots</a> at the Yarovit Hall Congress Center in Moscow. <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063641">Photos from the event</a> posted by the <em>Moscow City News Agency</em> show that the company had a few different robots on hand for the event, letting people get up close to them, take selfies, and <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063641">even kiss the creepy-looking bots</a>.</p>

 <p>However, at some point during the event, one of the robots was presented on stage and began to walk like someone who had had one too many drinks. Just a few moments later, <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063636">the bot crashed forward</a> onto the floor, leaving broken bits of plastic and metal on the ground. After the fall, someone tried to use a black curtain to cover up what had happened, but the curtain was twisted up, and it took far too long to hide the situation. While all of this happened, inexplicably, it sounds like the <em>Rocky</em> theme song was playing in the background. Let’s watch:</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4aqzua5vsewimmusg66fyajl/app.bsky.feed.post/3m5eso76zcs2a" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigiz35sfxgm3s6kshx57kkxjdzsxt26i7zvwddao2cgjnallgr3zm"> <p lang="en">Joke of the day from Moscow: Russia tried to unveil its first humanoid AI robot, Aidol. Key word: tried. The robot collapsed during its debut, forcing organizers to cut the presentation short. Their rushed attempt to lift the prop only made things worse.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4aqzua5vsewimmusg66fyajl?ref_src=embed">NOELREPORTS (@noelreports.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4aqzua5vsewimmusg66fyajl/post/3m5eso76zcs2a?ref_src=embed">2025-11-11T18:53:03.008Z</a></p></blockquote></div>   <p>Folks, I couldn’t write a comedic skit that funny if you sat me in a room and pointed a gun at me. This is top-tier comedy. In fact, it was so funny that I wasn’t sure it was real. I mean, there was that <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/13/hi-tech-robot-on-russian-state-tv-turns-out-to-be-a-fraud/">fake robot back in 2018</a> in Russia that turned out to be a man in a suit. Perhaps this was fake, too? But looking around, it does seem like this event happened and was covered by a news agency in Moscow.&nbsp; This is all a bit embarrassing for the folks involved, but at least the robot never stepped on a Lego and <a href="https://b1.mskagency.ru/c/1119897.jpg">screamed in pain…oh no!</a></p>
