              <p>As the Trump administration continues to ramp up ICE raids across the country, the Department of Homeland Security is increasingly trying to subpoena personal information on anonymous internet users who are trying to protest the agency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/dhs-anti-ice-social-media.html">according to <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p> <p>It reports that Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta have received hundreds of administrative subpoenas from the Department of Homeland Security in recent months. The goal is to get information on the identities of people behind accounts found to be tracking ICE agent movements or criticizing the group as it carries out its operations, during which officers have <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/ice-deaths-shootings-2026/">killed at least two people so far in 2026</a>.</p>

 <p><em>The New York Times</em> claims that Google, Meta, and Reddit have complied with “some” of the requests. It’s unclear if Discord has done the same.</p> <p>The gaming platform has frequently been subpoenaed by publishers looking for details on users sharing confidential information or pirating games. One of those was <em>Arc Raiders</em> distributor Nexon. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271854/discord-nexon-dmca-subpoena-copyright-piracy">Discord argued in legal filings back in 2024</a> that user privacy was legally protected by the constitution. Complying with the order, the company wrote, could violate its users’ “decisions to remain anonymous, an aspect of their freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.”</p>

 <p>Reddit, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1qd6qir/ice_trackers/">has been flooded</a> with people sharing information about ICE movements and facilities in their communities as people are disappeared off the streets. While agents remain masked and their identities kept hidden, ICE has been using <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-is-using-a-new-facial-recognition-app-to-identify-people-leaked-emails-show/">facial scanning technology</a> and other surveillance tools to <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/13/ice-using-private-data-to-intimidate-observers-and-activists-advocates-say">doxx people they don’t like in real time</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>YouTuber and Let’s Player Seán William “Jacksepticeye” McLoughlin has apologized for criticizing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-about-finding-the-meaning-of-famil-1840491727"><i><span>Life Is Strange 2</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> political commentary when he played the game on his channel back in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When Don’t Nod released </span><i><span>Life Is Strange 2</span></i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/im-not-sure-if-binging-life-is-strange-2-is-the-right-m-1840392293"><span>episodically over the course of 2019</span></a><span>, it attempted to tackle a wide array of political issues such as police brutality, racism, and immigration through the eyes of two Mexican-American brothers named Sean and Daniel. The pair spend the episodic adventure game on the run from law enforcement after a Seattle cop kills their father and Daniel’s latent telekinetic powers activate and kill the officer. As they walk through the United States, they’re confronted with all sorts of racism, abuse, and systemic failures.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Life Is Strange 2</span></i><span> throws any pretense of not being a political story out the window before the first episode is over, and while this was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/you-should-play-life-is-strange-2-1840213387"><span>a subject of praise for a lot of critics</span></a><span> seven years ago, it was also a point of contention for players who thought its commentary was forced or heavyhanded. Well, a lot has happened in the years since, and it’s harder to deny just how true to life </span><i><span>Life Is Strange 2</span></i><span> was. McLoughlin, who played through the whole game in 2019, signed off on the final episode of his Let’s Play critiquing Don’t Nod’s writing as “pushing one very specific agenda,” though he admitted he was “not the type of person to tackle these sort of political issues” and wasn’t trying to “downplay” the realities of being brown in America.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“I feel like there’s a lot more depth to this than you’re really tackling,” McLoughlin said. “I hope I’m not coming across as ignorant or anything because that’s not what I’m trying to say. If anything, I want to learn more about it. I want to get into it and I want to understand what’s going on a lot more but these things just don’t really shine a light on it that much. If anything it is just shining a light on it and then taking the light off immediately. It does suck that this stuff happens in the real world and I really wish it didn’t. Humans are complicated and a lot of humans are fucked up and have no empathy at all but hopefully we we get to a better place soon and hopefully things don’t get worse before they get better.”</span></p>  <p><span>Well, it seems the </span><i><span>Life Is Strange </span></i><span>community didn’t forget McLoughlin’s criticism, as a thread recently started circulating on X asking fans to offer up “the worst </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span> takes” they’d seen, and </span><a href="https://x.com/D_I_D_I_A_Z/status/2023735659916063088?s=20"><span>one fan responded</span></a><span>, “White men playing</span><i><span> Life Is Strange 2</span></i><span> and calling it unrealistic and too political.” Another fan tagged McLoughlin and said they were still waiting for an apology from the YouTuber for his comments in 2019, and McLoughlin </span><a href="https://x.com/Jacksepticeye/status/2023875097749344713?s=20"><span>replied</span></a><span> by apologizing and admitting he had been “naive.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did I really say that? Jesus! I'm sorry. How naive I was. I've learned a great deal in the last 8 years</p> <p>— Jacksepticeye (@Jacksepticeye) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jacksepticeye/status/2023875097749344713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While McLoughlin said back in 2019 that he hoped things wouldn’t get worse before they got better in America, they unfortunately have, and as more stories have come out about ICE’s violent treatment of immigrants and the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/17/ice-holds-people-in-disgusting-conditions-now-its-turning-warehouses-into-camps"><span>abhorrent conditions of the camps where it’s holding detained individuals</span></a><span>, it’s become harder for anyone to deny the state of things in this country. </span><i><span>Life Is Strange 2</span></i><span> wasn’t overly political, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123"><span>it was actually pretty honest</span></a><span> about how </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>cartoonishly evil these people are</span></a><span>.

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Devs ‘Focused On Delivering Updates’ Amid Radio Silence]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">As<em> Highguard</em></a> approaches its one-month anniversary, the hero shooter’s future is harder than ever to discern. But despite dwindling player numbers and recent layoffs, the developers are still working on getting the multiplayer game’s next update out.</p> <p>There’s been relative radio silence from Wildlight Entertainment since <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">mass layoffs</a> at the California-based studio last week. Then, when <em>Highguard</em>‘s website went down yesterday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734">people began to assume the worst</a>. The studio declined to comment on the status of the game when <em>Kotaku</em> reached out, but now a developer on the <em>Highguard</em> Discord has given remaining players a scrap of insight into where things are at.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000670636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670636"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670636">Discord</figcaption></figure> <p>“Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified,” moderator WL_Coronach wrote in response to a fan asking about the website being down. “Low priority atm (reputational damage already done). Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve.”</p> <p>What exactly those updates consist of remains to be seen. Wildlight was in the midst of delivering on its “Episode 2” commitments when everyone outside of a “core” team was laid off last week. An ambitious, year-long roadmap shared at launch is likely being completely overhauled at this point. One of the big questions is just how much of this content was already pretty far along or sitting in queue versus having to be built from scratch.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000670634" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670634"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670634">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>The big additions to <em>Highguard</em> thus far have been a new playable hero and a 5v5 mode, as well as the option to do 3v3 ranked. While initial criticisms of the game have called for portions of its resource gathering and flag capturing phases to be reworked, what existing players probably want more than anything are additional characters and loot. The game launched with a starting roster of only eight. In 5v5, the more popular of the two modes, that’s a lot of repeats. The gun and gear pools are also pretty light.</p>

 <p>It’s hard to imagine any number of new guns or characters pulling <em>Highguard</em> out of its current live-service tailspin. With time and resources, there’s a strong foundation that Wildlight could build on. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790">But if money</a> is already evaporating and players aren’t spending much on the free-to-play game’s marketplace, it’s hard to imagine it having the runway necessary to mount a real comeback.</p>
