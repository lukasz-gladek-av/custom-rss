              <p>Dell is a bit of a favorite when it comes to Windows laptops. They offer options for every budget but it’s rare to find one priced under $1,000. So, if you’re in the mood to hit the jackpot, there’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/">currently a Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Windows 11 Pro, AMD Ryzen 7 7730U) valued at $3,000 going for $799 on Amazon</a>—talk about a huge deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Buy That Dell Laptop?</h2>
<p>This laptop comes with a <strong>15.6-inch widescreen display that delivers Full HD visuals</strong> with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels. The screen uses Wide Viewing Angle technology, which means the colors stay crisp and accurate even when you’re not looking at the screen head-on. Furthermore, the anti-glare coating reduces reflections so you don’t strain your eyes doing work in a brightly lit room or near a window. The thin bezels on the sides of the screen give you more screen space without interruptions, and the LED backlight shines on the screen without wasting power so your battery will last longer.</p>
<p>The brain behind this machine is the <strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor, which clocks 4.5 GHz</strong> at its best: It’s optimized to provide snappy performance without draining the battery. So, if you’re doing work life seriously or studying, it won’t slow you down, and you’ll get decent battery life for it.</p>



<p>Internally, the laptop comes with 32GB of RAM which is the memory that enables your computer to have several programs open at the same time without lagging. Put simply, the more RAM you have, the more smoothly things go when switching between tasks or working with large files. This laptop’s generous memory puts you ready to handle demanding programs, so you won’t find yourself waiting around for things to load. Besides that, it also comes with a generous 1TB solid-state drive where all of your apps and documents reside.</p>
<p>You’ll be running Windows 11 Pro, the professional version of Microsoft’s latest operating system. It’s designed for business and serious users and offers strong security features along with tools that make managing your work easier.</p>
<p>What makes this deal even sweeter is the bundle of accessories included: You get a <strong>stylus pen for easy touchscreen operation</strong>, a camera privacy cover to ensure your privacy during video calls, <strong>a 128GB USB flash drive for extra portable storage</strong>, a <strong>dust plug</strong> to ensure the ports remain free from dust, a carrying sleeve for protective transport of the laptop, and a microfiber cleaning cloth to have everything spick and span.</p>
<p>This deal won’t last forever, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

              <p><span>We love to say that every Pokémon is probably somebody’s favorite, but the way Game Freak </span><a href="https://x.com/GatorEXP/status/1963942694859780583"><span>suddenly started going really hard on Malamar</span></a><span>, the squid-like creature whose claim to fame is its bizarre evolution requirement that makes you hold your 3DS upside down while its pre-evolution form, Inkay, levels up, had the makings of a propaganda psyop that I would not fall for. Since last week, The Pokémon Company has been </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1963588689684017623"><span>posting videos</span></a><span> and sending out care packages showing an uncharacteristic level of adoration for the squid. I love a good bit, and I like that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is leaning more into a memetic absurdism instead of a squeaky-clean, family-friendly image. So I had to wonder, what was this all leading to? It turns out, Malamar is one of the old Pokémon getting new love in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> with a Mega Evolution.</span></p>  <p><span>The live-action trailer reveals that all this excitement is due to a Malamar, which has gone into overdrive after it mega-evolved, using its hypnosis on the citizens of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world. Once the ‘mon changes forms, it can hypnotize people to the point of completely changing their personalities. Its appearance is a bit more slender than in its base form, and its body becomes luminescent, emitting a rainbow light that seems to be the source of its hypnotic abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>It’s nice that more obscure Pokémon are getting Mega Evolutions in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. Dragonite and Victreebel are cool additions, but we can always use more non-Generation I representation when giving old Pokémon new forms. I do wonder, though, if the game will find some way to implement Malamar’s signature odd evolution style into the Mega Evolution. Maybe you’ll have to hold your Switch or Switch 2 upside down to acquire its Mega Stone when the game launches on October 16.</span></p>

              <p>As has been much rumored over the last couple of weeks, an hour-long Nintendo Direct has now been officially confirmed for September 12. That’s Friday of this week, if you’ve lost track of your calendar. It’s timed to fall the day before Mario’s 40th birthday (well, the 40th birthday of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>at least, Mario himself did exist prior to that), so it seems likely that’ll be at least part of the focus. Of course, there’s also a lot of expectation around <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p> <p>It’s obviously a very big deal for Nintendo that the franchise that turned Mario into a superstar and that coincided with the company invading Americans’ homes with the NES is turning the big four-zero, so it’s enormously unfortunate that this should have fallen on a Saturday. Presumably the console company has at least <em>something</em> cute to announce for the occasion, even if it’s not the next big&nbsp;<em>Super Mario</em> game we’re all hoping for, but it would get lost if announced over the weekend. The next choice would then be Thursday, Nintendo’s preferred day for Directs, and close enough that it could still create enough buzz for the big day. It’s just, this Thursday is September 11, and pretty much everyone knows it’s a disastrous day to announce anything as people will find some sort of negative association with the events from 24 years ago. So that pretty much left the company with Friday.</p> <p>As for what will be revealed, we have very little idea. Obviously what everyone wants to hear is news on a follow-up to Switch launch game <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, but given the team behind it was responsible for the just-released&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, that doesn’t seem enormously likely. Possible, though! Nintendo is notoriously secretive, and if the team was split into two, or a whole new group were given responsibility for the aging plumber, there might be something to reveal for this holiday season? I’m just wildly hoping at this point.</p>

 <p>Of course, Nintendo has approximately 32 million different&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> franchises, and it would be ridiculous if there weren’t something to reveal for at least one of them. Hopefully not yet another remastering, but maybe a new 2D&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> platformer? Maybe a new&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario</em>? That’d be sweet.</p> <p>The other big game about which we’ve heard almost nothing is&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. We know the game is close to done, because it keeps getting rated in various countries around the world, but there’s not been an official word on a possible release date. I bet my bottom that this gets revealed on Friday, perhaps with an announcement for a forthcoming <em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>Direct, given that seems to be the current approach. If it&nbsp;<em>weren’t</em> to be mentioned in this week’s Direct, then everyone will start to get extremely squirrely.</p> <p>Given the Direct has no given theme, it’s possible that there could be all manner of holiday game announcements. Let’s hope so! In the meantime, you can camp the live stream right now. It’s all due to start 9 a.m. ET on September 12.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-libra-nerf-deep-night-2000624624</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-major-changes-ahead-of-new-ultra-hard-end-game-mode.1293537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been a while since FromSoftware made any big changes to<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em> but today’s patch brings a surprising number of significant tweaks. It’s full of bug fixes, character reworks, and other changes players will want to be aware of before descending into the multiplayer roguelite’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">new Deep of Night endgame mode</a> that goes live Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Anyone who’s been paying attention to the datamined leaks around Deep of Night will know it’s a multi-level retooling of the regular game that adds <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989">much more challenging enemies</a> as well as debuffs that weigh players down as they journey through Limveld. Successful runs will build players’ ranks, helping them to reach lower depths where enemy health and power keeps getting multiplied. I expect it to be like hitting a brick wall, otherwise known as playing E<em>lden Ring Nightreign</em> during that first week after it launched.</p> <p>But the patch notes for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1022">today’s 1.02.2 update</a> reveal important changes to the rest of the game as well.</p>

 <h2>Night Tide’s damage is going up after the second night</h2> <p>It’s become common for players to kill the second boss in each run and then run around the map taking damage from the rain to clean up a few loose ends or get that last level needed to reach 15. FromSoftware is trying to put and end to that by jacking up how much damage players take from the rain before ascending to take on the Nightlord.</p> <h2>The icon for Holy damage finally looks different from lightning</h2> <p>One of the cruelest tricks Nightreign played was making its first boss weak to holy and then making the holy symbol look indistinguishable from the lightning one. Months later, seasoned players might still confuse the symbols when rapidly scrolling through their inventories. To fix that, the symbol now has an orange hue (lightning is more green) and has more visible balls of light orbiting the blade. Hallelujah. It only took four months!</p>

 <h2>ED Libra finally got nerfed</h2> <p>The hardest boss in the game is getting dialed down a bit. I’d love to know what the clear rate was on Everdark Sovereign Libra compared to the rest. The goat summoned Condemned warriors to fight on its behalf who were copies of the players facing him. Those Condemned will now have less damage negation when being re-summoned, drop light shards that buff players more, and be less likely to dodge ranged attacks. The Guardian version will do less damage and all of them will target players differently, presumably meaning that they’ll actually attack Libra when he performs the Rioting ritual.</p> <h2>Targeting will be less finicky</h2> <p><em>Nightreign</em>‘s targeting system is terrible. It doesn’t activate unless your character is facing the target and it can get very sticky when you’re trying to quickly switch. One important fix, though, will help alleviate one source of constant lock-on pain, at least for PC players: “Fixed a bug where it was difficult to switch targets with a diagonal input.”</p>

 <h2>Lots of Relic changes</h2> <p>Here are the ones that stand out</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>Adjusted the effect “[Wylder] Standard attacks enhanced with fiery follow-ups when using Character Skill (greatsword only)” to consume stamina when performing follow-up attacks.</li> <li>Increased the attack power of the “[Wylder] Art activation spreads fire in area” burn effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “Continuous HP Recovery” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “[Recluse] Activating Ultimate Art raises Max HP” effect.</li> <li>Changed the “[Recluse] Activating Ultimate Art raises Max HP” effect so that the HP increase persists until an attack is received, even after the art’s duration ends.</li> <li>Increased the amount of Runes obtained through the “Critical Hits Earn Runes” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “HP Restoration upon (specific weapon type) attacks” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the effect “FP Restoration upon (specific weapon type) attacks” effect.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>Guardians are getting buffed</h2> <p>FromSoftware is throwing the weakest class a bone or three. Guardians will get better strength and dexterity gains as they level, better attack on Halberd guard counters, and higher range on their ultimate art’s attack. All of this should help them be much more effective in the early game while being even tankier in the final boss fights.</p> <h2>There might actually be penalties for leaving games now</h2> <p>I wrote <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-leave-abandon-penalty-matchmaking-1851785434">all the way back in July</a> that <em>Nightreign</em>‘s penalty system for disconnecting felt fake. Players left all the time and never reported getting temporarily banned from matchmaking. Well, that’s about to change. “Disconnecting from a session due to network issues or quitting the game during a session in progress will result in penalties, which may limit multiplayer capabilities,” the new patch notes read. “Rejoining the session you left will remove the penalty imposed upon disconnection.”</p> <p>The timing couldn’t be better because I have a feeling a ton of players are about to start rage-quitting their Deep of Night runs.</p>

              <p>September is the best month to score amazing laptop deals, thanks to the back-to-school season.

<h2>Supercharged HP Laptop</h2>
<p>This HP laptop comes with the latest Intel <strong>13th</strong> <strong>Gen i7-1355U processor (reaching up to 5.0GHz) and with 10 cores and 12 threads</strong>. That simply means it can keep pace with everything you do. It’s paired with Intel Iris Xe Graphics so the visuals are sharp and silky.</p>
<p>With <strong>64GB of DDR4 RAM and a spacious 2TB SSD</strong>, you’ll never be held back by this laptop no matter how many programs you have running or how much data you’re storing.</p>
<p>What’s more, the laptop is only 3.5 pounds and 0.73 inches thick so it won’t smother your bag or take up too much space. The 15.6-inch touchscreen screen is also very comfortable and bright with full HD resolution (1920 by 1080 pixels) and 300 nits of brightness: everything will stand out and look alive.</p>



<p>When it comes to staying in touch, this laptop has it all covered: It has Wi-Fi 6, which keeps the internet fast and consistent, and Bluetooth 5.3 for rapid pairing with your wireless devices. The camera is excellent for work meetings or online lessons, thanks to HP’s True Vision HD Camera that features a Privacy Guard for keeping things safe. The audio system is optimized for crisp and well-balanced sound so calls and video are clear without the use of headphones.</p>
<p>One of the standout features is the <strong>new Copilot key that launches Microsoft’s AI assistant</strong>. You can get help summarizing reports, pulling out insights or automating tedious tasks – all at the touch of a button. Based on Windows 11 Pro, this laptop comes with enhanced security features and tools that business users will appreciate.</p>
<p>Do not delay—September’s the time when it is worth grabbing it before it goes up in price again.</p>

This deal includes and Amazon gift card for $100 and you can upgrade from the base storage to double capacity for no extra charge.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4018/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
