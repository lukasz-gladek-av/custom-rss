              <p>Earlier this month, McDonald’s Netherlands put out an ugly and lifeless Christmas commercial that was created using AI generation tools. Over the weekend, after the ad spot went viral online for all the wrong reasons, the fast-food chain deleted it.</p> <p>Recently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/coca-cola-ai-tv-commerical-ad-coke-generated-holiday-1851700865">McDonald’s followed in the footsteps of Coca-Cola</a> and released <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1998108853444169807">a new AI-generated advertisement</a> just in time for the holiday season. The ad features numerous AI-generated scenes of people dealing with all the horrible, annoying, and not-so-great moments that can happen during this time of year. It’s genuinely a funny little idea for an ad, but it’s hard to watch and enjoy when it’s so clearly AI-generated.</p>

 <p>This is normally the part where I’d embed the ad via an official source, like the McDonald’s YouTube account. But, <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/mcdonalds-ai-generated-commercial">as spotted by <em>Futurism</em></a>, I can’t do that because the fast food company has seemingly removed it entirely from the internet, a step it took after previously shutting down comments on the ad. So here’s a reupload of it via the YouTube channel CongenAI:</p>

  <p>Perhaps the wildest part of all of this is that the studio behind the awful-looking AI ad claimed that it crunched for weeks to produce this slop. Seriously. <a href="https://80.lv/articles/mcdonald-s-unveils-an-ai-generated-christmas-ad-that-somehow-looks-worse-than-coca-cola-s">Here’s the full statement</a> from the studio, <a href="https://lbbonline.com/news/McDonalds-Netherlands-AI-Terrible-Truth-of-December">Sweetshop</a>, which has also since been deleted:</p> <blockquote><p>“For seven weeks, we hardly slept, with up to 10 of our in-house AI and post specialists at The Gardening Club working in lockstep with the directors. Every shot travelled through a rigorously engineered toolchain: real Google Earth plates, advanced style-transfer, pixel-level photo repair, custom LoRAs, control nets, bespoke ComfyUI graphs, and thousands upon thousands of tightly steered iterations.</p> <p>Then came compositing, lighting balance, physics corrections, artefact removal, and final finishing in Flame. We generated what felt like dailies – thousands of takes – then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production. This wasn’t an AI trick. It was a film. And here’s the thing I wish more people understood: magic isn’t the technology. The magic is the team behind it, people who pushed, questioned, experimented, swore at broken models, solved impossible problems, and refused to stop until every frame felt cinematic.</p> <p>I don’t see this spot as a novelty or a cute seasonal experiment. To me, it’s evidence of something much bigger: that when craft and technology meet with intention, they can create work that feels genuinely cinematic. So no – AI didn’t make this film. We did.”</p></blockquote> <p>Personally, I think it would be easier and better to just have a camera crew and a director film some actors, maybe add some stock footage in, and not make something horrible in a way that sounds both tedious and terrible. But I’m just old-fashioned like that, I guess.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[RPG Fans Pray Baldur’s Gate 3 Studio Is Using The Game Awards Hell Statue To Tease Divinity: Original Sin 3]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Geoff Keighley may not be opening a portal to hell after all. Roleplaying game fans have desperately linked <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">The Game Awards’ hell statue</a> to a new trademark application filed Tuesday and <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">reported by games publication <em>MP1ST</em></a>. A law firm <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420">filed a European trademark application</a> on Tuesday under the name&nbsp;<em>Divinity,&nbsp;</em>and the symbol in the accompanying stylized graphic certainly does look familiar.</p> <p>Two other trademark applications, showing similar imagery, were filed alongside the&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> one. One looks to be of a person tied up in a spiderweb, and the other has a striking similarity, again, to the symbol overlaid on the Game Awards statue. The trademark application for&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> categorizes it under computer game programs and video game software, as well as books, clothing, board games, and other “entertainment services.” No other information is available in the application to link the trademark to either the Game Awards statue or to <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> and&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developer Larian Studios.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Larian Studios for comment on the trademark application and its connection to the Game Awards statue. A Larian Studios representative did not mention&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>, but said: “We are releasing <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">Divinity: Original Sin 2 on Next Gen</a> but weren’t going to announce it until a bit later, so please keep an eye out!”</p>

 <p>Michael Douse, Larian Studios publishing director, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293">also posted to X addressing the rumors</a>,saying “there aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will.”</p>

 <p>Larian Studios announced in 2024 it’s working on two projects. All founder Swen Vincke would say, at the time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-next-game-excalibur-1851509450">was that one is codenamed Excalibur</a>. The studio is coming off of the massive success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, released in 2023. But before&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, Larian Studios was best known as the maker of the <em>Divinity</em> series, starting with 2002’s <em>Divine Divinity</em> and its 2004 sequel,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Divinity</em>. It’s published six different <em>Divinity</em> games, as well as expansion packs and enhanced editions of the games. The last <em>Divinity</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, was released in 2017. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">Asked about&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em> in 2024</a>, Vincke wouldn’t say anything except that whatever the studio’s next game is was “different than what you think it is,” yet “still familiar.”</p> <p>The Game Awards are just days away, so it’s unlikely that Larian Studios will say much about the trademark application or its potential link to the mysterious statue before the big show. But for many, that doesn’t matter: People are still holding out hope that there’s something more than simply an enhanced version of <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> to be announced at The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>
