              <p>Ridley Scott is one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ridley-scott-movies-ranked-gladiator-ii-1851701914">most prodigious directors</a> working in Hollywood right now. Every movie studio seems content to lavish him with massive budgets no matter how tenuous the pitch. But the filmmaker behind <em>Blade Runner</em> and other classics has grown unimpressed with what everyone else around him is producing. “The quantity of movies that are made today, literally globally–millions. Not thousands, millions,” he said during an interview this weekend. “And most of it is shit.”</p> <p>The choice comments came during a retrospective on his career at the BFI Southbank in London, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/ridley-scott-hollywood-drowning-in-mediocrity-1236570875/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a>. Scott, whose 2024 blockbuster <em>Gladiator II</em> at one point featured a mostly green-screened sea battle within a colosseum with massive sharks, lamented that too many bad films are “saved” with digital effects added in post-production instead of relying on solid scripts.</p>

 <p>Scott was asked if he has any movie comfort foods. Why yes, yes he does: his own movies.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I watched Alien with his commentary last night and every other scene he said something along the lines of “damn that’s good” or “it hasn't aged at all” and I just nodded in agreement every time. <a href="https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj">https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj</a></p> <p>— Barto (@bartonovopolis) <a href="https://twitter.com/bartonovopolis/status/1975050651299426475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Well, actually, right now, I’m finding mediocrity–we’re drowning in mediocrity,” he said. “And so what I do–it’s a horrible thing–but I’ve started watching my own movies, and actually they’re pretty good! And also, they don’t age.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I watched&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk</em>&nbsp;[<em>Down</em>] the other night and I thought, ‘How in the hell did I manage to do that?’ But I think occasionally a good one will happen, [and] it’s like a relief that there’s somebody out there who’s doing a good movie.”</p> <p>It’s unclear if he went on to mention what those “good ones” are. It would be hard to top 2023’s <em>Napoleon</em>, after all. Scott’s next movie is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller called <em>The Dog Stars</em>. It’s out March 2026.</p>

              <p>Any creator that wants to be taken seriously needs to start focusing a lot more on their audio. It doesn’t matter if your doing simple vlogs from your couch or conducting those man-on-the-street styled videos. Your viewers, whether they are conscious of it are not, are going to notice your sound quality. Cheap audio reduces the production value of your work, even more so than poorly shot or low quality video does, at least in my opinion. The good news is that it’s easy to take your audio up from sounding bad to sound pretty good. The DJI Mic Mini is a wireless lavalier microphone that is easy to use and far from expensive.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/"> It normally goes for $60, but right now, Amazon has it listed for 29% off. That saves you $17, bringing the price down to just $42 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable on You and in Frame</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini is an ultra-light miniature wireless transmitter that can be worn comfortably and is aesthetically pleasing on camera.</p>
<p>This mini microphone for creators can be placed on the speaker’s person in three different convenient ways. It can clip onto the collar of their shirt as well as the inside of a button-up. You can choose to magnetically adhere it. Just slap the mini clip magnet behind the shirt with the DJI Mic on the front. And then lastly, you can use a simple lanyard and have it hang around the speakers neck like a necklace.</p>
<p>All you need is the one transmitter. When fully charged, it has a maximum operating time of up to eight hours. That should give you plenty of time to record interviews, selfie videos, on-stage events, or whatever it is your looking to capture.</p>



<p>The mic utilizes intelligent noise cancelling at two separate levels. The basic mode is made for indoor settings that are relatively quiet but still has some background noise that’s better off removed. Strong mode is ideal of outdoor noisy environments where you really need to separate the sound of your person speaking from the crowds.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini uses an algorithm to makes sure the audio it picks up is good to use. It’s automatic limiting feature will lower the volume on its own if it detect audio input is too high. This can help prevent clipping.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/">For a limited time, you can grab the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier for the reduced price of just $42. Save $17 and upgrade your audio recording today.</a></p>
