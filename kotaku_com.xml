Gaming revenue for the company grew nine percent on the previous year, adding another $2 billion, “driven by growth in Xbox content and services, offset by a decline in Xbox hardware.” Even with falling console sales (down 25 percent), Microsoft saw colossal increases in income from its gaming, in the same year it chose to cancel multiple gaming projects, close down multiple studios, and lay off thousands of employees.</p><p>The document didn’t feel a need to mention all these closures in its celebration of an operating income of $34.3 billion, and instead stated, “We continue to invest in gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of first- and third-party titles.”</p><p>You’ll be relieved to learn that “the gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem,” according to the corporation. “We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores.”</p><p>Speaking on an accompanying earnings call, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-becomes-playstation-s-top-publisher-and-game-pass-revenue-nears-5-billion&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-becomes-playstation-s-top-publisher-and-game-pass-revenue-nears-5-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as reported by <em>Game Developer</em></a></span>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that Xbox Game Pass’s annual revenue totaled just under $5 billion, with 500 million active users, and “nearly” 40 games in development. He added, “We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay streamed via the cloud this year.”</p><p>One of those nearly 40 games isn’t <em>Perfect Dark</em>, the franchise reboot being developed by The Initiative.

This one is called <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> and includes a bunch of new features. It also looks perfectly positioned to once again trick me into thinking I will fall in love with these games. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Revealed during today’s Nintendo Direct, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will hit Switch 1 and Switch 2 on December 4 and tell the story of a world on the brink of collapse that must be rebuilt (and which is seemingly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/octopath-traveler-0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/octopath-traveler-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on the 2022 mobile spin-off <em>Champions of the Continent</em></a></span>). Players will still go around collecting party members and grinding through turn-based battles, but this time their own personalized character will be the star of the show. New base-building mechanics will also add some light life management sim aspects to the formula, it seems. </p><p>Most importantly, however, the HD-2D pixel art still looks incredible. Here’s the trailer:</p><p><em>Octopath Traveler </em>should be the prefect series for me. I grew up on 8-bit and 16-bit games. I was obsessed with SNES RPGs. I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, the most direct inspiration for the <em>Octopath games</em>, at least a dozen times. But try as I may, my appreciation, admiration, and respect for the <em>Octopath</em> games has never given way to being truly in love with them. I play a bunch, mostly out of a feeling of duty, and then eventually bounce off. They can be nice JRPG comfort food but never felt like anything more to me. </p><p>  <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is definitely going to be the one to fix that though, I can feel it. This it the one that will convert me into a true believer rather than just a sympathetic skeptic. I will definitely <em>not</em> buy <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>, play it for 10 hours, and then never put the game back in my Switch 2. This time will be different. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will fix me. I can’t wait to order it, gift wrap it, and leave it under the Christmas tree just waiting to not break my heart on Christmas Day. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-trailer-release-date-switch-2-1851787423]]></content:encoded>
