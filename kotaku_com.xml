              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab a new laptop without breaking the bank. We’re spotting plenty of amazing deals on a wide range of machines from popular brands like HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and even Apple – basically, there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">One of our favorite discounts, however, is this 70% drop on the 15.6-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which brings the overall price down to just $650, but that’s not all.</a> You’re also getting a 6-in-1 accessory bundle worth almost $200 with your purchase for free, which adds even more value to the offer. This deal applies to the stunning moonlight blue version, which gives off a premium, sleek look. Just note that the discount wraps up soon, so it’s best to grab it before the price shoots back up to $2,200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Power</h2>
<p>You’re greeted with a stunning 15.6-inch Full HD display upon opening the laptop. The screen features an ultra-thin 6.5 mm micro-edge bezel for a bigger viewing area, while the anti-glare coating keeps the visuals easy on your eyes. Touch support takes this a bit further by making navigation a breeze. You won’t have to rely on the trackpad or the mouse solely to get things done. Need to scroll a long document? Just use your fingers directly on the screen. The included touchscreen pen also makes it quite easy to swipe, draw, sketch, and even type!</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard, alongside a dedicated numeric keypad, which is quite comfortable to use. It provides your wrist with the support it needs for jotting down long documents, plus includes a dedicated Copilot key that launches the helpful AI assistant instantly. There’s also a built-in webcam, with integrated microphones for convenient video calls.</p>



<p>Power comes from the combination of an Intel Core i3-N305 processor and a modest 16GB RAM. Together, these let you push through busy, productive days with ease, regardless of the task at hand. The 1TB SSD, on the other hand, offers ample space to store all your important documents and files in a single place, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge offers over 9 hours of use, which means you can go an entire workday without worrying about running out of power. Recharging is fast too, so you won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long when running low. And finally, the free accessory bundle includes a touchscreen pen, a 128GB thumb drive, a laptop bag, a cleaning cloth, a camera protector, dust plugs, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. That’s everything you need to get started with work and entertainment, right away, and you’re basically getting far more than just a direct discount with this deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">This laptop is currently down to just $650 at Amazon, which is practically nothing for a device this packed.</a> This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer won’t be around for long. Grab it while there’s still time, as it could wrap up any moment now. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>

              <p>A quality Bluetooth speaker is a must-have for pretty much everyone. Whether you’re spending time with friends at the park or tackling household chores, a portable speaker can completely set the mood. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">The JBL Clip 5 is the ideal companion for any situation where you’d want to reach for a Bluetooth speaker, and right now, you can grab it at a 25% discount on Amazon.</a> Originally priced at $80, the JBL Clip 5 is now available for just $60. With powerful sound, a durable design, and a range of stylish color options, it’s a high-quality option for music lovers on the move.</p>
<p>The JBL Clip 5 delivers powerful, clear sound with deep bass, no matter where you take it. Whether you’re at the beach, by the pool, or on a hike, this portable speaker ensures your music stays crisp and vibrant. It’s built with an IP67 rating, meaning it is both waterproof and dustproof. So whether you’re caught in a rainstorm or accidentally drop it in the sand, the JBL Clip 5 is made to withstand the elements. The rugged exterior combines durable fabric with rubber, ensuring the speaker can handle the outdoors and a bit of rough treatment.</p>

<h2>Portability at Its Finest</h2>
<p>The “Clip” in JBL Clip 5 isn’t just a name. The whole design is built around it. The speaker includes an integrated carabiner clip. While the speaker itself is compact and easy to carry, the clip allows you to securely attach it to your bag or belt loop. Once you’re at your destination, the clip can be used to fasten it to your beach chair or whatever else, making sure your music is always within reach and ready to go.</p>
<p>A portable speaker isn’t much good if the battery runs out halfway through a playlist. Fortunately, the JBL Clip 5 offers impressive battery life, delivering up to 12 hours of playtime on a single charge. And if you need a little extra time, you can activate the Playtime Boost feature, which prioritizes power and gives you up to three additional hours of listening time—bringing the total playtime to 15 hours. With this extended battery life, the JBL Clip 5 is equipped to last through a full day of adventure or relaxation alike.</p>



<p>JBL speakers are known for their stylish and vibrant designs, and the JBL Clip 5 continues that tradition. Beyond just the classic color options like black and white, the JBL Clip 5 offers a variety of fun and bold choices. You can opt for a sleek black-and-orange combination or choose a playful pink-and-blue, sand-and-green, or solid blue, purple, or red color schemes. For those who prefer something a bit edgier, there’s even a camouflage “squad” pattern. Just make sure not to set it down in the grass. You’ll never find it again.</p>
<p>As a JBL speaker, the JBL Clip 5 is equipped with Auracast. This lets you pair two or more Auracast-enabled speakers together, synchronized to the same audio, to create even bigger sound. It’s great for having a party, and making sure the same music is playing throughout different rooms of the house or both inside and outside in the backyard.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch 2 Just Got Another Last-Minute Discount]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-just-got-another-last-minute-discount-2000654829</link>
            <guid>1388227</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re in the market for <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">a Nintendo Switch 2</a> and live close to a Microcenter, you’re in luck. The PC store chain currently has the console marked down to just $400 in a surprise last-minute discount for the most popular new gaming hardware of the year.</p> <p>Microcenter is <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/695288/nintendo-switch-2-console">currently advertising</a> the console at $50 off it’s regular sticker price. Not bad for the Switch 2’s first holiday. The catch is that you have to actually go to Microcenter to get it, however. There’s no shipping, so you either need to live close or drive far. The store closest to me says it has 25 unit in stock as of this writing, though it’s not clear how long the discount will be in effect.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 is $399.99 at Micro Center (in-stores) <a href="https://t.co/Jw6BrF6Ufj">https://t.co/Jw6BrF6Ufj</a> <a href="https://t.co/SpmMKtmVIx">pic.twitter.com/SpmMKtmVIx</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2001655303683678709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s worth noting that this is only for the standalone console, not the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. If you were planning on also buying that game, which costs an additional $80, you’d basically only be saving $20 off the normal bundle price. Still something, but not as good as the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle discounted to $450 that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Walmart and some other stores</a> were selling earlier this month.</p> <p>Any savings on a new console, especially one that’s sold as well as the Switch 2 in its first year, comes as a nice surprise. It’s also been an unexpectedly tough holiday season for new console sales. Circana recently reported that only <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">1.6 million units were sold in November</a> across Switch 2, Switch 1, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, making it the worst pre-holiday sales month for gaming hardware since 1995. That’s because even with Black Friday discounts, the average cost of a new console keeps going up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Asus Goes Wild on 32″ 4K OLED 240Hz Gaming Monitor, Now Selling $400 Cheaper at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-wild-on-32-4k-oled-240hz-gaming-monitor-now-selling-400-cheaper-at-record-low-2000654822</link>
            <guid>1388191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>High-end gaming monitors usually force you to pick your poison: blazing fast refresh rates with washed-out colors, or stunning image quality with sluggish response times that get you killed in competitive matches. Asus cracked that compromise with the <strong>ROG Swift PG32UCDM, a 32-inch beast that combines true 4K resolution, QD-OLED panel technology, a 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time,&nbsp; and a blistering 240Hz refresh rate</strong> in one package. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6526/">just slashed this monitor to $899 from its usual $1,299, marking an all-time-low that makes premium OLED gaming</a> a lot more accessible. Order today and you’ll have it sitting on your desk before Christmas, ready to transform how games actually look and feel when you’re playing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>QD-OLED Technology</h2>
<p>The quantum dot OLED panel <strong>makes perfect blacks</strong> because each pixel makes its own light and can turn off completely which makes for infinite contrast that LCD panels can’t match. In dark game scenes, you’ll see this right away when shadows show hidden details instead of turning into gray blobs. With 99% DCI-P3 coverage and true 10-bit color depth, colors pop off the screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>32-inch size is just right because 4K resolution</strong> makes things look sharper than 1440p without making UI elements too small to read. You can sit at a normal desk distance and still see the pixels clearly without having to move your head to see the corners. The text stays clear for work, and the 16:9 aspect ratio works well with almost all games and apps without black bars or stretching.</p>
<p>The <strong>240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time</strong> work together to make motion look clear, which makes 60Hz monitors feel like watching slideshows. Fast-paced shooters show enemy movements with no blur and give you the split-second edge you need to get headshots before your opponents even know you’re there. You can see apex markers and read road textures at speeds where other displays turn everything into smeared streaks.</p>



<p>Asus made a<strong> custom heatsink with a new airflow design and a graphene film backing to keep the OLED panels cool</strong> while they work. This cooling system greatly lowers the chance of burn-in by keeping the panel temperature stable, even during long gaming sessions where static UI elements stay on the screen for hours. The uniform brightness setting keeps the brightness level the same across the whole display, which stops some OLED monitors from changing brightness levels when you switch between dark and bright content.</p>
<p>This monitor has the VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black certification which means it meets strict standards for HDR performance. The peak brightness levels are high enough to make explosions and light sources stand out while keeping the perfect OLED blacks in the shadows. The matte screen surface scatters reflections without adding the grainy texture that makes images less clear on poorly made anti-glare coatings which means you can put the monitor near windows and not have to deal with glare while you play during the day.</p>
<p>The <strong>90W USB-C port can send both display signals and charge</strong> your laptop with just one cable: This keeps your desk tidy and makes it easy to dock a gaming laptop or MacBook for work. With Display Stream Compression, you can send the <strong>full 4K 240Hz signal over DisplayPort 1.4</strong>. You can <strong>also use HDMI 2.1</strong> to connect your PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at 4K 120Hz.</p>
<p>This monitor costs $899, which is $400 less than the retail price and less than other OLED gaming displays with similar specs, which usually cost between $1,200 and $1,500. At this price, most people would settle for VA or IPS panels with poor contrast but you’re getting here flagship panel technology, enthusiast-grade refresh rates, and professional color accuracy.</p>
