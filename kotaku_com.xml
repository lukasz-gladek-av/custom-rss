It will also likely be the cornerstone of a long-threatened push to launch its own app store on smartphones following anti-trust losses by Apple and Google. </p><p>The current wave of mass layoffs hitting Xbox follows multiple other rounds that Microsoft has implemented in the wake of its gaming acquisition spree. Nearly 2,000 staff across the gaming division were cut in January 2024, followed by the closures of critically acclaimed studios like Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May. Around 600 more layoffs followed in September, with Microsoft saying at the time that no games were canceled as a result of that round of cuts. </p><p>That’s unlikely to be the case this time around, with the full extent of the culling rumored to potentially include entire studios. Microsoft’s expansive portfolio of game development teams includes ones like Obsidian Entertainment which have prodigiously shipped almost half a dozen games since being bought, as well as others like Undead Labs which have spent years working on sequels that have yet to materialize. Xbox has also been retreating from its console hardware business amidst reported pressure to improve its bottom line, leading to major first-party exclusives like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War </em>going multiplatform on PlayStation 5.</p><p> “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest in June</a></span>, hinting at the current upheaval. “That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade-offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because...we are the business that we are.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492]]></content:encoded>

These function exactly like Charms from prior titles, with all of their names and descriptions even referring to them with that term. What’s more tricky than their naming scheme is understanding how to acquire more of them.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196773" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196773,197564,196790" data-current="196773"><div><p>This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22330.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Many Talismans are available to unlock and be upgraded to new levels. The biggest obstacles for this are the same ones you’ve been fighting against since you started playing <em>Wilds</em>: a lack of information and a cumbersome UI experience. That’s why we’re going to explain what you need to do to start your charm collection.</p><h2 id="h445145"><a id=""></a>How to Upgrade Talismans</h2><p>Forging new Talismans is simple enough. All you need to do is visit the Smithy and select the Forge/Upgrade Talismans option to see what can be crafted. Keep an eye out for any that have a red chest symbol, since you will only see their first tier on the Forge List. Unlike weapons with their upgrade tree or armor that can be strengthened all in one menu, upgrading is handled separately.</p><figure id="" data-id="5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-recommend-id="image://5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-recommend-id="image://5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>While you’re on the Forge List, press R1/RB to switch over to the upgrade list to see which Talismans can be powered up.</strong> From here, you can select the ones you have the required materials for to upgrade them to their next tier. Each enhancement will raise their equipment skill level by one. A Blessing Charm I will grant a level 1 Divine Blessing skill, while a Blessing Charm II will grant the level 2 skill.</p><p>Upgrading a Talisman will typically replace the option with the following tier when there is one. For example, upgrading to Blessing Charm II should take it off the Upgrade List and replace it with Blessing Charm III. I say “should” because sometimes there can be a hurdle to displaying new talismans. Don’t worry, we’re going to cover that too!</p><h2 id="h445146"><a id=""></a>How to Unlock More Talismans</h2><p>Unlocking these charms is similar to how it works for armor in that you need to discover the required materials first. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has plenty of big and small creatures for you to get parts from. The big ones can require repeated hunts to finally get a specific part, while some of the smaller life forms may require you to explore every nook and cranny of a map. <strong>If you want additional Talismans to forge or upgrade, you’ll need to hunt more monsters and capture Endemic Life as well.</strong></p><p>It’s also worth mentioning that the required materials will vary across upgrade levels. Some of them will need a mix of monster parts each time, and a few even require <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176">Hunter Symbols</a></span>. Just like with any other equipment, I recommend using the Wishlist mechanic to help you farm all the materials you need.</p><p>That leads to another issue you might come across. <strong>If you can’t switch over to the Talismans Upgrade List tab or if it’s greyed out, that just means you don’t have anything to currently upgrade.</strong> It could be that you’ve reached the maximum level for everything or that you haven’t found all the materials to unlock an enhanced version’s recipe. The menu will be available again as soon as you have something to upgrade.</p><p>On a related note, it’s a good practice to fight any new monsters or stronger variants that are added in updates. Both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">Mizutsune</a></span> and Arch-Tempered Rey Dau provide materials needed for higher-level charms. Remember that you’ll need to hunt these and gather the right materials before the upgrades are made available to forge. Considering that Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is only available with limited-time events, you may need to prioritize farming particular hunts when you have the chance.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-talisman-upgrade-forge-1851785415]]></content:encoded>
