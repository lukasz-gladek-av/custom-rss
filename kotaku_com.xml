PC gaming’s biggest storefront appeared to blame pressure from online payment processors for the changes, which some developers worry will lead to a censorship crackdown on anything Steam regards as too controversial, regardless of whether it contains harmful content or not. An anti-porn group, which previously tried to get games as mainstream as <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> banned, is now taking credit for Valve’s new policies and accusing critics of being “sick brain rotted pedo gamer fetishists.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196447" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: January 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="330" data-playlist="196447,196663,195805" data-current="196447"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: January 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21996.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em> (<strong>Content warning:</strong> This article mentions potentially upsetting game titles and topics.) </em></p><p>The Australia-based anti-porn group Collective Shout took credit for Steam’s surprise moderation shift in a statement over the weekend. “Hundreds of sexually violent online games that let players role-play rape, incest and the torture of women and children have been suddenly removed from the global gaming platform Steam,” co-founder Melinda Tankard Reist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946431955446431970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946431955446431970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X on July 19</a></span>. “In a victory for child safety campaigners, Steam banned the ‘games’ after Australian-based Collective Shout accused the payment platforms Visa, PayPal and Mastercard of profiting from violent pornography.”</p><p>Collective Shout’s connection to the Steam sex game purge was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20250719204151/https://www.vice.com/en/article/group-behind-steam-censorship-policies-have-powerful-allies-and-targeted-popular-games-with-outlandish-claims/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250719204151/https://www.vice.com/en/article/group-behind-steam-censorship-policies-have-powerful-allies-and-targeted-popular-games-with-outlandish-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first reported by Ana Valens at<em> Vice</em></a></span>, who noted that the “grassroots campaign” against the objectification of women and sexualization of girls in media has previously published a letter to the CEOs behind PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and other payment platforms accusing them of “profiting from rape, incest + child abuse” on Steam.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While those attempts to censor through manufactured controversy failed, Collective Shout may be having more success directly targeting payment processing companies which have been cracking down on pornography across the the broader web on creator platforms like OnlyFans. Earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fansly banned any sexualized “anthropomorphic content”</a></span> in an apparent bid to censor bestiality on the platform, despite that being condemned within the furry community as well. Instead of nuanced moderation, some platforms appear to be making more drastic shifts to appease payment companies.</p><p>That’s the concern around the recent purge of sex games on Steam. In addition to bans on games that use crypto currencies or feature “sexually explicit images of real people,” Valve added the much more ambiguous restriction against “Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.”</p><p>The new guideline coincided with Vavle removing games from Steam with titles like <em>Incest Tales: Webcam Daughter</em> and <em>Reincarnation in another world going to rape All NPCs VR.</em> But others with genre tags that still mentioned things like incest were left untouched, spreading confusion about where exactly Valve was drawing the line. It was also unclear why Valve was only taking action now despite this type of porn-slop, including some truly vile sounding games, have routinely crept onto the storefront. Instead of Valve banning a sexual assault sim called <em>No Mercy</em> earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725">it was voluntarily withdrawn</a></span> from Steam by its creators.</p><figure id="" data-id="70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-recommend-id="image://70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-format="png" data-width="1533" data-height="818" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an explicit game bundle on Steam.

Does it review games for infringing content first? Does it ban things based on how they look or sound and then wait for the creators to appeal later? And is it working off of clear guidelines from payment companies? It’s that type of moderation mess that risks censoring various game-based works of art simply because someone in a position of power might go “ick,” or, even worse, they saw someone making noise about it on social media and didn’t want to get caught up in the drama.</p><p>That’s certainly the approach that the owners of <em>Vice</em>, which originally broke the story on Collective Shout’s relationship to the changes, appears to have taken. Savage Ventures, which invested in Vice after it went bankrupt, was accused by Valens of being behind the removal of two of her articles about the topic. “Vice’s owner Savage Ventures has requested the removal of my Collective Shout articles,” she posted on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky over the weekend</a></span>. “This is due to concerns about the controversial subject matter—not journalistic complaints.”</p><p>In the meantime, Collective Shout cofounder Melinda Tankard Reist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is calling</a></span> those critical of Valve’s decision “porn sick brain rotted pedo gamer fetishists.” While the organization’s initial letter accused Steam of hosting hundreds of games that would “breach Australian classification laws,” Collective Shout has so far declined to name any specific examples. “Most of the content found within the games, including the graphics and the developers descriptions, are too distressing for us to make public,” it wrote. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-sex-censorship-hentai-gta-5-collective-shout-1851786636]]></content:encoded>

For me, I was stationed at STC Malachite, and no one there sold the new weapons from the update. I ended up walking to Garbage, which is where I found the Kora-1911, sold by Huron. You can also find one by speaking to Hamster in Zalissya.</p><p>Alternatively, the handgun spawns on Loners most frequently, so if you don’t mind taking down one of your own, there’s a free pistol in it for you.</p><figure id="" data-id="fea13651b5a3563d90577b0a694b041e" data-recommend-id="image://fea13651b5a3563d90577b0a694b041e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The ADS animation for the Kora-1911 in Stalker 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The ADS animation for the Kora-1911 in Stalker 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fea13651b5a3563d90577b0a694b041e" data-recommend-id="image://fea13651b5a3563d90577b0a694b041e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The ADS animation for the Kora-1911 in Stalker 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Furthermore, you can find the sole unique variant of the Kora-1911, known as the Night Stalker, in the Burnt Forest, specifically at Vityok Moon’s Bandit Group.
