And my guy looks like he is zooted out of his goddamn mind.</span></p> <p><span>Images of the popcorn bucket started circulating today ahead of any official announcement. You can see Yoshi holding one of his trademark eggs, but he also is giving the kind of thousand-yard stare usually reserved for people who ate an entire bowl of brownies without realizing they’re loaded with pot. He’s staring into the </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span> and holding onto that egg like it’s grounding him to reality. It’s currently rumored that this container will be available at AMC, Cinemark, and Regal theaters, but we’re still waiting on an official announcement.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-devs-know-safeguard-has-problems-and-are-looking-into-it-2000668703</link>
            <guid>1435834</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over a decade ago, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em> introduced a new multiplayer game mode to the franchise: <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Safeguard_(game_mode)">Safeguard</a>. This team-based mode had players pushing and defending a walking robot from another team tasked with stopping it. It was very good. But the mode’s last appearance in a main game was in 2018. So I was over the moon to see the mode return as part of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s second season. And while I have some issues with it, Safeguard is still a lot of fun in 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Booting up Safeguard in the new season of <em>COD: BLOPS7</em></a> was like returning to an old friend’s house after years away to hang out. Something I’ve always appreciated about the mode was how it gave the defense a way to fight back that wasn’t just “Kill the other team.” You can instead focus your damage on the robot, and if you do enough, it will stop moving and have to reboot. This gives less skilled players a way to help without having to hunt down highly skilled <em>COD</em> pros each match. It also leads to an interesting dynamic where a defending team can over-focus on taking out the bot and let the attackers flank them and wipe them out. But focus too much on the attackers, and the bot will walk its way into the checkpoint, and you’ll lose before you realize it.</p>

  <p>This time around, the robot you are defending is a four-legged Boston Dynamics-like mechanical dog. The bots were previously bipedal humanoids, which was fine, but I’m far more into guarding a robo dog than a random mechanical man. But it felt to me as if this robot dog might be moving faster than the past bots had in Safeguard. So I talked to the devs behind the mode, and they confirmed that, no, the bot is moving at a “pace consistent with previous” versions of Safeguard.</p> <p>However, “<em>BO7</em>’s tighter map layouts, updated pathing, and the new animation set can make its movement feel faster, even though the underlying speed hasn’t changed much,” said a Treyarch spokesperson. They also confirmed they are looking at data to decide if the bot should move a bit slower.</p>

 <p>Another issue with the current version of Safeguard in <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that you can sometimes win, but still lose. Basically, the game mode is built around how fast you get the bot to the checkpoint. Each team gets a shot at pulling this off. If the first team does it in let’s say two minutes, then the other team goes, and if they get the bot there in two minutes and three seconds, <a href="https://youtu.be/LegP5qViODY">they’ll lose despite the bot making it to the checkpoint</a>. This feels bad, and Treyarch tells me they are looking into this.</p>

 <p>“We’re evaluating options to end the second round early in situations where the attacking team hasn’t pushed the Robot far enough in time,” Treyarch told <em>Kotaku</em>. “And we’re looking at this alongside the broader UI improvements already in progress. Our goal is to make the rules and win conditions as clear and intuitive as possible for all players.” The team is also open to bringing back overtime, which isn’t included in Safeguard right now.</p> <p>Besides those issues, and an odd bug that let people knock the bot out with a combat axe that has already been patched, I’ve really enjoyed playing Safeguard again. I think it’s a great example of how <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s gunplay can be incredibly successful in modes that aren’t simply about killing each other.</p>

 <p>I hope the mode sticks around past season two and, like Kill Confirmed and other fan favorites, return in future <em>Call of Duty</em> games. You don’t even have to have a robot for this mode to work. If the next <em>Call of Duty</em> isn’t set in the future but instead WW2 or something, fine, use a jeep. That would still let me enjoy this mode with my friends, even those who aren’t great at FPS games.</p>

              <p><span>Cool stuff is always coming out of the alternative controller community. From rhythm games where you wiggle around on </span><a href="https://scrape.nugget.fun/"><span>a real skateboard</span></a><span> to games where you smack </span><a href="https://www.dachu-interactive.com/how-to-pet-your-cat"><span>a giant stuffed animal cat butt</span></a><span>, the world of weird controllers is awesome and underrated. Luckily, a brand new type of alt control is getting some well-deserved love.</span></p> <p><span>Streamer Perri Karyal is </span><a href="https://youtu.be/rIbfNUA5pWk?si=ZHmAQQDUcdhWQfk2"><span>known</span></a><span> for making alt controls that allow her to play games using her brain—but what if it were the other way around? What if a game could control a player?</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, Karyal </span><a href="https://x.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?s=20"><span>posted</span></a><span> a video showing off exactly that. Using a process called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), which basically sends signals to the part of your ear canal that’s responsible for your sense of balance, Karyal was able to hook up her own body to a controller.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can control your balance</p> <p>I made a device that sends DC current through my head to stimulate my vestibular nerve (called galvanic vestibular stimulation or GVS) and, in doing so, can make me feel completely destabilised.

The video shows Karyal running in a straight line — until a person shifts a joystick to the left, which causes her to veer to the left, too.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Karyal proceeded to use the tech to simulate G forces while playing Ubisoft’s 2020 racing game </span><i><span>Trackmania.</span></i><span> In the video, she sways from side to side in tandem with her digital car, to dizzying effect. She also reports seeing “flashing lights,” which doesn’t sound too good. The official </span><i><span>Trackmania</span></i><span> Esports account </span><a href="https://x.com/TMesports/status/2022169923741741070?s=20"><span>took notice</span></a><span> of Karyal’s experiment, calling it “awesome.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The technology that makes this possible is actually quite old. In an NBC article from 2005, journalist Yuri Kageyama </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna9816703"><span>tries out GVS</span></a><span>: “I found the experience unnerving and exhausting: I sought to step straight ahead but kept careening from side to side. Those alternating currents literally threw me off.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perri Karyal stresses not to replicate this experiment at home, as GVS isn’t very well-researched and can cause adverse effects. It’s very cool to watch someone else do it, though!</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> won’t be out until later this year, but Konami isn’t letting its last anthology of older <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> games languish in the meantime. The <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1</em> just got its final big update and it adds improved HD resolutions for some of the games, as well as a performance upgrade to finally let the more <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-snake-eater-pc-2-0-patch-resolution-1851657115">demanding games run at 60fps on Switch 2</a>.</p> <p>The big improvements are coming to <em>Metal Gear Solid 1</em> and <em>Snake Eater</em>. As shown off in this week’s PlayStation State of Play, they have expanded resolution settings. You can now play with “original,” “high,” or “max” resolution, though at least for the original <em>Metal Gear </em>there are reports that the improved HD textures lead to some weird jaggies on the screen.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000668737" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668737"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668737">Konami</figcaption></figure> <p>The new patch also makes it possible to finally swap the confirm and cancel buttons in the settings menu, and adds key binding options for mouse and keyboard on PC.&nbsp;On <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>, meanwhile, the texture pack apparently has a massive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1r38ar4/new_textures_for_mgs3_update_for_vol_1/">60GB install size</a> for the new upscaled resolutions, letting you boost the game to a bastard version of 4K.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000668739" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668739"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668739">Konami</figcaption></figure> <p>But the most important takeaway from the update is what it does for the game on Nintendo’s platform. While the Switch 1 version is what it is (not great!), the Switch 2 version can now reportedly run <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> and <em>Snake Eater</em> at roughly 60fps instead of being locked at 30fps. The upgrade adds a range of new options for customizing the internal resolution and upscaling outputs across the main game and the cinematics, letting fans find what they feel is the optimal compromise between the original look and feel of these games and modern expectations for crisp and smooth performance.</p>

 <p>The original release of the the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1</em> was fairly disappointing given the stature and significance of the games involved. But Konami has slowly made things right over the course <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-collection-patch-fix-steam-pc-1851117845">of two years</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-snake-eater-pc-2-0-patch-resolution-1851657115">and several updates</a>. The Switch 2 upgrade is the final make-good and brings performance in-line with the other console versions on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Now every time it goes on sale on Switch I don’t have to shy away from recommending it to people, including right now. It’s currently 30 percent off on all platforms.</p>
