            <title><![CDATA[Stranger Things Season 5 Made A Retro Gaming Mistake Most People Would Never Notice]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After nearly a decade, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-trailer-teaser-netflix-1851786407"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a> <span>is in its fifth and final season, and the Netflix series about kids fighting evil monsters is still dripping with ‘80s nostalgia. This includes a scene where a kid is playing </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins</span></i><span>, the classic NES platformer from 1985, on his NES. To most, this scene probably didn’t raise any red flags, but for eagle-eyed retro fans, this is a pretty glaring error from </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, whose whole shtick has been ‘80s references since the first season aired when Barack Obama was still president.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Derek Turnbow, a new character in season five, seems to be playing </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins </span></i><span>on an NES, the game that appears on his television is actually the arcade version. Retro-focused outlet </span><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/random-did-you-spot-this-nes-related-blunder-in-stranger-things-season-5"><i><span>Time Extension</span></i></a><span> points out the details that reveal this, like the big black borders shown on the screen. On the console, these black bars were nowhere to be seen. The arcade version uses these bars to show text overlays with the player’s score. The console version, meanwhile, just puts this information on top of the gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The error is all the more baffling because the set dressing has everything </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>needs to just play the NES version. There’s an actual Nintendo Entertainment System plugged into a TV, with the original </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins </span></i><span>cartridge inside, and yet, someone at Netflix used footage of the arcade version in the final episode. Retro fans are feeling some type of way about it.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I wasn’t born during this decade and didn’t play it until years after I was born, […] but even I know what the game looks like on there,” PrivateLiker7625 </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1p9idys/how_the_heck_did_they_mess_up_something_as_simple/"><span>wrote on Reddit</span></a><span>. “Talk about an insult to the intelligence of those that grew up on this!”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder,” dropthefunk </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1p8aaxr/the_wrong_version_of_ghosts_n_goblins_is_shown_on/"><span>wrote in another thread</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love Stranger Things, but Season 5 just committed a cardinal sin. They show a kid playing ‘Nintendo’ in his room… but the TV is clearly running the arcade version of Ghosts ’n Goblins, NOT the NES port. My retro heart can’t take it! 😫 <a href="https://t.co/LRZJOOjCTM">pic.twitter.com/LRZJOOjCTM</a></p> <p>— My Retro Life (@myretrolifeshow) <a href="https://twitter.com/myretrolifeshow/status/1994560916118278169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While the call for someone to lose their job is a bit extreme, it is an odd oversight considering all the ingredients for an accurate shot are seemingly in the room. Though the show is usually pretty consistent with its nostalgic callbacks, </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>isn’t immune to </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/goofs/"><span>continuity errors</span></a><span>, with most of them typically being in using imagery and products that wouldn’t have existed in the show’s ‘80s setting.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-pricey-ipad-lenovo-tab-one-falls-to-an-all-time-low-and-now-priced-like-a-no-name-android-tablet-2000648987</link>
            <guid>1369483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Didn’t get a chance to grab a solid tablet during Black Friday? Don’t worry. Cyber Monday is here, slashing prices across all popular categories, and offering one last chance to save massively before the holiday season begins.</p>
<p>We’ve been spotting tons of great options going for less, and if you’re after something that covers all the basics while staying under the $100 mark, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/">the Lenovo Tab One is an excellent option to consider. It’s now sitting at just $90, after a nice 25% discount, and there are no delivery charges to worry about either.</a> It’s not every day you get to grab an impressive screen while also saving on shipping, so get your orders in sooner rather than later. The tablet is going to be pushed back to its retail price of $120 at midnight, which is why it’s best to act fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bright Visuals, Even Better Sound</h2>
<p>We won’t label it as a massive tablet. You’re getting a modest 8.7-inch display, which isn’t overwhelmingly large; just enough for a comfortable viewing experience on the go. The display pushes vibrant visuals, while the 480 nits of brightness ensure exceptional visibility in all lighting conditions. Of course, visuals alone aren’t enough for an immersive streaming experience, which is why Lenovo packs the tablet with dual Dolby Atmos speakers for bold, rich audio. Translation? Brighter content, paired with an even better sound that brings your favorite content to life.</p>
<p>Performance is taken care of by the MediaTek Helio G85 processor, plus a 60Hz refresh rate, both of which come together to ensure a smooth, lag-free experience. You won’t exactly be able to multitask on this tablet, but it holds up well for casual use like browsing, streaming, video calls, etc. In fact, it’s a great option for kids, too. Google Kids Space support lets you introduce your little ones to teacher-approved content based on their interests. Subscribe to YouTube Kids, and you’ll have instant access to thousands of age-appropriate videos and hundreds of books, all ad-free.</p>



<p>Storing all the media content and programs you want won’t be an issue, thanks to the massive 64GB of storage, which is quite rare to find in this price range. If you’re purchasing it for your kids, you can pre-install a bunch of kid-friendly apps and games to keep them entertained for hours. There’s an included folio case to protect your tablet from the inevitable daily wear and tear. The built-in stand lets you prop it up wherever you like, however you prefer it. Place it on your workstation, a cafe, or even your bed for some late-night streaming sessions. As for the battery, a single charge gets you around 12.5 hours of unplugged YouTube streaming. It’s also designed to recharge faster than previous models, so it should be back at it in no time when running low. And since the tablet is compact, you don’t have to get a dedicated bag to carry it. Just toss it in your purse or backpack, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, this tablet isn’t a powerhouse. It’s made to do all the basic tasks, and it does those well. We especially recommend it for kids/teenagers wanting to have their own device. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6135/">The current deal brings it down to just $90, which is pretty cheap for a tablet from a known brand.</a> It’s also one of the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer ends soon. Grab yours before it’s too late.</p>

              <p>Whether you’ve accepted the PvP nature of PvPvE extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i> or not, getting betrayed still sucks. Getting stabbed in the back always feels unnecessarily mean <i>and</i> there’s no direct way to get some revenge, as the odds of you running into and recognizing the same person in a future game are pretty low.</p> <p>But a new community resource hopes to change that.</p> <p>Enter <a href="https://speranzabounties.com/">Speranza Bounties</a>, a fan-made site that does just what you think it does: publicly tracks troublesome rats up to no good out there in the Rust Belt (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-bounty-hunting-fansite/">h/t <i>Polygon</i></a>). Not only can you check to see what active bounties are on deserving players, which includes information such as what bad deeds they committed (extraction camping, lying, bait and switches, etc), but you can also post your own. All you need is a player’s Embark ID, which you can find by looking at who killed you in the post-game carnage report.</p>

 <p>Speranza Bounties keeps track of all bounties for 30 days, after which they expire. So if you find yourself on this naughty list, just lay low for about a month. The site also awards you with titles for taking down a player with an active bounty.</p>

 <h2>PvP could use a little extra love in <i>Arc Raiders</i></h2> <p>I’ll gladly get sent back to Speranza on this hill: PvP belongs in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. We don’t need exclusive PvP modes or maps or a PvE mode.</p> <p>That said, every time I get downed by another player, damn do I wish there was someway to exact revenge. While it’s a neat social experiment to wrestle with that impulse, I think tools like Speranza Bounties (as well as the fictional Speranza Watchlist) show that some added social elements to PvP, such as a bounty system or user-facing behavior report system that isn’t strictly punitive could add more ways to interact with the PvP element of this otherwise fantastic game.</p> <p>And no. I do not have a bounty on my head.</p> <p>…yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! I hope you enjoyed a lot of turkey. I did. I celebrated two Thanksgivings. Double the fun, double the calories. Anyway, welcome back from holiday break, and let’s get right into Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of gaming news and other stuff you might care about. And please, nobody mention turkey. I’m done with it until next year.</p> <h2>There Will Be Another <em>Hitman</em> Game, Says IOI</h2> <p>IO Interactive is currently wrapping up <em>007: First Light,</em> which is set to launch in March of next year. While some are excited, there are plenty of <em>Hitman</em> fans who are worried that perhaps Agent 47 and his deadly franchise have entered extended retirement. That’s not the case.</p>

 <p>“So of course there will be more <em>Hitman</em>,” <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about <em>Hitman</em> co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in <em>World of Assassination.</em> But we will, after that, be talking about the next <em>Hitman</em> — because, of course, there’s going to be a next <em>Hitman</em>.”</p>

 <h2><em>Zootopia 2</em> had one of the best opening weekends ever</h2> <p><em>Zootopia 2</em> hit theaters over the holiday weekend, and it broke a whole bunch of records on its way to earning an impressive $556 million. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/zootopia-2-box-office-records-1236631348/">As reported by <em>Deadline</em></a>, Disney’s new animated sequel had the largest opening for an animated movie in history, was the fourth-biggest opening in movie history ever, and now also holds the record as Disney’s biggest animated movie opening. And that’s just <em>some</em> of the records it smashed.</p>

 <h2>A bunch of Xbox games are nominated for PlayStation Game of the Year awards</h2> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/01/ps-blog-game-of-the-year-awards-2025-polls-are-now-live/">Sony announced</a> that fan voting for this 2025’s PlayStation Blog Game of the Year Awards was now open. And if you peruse the categories, you’ll notice that an awful lot of games are from studios or publishers owned by Xbox, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2,</em> and <em>Forza Horizon.</em> In fact, four of the games nominated for the blog’s top honors, Best PS5 game of 2025, are from Xbox-owned studios. Video games in 2025 are so weird now, y’all.</p>

 <h2>Oops, some <em>GTA 6</em> animations have leaked</h2> <p>A demo reel containing what appears to be <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1995234091856478416"><em>GTA 6</em> animations</a> was uploaded by an animator who worked on the highly anticipated open-world game. Fans quickly spotted the animations and started sharing them online. Of course, the video has since been deleted, but that hasn’t stopped the animations from spreading on social media and Reddit.</p> <p>The clips show a man loading an electric bike into a bike rack and a woman jumping out of a pickup truck. Not the most exciting stuff, but fans who have been waiting for over a decade for<em> GTA 6</em> will take anything they can get their hands on between now and the game’s launch on November 19, 2026.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-perfect-thanksgiving-plate-2000648127">What’s the perfect Thanksgiving plate?&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-games-pc-steam-wishlist-black-friday-thanksgaming-2000648371">Here are some good indie games!</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689">The best of 2025 (so far…)</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
