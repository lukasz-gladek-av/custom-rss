              <p>After nearly 50 years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204">Cracker Barrel</a> changed its logo last week. You probably heard or read something about it, as news of the change and the reaction to it became one of the biggest topics on the internet. And so, somehow, that leads us to a person online replacing the Cracker Barrel logo with the entirety of <em>Robocop</em> from 1987.</p> <p>On August 23, a few days after the Cracker Barrel news had swept the internet and sparked countless blogs and articles (<a href="https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204">even we wrote about it</a>), Twitter user Kodiak posted to the dying social media site the “full 1987 film <em>RoboCop</em> rendered as the Cracker Barrel logo.” You might be wondering a few things, namely: Why? Well, don’t worry, Kodiak doesn’t want to leave you with a mystery. Why did they re-render <em>RoboCop</em> as the Cracker Barrel logo?&nbsp; “Because nothing matters,” <a href="https://x.com/thisiskodiak/status/1959402871939862841">posted Kodiak</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The full 1987 film RoboCop rendered as the Cracker Barrel logo. Because nothing matters. <a href="https://t.co/0e1UjAezJY">pic.twitter.com/0e1UjAezJY</a></p> <p>— Kodiak (@ThisIsKodiak) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisIsKodiak/status/1959402871939862841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Is this the ideal way to watch <em>RoboCop</em>? Some might say yes. <a href="https://x.com/jenny____r/status/1959668520452862246">At least one person has seemingly watched the film on their big screen TV</a>, which is fun to think about. Another question you might be pondering—between never-ending thoughts about Cracker Barrel’s new, boring logo and what it means in relation to modern-day society—is a simple one: Is this legal? I’m not a lawyer. I’d probably say no, but these days it really does seem like law and order is out the window, and the rich and powerful can do whatever they want. Ohhh….wait, now I get why they picked <em>RoboCop</em> for this joke. Funny! (Shout out to <em><a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-b-testing-your-anti-woke-meltdown-e1a04224ffbb38b6">Garbage Day</a></em> for spotting this.)</p> <p>Anyway, go ahead and watch <em>RoboCop</em> until Twitter kills the video. At the moment, it has over 550k views, so it seems like Elon Musk and whoever still works at Twitter don’t care. Or they forgot the password to the account that lets them delete stuff. Either way, enjoy <em>RoboCop</em>. Or you can go buy and play that <a href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568">awesome <em>RoboCop</em> game from a few years back</a>. Do both at the same time? What do I care? I’m not your dad.</p>

              <p>It’s&nbsp;<span>highly unlikely that we’ll see <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-valve-erik-wolpaw-half-life-alyx-steam-counter-s-1848807049">a new&nbsp;<em>Portal</em> game</a> anytime soon from series creators </span>Valve. But now you can create your own<em> Portal 3</em> in a place I didn’t expect: <em>Minecraft</em>. Or you can play through 50 pre-made <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-2-is-the-better-portal-but-you-better-bring-a-f-5793326"><em>Portal</em> <em>2</em></a> puzzles via a newly released <em>Minecraft</em> mod.</p> <p>On August 22, <a href="https://portaljavaedition.net/about">a group of 20+ modders and fan devs released <em>Portal: Java Edition</em></a>, a free remake of Valve’s 2011 first-person puzzler built entirely in vanilla Minecraft using resource and data packs. That <em>technically</em> means the project, which is free to download now on PC, doesn’t use any “mods,” though the creators do include extra third-party mods that help with optimization. And you’ll likely want to install those if you plan to play. This rebuilt version of<em> Portal 2</em> in <em>Minecraft</em> is pushing the Java version of the popular crafting game hard, and it can chug on even beefy PCs without the extra mods.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Portal: Java Edition | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v7ZfuKZNis?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to the team behind it<em>, Portal: Java Edition</em> started development in 2020 and has taken roughly five years to complete. The mod includes all the mechanics and features from <em>Portal 2</em>, including portals (of course), lasers, light bridges, and mobility gels. The project is shipping with 50 levels spread across eight map packs. And if you burn through all of those, well, don’t worry, you can make some more, thanks to the included level editor. The level editor should be pretty easy to use for <em>Minecraft</em> vets, as it seems to function just like building anything else in Mojang’s crafting game, just with more big red buttons and companion cubes.</p> <p>To play <em>Portal: Java Edition</em>, you’ll need to own <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> on PC and then download the project’s files from GitHub. I had to download an older version of <em>Minecraft</em> to get <em>Portal</em> working in the game, but that’s not too hard and is fully supported by the official <em>Minecraft</em> launcher. Once more people are playing this and building levels in it, I expect to replay <em>Doom’s</em>&nbsp;E1M1 and the first level of<em> Super Mario Bros</em>. in the near future.</p>

              <p><em>Replaced</em> has been turning heads since it was first revealed back at E3 2021 (RIP), but actually completing the game has taken longer than anyone thought it would, including its developers at Sad Cat Studios. At long last, there’s good news, though: the team recently confirmed the gorgeous pixel art action game will arrive sometime next spring.</p> <p>That early 2026 timeframe will be a bummer to those secretly hoping <em>Replaced</em> might still sneak out onto PC and Xbox before the end of the year, but it’s better than nothing for fans who have been waiting years to finally see the cinematic cyberpunk platformer in action for themselves. After missing its original 2022 launch window, the day-and-date Game Pass game has been subject to continuous delays. A 2024 launch slipped into 2025, which has now slipped into 2026. What makes this time any different?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Replaced: Official Development Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPoyEkQePA4?start=146&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“This is the first time I’m addressing this personally and that’s because I can finally say it with confidence,” game director Yura Zhdanovich revealed in a new developer update. “<em>Replaced</em> will be released in spring of 2026. We will need just a little more time to get it polished. And to be more precise, our final trailer for the game with the exact release date will be shown later this year.”</p>  <p>Zhdanovich seems to be teasing a final date getting announced at The Game Awards 2025. Until then, <em>Replaced</em> has looked surprisingly good during its recent showing at Gamescom. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Much like<em> Silksong</em></a>, its repeated delays seem to have less to do with development woes (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">minus having to relocate because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>) than the fact that Sad Cat Studios had just been severely underestimating how much time it would take to get <em>Replaced</em> right.</p> <h2 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"><em>Replaced</em> is more than just eye-candy</h2> <p>Sporting a <em>Batman: Arkham</em>-like, combo-based combat system and tons of vibrant, detailed pixel art backgrounds, <em>Replaced</em> is exactly the kind of “hand-crafted” indie project that deserves as much production time as it can get. Add in the cinematic mood and ambiance of puzzle-platform games like <em>Inside</em> and <em>Planet of Lana</em>, and you have the recipe for something very special if Sad Cat Studios can pull it off. The latest demo of the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8Buktx_K0">looks as promising as ever</a>.</p>  <div tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"> <p>“We have done more than 600 clips of animation, which effectively translates to several thousands of hand painted frames of those animations blended together with beautiful VFX, amplifying the mix between retro and modern visuals,” Zhdanovich said. No AI-generated slop in sight. You love to see it.</p> </div>
