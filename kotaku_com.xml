              <p>The other shoe has dropped at Cloud Chamber. Following an internal delay and management shakeup, the studio making <em>BioShock 4</em> has now laid off 80 people, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. Originally, the sequel had supposedly been targeting a late 2026 release, but it will likely take longer now as significant aspects of the game, including the story, are reworked.</p> <p>Layoffs announced on Tuesday amounted to about a third of the staff at the roughly 250-person studio. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the next <em>BioShock</em> has gone through multiple studios and leadership teams over the last decade, with problems arising at Cloud Chamber in part due to the need to create a new studio while also meeting sky-high expectations for the franchise. One of the stumbling blocks was reportedly its rapid growth and the game’s shift to the newest version of Unreal Engine.</p> <p>“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” 2K Games president David Ismailer <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-layoffs-rod-fergusson-diablo-gears-2000618449">wrote in a memo to staff</a> this week that was shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">reported</a> earlier this month that<em> BioShock</em> 4’s latest stumble occurred following a negative internal review with executives, with particular concern about the game’s narrative. Publicly, 2K Games has said that the new <em>BioShock</em> is good but not good enough. “Some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay,” Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K parent company Take-Two, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a recent interview. Industry veteran Rod Fergusson is now leading the project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-infinite-update-multiplayer-modes-cut-gears-5933119">the second time</a> he’s been tasked with clawing a <em>BioShock</em> game out of development hell.</p>

              <p>Two free mods for the PC version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a> that removed the clothes from one of the game’s main female characters were removed by publisher Take-Two Interactive using a DMCA request.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/take-two-lawyers-give-mafia-nude-mods-the-cement-shoes-treatment-dmca-projects-that-had-the-dons-daughter-parading-in-the-buff/">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a>, a pair of NSFW nude mods for the recently released linear action game <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>have been removed from popular modding site Nexus Mods by Take Two’s lawyers, according to a Nexus customer support representative on <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13520836-takedown-request-issued-by-take-two-interactive-software-inc/">the site’s forums</a>. One of the nude mods replaced Isabella Torrisi’s in-game model with a nude version.&nbsp; The other mod, “Extended Textures For Nude Isabella,” allowed players to modify the character’s model, letting them give her “bigger nipples, bigger areola,” and even offering “cute pubic hair” options, according to text still indexed on Google search results. Both of these mods were created by Nexus user norskpl.</p> <p>“A takedown/DMCA request was issued by Lisa Deere [on behalf of Take Two Interactive Software, Inc.] on 08/12/2025,” posted a Nexus mod rep on the forums. “We were able to internally verify the legitimacy of this claim through the requesting of additional evidence to prove the identity of the claimant and the rights they hold over the content in question.”</p> <p>Interestingly, screenshots of the mod seem to indicate that norskpl didn’t create the nude model of Isabella themselves, but instead ripped it out of a different part of <em>The </em><em>Old Country</em> which features a nude Torrisi in bed with another character. It seems that they then tweaked the model and added options to modify it using mods. So in a way, this is like Take-Two Interactive’s lawyers DMCAing their own content. It’s an odd situation, but not surprising, <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-is-removing-old-gta-mods-using-dmca-notices-1847315391">as in the past, Take-Two has used DMCA requests</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-interactive-removes-more-gta-mods-using-dmca-s-1848053219">yank down mods they don’t approve of in other games</a>, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-goes-on-another-grand-theft-auto-mod-killing-s-1847467984"><em>Grand Theft Auto V. </em></a></p> <p>Perhaps using the <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s own pre-existing nude model is the problem, as it is content owned by Take-Two being used in a way they likely don’t approve of. I wonder, had the modder had just replaced the don’s daughter with a nude Shrek or Thanos, if Take-Two lawyers would have shown up at all.</p>
