              <p><i>Escape from Tarkov</i>, arguably one of the most hardcore extraction shooters out there, is finally making its way to Steam. The game has previously lived in perpetual beta status, but now the highly anticipated 1.0 release is expected this November. You can’t buy it on Steam just yet, though the listing is up and you can wishlist it. But, as some are learning, if you have already been a long-time <i>Tarkov</i> player and are hoping to consolidate your game library under Valve’s launcher or make use of Steam’s social features, you won’t just be able to download the game on Steam and connect your Battlestate Games account. You’ll have to pay for the game a second time.</p> <p>Like with many things involving <i>Tarkov</i>, this is all a little confusing, if not intimidating. So let’s break it down.</p> <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3932890/Escape_from_Tarkov/">Steam page for <i>EFT</i></a> went public today, with a release date of “coming soon.” Meanwhile, a FAQ on <i>EFT</i>’s official website lists <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/support/knowledge/542">some potentially disappointing news for some</a>: “To play <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> through Steam, you will need to link a Battlestate Games account to your Steam account.” This is hardly unique to <i>EFT</i>’s arrival on Steam, as other games, such as <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> and, more recently, <i>Star Wars Outlaws</i>, that have previously launched elsewhere and later come out on Steam typically have not supported a “cross-buy” situation. Still, this news has left a sour taste for many, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1niiife/comment/nej0yg3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">fans chiming in</a> <a href="https://x.com/OnlyBeysYT/status/1967968457682817456">on social media</a> to suggest the game is likely to get review bombed upon release and that it just feels silly, greedy even.</p>

 <p>The same FAQ page states that if you previously purchased <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/purchase">any of the more expensive versions</a> of the game, a newly purchased Steam copy “will automatically use the higher edition of the two when launching the game” once you’ve linked your accounts. So, technically speaking, if playing on Steam is a must, and you’ve purchased a more expensive version of <i>EFT</i> in the past, you should only buy the base edition on Steam when it goes live.</p> <p>The Steam FAQ page also contains some other potentially upsetting information: There are currently no plans for <i>EFT</i> to support the Steam Deck and Family Sharing is a no-go. Plus, the system requirements, as seen on the Steam page, are pretty steep. Recommended specs include 64GB (!!) of RAM and a 4070.</p>

 <p><i>Escape from Tarkov</i>’s main extraction mode will finally emerge from beta status on November 15, 2025, after nearly a decade in development. But it’s not the only mode that <i>EFT</i> has on offer.</p>  <p>As an extraction shooter, <i>Tarkov</i> features PvP elements that see both bots and players on a live multiplayer map, though the main game loop is all about getting in, looting, surviving, and extracting. Two years ago, however, BSG released <i>EFT: Arena</i> as a standalone solution for those who wanted to experience the tactical shooter in a competitive environment. Though <i>Arena</i> uses the same <i>EFT</i> account to share rank and stats, and is available for purchase individually on the Epic Games Store right now, this mode does not have a Steam listing.</p> <p>So while needing to buy the game a second time if you desperately need to play might be a bummer, it’s worth noting that you <i>can</i> just add non-Steam games to the Steam launcher. That said, given that you’ll still need a BSG account and your previous purchases of the more expensive editions will carry over, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1niiife/discussion_tarkov_has_a_steam_page_now/">some are wondering</a> why BSG can’t just allow the base version to carry over with a download of the launcher through Steam.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Devs Were Extremely Focused On Optimization And Performance]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797">After playing <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s open beta last month,</a> I was impressed by how well it performed on console. And footage of the beta running on an <a href="https://youtu.be/gLqxhWuli3Y">Nvidia 1060 GPU</a>, a nearly decade-old card at this point, further impressed me. So when I recently talked to some of the devs about <em>BF6</em>, I was curious how the team made it run so well, and they explained it was about not pushing consoles too hard and always optimizing during development.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-controversial-quick-turn-flick-console-why-cheating-2000625445">During my video call with <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;technical director Christian Buhl</a>, I asked if he felt like the current generation of consoles was tapped out and needed to be replaced or if they still had some performance to squeeze out of them. He told <em>Kotaku</em> that while he always feels like “there’s more room to improve performance,” he doesn’t expect devs to “double frame rates” in future PS5 and Xbox Series X/S games at this point. And with <em>Battlefield 6</em>, the studios working on it weren’t even trying to push these consoles to some theoretical breaking point. Instead, the goal was always to make an online FPS that ran very well.</p> <p><span>“We also were intentionally not trying to push super hard on [PS5/Xbox Series X/S,]” said Buhl. “We didn’t want to push to the edge and fail. We wanted to make sure that we had an experience that we could optimize, that we could get to the point where it was going to run reliably at 60 frames per second, or, you know, over 80, whatever settings you preferred. And that was our focus, right? Like, get stuff in there, get it performant, and then add [more].”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>Buhl admitted that in the past, developers working on <em>Battlefield</em> games had a different approach. Often teams would “build a bunch of cool shit and then try to make it work.” This time around, that wasn’t the case, and Buhl told me that during development, <em>Battlefield 6</em> had to “<span>constantly be working; it had to constantly be performant.” </span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, it’s not like we’re 100 percent hitting our targets throughout development. But every time we [dropped] too low, we put performance optimization efforts in place, paused work, [and said], ‘You can’t add stuff until we get this optimized,'” explained Buhl. “</span><span>So that we could kind of make sure that at the end, we weren’t trying to do this giant lift of taking it from 30 frames to 60 frames, or something like that. We were taking it from, like, 55 to 60, right? And that’s a much more feasible effort.”</span></p>

 <h2>The ongoing debate around video game performance</h2> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> on consoles does still use upscaling tech. Buhl confirmed to <em>Kotaku</em> that on PS5 and PS5 Pro the game uses PSSR. And on all consoles, FSR is available too. But it’s clear the devs were focused intently during development on shipping a game that ran well no matter where you played it, even if that meant cutting back visuals or effects.</p> <p>The topic of video game optimization has become a hot one following the release of <em>Borderlands 4</em> last week. Many claim the highly anticipated looter shooter is poorly optimized on PC and console, with players complaining about having to use low settings and DLSS to run the game on beefy rigs. For a point of comparison, <em>BF6</em> is pretty playable on a 1060. <a href="https://youtu.be/UnTB3AkNkno"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is very much not.</a> That card is below the minimum PC specs for both games.</p>

 <p>In my experience on both PS5 and PC, <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s performance has definitely disappointed me. Especially on PS5, where some others and I have run into an issue where the game’s framerate drops lower and lower as you play longer and longer. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has pushed back on these criticisms, claiming the game is very well optimized for what it is and has suggested some players need to lower settings. And if you aren’t happy, you can just <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-boss-tells-players-please-get-a-refund-from-steam-if-you-arent-happy-as-randy-pitchford-continues-his-very-public-crashout-over-the-fpss-performance-woes/">return the game and get your money back</a>.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. EA told me the game will support 60FPS on all platforms, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">even Xbox Series S,</a> and on some machines, like the PS5 Pro, the game can exceed that framerate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Great RPG Demos You Can Play Right Now For Free]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-free-demo-rpg-digimon-persona-3-2000624957</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-great-rpg-demos-you-can-play-right-now-for-free.1299540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re looking for something new to play this fall but can’t quite decide what to dive into, these free demos might help you make up your mind. They run the gamut from traditional turn-based RPG to action roguelike and mech RPG-lite. Best of all, nearly all of them let you carry over your progress from the free demo to the full paid game if you end up taking the plunge. Most of them are also available across nearly ever console.</p> <h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></h2>  <p>I recently had the opportunity to go hands-on with <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> for <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093">a couple of hours at PAX West</a> and was pleasantly surprised by just how good it looks, sounds, and plays. It’s a crunchy turn-based RPG that seems like it’ll have a lot of Digimon-customizing depth to mine, but with the aid of some streamlining including a fast-forward option for battles. The demo takes place at the beginning of the game, sets up its central mystery, and introduces you to most of the basic systems. If you opt to keep playing, you can pick up right where you left off in the full release next month.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 3</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p> <h2><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em></h2>  <p>Imagine <em>Hades</em> but you control two characters instead of just one and you get a sense of the chaos and potential of <em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em>. Choose a team of two from an assortment of guardians, each with their own abilities and each controlled by a separate thumbstick. If you make it to the end, a guardian must be sacrificed and is removed from your pool of fighters until the evil you’re fighting is sealed away for good. There’s a fair bit of town-building, build-crafting, and weapon-crafting on top of this loop, making<em> Towa and the Guardians</em> far and away one of the more interesting mashups I’ve played this year.</p>

 <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 19</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em></h2>  <p>The first game in the super-awesome but very convoluted <em>Trails</em> series is getting a remake and it’s almost out.<em> Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is a modern 3D overhaul of the 2006 isometric PSP RPG. It’s basically taking the world and story of the original and grafting it onto the more current gameplay systems from the recent <em>Trails Through Daybreak</em> games, including a hybrid of turn-based and real-time action combat options. If you’ve always been curious about Nihon Falcom’s long-running science fantasy series but couldn’t figure out where to jump in, <em> Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is meant to be the lifeline for you. It might not be as easy to hop into from a gameplay perspective as the original, but the presentation and everything else is a lot prettier and more streamlined.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 19</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em></h2>  <p>What if you combined <em>Armored Core</em> with <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>? It sounds like a match made in open-world mech RPG heaven, right? Based on my early time with <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em>, the sequel to the Switch exclusive doesn’t entirely deliver on that promise but there are definitely more than a few flashes of brilliance. <em>Titanic Scion</em> has you taking big robot suits through sprawling environments to kill enemies and upgrade your powers, culminating in the occasional big boss fight. The scope is way more massive than in the original, which means it’s not necessarily doing any one thing very good. For anime mech-heads, though, it’s definitely worth a look. What it lacks in cogent storytelling and environmental detail, it makes up for with some really excellent mech progression and customization gameplay.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 5</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Persona 3: Reload&nbsp;</em></h2>  <p>The best <em>Persona</em> is finally coming to Switch 2! <em>Persona 3: Reload</em> hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last year, where the demo has been free for a while now. But the announcement of a port for Nintendo’s newest portable has brought a free demo to Switch 2 as well ahead of launch next month. Hang in there! The opening of <em>Persona 3</em> is one of the slowest among the series’ modern entries, and the dungeon-grinding mechanics can get tedious at times. But the music, characters, and later game are all top-notch. If the other <em>Persona</em> games haven’t gripped you, <em>Reload</em> might have what you’ve been missing. There’s a bit more old-school dungeon crawling in it and the story is darker, more unsettling, and, in my opinion at least, ultimately more engaging.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 23</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 2</p>
