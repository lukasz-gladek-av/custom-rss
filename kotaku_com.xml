            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  The Spring Drop will bring in a host of new baby animals, and eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
                </p><div>
              
              <p>The next major update to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> is going to make all the baby animals over 2,740 percent cuter. I checked the figures using measurements, and by watching the new trailer for the Spring Drop four times over.</p> <p>It seems that until now,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> has generated its baby animals by scaling down the body size of their adult forms, but keeping the heads the same. And that’s good. That’s worked. But there was room for improvement. In the next update, due in the spring, all the game’s younger animals will receive bespoke designs, complete with all-new animations, sound effects, and the cutest iddle widdle eyes you’ve ever seen.</p>

  <p>Seriously, how are we supposed to even cope with those fuzzy lil’ guys? Those bunnies! The new wolf pups! The way the bunnies tip their heads and twitch their ears?!</p>

 <p>This is also a splendid piece of game promotion, for a game that requires less advertising than oxygen. Mojang’s Agnes Larsson is infectiously and apporiately excited about the new pups, and it compelling portrays&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> as a game that’s interesting far beyond that of the PvP-focused YouTube denizens of LifeSteal or what have you.</p>

 <p>I tested the video to its absolute limits, by this morning showing it to my 11-year-old son who is hellbent on a new, tougher exterior, and he melted before it. There were attempts at somewhat patronizing, “Yeah, that’s sweet,” remarks to placate me until he was caught off guard and let out, “KITTENS!” After that, he was n. Some cool credibility was recovered on the reveal that name tags are soon to be craftable, as he let out a YouTuber’s “Yesssssssss,” and carefully noted the ingredients for the task. After that, his Switch lured him away from the video, as he and fellow classmates rushed to work on a new world on their shared Realm before each player was popped out of existence as they were dragged from screen to school. I happily continued watching yet again, until Larsson was once more scratching a real pig’s belly with a rake.</p>

 <p>I’m a little bit worried about how I’m going to cope <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">on returning to Donut SMP</a> to a world that is yet to contain those cuboid little chicks, or baby highland cattle that I need to hug until they pop.</p> <p>All of the above is currently available in Snapshot, Beta and Preview versions of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, although there’s no date for when it will all properly arrive.</p>

<p>If you want a pair of your own right now, you’re in luck. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">You can get fourth-generation Apple AirPods on Amazon.com for under $100, which represents a savings of $29 compared to their retail price of $129</a>. That’s about 22% off, which is well worth locking in your purchase for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A pair of one of Apple’s best sets of earbuds</h2>
<p>These AirPods are all about seamless integration, and they do that perfectly. As soon as you pair the AirPods with your iPhone, the AirPods will also automatically appear on your iPad, Mac, and any additional Apple products that utilize the same Apple ID. To start listening to music, podcasts, etc., simply open the AirPod case and put the AirPods in your ears.</p>
<p>In terms of sound quality, the fourth-generation Apple AirPods sound great. They deliver balanced audio with clear vocals, punchy enough bass, and relaxed tuning that allows for extended listening periods without fatiguing your ears. And they’re super comfortable, too. Each stem is relatively thin and lightweight, so you don’t get tired of wearing them.</p>
<p>Plus, the included charging case fits into a pocket or bag so you can carry the AirPods with you at all times and recharge them when needed. Simply flip the lid of the charging case and you can determine if there is sufficient battery left to continue listening or if it is time to charge the AirPods again.</p>



<p>As far as battery life, the fourth-generation Apple AirPods are capable of delivering hours of continuous listening per charge, allowing users to listen to content for extended periods of time. After the battery runs low, the AirPods can be placed back into the charging case for additional power to extend the amount of time available for listening. Users can also recharge the charging case via a cable, eliminating the need to store separate chargers for individual components.</p>
<p>These Apple AirPods build upon the ease-of-use features that were introduced in earlier generations of AirPods and offer you a budget-friendly option to upgrade or acquire a set that improve on Apple’s previous release in just about every way. If you’re interested in grabbing the new AirPods right now, be sure you lock in this deal while it’s still available.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Darth Jar Jar Is Real (Sort Of): LEGO’s Dark Falcon Brings the Wildest Star Wars Fan Theory to Life and Now at Its Lowest Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/darth-jar-jar-is-real-sort-of-legos-dark-falcon-brings-the-wildest-star-wars-fan-theory-to-life-and-now-at-its-lowest-price-2000657841</link>
            <guid>1400305</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the years preceding the release of the sequel trilogy, a quite infamous and entertaining Star Wars fan theory began circulating online. The idea was simple: Jar Jar is Evil. The delightfully wacky Gungan was never meant to be comic relief, but rather the true villain of the prequel trilogy. According to the theory, George Lucas had originally planned to reveal Jar Jar as the saga’s ultimate puppet master, only to abandon the twist after audiences reacted poorly to the character following <em>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em>. Some fans treated the theory as a genuine missed opportunity, others as a long-running joke—but nearly everyone agreed it was fun to imagine an alternate Star Wars timeline where “Darth Jar Jar” was real.</p>
<p>That alternate timeline now appears to be alive and well—at least in brick form. LEGO has wholeheartedly embraced this playful “what if” scenario with its LEGO Star Wars The Dark Falcon set.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/"> As we kick off the new year, Amazon is offering the set at a 17% discount, dropping the price from its usual $180 down to $148,</a> a $32 savings on one of the more unusual and conversation-starting Star Wars builds in recent memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Dark Falcon exists in a twisted mirror version of the Star Wars universe, where heroes and villains have swapped moral alignments. The iconic Millennium Falcon design is reimagined in sleek jet black with striking red accents, immediately evoking Sith aesthetics rather than Rebel scrappiness. That theme extends to the minifigures as well, each offering a role reversal that ranges from clever to downright absurd.</p>

<h2>Your Favorite Star Wars Characters, But Wrong</h2>
<p>Front and center is the figure fans have joked about for years: Darth Jar Jar. The Naboo native finally gets his moment as a full-fledged Sith, complete with a menacing double-bladed red lightsaber reminiscent of Darth Maul’s. Rey joins him on the dark side, also wielding a double-bladed red saber—though this one runs parallel, like a tuning fork. C-3PO reappears as a bounty hunter, keeping much of his familiar silhouette but taking on a far tougher persona and red-glowing eyes.</p>
<p>On the flip side, classic villains get heroic makeovers. Darth Vader becomes Jedi Vader, dressed in a clean white outfit and wielding a blue lightsaber like he did in his Anakin Skywalker days. Then there’s the most unsettling transformation of all: Luke Skywalker. No longer the noble Jedi, but also not a villain the way you’d expect with this pattern going. Instead, Luke has embraced a bizarre, laid-back beach lifestyle. LEGO’s design makes him look less like a galactic hero and more like The Dude from The Big Lebowski, blue milk in hand and vibes fully off.</p>



<p>Beyond the minifigures, The Dark Falcon is packed with interactive features. The 1,579-piece set measures over 5 inches tall, 7 inches long, and 12.5 inches wide. Flip-up panels reveal a detailed interior, while spring-loaded shooters let you fire off lasers. There’s a removable throne for Darth Jar Jar, a jail cell for Beach Luke, and an opening cockpit that seats two minifigures.</p>
<p>This strange reimagining isn’t tied to traditional Star Wars canon, but instead to LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy, a four-episode animated series that debuted on Disney+ in 2024. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the Darth Jar Jar theory or simply enjoy seeing Star Wars turned upside down, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">The Dark Falcon LEGO set is a standout collector’s piece—especially at $32 off for a limited time.</a></p>
