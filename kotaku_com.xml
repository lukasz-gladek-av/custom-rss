While the mainline video game series may have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">broken from its traditional three-year cycle</a></span>, the trading card game has not, and the run of Gen-IX-led packs comes to an end with this month’s release of Black Bolt and White Flare. Oddly, it’s a celebration of the Unova region, the home of <em>Black</em> and <em>White</em>’s Pokémon, and it’s the English language version’s first ever split set.</p><p>There’s a lot going on here, and little of it makes a great deal of sense. For the last 15 years, there’s been a new mainline <em>Pokémon </em>game from Game Freak every three years. As such, the TCG has followed behind, running three-year cycles adding the new generation of monsters to the mix, and introducing the new wave of Trainers. But without a game this year, and DLC for <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> having dried up long ago, there’s nothing new for the table-top game to add—hence the re-introduction of Mega Evolution.</p><p>But also, hang on, this is all happening six months early! <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> didn’t finish until March 2023. Given the lack of a new game, why are we moving on already? I’m so confused. And given this, you might imagine the seemingly last set from the <em>SV</em> era to be a climactic celebration of Gen IX Pokémon, the Paldea region in which the games were set, and the “ex” cards that dominated the game. But nope.</p><h2 id="h334876"><a id=""></a>Wait, this is a <em>Black</em> and <em>White </em>set?</h2><p><em>Sword &amp; Shield</em>’s three years ended with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-crown-zenith-vstar-universe-pull-rates-art-1850005871?_gl=1*1lmmirp*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI0ODgzNTUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTI0OTEwNjAkajYwJGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-crown-zenith-vstar-universe-pull-rates-art-1850005871?_gl=1*1lmmirp*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI0ODgzNTUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTI0OTEwNjAkajYwJGwwJGgw">the fantastic Crown Zenith</a></span>, a special set that was a mighty send-off to the V and V-Star cards and the Galar region, so something similar was expected. Instead, and honestly I’m delighted by it, we have a <em>Black &amp; White</em>-based collection that features all 156 Unova region Pokémon! Bonkers.</p><p>This new set also represents the first time a non-Japanese set is being released in two distinct halves, with specific cards only available in either Black Bolt or White Flare. This is different from when a set releases with two variant Elite Trainer Boxes, as while those have unique extras, the packs within remain identical. Here we’ve got different packs with different cards, found inside different ETBs. Also, because it’s a so-called special set, there are no booster boxes, and no packs sold loose. So, er, yeah, given the current state of the TCG, it’s going to be an absolute nightmare to find anything.</p><p>However, should you find something, there are some stunning cards to pull. We have no idea of pull rates yet (I should have more of an idea later this week when I’ve torn through some early samples), but I’m desperately hoping <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">the more recent trend</a></span> of generosity might continue, even to the point of the glorious stats of Crown Zenith.</p><h2 id="h334877"><a id=""></a>So what’s in Black Bolt and White Flare?</h2><p>Right, hopefully you’re now as utterly confused as the situation requires. Will we see a surprise return from <em>S&amp;V</em> next year? No one knows! But in the meantime, we have this completely inexplicable celebration of <em>Black &amp; White</em> pocket monsters to enjoy. I’ve gone through all the Black Bolt and White Flare cards we know will be in the set to pick out some highlights, the cards you’ll either want to pull because they’re so pretty, or because they’ll fetch the biggest prices. Not all have had an English version released yet, but while the text will change, the art remains identical.</p><p>The set is going to be so daft. Every single basic card will have a regular version, then a reverse holo variant, and then a different Poké Ball reverse holo variant, <em>and then another</em> Master Ball reverse holo version. Anyone looking to complete a master set is going to need to collect 800 cards. They don’t make binders that big.</p><p>We have seen packs opened already—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT1LN_yDrrs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT1LN_yDrrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTubers who don’t feel beholden to embargoes and street dates</a></span>&nbsp;have already given us an indication of how often alt-arts are appearing. It has revealed a new pattern for Energy cards, and the inclusion of a very cool stripy holo pattern on rarer Energy cards. It’s also shown that you can get a triple-hit in a single pack, with an art rare, ex, and holo Energy all together.</p><p>Right, let’s get on with the good stuff. Click on to see somehow of the highlights in the split set.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="59039313ea42fbb8e765304d69e6ea90" data-recommend-id="image://59039313ea42fbb8e765304d69e6ea90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Klinklang" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Klinklang" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59039313ea42fbb8e765304d69e6ea90" data-recommend-id="image://59039313ea42fbb8e765304d69e6ea90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Klinklang" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Look, let’s all be adult about this. Unovan Pokémon are hardly the best range. Filled with the likes of the vile Pansage, Pansear and Panpour, and whatever the holy heck a Musharna is supposed to be, it wasn’t exactly the most inspired collection. Vanillite, for crying out loud. Oh, and that Audino abomination. Brrrr. But thankfully, great artists can make up for terrible crimes. As is the case with this Klinklang.</p><p>You have to imagine that everyone involved was just not feeling it when they drew up the Unovan creatures. “I dunno,” someone must have said. “What about three Pokémon that are just cogs?” And someone else looked over, annoyed to be interrupted while drawing a Pidove and pretending it was different from a Pidgey, and said, “Sure, whatever.”</p><p>But then along comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-scarlet-violet-yuka-morii-1849600725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-scarlet-violet-yuka-morii-1849600725">the wonderful Yuka Morii</a></span> and delivers a clay-made rendition of the awful idea. I’d love to have seen this lit a bit more brightly, but it’s so rare that we see Morii get a full-art card that it’s to be celebrated every time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7514ef367effaa34d2421a4f7b666ae4" data-recommend-id="image://7514ef367effaa34d2421a4f7b666ae4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Audino" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Audino" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7514ef367effaa34d2421a4f7b666ae4" data-recommend-id="image://7514ef367effaa34d2421a4f7b666ae4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Audino" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>And to prove the point further, here’s an Audino card I want to own. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-asako-ito-nintendo-silver-tempest-1849614423&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-asako-ito-nintendo-silver-tempest-1849614423">Asako Ito</a></span> has her first full-art card since Crown Zenith’s Altaria!</p><p>No one seems to know who Asako Ito really is—the name is a pun on crocheting, and unless this is one of the most extreme examples of nominative determinism, it seems very unlikely that’s her real name. But whomever she may be, her cards with their woolen Pokémon and felt backgrounds are a constant delight. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="79bfa7661294cb3cb5964c414e886a2d" data-recommend-id="image://79bfa7661294cb3cb5964c414e886a2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Oshawott" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Oshawott" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79bfa7661294cb3cb5964c414e886a2d" data-recommend-id="image://79bfa7661294cb3cb5964c414e886a2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Oshawott" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t just a matter of cuteness, I swear. Although goodness me, it’s very cute. It’s that this type of art tends to do extremely well, too. The level of detail, and depictions of the coast, always seem to spike prices.

Hilda is a special art rare in the Japanese set, so likely a special illustration rare over here, and, well, you can see the angle of the depiction and figure out why everyone’s going to buy it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76c40f3d80052669e157feff69382e61" data-recommend-id="image://76c40f3d80052669e157feff69382e61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Keldeo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Keldeo ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76c40f3d80052669e157feff69382e61" data-recommend-id="image://76c40f3d80052669e157feff69382e61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Keldeo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This seems like an inevitable smash hit to me. Yuu Nishida’s Keldeo is a stunningly beautiful card, and so gloriously colorful. And look at the detail! Look at that two-stage waterfall in the background, the water ripples around Keldeo’s hooves, the god rays coming from the trees. </p><p>It helps that that two-energy first attack, the 30+ one, is in fact 30+90 if you played it from the bench that turn, and then Sonic Edge will do another 120 every turn after that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e14d110d92e5603a1cfe2c7c59ad4807" data-recommend-id="image://e14d110d92e5603a1cfe2c7c59ad4807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e14d110d92e5603a1cfe2c7c59ad4807" data-recommend-id="image://e14d110d92e5603a1cfe2c7c59ad4807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Oh wow.

Illustrated by Takumi Wada, who I believe was previously the lead artist on the <em>Zelda</em> franchise, and has now absolutely established himself within the <em>PTCG</em>. He also gave us Destined Rivals’ incredible Zamazenta and that lovely full-art Crustlem but this is something beyond. Gosh, I hope I can pull this, because I’ll never be able to afford to buy it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c6f62e478765688940e997ed003659c1" data-recommend-id="image://c6f62e478765688940e997ed003659c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Victini" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Victini" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c6f62e478765688940e997ed003659c1" data-recommend-id="image://c6f62e478765688940e997ed003659c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Victini" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, let’s move on to the real big-hitters. They might not be the prettiest, but they’re going to be very sought after.</p><p>A weird thing about this card is that it appears in both sets, as #171 in Black Bolt and #172 in White Flare. Another weird thing is that it’s almost entirely red. This was a promo in Japan, given away in tournaments and lotteries, making it far more rare. Ours will likely still be a very rare pull, but not quite as obscure. Still though, as a novelty, it’ll attract a lot of attention.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This and the next card are the big two, however. Or that’s clearly the hope, at least. With a brand new rarity designation—that white and black star—they’re a completely unique type of card, almost like a woodcut of holo lines, and this one appears far darker in real life than in the artwork.</p><p>It’s clearly hoped these will prove to be a big deal, especially given that they’ve <em>not</em> been chosen as the promo cards to include in the related ETB.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc841d34a5fef2f80daa416cf07a8e19" data-recommend-id="image://fc841d34a5fef2f80daa416cf07a8e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex White" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex White" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc841d34a5fef2f80daa416cf07a8e19" data-recommend-id="image://fc841d34a5fef2f80daa416cf07a8e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reshiram ex White" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>You can get a much better idea of the bizarre nature of these cards from the Reshiram version. Until we can hold one in our hands, it’s pretty hard to get an idea of how the holo effect works.</p><p>I think these two <em>will</em> be very popular, but I’m not convinced its a concept that’ll last if TPCi tries to keep it going. As with gold cards, in the end the artwork just can’t be as engaging or as enjoyable, and imposed rarity is really never what causes a particular card to really take off.</p><p>We’ll all know a lot more come July 18 when the sets are released into the wild.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202]]></content:encoded>

The first shows Superman and Krypto sitting on the moon looking down at Earth. The second is a goof between Superman and Mister Terrific about trying to patch up Metropolis after the third-act catastrophe. There are no surprising reveals. No teases for new characters and future movies. I thought for sure that Darkseid’s eyes were going to light up from the other side of a pocket universe portal or something. Instead, there was nothing. It’s such a relief. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After decades of Marvel erecting an ever broader and more convoluted web of movie and TV show tie-ins, each drawing from vast comic book reserves not just to create and tell stories that are entertaining in and of themselves, but to reliably fuel box-office revenues year in and year out, it is nice to sit down to a comic book movie that is unabashedly in love with its source material and willing to deploy it without obvious ulterior  motives. <em>Superman</em> is bursting with DC references and deep cuts, but in a way that feels like you stumbled upon them by rummaging through your friend’s old toy bins rather than watching them get made on the assembly line at the factory. </p><p>For example, there is the “Justice Gang” consisting of Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, Kendra Saunders/Hawkgirl, and Michael Holt/Mister Terrific. Their powerful-but-bumbling-but-ultimately-goodhearted shtick is a familiar trope in Gunn’s movies. They are essentially Diet Pepsi <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but nothing in <em>Superman</em> wastes time trying to lay the groundwork for a potential spin-off. They serve clear roles within the plot, have their own little micro-character arcs within the movie, but are mostly kept out of the way. The one exception is Mister Terrific who eventually becomes one of the anchors of the movie. Even then, nothing in <em>Superman </em>seeds the threat of a spin-off. </p><p>At no point do you feel like actor Edi Gathegi is “trying out” for a standalone movie, even though he aces every line, including some really terrible ones, and has the best single action sequence in <em>Superman</em>. It feels like how support characters were always used in the DC animated series, the only successful semblance of a DCU that Warner Bros. ever managed. The <em>Batman</em>,<em> Superman</em>, and <em>Justice League</em> animated series episodes were a tight 22 minutes each, designed to appear on TV out of order on any given afternoon or Saturday morning. The stories were never constructed as launching boards for new reoccurring characters in hopes of launching, for example, a separate <em>Aquaman</em> cartoon. They instead encouraged you to revel in whoever did show up because you  might not ever see them again except as part of the background scenery. </p><p><em>Superman</em> isn’t completely free of the superhero marketing industrial complex which shows like <em>The Boys</em> have successfully mocked for years. There’s a Peacemaker cameo, though it’s brief and simply played for laughs. And we do see<em> Supergirl</em> show up at some point after partying off-planet. Even that tease for the upcoming 2026 movie is tastefully limited and doesn’t sabotage the actual story everyone’s actually showing up to see. It does explain Krypto’s role in <em>Superman</em>, putting a neat, easily ignored bow on what is otherwise the most endearing part of the movie. What the movie doesn’t saddle us with are any throwaway scenes where characters we don’t know or care about mumble things like “Daggett Industries” to help “lay the groundwork” for a <em>Clayface</em> movie. That movie, coming next year, will have to rely on its own merits rather than riding the coattails of a greater DCU to achieve above-average box office success.</p><p> “I do believe that the reason why the movie industry is dying is not because of people not wanting to see movies,” Gunn told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/superman-director-james-gunn-dc-studios-interview-1235356450/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/superman-director-james-gunn-dc-studios-interview-1235356450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rolling Stone</em> last month</a></span>. “It’s not because of home screens getting so good. The number-one reason is because people are making movies without a finished screenplay.” You can tell the difference in<em> Superman</em>, a movie not labored by rewrites, reshoots, and backbench Marvel talent shuffling. It exists because watching a kind-hearted person protect people from monsters and corporate megalomaniacs is fun and cool and entertaining to watch. Not because it can <em>Moneyball </em>another half-dozen billion-dollar comic book franchises into existence. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204]]></content:encoded>
