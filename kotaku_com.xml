            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a new way to experience Nintendo’s fantastic <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</em> A completely free virtual reality mod for the open-world RPG is out now, letting you hop into Hyrule like never before, and it looks amazing.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR"><em>BetterVR</em> is a newly released mod</a> for the Wii U-emulated version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-breath-of-the-wild-helped-me-love-food-again-1842385671"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> that lets you play through the entirety of the game through the eyes of Link himself. You’ll need a copy of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> on Wii U, a somewhat powerful PC, the Cemu emulator, and, of course, a virtual reality headset like the Meta Quest 3. But if you have all that, you can now virtually explore <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in a whole new way.</p>

  <p>This is a fully stereo-rendered VR experience with 6DOF and no alternated eye rendering. <em>BetterVR</em> also supports full hand and arm tracking, letting you chop down trees and fight monsters by flailing around. (You can also use normal button commands if you prefer, of course.) It also features customized VR controls, like reaching behind your back to grab your sword, so it should play and feel like a native VR game.</p>

 <p>I’m not surprised this VR mod is so good. The team behind it, Flat2VR, are the same folks who created the <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-vr-mod-alyx-pc-valve-steam-gordon-freeman-1849603782">excellent<em> Half-Life 2 VR</em> mod that is as good as Valve’s very own</a><em> Half-Life: Alyx.</em> The team has also ported other games to VR and has even developed commercially released ports of titles, like <em>Roboquest VR.</em> Even with all that experience, however, making this mod wasn’t easy, as explained in a thorough writeup on the mod’s GitHub page. They had to reverse engineer a lot of how<em> Breath of the Wild</em> worked and then translate that into something that could be rendered and played in VR. The end result is impressive as heck, and I’m almost tempted to download this mod and set up an emulator to check it out. I wasn’t a big fan of <em>Breath of the Wild,</em> but maybe this would change my mind.</p>

 <p>As for how Nintendo lawyers will react to this, who can say? The project seems confident enough that it will be fine, <a href="https://x.com/Flat2VR/status/2005107315041513621">as the team has been posting about it publicly for days</a> before it launched on Tuesday. Seeing as the mod itself contains zero <em>Breath of the Wild</em> files, I’d say <em>BetterVR</em> is probably safe, but you never know with Nintendo.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-deals-soulslike-rpg-goty-discount-sale-2000656129</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2025 is almost over. The internet is full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">GOTY lists</a> recommending dozens of stellar releases. You can find many of the games on those lists currently on sale on the PlayStation store. It’s not a bad time to catch up on that game or two you missed that everyone was buzzing about this year and see what all the fuss is about while you’re nursing that New Year’s hangover.</p> <p>Below is a quick rundown of some of the biggest releases of 2025 that are all currently discounted on PSN:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></em> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></em> – $30 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></em> – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em></strong> – $32 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></strong> – $50 (29 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></strong> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></strong> – $48 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</strong></em> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction</em></strong> – $37.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> – $42 (40 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> – $33.50 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></strong> – The Ivalice Chronicles – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – $38.50 (45 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Standout deals include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> which are all essentially half off. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is the cheapest overall on the list at $16 and probably has the best player value quotient when it comes to how many times a game can kill you without making you quit. Games that didn’t get as much fanfare in 2025, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> are all well worth a look, too.</p>

 <p>If you didn’t catch <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, or <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> when they launched on Xbox, they’re all on sale as well. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> is $20 (half off), <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is $36 (40 percent off), and<em> Indiana Jones</em> is $49 (30 percent off). If you’re looking for some Soulslike action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em></a> is $42 (30 percent off) and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a> is $40 (20 percent off); both of those are very good. Finally, there’s <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a sci-fi horror action-adventure about war and time-loop monsters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam">that’s more than the sum of its parts</a>. At just $36 (40 percent off), it’s currently at its lowest price yet.</p>

              <p>Looking to improve your gaming PC? You may need a new graphics card. The latest and greatest may be a little expensive, but you could always do with a sale-priced upgrade so you can save a bit. We found one that’s heavily discounted now, and you can not only get it for a low price, but it should do your computer some good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/">You can find the SFF-Ready ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition Graphics Card on Amazon right now for $318</a>. In comparison to the original retail price of $470, that’s a discount of $152 and represents about a 32% savings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful GPU that can enhance all your gaming goals</h2>
<p>This ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060Ti is a powerful graphics card that includes all the features you’d need to play the newest games at 144Hz, do photo and video editing at high resolution, and still have room left over to run other (usually demanding) applications.</p>
<p>Based on NVIDIA Ampere Architecture, the 8 GB of GDDR7 memory will allow you to maintain high frame rates at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions with less lag. Even at higher resolutions you should be able to achieve frame rates above 60 FPS. You’ll also see lower power consumption when running with this card.</p>
<p>To support the unique demands of small form factor systems, ASUS has engineered this product to fit within most mini ITX and micro ATX enclosures. While this card does occupy two and a half slots, it’s much smaller than most other graphics cards and leaves ample room to install additional hardware inside your enclosure. It does a great job at balancing both airflow and cooling to maintain stable performance during heavy loads, and uses axial-tech fans and carefully located heat sinks to ensure that this card runs quietly and maintains low operating temperatures.</p>



<p>For the gamer, this graphics card provides a significant upgrade over both integrated and older discrete graphics cards. With this card you’ll get faster load times, smoother frame rates, and better management of modern features like ray tracing when you play supported titles. For creators, the increased memory and processing power of this graphics card will help with tasks such as video editing, 3D modeling, and multitasking, especially when your workloads require more than what a typical GPU can provide.</p>
<p>Overall, with its superior performance, compact size, and highly efficient cooling, the SFF-Ready ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition Graphics Card is an ideal graphics card for upgrading to for many PC builds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/">Given the current sale price of $318, this graphics card is an affordable option to consider if you want to increase your PC performance without spending too much money.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the weekend, I went out to the theater and saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a>. Even as a big <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I walked out disappointed. But I don’t want to talk about that. Instead, I want to highlight a moment I was forced to watch <em>twice</em> due to some snafu at my local AMC. The moment in question involves some children hooking up a tube to a monkey’s face and farting into the other end. Hey Hollywood, what the fuck?</p> <p>We arrived to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> about 15 minutes before the movie started, and to our surprise, my wife and I noticed the trailers were already playing. Strange! We sat down and I caught a new trailer for Sony’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><em>Zootopia</em></a> knock-off, <em>GOAT</em>, which is a basketball movie about talking animals or something. Approximately one minute and 49 seconds into this trailer, I was surprised to see two young rhino girls using a tube and a gas mask to funnel a fart from one of the animals’ asses to the face of a sleeping monkey man.&nbsp; Here’s the moment in question.</p>

  <p>I looked around the theater, which was basically empty as we’d arrived fairly early, and questioned if I’d actually seen what I thought I’d seen. I mean, sure, animated movies for kids are filled with fart jokes, so it hardly seemed impossible that Sony’s <em>GOAT </em>would feature one. But having cartoon animal kids basically recreate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7c_GK40Dsjg">the fart mask stunt from <em>Jackass 2</em></a>&nbsp;as a silly moment caught me off guard. I shook it off and soon was lost in the opening minutes of <em>Fire and Ash</em>, the&nbsp;<em>GOAT&nbsp;</em>trailer a distant memory. Or so I thought.</p>

 <p>About 10 minutes later, someone seemingly complained that the movie had started early, and so the AMC restarted everything, trailers included. Mildly annoying, but it did make me giggle at all the people who had arrived late specifically to avoid trailers then being forced to watch them anyway. It also meant that I’d have a second chance to catch the fart joke. And yup, to my surprise, <em>GOAT</em> does indeed include a recreation of<em> Jackass 2’s</em> fart mask bit, complete with the victim retching and losing it.</p>

 <p>Folks, I’m not a prude. I love the <em>Jackass</em> movies. And I’m not above laughing at a fart joke or someone getting hit in the groin. But it feels like <em>GOAT </em>and the people involved were desperate to one-up all the other fart jokes in kids’ movies these days and, in the process, created something that feels like it crosses a line that I’m not even sure I can properly put my finger on. At the very least, moving forward, I’d like a warning before any trailers that feature kids recreating gross-out pranks from <em>Jackass</em> movies, okay?</p>

              <p>Need to give your home a visual upgrade? A set of colorful lights is a great way to do exactly this. And here’s the good news: you don’t have to spend an arm and a leg to do it. In fact, we’ve found a way to do it without spending too much to kick off 2026, and we’ve brought that idea here to you in the form of a deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6614/">Get the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 with Dual Cameras at Amazon for only $74.98, which saves you $65.02 (or approximately 46%) when compared to the normal retail price of $140.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A simple setup for enhancing your TV with backlights</h2>
<p>Govee’s Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 with dual cameras gives you a new level of immersion when it comes to how you watch TV. The Envisual utilizes dual cameras to capture the colors of your TV screen in real-time, then sends those color captures to LED backlight effects behind your TV.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to add excitement and energy to the shows, movies, and games you watch on TV with exciting lighting effects that change with the content being displayed on screen, the Envisual T2 does exactly that. The best part is that you don’t have to learn a difficult setup just to attach some lighting to your TV. Nothing should be that complicated, and this setup doesn’t follow that convention.</p>



<p>To that end, installing the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 is super quick and easy. The installation package comes with the exact LED strip components that go around the back of your TV and also two smaller cameras that you can install on to your TV frame. But despite seeming intimidating, the setup isn’t all that bad, so you’ll be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can control the lighting for your TV, too. The app allows you to adjust the intensity of the lighting, select various color effects that can be used for different viewing experiences, or choose a specific mode depending upon your viewing preferences. There’s a lot you can change here, and you’re really only limited by your creativity. That’s about it, especially if you’re willing to try a lot of different ideas.</p>
<p>We can’t really say it enough. This special backlight setup is a great way to make your TV feel that much more immersive. It’s a great viewing experience for anyone who wants to take their TV sessions to the next level. And when you factor in how much money you can save right now, that makes it an even better idea to go ahead and grab it right now.</p>

              <p>….And we’re back. Sorry about last year. Our previous owners, G/O Media, were <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584/">a pack of idiots</a> with more money than brains, who decided to stop anyone at <em>Kotaku</em> from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3ldmmw2n25c2x">writing personal top ten lists</a>. Why? Pretty simple, really: <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/07/03/go-media-jim-spanfeller-gawker-influence/">They had no idea what they were doing and nearly destroyed this place</a>. Anyway, they’re all gone now, and I’m still here. So let’s talk about my 10 favorite games of 2025!</p> <p>This 2025 list was an odd one to put together. I started with over 20 games that I played this year that I liked a lot. But whittling this list down to 10 was shockingly easy. Nothing felt like it had to be on here or screamed “Zack’s Favorite Game!” <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769">It was a year in which I played so many good games</a>, but few that stuck with me in the same way <em>Control</em> did in 2019, or<em> Half-Life: Alyx</em> the following year.</p>

 <p>I won’t waste any more time. You can go scroll to the list now and nod in agreement with some picks and shake your head at others.&nbsp; As usual, this list is in no particular order until the very end, where I’ll drop my personal favorite game of the year! (<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-robocop-alan-wake-2-best-games-2023-1851124842/3">And</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezen-s-top-10-games-of-2022-1849916027">here</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2021-1848267109">are</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2020-1845735344">my past</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2019-1840540510">lists</a>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, wait, one more thing: If you scroll <em>all</em> the way to the end, you’ll find my top 10 games of 2024. <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/jim-spanfeller-is-a-herb-rise-fall-blog-post-deadspin.html">Take that, Jimbo</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><em><strong>Battlefield 6</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616054" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616054"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616054">EA / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yeah, I wish EA’s big online FPS had some bigger maps. And, yup, there are still some vehicle balancing issues that need fixing. And, okay, sure, Redsec isn’t great, and the best thing I can say about the single-player campaign is that it’s short. But whatever, none of that has stopped me from investing nearly 150 hours into <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> since it launched in October. This is the kind of chaotic but tactical combat that I love in multiplayer games. The kind of online shooter where you can spend all night driving around in tanks and then the next day grab an SMG and clear rooms with your friends. And then a tank blows up the room you were in, and the building collapses, and you scramble outside into a nearby jeep and escape, only to be sniped by a bastard on the other side of the map. It’s <em>Battlefield</em>, baby, and I love it.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Routine</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649265"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649265">©&nbsp;Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p>When I wrapped <a href="https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242"><em>Routine</em>, a creepy photorealistic sci-fi horror game</a>, I liked it a lot, but I wasn’t convinced it would make my game of the year list. But then it did something not many games can do: It stuck with me. It has an incredibly oppressive and scary atmosphere that evolves in some interesting ways over the course of its runtime, before ramping up the horror to 11. And it does all of this while not being filled with cheap jump scares or bathtubs of blood. The fact that it’s all set it in mundane but incredibly realistic spaces, like kitchens and offices, just makes it all the easier to fully lose yourself in the experience. One scare in particular shook me up so bad that I’ll never forget it.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Avowed</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000004852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000004852"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000004852">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>I will forever be a sucker for big RPGs that let me wander aimlessly and discover new quests. Bethesda’s RPGs have been doing that for decades. <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em></a> smartly condenses the Bethesda formula while replacing some of that lost bloat with well-written companions and interesting hand-crafted sidequests. The end result is an RPG that lacks the simulation elements of <em>Skyrim</em> and the scale of <em>Fallout 4,</em> but features memorable characters and moments that stood out in a year filled with both.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>THPS 3+4</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001310"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001310">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>Few games feel as good as a well-made<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> title. And this year’s remake of <em>THPS 3 </em>and <em>THPS 4</em> is very well-made indeed. This is just a perfect little package of skateboarding shenanigans. Yes, I know people got mad about the open-world quests being removed from <em>THPS 4,</em> but I’ve always preferred the two-minute format for these classic <em>Tony Hawk</em> titles. Leave the big spaces and quests to <em>Underground</em> or <em>Wasteland</em>, y’know? That minor quibble aside, what Iron Galaxy created with <em>THPS 3+4</em> is marvelous. It looks like I remember those old games looking, plays fantastically, and features enough challenges and extra content to keep you grinding and flipping for many late nights. Now, someone convince Activision to remake <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground,</em> please.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Despelote</strong></em></h2> <figure><figcaption>© Panic</figcaption></figure> <p>I don’t care much for soccer. But I loved <em>Despelote</em>, a game that uses soccer as a throughline connecting different moments from a young boy’s life as he grows up in Quito during Ecuador’s qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This is a story about being a kid, dreaming big, getting into trouble, lying to your parents, growing up, and going back to where you once lived, only to find a much different place. You’ll be able to finish this one in a single extended sitting, and by the end, you’ll likely be won over by its storytelling, voice acting, visuals, and heart.</p> <h2><em><strong>Dispatch</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647392"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647392">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of Telltale narrative games (like <em>Wolf Among Us </em>and <em>The Walking Dead</em>) back in the day and enjoyed them, but I wasn’t sure if that formula would work again in 2025. I mean, I’m not sure it really worked back then either, but the writing was strong enough to win most folks over. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, a narrative-driven episodic game about a superhero agency, shows that with some tweaks and upgrades, the Telltale formula can still kick ass. Strong voice acting, a focus on narrative over fluff gameplay, and some truly funny moments help this strange workplace superhero comedy succeed in a way that, I’d argue, most Telltale games didn’t. Now, where’s season 2?</p> <h2><em><strong>Mafia: The Old Country</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655161"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655161">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p>When I sit down to play a game, I don’t always want to invest 400 hours into an RPG or grind away filling up meters or fight random people online. Sometimes, I just want a linear, 10-to-15-hour cinematic experience featuring solid gameplay and gorgeous visuals. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-the-old-country-rare-big-game-you-can-finish-weekend-short-aaa-2k-2000655148"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is that kind of game</a>. The kind of game that we don’t get much of anymore. A big-budget AAA linear action adventure game that lacks crafting, RPG skill trees, or other guff. It’s just the classic mobster story of a dude who goes from nothing to everything, but it all costs him so much. Except this is set in 1904 Italy and ditches Tommy Guns and big cities for rolling fields and horses. The end result is beautiful.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>South of Midnight</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000003790" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003790"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003790">© Compulsion Games</figcaption></figure> <p>If <em>South of Midnight’s</em> combat was better, it might have been able to slide into my top spot because everything else around the action-platformer is just that damn good.<em> South of Midnight</em> is a stop-motion-style adventure through a magical version of the South that deals head-on with topics like racism and slavery. But it also celebrates the unique culture that exists in the deep southern portion of the United States. And what screenshots of this game don’t reveal is that it’s packed with some of the best music of 2025, with songs that made me dance and others that made me cry. If you want to feel something, <a href="https://kotaku.com/south-of-midnight-game-pass-xbox-series-pc-south-review-1851775149">play <em>South of Midnight.</em></a></p> <h2><em><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000700" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000700"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000700">© Universal</figcaption></figure> <p>One night, while playing<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-best-jurassic-park-game-ever-pc-park-sim-baby-dinosaurs-2000639737"><em> Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a>, I spent nearly three hours creating a massive paddock filled with various dinosaurs and a jeep tour. When I realized I had spent that much time on one part of the map, I felt a bit weird. Then I burned another hour while making that paddock look amazing and ensuring the adult and baby dinos inside were happy and healthy. A great game doesn’t have to tell some epic story or be filled with important themes and ideas. A great game can just take what came before it, expand on all of that, and then offer you a newly perfected prehistoric park builder that will suck away weeks of your life if you aren’t careful. This is one of the best simulation games around, and easily the best<em> Jurassic Park</em> game ever made.</p>

 <h2><strong>And my top game of 2025…<em>The </em></strong><em><strong>Outer Worlds 2</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639922"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639922">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>I went back and forth on this a lot. I bet if you ask me in like two months what my top game of 2025 is, I might say something else. Truly, this was a strange year. But, I must admit that the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> (from <em>Avowed</em> studio Obsidian) was my game of the year.</p> <p>As someone who has put an embarrassing number of hours into<em> Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4</em>, I’m always craving an RPG that can provide similar experiences. The original <em>Outer Worlds</em> got close, but <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> finally nails and then improves on the open-ended FPS RPG action found in those past<em> Fallout</em> games. Gone are the stilted conversations from <em>Fallout</em> and the wonky combat and visuals. Instead, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-flaws-system-great-how-it-works-rpg-xbox-obsidian-2000653910"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a> looks marvelous, feels like a joy to play, and still makes sure to include enough quirky moments and silly bits to satisfy any <em>Fallout</em> fan. Obsidian even included an in-game radio with ads and songs just like Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games.</p> <p>I can’t wait to come back to <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> in a few years, after forgetting most of it, and replay it as a new character. And to me, that’s the ultimate proof that a game has done something right.
