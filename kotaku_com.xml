              <p>The next mainline <i>Resident Evil</i> game is months away, and the hype among devoted fans is likely as contagious as a well-designed Umbrella Corp. bio-weapon. <i>Requiem</i> doesn’t just look the part of a dark and violent survival horror game; the developers have made it clear that <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-2-4-horror-scary-grace-2000630216"><i>Requiem </i>really wants to scare you,</a> unlike some previous <i>RE</i> titles that were more action-oriented. And with its return to the iconic series’ location of Raccoon City, <i>Requiem </i>is sure to make <i>RE</i> lore enthusiasts eager to sink their teeth into every new detail it reveals in the series’ larger canon.</p> <p><i>Resident Evil</i> has been with us since 1996. Since then, it’s become one of the most iconic and celebrated survival horror series out there, and deservedly so with its iconic cast of heroes and villains. Though some entries haven’t landed as well with hardcore fans, the series has arguably been riding high since 2017’s <i>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</i>. And it didn’t stop there; a series of successful remakes of games from the series’ glory years in the ‘90s and 2000s have also served as reminders that when <i>Resident Evil</i> is firing on all cylinders, it’s a force to be reckoned with.</p>

 <p><i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>, also known as <i>Resident Evil 9</i>, launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-release-date-re7-2000625335">Switch 2</a>, and Windows PCs on February 27, 2026. Officially announced and shown off <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941">during Summer Game Fest</a>, the game will follow the story of Grace Ashcroft as she revisits the nightmares of her past in her official duties as a technical analyst for the FBI.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-bunch-of-resident-evil-games-are-reportedly-getting-switch-2-ports-2000624442">A Bunch Of <i>Resident Evil</i> Games Are Reportedly Getting Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547">Grace’s past isn’t something she’s keen to relive</a>. Unlike many other <i>RE</i> protagonists, she’s hardly battle-hardened. But she’s certainly had her own experiences with the series’ legendary violent threats, so she’s not a total newbie. Still,<i> Requiem</i> is ambitious for its use of a new protagonist and a return to an iconic city. So, what can we expect when the game arrives in 2026? Let’s go over everything we’ve learned about this highly anticipated sequel.</p>

 <h2><i>Requiem</i> will embrace both first- and third-person</h2> <p><i>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</i> was the first mainline <i>RE</i> game to pivot exclusively to a first-person perspective (though the series had had its share of first-person action in earlier spin-offs). Its follow-up, <i>Village</i>, started off in first-person but eventually introduced a third-person option. <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-requiem-first-third-person-option-ps5-1851784320"><i>Requiem</i> will allow you to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at launch</a>.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-requiem-first-third-person-option-ps5-1851784320"><i>Resident Evil 9</i> Lets You Swap Between First-Person And Third-Person Whenever You Want</a></p> <p><i>Biohazard</i> made a compelling case for <i>RE</i> in first-person (even if it did feel like an answer to <a href="https://kotaku.com/od-hideo-kojima-productions-silent-hill-pt-game-awards-1851089141">Hideo Kojima’s wildly popular <i>Silent Hills</i> demo</a> that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nobody-actually-knows-how-they-solved-the-silent-hill-t-1621044581">had everyone terrified at the time</a>), so it feels appropriate for the series to carry on with it. But after three remakes (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>4</i>), it’s clear that surviving <i>RE</i>’s environments in third-person is also a treat. How then, could we possibly choose between them?</p>

 <p>The gameplay sounds promising. Thanks to a playable demo available during Gamescom earlier this year, some folks got a taste of the action. It seems clear that first-person amplifies the fear, but third-person will still be a spooky good time.</p>

  <p>The demo featured a flashback scene in which Grace is without a gun to wield and the experience to wield it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview"><i>IGN</i>’s Matt Kim</a> described a chase sequence in which Grace has nothing but empty bottles to throw at one of <i>RE</i>’s most terrifying creatures yet.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849"><i>Kotaku</i>’s Kenneth Shepard described his time</a> with the demo as featuring more “hide-and-seek horror” than the likes of the series’ eighth entry, <i>Resident Evil Village</i>. “It felt like the game had been stripped down to its core elements to leave you with a terrifying helplessness.”</p> <h2><i>Requiem</i> is about ‘addictive fear’</h2> <p>In a special <a href="https://youtu.be/-hiC3qpghP0">‘Creators’ Message’ video from Capcom last June</a>, <i>Requiem</i>’s director Koshi Nakanishi described the philosophy behind <i>Requiem</i>, and it’s all about establishing an emotional contour that fans of survival horror know very well:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our core concept for this game was “addictive fear.” There’s something about the catharsis you get from overcoming your fears. It creates an addiction that makes you want to do more, to play more. That intense focus, while scary, makes for a really fun game. This served as our launching point for <i>Requiem</i>.</p></blockquote> <p>While <i>RE</i> has largely course-corrected itself back toward horror starting with <i>Biohazard</i> in 2017, this is still music to the ears of us survival horror fans. Of <i>RE</i>’s large cast of characters, many are exceedingly proficient with firearms and, by now, are well acquainted with surviving hordes of zombies and lumbering giants eager to stalk them. Grace, then, with her comparative lack of experience, enters as a way to allow players’ fears to synergize with the character’s emotional state.</p> <h2><i>Requiem</i> wants to avoid just letting you shoot your way through zombies</h2> <p>Originally, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-decision-to-scrap-leon-kennedy-as-a-playable-character-shows-the-franchise-is-finally-stepping-away-from-hardened-and-stoic-protagonists/">Capcom thought to center series legend Leon Kennedy</a>, the main character of <i>RE4</i> and co-protagonist of <i>RE2</i> and <i>6</i>, in <i>Requiem</i>. But given how experienced (and likely PTSD-ridden) Kennedy is, it didn’t seem to be a good fit. In the “Creator’s Message” video from last summer, Nakanishi said of Leon Kennedy:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Making a horror game based around [Leon] is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s how we got our new girl, Grace, as our protagonist for <i>Requiem</i>. But though we have a fresh face ready to scream in terror, <i>Requiem</i> is hoping to avoid just building up to a shooting spree with every baddie. “Of course, there will be boss battles,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-boss-battles-will-be-more-like-the-originals-and-re2s-but-will-still-include-several-new-combat-options/">Nakashi told <i>Automaton</i></a> in a joint interview at Tokyo Game Show this year. He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>However, rather than defeating enemies in a flashy manner as you progress through the game, like in games that emphasize gun-shooting action, the style is more like <i>Resident Evil </i>and <i>Resident Evil 2</i>, where players expand their exploration area in a closed space and overcome obstacles using their wits.</p></blockquote> <h2><i>Requiem</i> sounds like a perfect excuse to go back and play every <i>Resident Evil</i> game</h2> <p><i>Requiem</i> will arrive just before <i>Resident Evil</i> celebrates its 30th birthday. Director Nakanishi has stated that the title itself is intended “to mark a milestone in the series” with its return to Raccoon City, where everything in the game’s fictional universe started. The team sees the game as a “requiem, a eulogy to those who came before.”</p>  <p>So if there was ever a <i>Resident Evil</i> game to make you go back and play through the series to prepare, it sounds like <i>Requiem</i>, arriving just before the series’ third decade, is the game to do that with.</p>

 <h2>Hey, what about those rumors you’re seeing on the internet?</h2> <p>If you have a working internet connection and the ability to type <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i> into a search bar, you’ve likely seen alleged leaks and speculation about the game. Video games are fertile ground for wild theories and some folks have gone a little overboard with such things.&nbsp; <i>Requiem</i>’s producer, Masata Kumazawa, is well aware of this.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-reveals-who-mysterious-hooded-character-is/">In an interview with <i>The Gamer</i></a>, Kumazawa said the following:</p> <blockquote><p>I would like everyone to remember, let’s calm down a bit–what we’ve shown you so far is everything we can say. People get frustrated with us, because even though we didn’t promise things, the rumors and theories were such that they were widely believed.</p></blockquote> <p>So yeah, the game ain’t that far away. Let’s relax with the speculation.</p> <hr> <p>Speaking for myself, I don’t think I’ve been this excited about a <i>Resident Evil</i> game since <i>RE4</i>. Hopefully the game lives up to that excitement when it arrives in February of 2026. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a few missing entries in the <i>Resident Evil</i> catalog to catch up on.</p>

              <p>Current Game Pass Ultimate subscribers <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">are getting hit with the new 50-percent price hike</a> on November 4, but only in some countries. Microsoft recently confirmed that fans in places like Poland and Korea can remain at the lower monthly price if they stay subscribed. Not so for Xbox users in the U.S.</p> <p>The confusion started when some fans started sharing the emails they’d received from Microsoft about Game Pass Ultimate going from $20 a month to $30. While some of those messages informed players about a price hike they’d see next time they renewed their subscription, others were told the pricing wouldn’t change unless they ended their subscriptions and later resumed them. Microsoft has now confirmed that the delay is only for users in some markets like Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India. Players in the U.S. and UK will see the changes take affect as planned on November 4.</p>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is that one real. I got one saying tough it’s going up. <a href="https://t.co/EHbqiWvCr8">pic.twitter.com/EHbqiWvCr8</a></p> <p>— I play games (@G_Obertron) <a href="https://twitter.com/G_Obertron/status/1975558838607839518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <div> <p>“Our recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We’ll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries,” Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in a new statement.</p> <p>Why the discrepancy? Some have been speculating it has to do with local laws restricting how companies can hike subscription prices and the amount of heads-up they have to give consumers. Either way, it’s a bummer for any Xbox fan in the U.S. who thought they might be getting an unexpected reprieve from the latest Xbox price hikes. Microsoft also recently confirmed that Game Pass subscribers are <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">no longer eligible for 10 percent off of DLC</a> and other add-on content.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The year is 2025. An entertainment industrial complex once riding high on a new generation of bankable stars and fresh IP now faces increasing decline and desperation as it strip-mines what remains of its old energy reserves. Enter <em>Tron: Ares</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tron-3-ad-features-mr-beast-tron-ares-disney-2000623530">a fall blockbuster that seems to exist entirely</a> to breathe new life into an old franchise and that accidentally commits the company’s latest act of stomach-turning necromancy instead. The first wave of reviews is in, and it does not paint a very flattering picture of Jared Leto’s latest vessel for renewed relevance.</p> <p><em>Tron: Ares</em> (2025) is a sequel to <em>Tron: Legacy</em> (2010) which was a follow-up to the original<em> Tron</em> (1982). It features Leto as the titular Ares, an advanced program sent by a defense contractor into the real world to attack a gaming company in a race to perfect a technology that can make digital objects exist in real life. Leto is essentially a <a href="https://x.com/thelegacyofnerd/status/1975228908862894321?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"><em>Fortnite</em> skin come to life</a>&nbsp;fighting in a live-service turf war between competing metaverses, except eventually he joins the side of the good guys, including Jeff Bridges and his son. Gillian Anderson is also in this one.</p>

 <p>Forces within Hollywood have been trying to make this movie for a while. Leto was reportedly central <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tron-ares-set-visit-jared-leto-greta-lee-lightcycle-2000652340">to finally making it happen</a>. It was directed by Joachim Rønning, best known for the seminal 2019 fairy tale reimagining<em> Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</em>. The results with <em>Tron: Ares</em>, out October 10, probably could have been a lot worse, but by all accounts, they still aren’t great.</p>

 <p>“There is no drama or jeopardy or human interest anywhere,” writes Peter Bradshaw for<em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/07/tron-ares-review-gillian-anderson-sci-fi-jeff-bridges-jared-leto">The Guardian</a></em>. “This franchise now looks about as urgently contemporary as an in-car CD player.” Alison Willmore was not much more impressed at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-tron-ares-doesnt-realize-its-depressing.html"><em>Vulture</em></a>. “Rønning does get his own kick-ass score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, all ominous throbbing, but can’t come up with anything visually distinctive,” she wrote.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review"><em>IGN</em></a> considered the movie mid overall but adored the soundtrack. “<em>Tron: Ares</em> is getting a 5. And honestly, I bumped it up from a 4 just because of Nine Inch Nails,” wrote <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review">Clint </a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review">Gage</a>. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/tron-ares-review/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a> gave the movie 2.5 stars out of five, dinging it in part for Leto’s performance, with Emily Garbutt calling him “thoroughly unconvincing as AI-with-a-heart Ares.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-jeff-bridges/"><em>Polygon</em></a> was let down by what critic Samantha Nelson saw as the paint-by-numbers storytelling, though she found the overall vibes more entertaining. “The Daft Punk soundtrack was the best part of <em>Tron: Legacy</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and the Nine Inch Nails album written for&nbsp;<em>Tron: Ares&nbsp;</em>similarly elevates even lackluster scenes,” writes Nelson. “There are haunting sequences that evoke Vangelis’ <em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>score and more propulsive tracks that perfectly complement the fast-paced action.”</p>

 <p>And not everyone found Leto so ill-suited to the role, though whether or not that’s a good thing is up for debate. “Leto’s performance works because he’s so utterly believable as a soulless ghoul that it’s easy to buy into the happy-to-be-here warmth of his emergent humanity,” writes David Ehrlich for <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/tron-ares-movie-review-1235154526/"><em>IndieWire</em></a>. “Sure, the movie’s idea of “emergent humanity” is limited to Ares’ deep appreciation for Depeche Mode (who the security program rightly appraises as being superior to Mozart), but these days that’s more humanity than a lot of people could ever hope to muster.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/tron-ares-review-1236542140/"><em>Variety</em></a>‘s Peter Debruge ultimately blames former Disney studio exec Sean Bailey for the ambitious misfire. “As president of production at Disney, Bailey effectively pillaged the company’s back catalog (he was responsible for so many of those live-action remakes, franchise reboots and theme park adaptations),” he writes. “While it was exciting to see what <em>Tron</em> might look like in the 21st century, the brand gets in the way of Ares’ internal evolution…there’s a sense that <em>Tron: Ares</em> has too much nostalgia to service, from the cobwebby re-creation of Flynn’s arcade-basement office to Bridges’ extended cameo (as a drawling, laid-back Dude who sounds less like Flynn than his <em>Big Lebowski</em> character).”</p> <p>A parody news post claiming Leto <a href="https://twitter.com/DiscussingFish/status/1975205738416128324">had sex with AI</a> to prepare for the movie spread on social media yesterday. It was false, obviously, but maybe <em>Tron: Ares</em> would have turned out more interesting if he actually had.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everyone deserves a pair of headphones that are comfortable to wear and sound great that doesn’t cost a ton of cash. Well you can have it all with the Sony WH-CH520 wireless Bluetooth on-ear headphones. They come in a wide array of fun colors and are dirt cheap, right now at least. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">Normally going for $70, it’s down more than 46% to just $38. You’ll save a whole $32.</a></p>
<p>I’ve really got to applaud Sony on the brand’s naming scheme choices. You take a look at Apple and its flagship over-hear headphones are given a flashy name like the AirPods Max. Samsung’s line of earbuds are predictably the Galaxy Bus. But Sony? Nah. These are The WH-CH520. No sauce, just the meat — but it’s good meat.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Pick between six stylish colors. The Sony WH-CH520 come in your classic black and white, but also in fun varieties like blue, yellow, pink, and cappuccino.</p>
<p>The headphones are super lightweight and the synthetic materials around the earcups are soft. You can comfortably wear them all day without taking them off. The band includes a plush head cushion. Some real bad pairs of headphones will create that awkward pressure right at the top of your head where it makes contact. That’s not a problem here.</p>



<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>And you really can wear them all day long with the super long battery life. One chare will last your an impressive 50 hours. Charging is fast too. If you find you’ve forgotten to plug them in before a big trip and you’re rushing out the door, no sweat. A miniscule three minute charge will bring them back up to a whole 90 minutes of listening time. You can plug them in while brushing your teeth and then be good to go.</p>
<p>Take hands-free calls when wearing the Sony WH-CH520 headphones. Your phone can stay in your pocket the next time it buzzes as you accept the call. Built-in microphones are able to isolate your voice from any distracting background noise so this way folks on the other end hear you and only you.</p>
<p>Multi-point Bluetooth allows you to connect the headphones to two different devices simultaneously. Pair them with both your phone and laptop. This way you can be listening to Spotify off the computer while you’re working or maybe be watching a YouTube video with lunch, then when someone calls you one your phone, you can seamlessly switch over and have the call come through the headphones. You can even play a podcast or music off your phone while also paired with your gaming console to make the grind more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">For a limited time, grab these Sony WH-CH520 Bluetooth Headphones for the reduced price of $38.</a></p>

<h2>Recreate Marvel’s Most Iconic Moments</h2>
<p>Lego recreated that one slow-mo shot used in all the trailers. It’s the one in the opening scene from the movie as the Avengers are storming Hydra’s snow base and they all momentarily are all leaping through the air while busting through trucks and trees and whatnot. The first Avengers film had that tracking shot in the middle of Manhattan, circling around the heroes. Avengers: Age of Ultron had this.</p>
<p>The 613-piece Lego sets features favorite Avengers minifigures including the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner. I mean Hawkeye. Designed for kids 10-years-old and up, this Lego Marvel set has some interactive elements. Simulate the Hulk’s explosive power and strength with the bunker that launches into the air. A push-along road vehicle is included. The set includes a variety of transparent stands so each of the Avengers can be suspended in air in the middle of the action, making it all feel dramatic and dynamic.</p>



<p>The whole set is reconfigurable to your liking. You can built it to spec, making the frame of the 2015 film to a T or, I don’t know, stick Iron Man and Captain America in the humvee to act out Tony teaching Cap how to drive before his road test. Buy a Batman minifigure and pretend he is in the Avengers, teaching Cap how to drive before his road test. That’s the magic of Lego.</p>
