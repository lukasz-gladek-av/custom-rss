              <p>Samsung’s 83-inch S85F TV proves that OLED screens have finally gotten big enough to turn your living room into a real home theater. This 2025 model packs 20 neural networks that upscale everything to stunning 4K clarity and the OLED panel delivers deep blacks and vivid colors that LCD technology can’t match. The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/">just slashed the price to $2,497 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the original $4,297 sticker</a>, which marks <strong>an all-time low for an 83-inch OLED with this level of AI processing power</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI Processing Works While You Watch</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen2 processor has 20 specialized neural networks</strong> that each work on a different part of image quality, such as sharpness, color accuracy, motion handling, and brightness optimization. These networks look at each frame in real time and find objects, faces, and scenes so they can make specific improvements instead of blanket processing that can make some content look too sharp or too bright.</p>
<p>When you stream a show that was made in 1080p or lower,<strong> the AI upscaling doesn’t just stretch the picture to fit the 4K panel</strong> but it also fills in missing details by guessing what should be there based on patterns it sees. This means that older movies and TV shows become clearer and more defined, so they can be watched on an 83-inch screen without looking pixelated or soft around the edges.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Vision AI goes even further by <strong>automatically changing settings based on the type of content you’re watching</strong>: Sports get better motion smoothing to keep fast camera pans clear, while movies get a different kind of treatment that keeps the cinematic feel with the right color grading and motion handling. You never have to go into settings menus or change picture modes by hand because the processor makes these changes automatically as scenes change in the same piece of content.</p>



<p>The<strong> OLED HDR feature makes contrast that LCD panels can’t match</strong> because each pixel makes its own light instead of using a backlight that bleeds into dark areas. When a scene goes from a bright outdoor shot to a dark interior shot, you can see true blacks in the shadows and highlights that stay bright without washing out the whole frame. This self-emissive technology lets you sit at wider angles without changing the color or lowering the contrast.</p>
<p>When you watch nature documentaries, cooking shows, or anything else where accurate color reproduction changes how you see the picture, Pantone validation makes sure that the colors match real-world references. Instead of looking too pink or orange like some TVs that value bright colors over accuracy, skin tones look natural in different lighting and ethnic groups. This validation process checks the display output against Pantone’s color standards.</p>



<p><em>Object Tracking Sound Lite</em> makes <strong>sounds that move across the screen to match where the action is happening</strong> in the frame: This makes the game feel more real, even if you’re using the built-in speakers instead of a surround sound system. The sound moves with the car as it drives from left to right instead of staying in the center channel and it helps your brain naturally connect visual and audio cues. <strong>Alexa integration lets you control the TV</strong>, look for content, and manage smart home devices without having to get up from your chair.</p>
<p>Right now, you can save $1,800 off the regular price of $2,497, and you get the <strong>newest model from 2025 with better AI processing</strong> that older models don’t have. This Cyber Monday deal is great for anyone who wants to improve their home theater and the huge screen, self-lit OLED pixels, and neural network upscaling work&nbsp; make streaming services, gaming, and regular TV watching feel like high-quality entertainment that is worth the money.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/galaxy-buds-3-pro-go-for-new-all-time-low-samsung-wants-to-sell-10x-more-than-airpods-this-cyber-monday-2000648805</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s goal with their AI-powered earbuds was to make them understand how you listen instead of making you change how you listen – and they did this before Apple even announced that the AirPods Pro 3 would have similar features. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro has adaptive intelligence</strong> that automatically changes based on your surroundings and makes them smarter than anything else you have in your ears right now.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">lowered the price of these silver earbuds from $249 to just $159 for Cyber Monday weekend</a>. This is the lowest price ever for Samsung’s best wireless earbuds. Since Apple’s latest model doesn’t beat these on any important spec, this deal is even better for anyone who wants high-quality sound without the high price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI That Hears What You Say</h2>
<p>Samsung made these earbuds with Galaxy AI technology which does the hard work for you so you don’t have to think about it. The adaptive active noise cancellation <strong>always keeps an eye on your surroundings and changes itself on the fly</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with settings when you go from a quiet office to a busy street. This means that when the earbuds sense that the environment is louder, they automatically turn up the noise cancellation. And when you need to hear conversations or announcements around you, they turn it down.</p>
<p>The adaptive equalizer goes even further by looking at how the buds fit in your ear and changing the sound profile to fit: Everyone’s ears are different, so the same earbuds can sound very different to different people.</p>



<p>The new fit fixes one of the biggest problems people had with older Galaxy Buds models: they were uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Samsung changed the design of these Buds 3 Pro to a canal style and the stems are shaped like blades which helps with <strong>stability and keeps the weight evenly distributed</strong>. When you use the stems, they light up with a soft glow. This looks cool and also makes them easier to find when you put them down in low light.</p>
<p>The Real-Time Interpreter feature turns these earbuds into a t<strong>ravel buddy that helps you talk to people in person</strong> who don’t speak the same language. When you turn on this feature, the person speaking Spanish hears their language through the phone speaker, and you hear the English translation directly in your ears. This makes the conversation flow smoothly without both people having to huddle around a screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>sound quality is good because there are two amplifiers and planar tweeters</strong> that handle high frequencies well and keep distortion low even when the volume is high. The dedicated high and low frequency channels keep bass and treble processing separate. This keeps tracks with a lot of instruments in different frequency ranges from getting muddy. You can hear this separation best in orchestral music or thick electronic music, where cheaper earbuds tend to make everything sound like a wall of sound.</p>
<p>At $159, you’re getting Samsung’s best earbuds for $90 less than their normal price: This puts them in the same price range as mid-range options that don’t have any AI features. The <strong>two-year Amazon-only warranty</strong> gives you twice the coverage you would normally get.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-crash-to-all-time-low-year-round-lighting-cheaper-than-budget-holiday-lights-2000648801</link>

              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting systems get rid of the yearly hassle of putting up and taking down disposable holiday lights every winter, then storing the tangled strands that always stop working the next year. Govee’s permanent outdoor lights “Pro” stay up all year on your roofline or eaves and you can change the color scheme for holidays, seasons, or everyday accent lighting with just a few taps in an app.</p>
<p>Installation is surprisingly easy because the clips have adhesive backs that attach each light in about eight seconds: This gets rid of the ladder gymnastics and frustration that make hanging lights the most hated chore. Normally, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">200-foot kit with 120 RGBIC LED lights costs $759 but Amazon is currently offering it for just $459, which is the lowest price ever</a>. This deal started on Black Friday and will last through Cyber Monday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Gives You Real Color Flexibility</h2>
<p>The RGBWWIC label means that <strong>each bulb has six separate LED chips: red, green, blue, warm white, cool white</strong>&nbsp;and an integrated circuit control that lets you control each light separately. This wider range of colors goes beyond basic RGB systems that have trouble getting whites right. It gives you bright, saturated colors for parties and holidays, as well as natural warm and cool whites that are good for everyday outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>warm white mode at 2700K makes the room feel cozy</strong>, like old-fashioned Edison bulbs. The <strong>cool white mode at 6500K</strong>, on the other hand, gives off bright light that is great for security or task lighting around doorways and walkways.<strong> Each light can give off up to 50 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is bright enough to light up the outside of your home instead of just adding decorative touches that get lost in street lighting.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design makes the light into a triangular beam pattern that cuts down on harsh glare while still letting people on the street and in nearby homes see it. This optical engineering stops the raw LED bulbs from blinding people when they look directly at them, making the display more pleasant for you and anyone who walks by your house. The<strong> 75 pre-programmed scene modes</strong> have animated effects like color waves, twinkling patterns, and gradient transitions that move across the whole 200-foot run.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app lets you control each LED individually so you can change the colors of different parts of your roofline to make patterns, text, or images on the outside of your home. You could show off the colors of your favorite sports team, write messages for special occasions, or make patterns of the American flag for patriotic holidays without having to buy different light strings.</p>
<p>The <strong>lights and power adapter both have an IP67 waterproof rating</strong>&nbsp;which means that they can be submerged in water up to 1 meter deep without being damaged. This makes them very safe from rain, snow, and sprinkler overspray. The <strong>IP65</strong> control box doesn’t protect as well but it can still handle heavy rain and dust without any problems. <strong>Govee says these lights will last for 50,000 hours</strong> which is more than 5 years of continuous use or decades of normal seasonal use.</p>



<p>To install, use the included VHB (Very High Bond) adhesive and clips to attach the lights 2 to 4 inches away from the wall or soffit. Each clip snaps onto the light housing and sticks to the outside of your house. This keeps the bulb at the right angle and distance for the best light distribution. The system comes in 16.4-foot sections that connect with waterproof joints. This lets you go around corners, over different rooflines, or skip parts where things like chimneys get in the way.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday price of $459 instead of $759 makes permanent outdoor lighting cost less than many homeowners spend on disposable lights over just a few years, while delivering capabilities that temporary strands can’t approach.</p>

              <p>The PS5 Slim, both the Digital and Standard editions, sold out completely during Black Friday sales. But the good news is that Amazon just cut the price of the PS5 Pro for Cyber Monday weekend and gives shoppers a rare chance to get Sony’s very best console at a record low price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This PlayStation 5 Pro usually costs $749, but the current deal brings the price down to $648</a>, a record low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True 4K Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>GPU in the PS5 Pro has 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory than the base PS5</strong> and gives it the power to run demanding games at full 4K resolution without using upscaling tricks. You won’t have to choose between frame rate and resolution anymore when you play games that are optimized for the Pro because the Pro can handle both at the same time.</p>
<p>PS5 Pro enhancement patches for games like Spider-Man 2, Horizon Forbidden West, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <strong>unlock higher resolutions, better textures, and smoother performance that the base PS5 hardware</strong> can’t keep up with. You will immediately notice the difference in image clarity when there is a lot of movement or in detailed open-world environments where the standard PS5 drops resolution to keep performance up.</p>
<p>PlayStation <em>Spectral Super Resolution</em> is a custom <strong>AI-driven upscaling technology</strong> that looks at game images at the pixel level and reconstructs detail that is close to native 4K quality from lower resolution inputs. This machine learning method works differently from simple checkerboard rendering because it looks at how each pixel should look based on trained models instead of just filling in the gaps between existing pixels. <strong>PSSR lets games render at 1440p or 1800p internally and then upscale to 4K with very little loss of quality</strong>.</p>



<p>Dedicated hardware acceleration <strong>speeds up ray tracing calculations by up to three time</strong>s compared to the base console and makes ray tracing much better. Ray-traced reflections, shadows and global illumination effects that used to slow down frame rates on standard PS5 now run at playable speeds. This makes these visual improvements useful instead of just tech demos that you admire for a short time before turning them off.</p>
<p>The <strong>2TB internal SSD doubles the storage space of the first PS5 models</strong> which is good because modern games often take up more than 100GB with all their updates and DLC. With this extra storage, you can keep a dozen AAA games ready to play without having to delete and redownload them all the time based on what you want to play that night.</p>



<p>The <strong>console doesn’t come with a disc drive</strong> so you’ll have to buy games and movies digitally unless you spend $79 on Sony’s optional external drive. This choice keeps costs down, but it also means that there are no used game markets, no sharing games with friends, and no watching 4K Blu-rays without buying more.</p>
<p>The <strong>included DualSense controller has the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong> that made the PS5’s tactile experience stand out. These features set PlayStation apart from its competitors. The console has Wi-Fi 7, which makes downloads faster and streaming more stable. It also has USB-C ports on the front for easy charging of accessories.</p>
<p>The Pro costs only $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition when both are at full price, which is a very small premium for double the storage and much better performance. You’re getting hardware that will last for years and play the best settings on upcoming games, ray tracing features that make gameplay better instead of just screenshots, and instant upgrades to your current game library.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-zero-profit-on-beats-solo-4-50-hour-wireless-headphones-at-cyber-monday-low-2000648763</link>
            <guid>1368232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the premium headphone market, big names like Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats compete with each other by offering different features and prices to different types of listeners. The <strong>Beats Solo 4 is the perfect choice if you want great sound quality, spatial head tracking, and modern connectivity features</strong> without having to pay extra for active noise cancellation.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday weekend, Amazon has the lowest price ever on this model which competes directly with models that cost a lot more: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The regular price is $199, but it’s now only $129</a>. Instead of cramming in every possible tech feature, they focused on battery life, comfort, and sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long battery life and compatibility with all devices</h2>
<p>Beats designed the <strong>Solo 4 to last up to 50 hours on a single charge</strong> which changes the way you use wireless headphones all week long. You can fly across the country several times, go to work every day for two weeks or binge-watch entire TV shows without having to look for a charging cable. The USB-C charging port has fast fuel technology that lets you <strong>play for 5 hours on a 10-minute charge</strong> when you’re running late. The <strong>Solo 4 connects to both iOS and Android devices</strong> via Bluetooth so you don’t have to worry about being stuck in one ecosystem if you switch between platforms for work and play.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm drivers in each ear cup make Beats’ “custom acoustic platform,”</strong> which adjusts the frequency response to give you strong bass without drowning out vocals and instruments in the mid and high ranges. You will be able to hear the thump of kick drums and bass lines clearly while still being able to understand every word in podcasts or other content with a lot of dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make listening more immersive by tying sound to your device instead of your head movements. When you turn your head while watching a movie, the sound stays in the same place on the screen, just like it does in a real theater. This feature turns on automatically when you play content that works with it on Apple devices and some Android phones.</p>
<p>To fix the comfort issues that plagued earlier Solo models during long wear sessions, Beats changed the headband and ear cushions: The very light construction spreads pressure more evenly over your head, and the soft foam cushions make a tight seal without the vice-grip feeling that gives you headaches after an hour. The on-ear design folds flat into a small shape that fits easily into backpacks or carry-on bags.</p>



<p>The matte black finish doesn’t show fingerprints and scratches as easily as glossy finishes, which show every smudge within hours of opening the box. <strong>Beats comes with a 3.5mm audio cable</strong> so you can connect to older devices that don’t have Bluetooth or keep listening when the battery dies after a long time of use.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal brings the price of the Solo 4 down from $199 to $129 and puts it in direct competition with budget models that give up battery life, build quality, or platform compatibility. You’re getting a high-end Beats product for less than what many mid-range brands charge, plus the brand recognition and customer service that come with owning an Apple product.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-beam-with-dolby-atmos-hits-record-low-on-amazon-black-soundbar-for-cyber-monday-at-zero-margin-2000648759</link>
            <guid>1368214</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos is known for making high-quality audio products and the Beam (Gen 2) shows why <strong>the company is still the best in the soundbar business</strong>. TVs these days are getting thinner and more stylish but that slim design comes with a trade-off: the built-in speakers don’t have enough room to make good sound. This makes a frustrating gap between beautiful 4K visuals and disappointing audio that ruins movies, shows, and music.</p>
<p>The Sonos Beam fixes this by turning your living room into a mini theater with Dolby Atmos support and smart home integration. For Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">you can get it for $349, which is $150 less than its normal price of $499</a>. This is the lowest price ever and makes premium sound more affordable than ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Quality Sound Technology in a Small Package</h2>
<p>The Beam has great hardware in a surprisingly small frame that won’t take over your entertainment center. The <strong>speaker array has one center tweeter, four full-range woofers, and three passive radiators</strong> that work together to make 200 watts of total output power. Five Class-D digital amplifiers power the array. With this setup, the soundbar can handle frequencies as low as 50.4 Hz and gives it deep bass without needing a separate subwoofer for most people. <strong>Dolby Atmos</strong> processing is what really makes the magic happen: It makes virtual height channels that bounce sound off your ceiling to make it sound like it’s coming from above.</p>



<p>The Beam from Sonos is more than just a TV and movie player: When your screen is off, <strong>the soundbar becomes a high-tech music streaming device</strong> that connects to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and many other services through built-in Wi-Fi. The <em>Trueplay</em> tuning technology uses the microphone on your iPhone to figure out how sound travels in your room and automatically changes the sound profile to make up for furniture, wall materials, and the shape of the room.</p>
<p>You can use the Sonos app, your current TV remote through HDMI-ARC, Apple AirPlay 2 for iOS users, or voice commands through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant to control everything. It only takes a few minutes to set up because you only need two cables: one HDMI cable to connect to your TV and one power cord. This means you won’t have to deal with the mess of wires that come with most surround sound systems.</p>



<p>Sonos is better than its competitors because you can add more devices to it while their ecosystems are closed and don’t allow for many upgrades. You can start with just the Beam and then add a Sonos Sub for deeper bass or pair two Sonos One speakers as rear channels to get real 5.1 surround sound. You can play music in different rooms or make a whole-home audio system that plays the same content in all of them because every Sonos speaker connects wirelessly to your home network.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal is a great deal for anyone who takes their home entertainment seriously because it’s only $349 instead of the usual $499. Soundbars that work with Dolby Atmos usually cost $600 or more. Cheaper options, on the other hand, may not be as well built, may not support apps, or may not be able to be expanded in the future.</p>

              <p>Digital picture frames fix the problem of printed photos collecting dust in albums that no one ever opens: They turn your favorite memories into a display that changes every day and is seen by everyone. With modern WiFi-enabled frames, family members can send photos from anywhere using a simple app which means that grandparents can get pictures of their grandkids right away without having to know how to use cloud storage or email attachments.</p>
<p>The 10.1-inch frame from <em>Euphro</em> makes everything easier with a touchscreen interface that anyone can use, even if they’ve never owned a smartphone or tablet. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/">Cyber Monday sale brought the price down from the usual $99 to $45</a> which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. That discount makes sense for a frame that has a lot of storage, a clear display, and easy photo sharing, all in a package that anyone can use without any technical knowledge.</p>

<h2>WiFi Sharing That Works and Isn’t Confusing</h2>
<p>The <strong>frame connects to your home’s Wi-Fi network</strong> through a simple setup process that shows you how to do it on the touchscreen. Once it’s connected, anyone you give permission to can send photos through the free <em>Uhale</em> app which is available for both iPhone and Android devices. Family members can easily get to your frame by downloading the app, making an account and asking for access with a unique code and you can then approve their request with just one tap. When you send photos through the app, they show up on the frame right away: This is the magical moment when grandma sees her grandson’s first day of school photos pop up in real time from hundreds of miles away.</p>



<p>The <strong>10.1-inch IPS touchscreen has a resolution of 1280×800</strong> which is enough to show photos clearly without the blurry, pixelated look that cheaper frames give. IPS technology keeps the colors true and bright even when you look at the screen from the side. Older LCD panels would wash out if you weren’t standing right in front of them. You can pause the slideshow to look at a favorite photo or skip over pictures you’ve seen recently with the touch interface, which responds smoothly to swipes and taps. Depending on how you set it up, you can turn the frame from portrait to landscape mode.</p>
<p>The <strong>internal storage can hold up to 32GB, which is enough for about 60,000 photos</strong> at the resolution of a typical smartphone so you’ll run out of wall space before you run out of memory. The <strong>frame can also take microSD cards</strong>&nbsp;but most people never get close to filling up the internal storage, even after years of regular photo uploads. You can send files directly from cameras, phones, or computers without having to worry about compatibility issues because JPEG, PNG, and MP4 files are just a few of the many image and video formats that work without conversion.</p>



<p>You can change how photos look by changing the order they show up in, the speed of the slideshow, and the transition effects between images. If some photos don’t fit the season or mood, you can hide them from the rotation. The frame will remember these settings until you change them. You can set the display order to show the newest photos first, shuffle them randomly, or play them in order of when they were taken.</p>
<p>Cutting the price by $54 makes this frame cheap enough to buy on a whim, and it has features that frames that cost twice as much have a hard time matching.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[JBL Loses All Margin This Black Friday Week, 5.1-Channel Soundbar Crashes to an All-Time Low]]></title>

              <p>You should want the best out of your home entertainment setup. And that doesn’t just mean investing in a good TV for video quality. You’ve got to give audio some love too. Sure, a fancy 85-kinch OLED smart TV is going to look awesome in your living room, and while built-in TV speaker have gotten better over the years, they still don’t hold a candle to a dedicated surround sound system. This JBL soundbar and subwoofer combo offer a great improvement to your home entertainment soundscape without you needing to empty your bank account. And best of all, it’s on sale right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Normally the JBL Bar 500 goes for $650, but for a limited time deal for Black Friday week, you can get it for just $400.</a></p>
<p>This JBL soundbar measures across at exactly 101.7 centimeters. That can comfortably fit atop your media center right in front of your TV. The subwoofer works wirelessly, which means you don’t need to hide cables running from one side of the room to the other. That measures 10 inches high and will be the difference between a bass that booms and a bass that&nbsp;<strong>BOOMS</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With support for both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam surround sound, you can bring theater-like quality sound and feels like it’s coming from all directions in a 3D space, fully immersing your in the audio. And it does so without actually needing any additional surround sound speakers — just the 5.1-channnel&nbsp; system.</p>
<h2>Enhanced Dialogue</h2>
<p>Now one of the main reasons to upgrade to a soundbar over your TV’s built-in speakers is dialogue. TV shows and movies nowadays have a tendency to be mixed with more robust audio setups in mind. This is why when playing off just your TV speakers, you might sometimes find it hard to actually make out what anyone is saying. However, if you go to increase the volume, suddenly the next scene has erratically loud sound effects like explosions, gun fire, or even just background music.</p>



<p>The JBL 500 sound bar gives you the option to enhance dialogue separately from the rest of the audio. PureVoice Dialogue Enhancements algorithmically isolates and amplifies vocal clarity so that you don’t feel forced to always watch with the subtitles turned on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Tons of other smart features are packed into the JBL Bar 500 soundbar and subwoofer.</a> With Wi-Fi support, you can connect to your sound system from other devices on your network. Stream music to them over AirPlay from an iPhone or MacBook. You can even pair the soundbar with an Alexa smart home hub can control the speaker with voice commands.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads Samsung G6 32″ Curved Gaming Monitor, 240Hz 1440p 1ms Beast Now Goes For New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-samsung-g6-32-curved-gaming-monitor-240hz-1440p-1ms-beast-now-goes-for-new-record-low-2000648749</link>

              <p>Gaming monitors set casual players apart from serious competitors and the most important features are the <strong>refresh rate, response time, and panel curvature that brings your peripheral vision into the action</strong>. The 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G65B has a 240Hz refresh rate that updates the screen four times faster than regular monitors, a 1ms response time that gets rid of the ghosting and blur that can get you killed in competitive shooters and the aggressive 1000R curve matches the natural curve of your eye. This Black Friday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6097/">the monitor’s price on Amazon dropped from its usual $799 to $380 (52% off)</a>&nbsp;which is the lowest price ever for a display that has high refresh rates, HDR 600 certification, and QHD resolution all in one package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6097/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>QHD Resolution</h2>
<p>The 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution has 1.7 times as many pixels as a standard 1080p display which means that text is sharper and game environments are more detailed, but it doesn’t require as much GPU power as a 4K monitor. With a good graphics card, you can actually get 240 frames per second at this resolution. In competitive games where the first person to spot an enemy wins the fight, the extra screen space gives you more room for HUD elements, minimap details, and peripheral awareness. QHD also scales perfectly for work between gaming sessions.</p>



<p>DisplayHDR 600 certification means that <strong>the panel can reach a peak brightness of 600 nits</strong>: This makes the contrast between dark shadows and bright highlights real, unlike cheaper monitors that make everything look washed out. This level of brightness really helps in games with dramatic lighting and lets you see enemies hiding in dark corners or details in bright outdoor scenes that would normally be washed out on standard displays.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro makes sure that the refresh rate of your monitor matches the frame output of your graphics card: This stops screen tearing and stuttering that can happen when the camera moves quickly. The technology also has low framerate compensation that kicks in when your GPU drops below the monitor’s minimum refresh rate.</p>
<p>The 21:9 aspect ratio makes your field of view wider so you can see more of the game world on the sides than you can on a regular 16:9 monitor. This extra peripheral vision gives you an edge in first-person shooters and battle royale games because you can see enemies coming from the side or look for loot without having to turn your camera all the time.</p>



<p>CoreSync <strong>ambient lighting technology sends colors from the screen to the wall behind the monitor</strong> and brings the atmosphere of your game into your real life. The effect works best in low light, where the subtle color wash makes the experience more immersive without being too distracting. If you want a more traditional setup, you can turn it off completely.</p>
<p>Getting a premium gaming monitor for $419 less than normal is a great deal, especially since it comes with features like a 240Hz refresh rate, HDR 600, and a 1000R curve that makes you feel like you’re in the game.</p>
