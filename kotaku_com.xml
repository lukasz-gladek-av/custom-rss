              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>is one of 2025’s biggest surprise success stories. Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG has gone on to sell more than </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered"><span>3.3 million copies</span></a><span> since its launch in April, and is a frontrunner as we head into Game of the Year talks in December. Naturally, Sandfall Interactive is looking to capitalize on all this by making </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>a full-blown franchise rather than a one-off, as director Guillaume Broche has hinted that it has more stories to tell.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4"><span>MrMattyPlays</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>), Broche says that </span><i><span>Expedition 33 </span></i><span>is “not the end” of the series, and that Sandfall Interactive hopes to release more games under the </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>umbrella. Whether that means direct sequels to </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> or if Sandfall Interactive decides to go </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927"><span>the </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>route</span></a><span> and create an anthology of separate stories remains to be seen.</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> is the franchise name,” Broche says. “</span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> franchise.”</span></p> <p><span>If a sequel is set in the same universe as </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, it’s unlikely that it would take place after the original game. Its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>branching endings</span></a><span> leave that world in two markedly different states, and neither of them screams “sequel bait.” Sandfall Interactive might explore any of the other numbered expeditions in a prequel, but we do know how all of those turned out based on the logs they left behind. There’s also the “outside world” storyline that is briefly touched on in Act 3 but never resolved. I’ll stay vague on that one to avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say there are a lot of possibilities for the future of </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>.</span></p>
