              <p>We now know when <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> is coming out, how much it will cost, and that it’s not coming to Switch 2 at launch, at least if a new report from Dealabs writer billbil-kun is to believed, and they usually are. The apparent leaks raise questions about why the latest <em>Call of Duty</em> is still coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but not Nintendo’s newest hardware which is more capable than both of those platforms.</p> <p>According <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383">to billbil-kun</a>, Microsoft will be revealing the launch info for <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle-2000617873"><em>Black Ops 7</em> at Gamescom next week</a>. That includes European pricing of €80, its standard cost overseas, suggesting it will also remain at $70 in the U.S. despite warnings earlier in the year that Microsoft would be raising the prices of some of its fall releases. The company retreated from that with<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-xbox-80-price-tag-sgf-rpg-mario-kart-1851784014">The Outer Worlds 2</a></em> earlier this summer, and now it appears <em>Black Ops 7</em> won’t be crossing the $80 Rubicon either.</p> <p>The release date for <em>Black Ops 7</em> is apparently November 14, the latest an entry in the annualized multiplayer shooter franchise has ever appeared (this <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1945861417485099010">corroborates a similar leak from July</a>). But billbil-kun writes that none of the release information currently mentions Switch 2, making it seem unlikely the game will arrive on the handheld hybrid this year despite a 10-year agreement between Microsoft and Nintendo to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to the platform.</p>

 <p>While Activision confirmed both sides are still committed to making that happen <a href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">with plans to reveal more information in the future</a>, it seems like <em>Call of Duty</em> is skipping Nintendo’s consoles again for the 12th year in a row, and two years into Microsoft’s completed acquisition of the publisher. One possible reason for the delay is that Nintendo has been just as stingy with sharing Switch 2 dev kits with Microsoft as with anyone else.</p> <p>While Activision executives met with Nintendo to discuss the specs for the Switch 2 in December of 2022, it’s possible the company was among those third-party development partners who missed out on pre-release access to the new hardware to begin porting games over to it. That shortage, potentially fueled by Nintendo’s paranoia about leaks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-console-power-playstation-4-xbox-one-1850850348">has reportedly led to</a> lots of developers playing catch up with the Switch 2’s release. Even the makers of <em>Black Ops 7</em>, it seems.</p>

              <p>Last weekend, Japanese McDonald’s outlets’ attempts to include packs of Pokémon cards in Happy Meals ended not only two days early, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-happy-meal-chaos-2000616843">in the complete chaos of miserable children and gross amounts of wasted food</a>. This weekend, the chain is trying again, but this time with toys instead of cards and far more strict rules in place.</p> <p>Originally intended to run August 9 to 11, the Japanese Happy Meal promotion was the annual event of including packs of&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards, which always causes a lot of excitement, but rarely involves the police. This year, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">amidst the ongoing mass hysteria over the cards</a>, things immediately got wildly out of control. Scalpers rushed in to buy dozens of Happy Meals each, removed the cards to resell them, then dumped the food on the street. Just a few hours in to what should have been a three-day promotion, the entire thing had to be abandoned due to card stocks running out and the chaotic scenes in restaurants. <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">McDonald’s quickly issued an apology</a> and said it was all cancelled.</p> <p>However, the company is trying again. This weekend’s promotion features Pokémon toys rather than cards, but seems no less likely to be the target of scalping assholes. Running from today, August 15 to 17, far stricter purchase restrictions have been put in place—so much so that it’ll suck for any family with four kids. Last weekend, the often ignored rules said no more than five Happy Meals could be bought per person. This time it’s no more than three meals per&nbsp;<em>group</em>. “If you order four or more sets,” <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/">says McDonald’s</a> (via machine translation), “we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order.” The same rules apply to deliveries.</p>

 <p>McD’s appears to recognize that this solution isn’t ideal. The statement says,</p> <blockquote><p>“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers who look forward to dining with their children, grandchildren, or friends due to these purchase restrictions. We will continue to review and improve these sales methods and measures, listening to the opinions of our customers and store staff.”</p></blockquote> <p>The one consolation is that the toys look like shit. Clearly things are so nuts right now that this might not have too big of an impact, but they look like the worst plastic tat, rather than a desirable plushie or similar.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ハッピーセット ポケモン「おうちリレー」篇" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2_xGYjr1W44?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>However, it probably doesn’t help that the promotions are being all mysterious about one of the possible toys (surely Charizard) which will only encourage silliness. In a normal world, that sort of super-low-level gamble is a useful way of drawing people in and encouraging repeat purchases in the hope of getting the secret toy, but in the current situation it seems like more trouble than it’s worth!</p> <p>Good luck to all McDonald’s employees in Japan who almost definitely aren’t paid enough to put up with this.</p>
