            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans spent a lot of time trying to decipher <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-shared-a-4-minute-pixar-like-animated-short-with-no-explanation-2000632524">possible clues hiding in a recent Pixar-like Nintendo short film</a> featuring a baby and, as it turned out later on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendos-mysterious-animated-short-was-a-pikmin-tease-after-all-2000633212">Pikmin</a>. Were they a tease for a new <em>Pikmin</em> game? Rosalina’s origin story in the <em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie? Apparently not. Nintendo now claims this short film experiment was all just for fun. It’s easy to see where it could go in the future, though. Are these the first building blocks of Nintendo’s version of a Disney-style streaming library?</p> <p>“These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.,” the company <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992">posted online this morning</a>. “Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content.”</p> <p>The <em>Pikmin</em> shorts come just a couple months after a series of claymation<em> Mario</em> videos that felt like something out of <em>Sesame Street</em>. While they turned out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-mario-claymation-show-as-part-of-new-kid-themed-my-mario-product-line-push">to be hocking</a> new merchandise for the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> 40th anniversary, it was easy to imagine a whole streaming series based around a similar aesthetic and visual gags. This isn’t even the first time Nintendo has experimented with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANpP2PebOW0">short movies and made <em>Pikmin</em> the stars</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We hope you enjoyed the two “Close to You” videos released on October 7 and 8.<br>The second video is available on Nintendo Today!, a free app available on your smart device.<br>These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>Nintendo Pictures will continue to… <a href="https://t.co/GKizLT0Ckv">pic.twitter.com/GKizLT0Ckv</a></p> <p>— 任天堂株式会社 (@Nintendo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s notable that the second of the two<em> Pikmin</em> short films is only viewable inside the Nintendo Today! app, a strange Switch 2-era digital curio that Nintendo still seems to be figuring out. It’s part of a growing and weirdly aligned set of entertainment touchpoints for the brand. There’s the music app with soundtracks dating back to the NES days, Switch Online’s library of classic games, new theme parks, and box office blockbusters like the upcoming <em>Mario Galaxy</em> and<em> Zelda</em> movies. Also alarm clocks, amiibo, Lego, and a whole adjacent universe of <em>Pokémon,</em> whose streaming app inside Switch <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/64104/~/discontinuation-of-pok%C3%A9mon-tv-on-nintendo-switch">was killed off a year ago</a>.</p>

 <p>I would never expect Nintendo to do something so sane, rational, and predictable as trying to wrap all of this stuff into one coherent super-app, but it is easy to see an opening for more Nintendo content on streaming. The company doesn’t need an entire platform of content to win people over with a few hits. Millions of households sign up for Disney+ <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-plus-price-raising-bluey-season-4-jimmy-kimmel-2000627947">just for <em>Bluey</em></a>. Where is Nintendo’s <em>Bluey</em>? I say that not as some writer cosplaying as an industry analyst, but as a parent with three children who love Mario and have run out of <em>Bluey</em> to watch.</p>

  <p>They still occasionally watch the old <em>Mario</em> cartoons from the ’90s that I grew up with. What else are they going to do when they finish <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and get tired of streaming <em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> for the 50th time? If your answer is “Go back and play<em> Super Mario Bros 3</em>,<em>“</em> than you’ve never watched young kids who weren’t raised on 8-bit graphics try to grapple with the low-stimulation limitations of unforgiving 2D platforming.</p> <p>Nintendo execs have spoken in the past about how the company’s biggest competitors aren’t PlayStation or Xbox but Netflix and the smartphone. It gave up trying to put games on mobile marketplaces dominated by free-to-play casinos, but it’s finally seeing if there’s a place in the ever-expanding universe of short-form video for a <em>Mario</em>-sized respite from all the algorithmic junk. That would be nice! I would take that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">over an Alarmo 2</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-osmo-mobile-gimbal-stabilizer-falls-to-a-price-even-lower-than-prime-day-feels-like-clearance.1320832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You let me know if anything like this has happened to you. You’re trying to record something eventful on your phone. Maybe it’s your kid on their way to scoring their first goal in their peewee soccer league. You decide to run alongside them to keep up with your phone camera capturing this precious moment. But then afterwards, you look to the new video in your camera roll and see that it is an unwatchable mess. The frame is unstable, bouncing around with every step you took. You can’t even tell what is happening in the shot.</p>
<p>That’s why any professional or amateur video aficionado is going to want to keep a gimbal stabilizer in their kit. Even though Prime Big Deals Days has passed, Amazon still has a couple of DJI’s phone stabilizers on sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">The DJI Osmo Mobile 7P which normally goes for $149 has come down to just $120</a>. Likewise the DJI Osmo Mobile 7 has dropped from $89 to just 75.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Now the Osmo Mobile 7 and Osmo Mobile 7P are pretty similar, but the 7P has a couple enhancements over the standard 7. Mainly, the 7P is equipped with a retractable extension rod inside the handle, providing your with more flexibility when using it as either a selfie stick or tripod.</p>
<p>Mounting your phone to the gimbal couldn’t be easier. The DJI Osmo gimbals use a magnetic connection to pair the phone so you can start filming immediately.</p>



<h2>Intelligent Tracking</h2>
<p>Both gimbal stabilizers from DJI can make your filming life so much easier by tracking your subject and eliminating any unwanted camera jitter that comes from shaky hands or you needing to move while shooting. Even if your subject quickly changes direction, the Osmo Mobile 7 or 7P will be able to adjust automatically, keeping them in the spotlight at all times. Even if your subject is momentarily obscured like if they pass behind a tree, the gimbal can maintain continuous tracking ensuring your footage is fluid throughout.</p>
<p>Record or take photos in selfie mode with no one behind the camera. The Osmo 7 and 7P’s handles convert into a tripod base so they can stand upright on their own. You can then use gesture controls to direct the shot from afar. Raising your palm tells the gimbal to start or stop tracking you. Making a “double-L” with your thumbs can be used to adjust framing. Then making a V or peace sign gesture will tell it to take a photo or start or stop video recording.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">The battery will reliably last your for 10 full hours. Then when you’re done recording, the gimbal can be quickly folded back up into a portable form factor.</a></p>
