              <p><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale might not have paid off all the various story threads this season set up, but it did tease a location rarely seen in the games and featured the reveal of something big returning from <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>. Spoilers below for the season in general and the finale episode in particular. If you haven’t watched it yet and don’t want to be spoiled, don’t keep scrolling!</p>  <p>After two seasons of following the Ghoul as he searched for his family, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finale-margot-enclave-cooper-janey-2000665411"><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale</a> finally brings him face to face with…their empty cryopods hidden deep in a secret Vault below Mr. House’s Lucky 38 Casino. Dang. But inside his wife’s tube is a postcard for Colorado, giving him hope that his family is still alive in the midwestern state.</p>

 <p>So off he goes on a new quest to hopefully find his wife and daughter after a heck of a 200 years. During the credits, a billboard reinforces the idea that next season will, at least partially, be set in Colorado. What do we know about Colorado in the <em>Fallout</em> universe, and what can we expect?</p> <h2>Colorado In The <em>Fallout</em> Universe</h2> <p>Colorado is a state that has been mentioned a few times in past games and <em>Fallout</em> media, but has rarely played a big role. It, like most of the rest of the United States in <em>Fallout</em>, was mostly wiped out by the nuclear bombs dropped during the Great War. Colorado’s biggest appearance in the games thus far happened in<em> Fallout Tactics</em>, a game that isn’t wholly canon, but parts of it might be (it’s weird). In that 2001 tactical turn-based RPG spin-off, we are introduced to Vault 0.</p>

 <p><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_0">Vault 0</a> is set in an expanded version of the real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain_Complex#Video_games">Cheyenne Mountain Complex</a>, a large underground U.S. military bunker designed to survive nuclear war and other massive attacks. Exactly what happens in <em>Fallout Tactics</em> isn’t really important, but Vault 0 and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex could play a part in season three. We know the Enclave is still around, and it would make sense for them to hole up in something like that to hide away from the rest of the wasteland.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, as pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/fallout-season-3-location/">PC Gamer</a>,</em> in the lead-up to <em>Fallout</em> season one, Amazon posted an hour-long video about the opening of Vault 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/o1YhcviJ7IU?t=761">And during the stream, an announcer says this</a>: “Unless you’re the President of the United States or something like that, and you have a mountain in Colorado to go under and direct the events of the world.” And who did Cooper Howard run into in this season and hand off the Cold Fusion capsule to? The president. I suspect Vault 0 or a version of it will play a role in season three.</p> <p>One other interesting thing to note about Colorado is that the original version of <em>Fallout 3</em> that was being developed by Black Isle Studios before it was canceled was going to be partially set in Colorado. Fitting that Colorado will likely play a big role in season three of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> show, given that it was previously featured in both the third <em>Fallout</em> game ever made (<em>Tactics</em>) and the original <em>Fallout 3</em> (Project Van Buren).</p>

 <h2>That Other Big (Wink) Tease</h2> <p>After all the credits, Amazon included a post-credits teaser scene featuring Elder Cleric Quintus and Dane back at the Brotherhood’s Area 51 base we saw earlier in the season. Chaos is continuing there after Maximus took off with the Cold Fusion capsule. Anyway, Dane brings Quintus a scroll. He tells the scribe that Quintus the Unifier is no more. Instead, he is now Quintus the Destroyer and unrolls the scroll to reveal a blueprint for Liberty Prime.</p> <p>We technically saw what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1qcvxny/surprised_no_one_is_mentioning_this/">appears to be Liberty Prime earlier this season</a> in a photo featuring Mr. House’s body double. But this is the giant democracy-defending robot’s first real appearance in the show. Or, well, he appears as a blueprint schematic. Close enough.</p> <p>This seems to be a new version of the big robot, named Liberty Prime Alpha, and is different from the mech that first appeared in <em>Fallout 3</em> and later in <em>Fallout 4</em>. I’m not yet convinced this ragtag chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel is going to be able to create its own Liberty Prime. Perhaps it’s buried away in Area 51? We’ll have to wait until season three to find out.</p>
