              <p>Dyson built its reputation on mastering airflow in vacuum cleaners so jumping into hair dryers might seem like an odd pivot until you realize it’s the exact same engineering challenge. The Supersonic Origin applies that airflow expertise to drying hair faster and with less heat damage than traditional dryers that basically just blast hot air at your head.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">has dropped this powerful tool to $299, down from its usual $419 price</a>, which marks an all-time low for a device that rarely sees discounts. If you’ve been frustrated with frizzy results or spending 20 minutes blow-drying your hair, this deal makes switching to professional-grade technology affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the Supersonic Different From Your Average Dryer</h2>
<p>The Supersonic Origin places the <strong>motor at the handle instead of the head and</strong> entirely alters the balance and handling. Classic hair dryers place a cumbersome motor at the top and cause your arm to tire within minutes and producing that unpleasant weight distribution. Dyson’s V9 <strong>digital motor rotates at 110,000 rpm</strong> which is ridiculously quick next to standard dryers that top at 20,000 rpm. The fast motor drives 13 liters per second through the barrel and produces a concentrated, high-velocity airbeam that dries hair internally, not roasting the top.</p>
<p>Its smart heat control system<strong> takes air temperature readings 40 times per second</strong> and transmits the readings to a microprocessor that controls the heating element. The result is that the <strong>air temperature never goes above 302°F</strong> and that’s important because hair damage takes off at a very rapid rate above that temperature. Drugstore dryers are not very temperature-controlled at all and can easily reach 350-400°F and they fry the protective cuticle layer on your hair. The Supersonic controls temperatures evenly, so your hair dries fast without the crispy, damaged feel that so often comes from the intense heat.</p>



<p>This Supersonic model comes with the necessary attachments that will suit the majority of daily styling requirements. The concentrator for styling allows for a focused airflow for smooth and controlled drying and is ideal when using a round brush to add volume. The wide tooth comb attachment is ideal for hair that is coily, curly, or highly textured, and enables curl drying and lengthening at the same time without interfering with the natural form. The diffused air attachment is for fine hair or sensitive scalps that cannot tolerate strong direct heat.</p>
<p>These are actual airflow and heat settings, not the typical low-medium-high. You get<strong> three real speed settings with four heat settings</strong> and a cold shot button that sets your style with the closure of the cuticle on your hair. The cold shot is not a gimmick: it seals the hydrogen bonds of your hair at the completion of heat styling, and your blowout will last longer.</p>



<p>The acoustic engineering deserves mention because loud hair dryers are genuinely annoying, especially if you’re drying your hair early in the morning with roommates or family around. Dyson tuned the motor frequency to an inaudible pitch and then added acoustic silencers to further reduce noise. The <strong>result measures at 79 decibels which is noticeably quieter than most professional dryers</strong> that scream at 85-90 decibels. That 6-10 decibel difference translates to roughly half the perceived loudness, making the experience far more pleasant.</p>
<p>Right now, you’re paying roughly three times the price of an entry-level dryer at $299 but the technology is so good that it’s really worth it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-review-ryu-weapons-combat-story-2000637393</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What do you want out of a modern, big-budget, blockbuster video game? Large, detailed environments to explore? Tons of skill trees, crafting systems, and resources to manage? An HBO-worthy story with top-notch voice acting that keeps you playing until the end? <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> does not give a fuck about any of these things.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-hitstop-difficulty-game-pass-2000623220"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is here</a> to serve you up tense, twitchy combo-based action and flashy but simple backdrops for ever more ridiculous boss fights and bloodbaths. Nothing more. Nothing less. It gets that job done with S-tier style and attention to detail. Everything else is…<em>fine</em>. I hope that doesn’t sound like a disappointment.</p>

 <p>It’s not. I’m 10 hours into Team Ninja and Platinum Games’ cyberpunk-infused joint entry in the long-running series and I’ve been loving every no-frills moment. The sequel is out October 20 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (published by Microsoft and available day-one on Game Pass Ultimate) and my full review won’t be out until later this week. I’ll leave more of my nitpicks until then. For now I can confidentially say this game has some real juice.</p>

 <p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is the Brazilian steakhouse where the hosts keep plopping down increasingly rich and tasty hunks of meat until you feel completely gorged and then they give you more and you keep going because it’s just that good and also the world will fall to ruin at the hands of a mythic evil dragon if you don’t.</p>

 <p>There’s not a lot of variety. You may occasionally break into a sweaty panic. But plate after plate of bloody brawls and bone-crunching boss fights will arrive and you will not send them back because this is Team Ninja’s house and you will feast until it’s over because who knows, it could be another 13 years until the next <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> arrives.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637430"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637430">Team Ninja / Microsoft</figcaption></figure> <p>If you haven’t been keeping up, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> puts you in the shoes of Ryu Hayabusa’s rival Yakumo who wields the Bloodraven Form technique to chain the blood of his enemies into dazzling and devastating combo attacks (you also play as Ryu in some chapters). Yakumo gets access to multiple weapons with different attack patterns and unlockable move sets. There’s even an ultimate meter you can fill up to unleash quick executions.</p>

 <p>Combined with dodges, parries, and an overwhelming number of fighting-game-style aerial maneuvers and attacks, the combat rewards close attention and thoughtful execution. It’s a button-mashing gorefest, except that every button is pressed for a particular reason and if it’s not, you’re probably looking at the game over screen again.</p>

 <p>Every challenge room and boss fight so far has left me feeling satisfied and accomplished in exchange for the effort expended, even when progress slowed to a crawl and it briefly felt like I was banging my head against the wall. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is so limited and focused in terms of what it puts in front of you that I found these periods of stalled momentum as cathartic and calming as pushing through to the next chapter.</p> <p>I won’t talk about the story because I’m not finished yet and, well, when has a<em> Ninja Gaiden</em> story ever really mattered that much? There’s a mysterious woman manipulating you into breaking magical seals to purify the ancient dragon and prevent it from returning to haunt neo-Tokyo. The English language dubs are not great so I’m playing with subtitles. The conversations and characters, like the spartan levels you encounter them in, provide the most barebones table setting for a linear series of battles and the occasional 3D <em>Sonic</em>-style platforming section.</p> <p>None of the stuff outside of combat has been all that great in<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em> so far, so I welcome there being so little of it. This is a game about seeing how long you can keep your health meter unscathed while landing just enough blows to randomly sever an enemy’s limb and open them up to a grisly execution move that sprays blood all over the screen and nets you points toward your high score for the stage. It’s strikingly old-school that way. It’s nice to have you back, <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lay%E2%80%99s-says-42-of-people-didn%E2%80%99t-know-its-potato-chips-were-made-from-actual-potatoes.1329937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lay’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/college-students-float-on-bags-of-potato-chips-1638992763">potato chips</a> are receiving a big rebrand that makes it clear that the popular snack food is made from potatoes. That might seem silly, until you realize that according to the chip maker, nearly half of the people who buy its product didn’t know the chips were made using potatoes. Seriously.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/our-stories/story/from-potato-to-chip-the-next-chapter-of-lays">Lay’s announced plans to “revamp” the “world’s most popular potato chip”</a> and laid out what it intends to do in a press release that revealed the new chip bag design and shared the surprising statistic.</p>

 <p>“There are more than 4,000 registered potato varieties in the world, and only 10 are good enough to become a Lay’s potato chip,” explained Lay’s in a press release that mentions the word potato nearly 30 times. “Lay’s spends up to nine years creating the best potato for farmers to grow that can deliver the perfect crisp, flavor and golden glow when sliced and cooked. The potatoes’ journey from the soil to the shelf is the heart of Lay’s. But here’s the surprising part — 42% of people who enjoy Lay’s don’t realize they’re made with real, farm-grown potatoes.”</p>

 <p>Usually, I find press releases to be filled with exaggerated language and brand hype that I roll my eyes at, but yeah, no, that is indeed surprising. Nearly half of the people who buy and consume Lay’s chips don’t know they are made from…potatoes? It makes me wonder what they thought the chips were made out of and if they even had a guess or were just buying bags of salty and crispy snacks without much thought beyond “It tastes good.”</p>

 <h2>The new Lay’s chip bag</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000637409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637409">©Lay’s / PepsiCo</figcaption></figure>  <p>So to help address this problem, and also declining sales, the chip maker is rebranding its most famous product. I mean, this doesn’t seem like Lay’s problem to me, but it’s nice they are trying something. You’ll notice that the new bag design has potatoes on it. I mean, the old design <em>literally</em> had a potato transforming into a chip on the front of it, but apparently that wasn’t working. The new bag looks more rustic with wood paneling artwork, and even says, in big black letters, “Made with real potatoes.” Lay’s really wants you all to know that these are potato chips. Lay’s also says it’s removing artificial flavors and colors from its popular potato chip brand in the United States, too. I assume this is connected to U.S. Health Secretary and America’s 14th weirdest maniac, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-rfk-jr-to-announce-phasing-out-of-artificial-food-dyes">his ongoing war against artificial flavors and other chemicals he doesn’t like</a>.</p>

 <p>“The new visual identity celebrates the humble, farm-grown potato — where every Lay’s potato chip starts — and heroes the ingredients that deliver the unmatched flavor consumers have always loved,” explained Alexis Porter, PepsiCo’s Vice President of Marketing, Global Lay’s, in a press release. You can almost hear the desperation from Porter when talking about how these chips are made from potatoes.</p> <p>Will all of this work? Who can say? It does feel like more than ever, the world is slipping into accepted stupidity, while folks seem overall less interested in learning. And if you do try to learn anything, you just end up reading AI-generated summaries filled with nonsense. Or maybe people just assume everything they buy in a store is fake and overly processed plastic pretending to be food. Probably a bit of column A and column B. I’m feeling kind of sad about the future. Seems like the perfect time to curl up on my couch and eat some chips. Wonder what these things are made out of?</p>

              <p>The October 2025 Steam Next Fest <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-free-demos-next-fest-painkiller-reanimal-steam-2000634620">wrapped up today</a> and Valve has revealed the most downloaded demos from the event. Big winners included <em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em>, <em>Everwind</em>, and <em>YAPYAP</em>. If you’ve never heard of any of those, this is your chance to catch up on tomorrow’s hit Steam games before they’re out.</p> <p>Here are the top 10 demo downloads during the latest Steam Next Fest in order of most unique players:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Half Sword</em></strong></a> (medieval swordplay sim)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em></strong></a> (turn-based strategy)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/"><strong><em>YAPYAP</em></strong></a> (magic comedy crew-like)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4021860?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Final Sentence</em></strong></a> (typing battle royale)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong></a> (co-op horror adventure)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4028270?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Everwind</em></strong></a> (co-op survival RPG)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795540/The_Midnight_Walkers?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>The Midnight Walkers</em></strong></a> (zombie extraction shooter)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810880/THE_CUBE_SAVE_US?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>The Cube, Save Us</em></strong></a> (extraction MMO)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4059420?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Misery</em></strong></a> (post-apocalyptic co-op survival)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179350/Long_Drive_North_CoOp_RV_Simulator?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Long Drive North: Co-Op RV Simulator</em></strong></a> (open world survival)</li> </ul> <p>Online co-op and survival sims still reign supreme, though it’s nice to see <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em> having a mini-breakout moment in 2025. “This is the heroes game I have been waiting for ever since heroes 3,” wrote one Steam reviewer about the demo. I was never an <em>HoMM</em> guy growing up, but I like strategy RPGs and enjoyed what I tried of the Early Access build that came out earlier this month.</p>

 <p>Here are some other games from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed">larger top 50 Next Fest demo list</a> that caught my eye. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923350/Ultimate_Sheep_Raccoon/"><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</em></a> is a multiplayer PVP <em>Trials</em>-like. Think 2D side-scrolling <em>Mario Kart</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/"><em>Master of Command</em></a> is a history buff’s historical strategy game that trades neat graphics for the nitty-gritty detail of regiment customization and supply line management. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170150"><em>Cairn</em></a> is an open-world atmospheric climbing sim. It looks like the indie version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> meets <em>Death Stranding</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4040960/Tears_of_Metal_Demo/"><em>Tears of Metal</em></a> is a co-op hack-and-slash roguelike. It’s giving <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> in the art style of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>. Finally there’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/"><em>Skate Story</em></a>, a skateboard RPG in which you grind through a shadow realm to liberate tortured souls. I keep hearing great things.</p> <p>The October 2025 Steam Next Fest may be over now, but most of these games still have free demos you can download if you want to check them out and wishlist them ahead of their launch windows. Because as we all know, Steam users don’t already have way too much to play.</p>
