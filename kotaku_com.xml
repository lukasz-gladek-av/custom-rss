            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The overwhelming consensus among the first hands-on demos with <em>Borderlands 4</em> earlier this summer was that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-4-hands-on-preview/">it’s more of the same</a>. If you already like <em>Borderlands</em>, the sequel is likely to provide everything fans usually show up for. If not, well, TBD on how many nonbelievers Gearbox Entertainment manages to win over with its most ambitious looter shooter yet. Much of that will come down to the details, and the studio has been sharing a lot of them recently. Here’s a bunch of stuff we learned <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">about <em>Borderlands 4</em> this week</a>.</p> <h2>Split-screen co-op returns</h2> <p>Senior project producer Anthony Nicholson<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/12/how-borderlands-4-built-for-co-op-ground-up/"> wrote on Xbox Wire this week</a> that in addition to supporting local co-op, <em>Borderlands 4</em> will also let you play with another pair of people in split-screen mode. Two TVs, four-player sessions, tons of chaos. Teaming up has also apparently been streamlined with a better lobby system and improved dynamic level scaling, including the option for each player to set their own difficulty.</p> <h2>Switch 2 won’t have couch co-op</h2> <p>“Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full cross-play with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S,” reads <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNFY9RTPMT184WZ70D421">the Nintendo version’s support page</a>. The port targets 30fps and arrives on October 3, roughly three weeks after the platforms.</p>

 <h2>There are over 30 billion guns</h2> <p>Yes, that’s a real stat Gearbox is pushing. One of the reasons for that big number is that <em>Borderlands 4</em> lets you mix-and-match elements from different in-universe weapons manufacturers. Then there are all of the RNG stat and perk drops you can get. According to Nicholson, the studio created a Matrix-like gun rack to help conceptualize all the possibilities and prevent the game from spitting out combinations that wouldn’t work.</p> <p>“It was this really large gun map where you could see all of the individual parts for all the individual guns, for all the individual manufacturers,” he <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">told the Epic Games Store blog</a>. “It made it so you could see how each of those things were and how we could have those combinations roll together and how they would work—the slides, the animators, the actions, the art all fitting together. Because a certain gun, if it pumps one way, but there’s a long barrel that goes on the bottom, obviously those parts can’t go together.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> has “more passive perks than all the previous <em>Borderlands</em> combined”</h2> <p>Size matters, at least for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1lh1qm0/borderlands_4_long_info_dump_compiled_from_32/">Gearbox’s marketing guys</a>. The <em>Borderlands 4</em> map is bigger than the last two numbered entries combined. The guns have four times as many polygons as <em>Borderlands 3</em>. All those billions of guns. You get the idea. The skill tree follows a similar pattern. It sounds more advanced, and potentially overwhelming, than any game prior—more <em>Diablo 4</em> or<em> Path of Exile</em> than your traditional RPG shooter.</p>

 <p>“The Augment and the Capstone system that we have forces you to make a choice and all of them drastically change the ability that each player has,” character designer Nick Thurston <a href="https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-passive-perks-interview-gearbox/">told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “That <em>alone&nbsp;</em>would create more build diversity than we’ve ever had. But then we also have more passives than all the previous Borderlands combined. I think Amon alone has 87 passives, and most Vault Hunters have about 80.”</p> <h2>Techno Viking Amon is<em> Borderland</em>‘s “most complicated” Vault Hunter yet</h2> <p>Amon is the guy with the big fire and ice axes you see in all the <em>Borderlands 4</em> trailers. But looks can be deceiving. He’s not just a tanky melee character. He’s apparently the poster child for the new game’s build variety. Everyone in a squad could play as Amon, but the styles might all be different, Gearbox claims. Melee, ranged, support, he can do it all. Unlike most of the franchise’s Vault Hunters that pop abilities and then just shoot stuff, Amon’s skills can be deployed in more ways.</p>

 <p>“He just has more abilities than any other Vault Hunter numerically because of his trait, which allows him to have forge skills,” Thurston <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-amon-is-a-more-complicated-vault-hunter-to-play-than-past-options/1100-6533956/">told <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “I wouldn’t say he’s super complicated, but he has a lot more going on in the middle of combat, and he’s a lot more active than I think a lot of people historically expect from Vault Hunters.” He sounds like a more advanced archetype than some of the others, though Gearbox says he’s still approachable to new players.</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> is inspired by mergers, acquisitions, and fascism</h2> <p>The game takes place on a prison planet called Kairos. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford suggests that’s a not-so-subtle illusion to the studio’s rocky period during which it was sold to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-gearbox-embracer-acquisition-1851297286">poorly conceived Embracer holding company</a>, before trying to escape again. The studio group is now owned by longtime publishing partner 2K Games, part of the broader Take-Two portfolio that includes <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> maker Rockstar Games and mobile maker Zynga.</p> <p>“There’s this cultural and emotional shift in me, personally, and at the studio. What does it mean to trade some autonomy for organization?” he told <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">the Epic Games Store blog</a>: “What does it feel like to move up and down the scale between autonomy and being organized or even being controlled? On one end of a spectrum you have anarchy, and on the other end of the spectrum you have fascism, totalitarianism, zero freedom. It’s not just about societies—that’s all of us as individuals, to imagine where we want to be on that spectrum and how comfortable we are. And we were going through that as a company.”</p>

              <p><span>This weekend is a big one for fans and players of competitive </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. Thousands of fans are gathering in the Anaheim Convention Center to watch the best of the best battle each other in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>. However, not everyone is there to have a good time. For some people, the cost of attendance is merely a business expense. Like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-scalpers-happy-meal-toys-japan-2000617978"><span>every other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>event or collaboration</span></a><span> in recent memory, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers</span></a><span> have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>descended upon Anaheim</span></a><span> to buy up exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> merch and then sell it for a profit. I really wanted to go to Worlds this year, as I’ve been a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fan most of my life and still haven’t been to one of the championship competitions, but while the tournament is just beginning, the vibes seem so rancid I’m not sure it would make for a great first impression.</span></p> <p><span>It seems like every other week we here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>are writing about some absolute nonsense in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, as scalpers have made full-time jobs out of buying up cards and collectibles for a quick buck. The controversial practice has become so lucrative for these grown-ass adults that sales devolve into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-adults-men-fighting-over-restock-machine-tiktok-1851768074"><span>actual acts of violence</span></a><span> or crowds end up </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>jockeying to rummage through shelves</span></a><span> like it’s Black Friday. Part of me feels some sympathy for people who have to resort to this because times are tough and it’s easier than hard labor, but especially considering this franchise has probably brought me more joy than any other for most of my life, it really sucks to see that every new event or merch drop now makes me feel so deeply cynical.</span></p> <p><span>The Anaheim event has only been going on for a day, and there are already </span><a href="https://x.com/michmalllow/status/1956092730708516956"><span>reports of resellers setting up shop in neighboring hotels</span></a><span> near the convention center, with others responding by putting up signage </span><a href="https://x.com/predaconspittor/status/1956151255124029911"><span>prohibiting such wheeling and dealing</span></a><span>. Competitive players are </span><a href="https://x.com/NicholasMoffit2/status/1956059599569916167"><span>posting on social media</span></a><span> about selling merchandise for more than they paid for it. What is supposed to be a giant community gathering has become something else entirely, and it’s made it harder to be a fan when you can’t even engage with it without having to push through people with bad intentions.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really really dislike how pokemon worlds has turned from a celebration of competitive pokemon to taking anything remotely valuable and scalping it for a profit.</p> <p>— Tyson Blätter (@T_Blatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/T_Blatt/status/1956007686190866633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Worlds Pokemon Center showing us once again that capitalism ruins everything people love 🙂</p> <p>— Sawyer Melban (@sawyerhatemail) <a href="https://twitter.com/sawyerhatemail/status/1955874877724090578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t understand why some people are complaining that we brought our daughter to the Pokemon Center yesterday.

So it begs the question: Is </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>just cooked as a hobby now? After nearly 30 years, has the franchise’s reputation become so sullied by people who buy its merchandise just to sell it to other people that longtime devotees are leaving it behind? The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise is too far-reaching to really be affected by this phenomenon, which a lot of collectors believe is why The Pokémon Company doesn’t do much to really stop it. Purchase limits on new merchandise are helpful, but they don’t stop scalpers from showing up before stores put cards on the shelf, making multiple accounts to purchase items online, or causing a ruckus at events like Worlds. </span></p> <p><span>You would think constantly being in the headlines for robberies, chaotic sales, and even actual violence associated with your product would be damaging enough to the brand that TPC would be motivated to take real action. But again, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is so prolific that TPC doesn’t actually receive any chip damage from this. A sale to a scalper puts the same amount of money in Pikachu’s pockets as one to a devoted fan. The assembly line will keep going, and unless people stop buying from them, scalpers will keep showing up. As I said earlier, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has brought me more joy than probably any other series. These days, however, that joy is getting drowned out by cynicism every time some event takes place that should be reminding me why I fell in love with </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the first place.</span></p>

<p>The Remedy Connected Universe is growing pretty rapidly these days, and its latest entry is a <i>Control</i> spin-off known as <i>FBC: Firebreak</i>. In this cooperative shooter, players return to the Federal Bureau of Control’s bizarre and unsettling Oldest House with up to two pals.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-relaunch-remedy-alan-wake-control-2000617135"><i>Alan Wake</i> Devs Plan A Big Relaunch For Failing Co-Op Flop</a></p> <p>Unfortunately, the game hasn’t been the hit many were probably hoping for. Developer Remedy is looking to put some elbow grease into <a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-relaunch-remedy-alan-wake-control-2000617135">rehabilitating the co-op shooter</a>. But you <i>can</i> play it right now if you want. So let’s get into everything you’d need to know if you want to play it as of summer 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what-don%e2%80%99t-folks-like-about-fbc-firebreak"></span>What don’t folks like about <i>FBC: Firebreak</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Firebreak</i> unfortunately hasn’t satisfied critics or players. Cited issues include a “<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/fbc-firebreak">lifeless</a>” feeling when playing and a bit too much <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-review">chaos and drudgery</a>. It’s a disappointing debut for a game set in an otherwise excellent setting with a decent premise.</p>

 <h2><span id="how-many-people-are-playing-right-now"></span>How many people are playing right now?<span></span></h2> <p>While you may be able to make your own fun in <i>Firebreak</i>, it’s fair to say most people aren’t. At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/">SteamDB reports</a> a player count in the low teens, with an all-time peak of 1,992 players. Those aren’t great numbers on PC, to say the least.</p> <h2><span id="does-fbc-firebreak-have-crossplay-support"></span>Does <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> have crossplay support?<span></span></h2> <p>The short answer is <b>yes</b>, <b><i>FBC: Firebreak</i></b><b> has crossplay support</b>. Players can team with one another across other platforms by sharing a party code. So, if you’re a console fan with friends who prefer to play on PC, or vice versa, you can invite each other for some first-person shooting fun in either duos or trios.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618048"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618048">© Screenshot: Remedy</figcaption></figure> <h2><span id="does-fbc-firebreak-have-crossprogression-support"></span>Does <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> have cross-progression support?<span></span></h2> <p>The good news stops at crossplay, I’m afraid. <b><i>FBC: Firebreak</i></b><b> does not support cross-progression at launch</b>.</p> <p>However, that doesn’t mean the game won’t have cross-progression at some point in the future.</p>

 <p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fbc-firebreak-crossplay-support-launch-no-cross-progression">MP1ST</a>, community manager Julian Fondum responded to an inquiry about cross-progression by saying, “Not at launch. Maybe way down the line. It’s a maybe. A lot of things we’re doing on the back end [are] definitely built in the way that we can do a bunch of things down the line when we have more resources and so on.”</p> <p>That sounds promising to me! But as with any feature that hasn’t been confirmed yet, don’t hold your breath. I suspect there are plenty of things on the game’s roadmap that Remedy views as more pivotal for the game than this for now.</p> <p>If you’re a fan of the Remedy Connected Universe and want to see what all the fuss is about, even if the game has failed to impress on launch, <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, and Windows PCs.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> </a>isn’t an open-world game like some of the previous titles in the franchise. Instead, it’s a linear action game set inside large, detailed areas that offer some freedom. However, a new upcoming update will add a more traditional open-world mode to the recently released game.</p> <p>On August 14, developer Hangar 13 posted a message on social media thanking players for all the “love and loyalty” following the launch of<em> Mafia: The Old Country</em> earlier this month. But the message also contained an announcement: <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-old-country-swimming-open-world-baldurs-gate-2000616867"><em>The Old Country</em></a> will get a “Free Ride” mode in a free future update.</p> <p>“Today, we’re excited to confirm Free Ride is on its way,” posted Hangar 13 on Twitter. “Expect some new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mafiosi—thanks for the love and loyalty you've shown <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MafiaTheOldCountry?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MafiaTheOldCountry</a> since launch.</p> <p>Today, we're excited to confirm 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐑𝐢𝐝𝐞 is on its way! Expect some new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months. <a href="https://t.co/FqJ3UU9brG">pic.twitter.com/FqJ3UU9brG</a></p> <p>— Mafia Game (@mafiagame) <a href="https://twitter.com/mafiagame/status/1956025890632077319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Currently, <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> does include a <a href="https://youtu.be/YOkZY_CEQg0">“Free Roam” option known as Exploration</a>, but this mode is pretty boring and doesn’t feature enemies, missions, activities, or much to do. You can find and grab missed collectibles and clean up some other loose ends, but for the most part, it’s an empty world devoid of anything to do. That won’t be the case with this new open-world-esque “Free Ride” mode. And while we don’t have any more details about Free Ride in <em>Old Country </em>just yet, we can look at the most recent release in the series to see what to expect.</p> <p><a href="https://mafiagame.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Ride">Free Ride</a> was a mode present in <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-definitive-edition-is-a-great-remake-of-a-clunky-1845182811"><em>Mafia: The Definitive Edition</em>, Hangar 13’s remastered version of the original <em>Mafia</em></a> game released back in 2020. It let players run around the game’s city and countryside freely and added new missions, races, and even some wackier content involving rituals and aliens. It was unlocked after beating the first mission in the game. I would assume Free Ride in <em>Old Country</em> will be similar in scope and scale. If that’s the case, many players who missed the more open-world format of <em>Mafia III</em> will be happy to have something bigger and more free-roaming to sink their teeth into when it arrives at some unspecified date in the “coming months.”</p>

              <p><span>When I played </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i></a><span>, Wrong Organ’s psychological horror game and surprise dark horse in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2024-astro-bot-dragon-age-star-wars-1851726357"><span>2024 Game of the Year race</span></a><span>, I couldn’t have anticipated it would reach the level of fandom in which it got cute, </span><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/mouthwashing?utm_campaign=mouthwashing-launch&amp;utm_source=twitter-steam-discord"><span>marketable plushies</span></a><span>. Its subject matter is very dark, but then again, that’s never really stopped horror games and movies from going down this path. I suppose it shouldn’t be too surprising, then, that its characters are getting stuffed toys, despite the terrible things they all go through in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>’s brief runtime. What is surprising is that after all this time, the community is not only still debating the game’s horrors and morality…but now, they’ve devolved into going for each other’s throats over a plush of a character named Jimmy reimagined as a cute cat.</span></p> <p><b>Content warning: Sexual assault</b></p>  <p><span>Jimmy is the primary player character in </span><i>Mouthwashing</i><span>. He and his crew have been stranded in space after their freight ship collided with an asteroid, and the game goes over the fallout of the crash and the months that followed. Without getting too into everything that goes down, suffice it to say </span><i>Mouthwashing </i><span>is a pretty harrowing story involving some of the worst things humans are capable of, and Jimmy is the perpetrator of a lot of those crimes. He’s also an unreliable narrator attempting to cover up what he’s done, and the things he’s revealed to have done on the ship put him far beyond any possible redemption.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy does a lot of reprehensible things in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, and the one that’s perhaps most notable is that the game implies he raped Anya, the lone woman on the ship, who is now pregnant. We don’t need to get into all the repercussions of this act here, but as you can imagine, a lot of </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>fans are not fans of Jimmy’s. In fact, I’d argue the game’s entire point is to make you hate this guy. He’s the villain of this story, and even if he attempts to do the right thing at the end of the game, that’s not going to be enough for some. Others, meanwhile, do find him compelling as a character whose layered story has a lot of depth. For some who find his actions unforgivable, even believing him an interesting centerpiece in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>’s story goes beyond what they believe to be morally acceptable.</span></p>

 <p><span>Fast forward to August 2025, and a collectible manufacturer called </span><a href="https://www.plushshop.com/"><span>Plushshop</span></a><span> is making a cat-shaped plush of Jimmy. The store has stuffed cats based on characters from anime, TV shows, and video games, ranging from </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>One Piece</span></i><span>. When the company first announced plans to make </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>plushes, those plans didn’t include one for Jimmy, which led to backlash from fans. The company has since removed those initial </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>plushes from its store and deleted any mention of them from its social media accounts. </span></p> <p><span>However, after the shop announced its Jimmy plush as a separate launch, </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>fans jumped on the website to leave negative user reviews saying that given Jimmy’s true nature, he shouldn’t be made into a cute cat plush. That alone is maybe a conversation worth having, but the comments quickly devolved into a toxic cesspool, with some people claiming that those who bought the plush were rape apologists and several comments that, for some reason, included racial slurs. I went to go look at them myself on PlusShop’s website, but the Jimmy plush seems to have been removed. We’ve reached out to PlushShop for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back. In the meantime, screenshots of the reviews have begun circulating on places like </span><a href="https://x.com/SecondHorn31331/status/1955290233789956236"><span>X (formerly Twitter)</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mouthwashing/comments/1mper2l/the_jimmy_meow_plush_from_plush_shop/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>, but do be warned that there’s some foul language in those links.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As someone who really enjoyed </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>for its exploration of the human psyche and its striking visuals, am I thrilled that its characters are being made into plushes? Not particularly. I do think it’s a bit weird to make those characters cute cats or even just regular toys. It turns a pretty horrific story into an almost absurdist display prop, and even the officially </span><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/mouthwashing/products/curly-mouthwashing-plush"><span>licensed plush of a man</span></a><span> wrapped up in bandages with his painkillers made into an accessory kind of feels like a parody or shitpost, turning some of the most memorable, horrific imagery in the game into a purchasable gag. All that said, the reaction to this cat plush is so ludicrously overblown and reeks of the kind of “putting fictional characters on trial” nonsense that has plagued discussions around games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>and that I can’t believe we’re still dealing with in 2025.</span></p>

 <p><span>Good stories are built around conflict, and in some of those stories, the perpetrators of that conflict are reprehensible people who cannot be redeemed in the eyes of the beholder. Yes, in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, one character has committed one of the most vile things a person is capable of. But he is not a real person, and he is not on trial. Liking a story in which people do terrible things is not the same as endorsing their actions, and if that goes over someone’s head, I’m surprised they’re engaging with </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>to begin with considering several of its characters are morally dubious, to say the least. Since some of the comments weighing in on this use racial slurs, I imagine at least some of those people putting Jimmy on trial have larger issues than a lack of media literacy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The root of these kinds of arguments is that there will always be people who don’t understand that others engage with art differently than they do. One thing I’ve learned in my years of writing, reading, watching, and listening to criticism is that you’ll find that there are some people who have different expectations when they voice an opinion about a work. For example, when someone lashes out at a critique, it’s often under the pretense that a critic is trying to “change” something they think is fine. When some fans voice a complaint about a game, they expect the developers to address it in a patch, and so when they see another person criticizing anything, this is the only framework they have for understanding that critique: as, effectively, a complaint to management over an issue they wish to see rectified. </span></p>

 <p><span>The same thing happens with how people engage with characters. Some people only “like” characters if they support everything they do and can stand by them in the end, so the concept of enjoying a character who does reprehensible shit is so foreign to them that it is somehow a moral failing to derive any sort of satisfaction from them, even from dissecting their actions. Because people are so fixated on their own media literacy framework, art that engages in uncomfortable topics will never be free from Tumblr-era moralizing. To people who make these arguments, “problematic” storylines are just problems to be solved, rather than a means of exploring potentially challenging or uncomfortable themes. The curtains were blue. Jimmy was a bad guy. That’s all there is to it.</span></p> <p><span>I didn’t expect to rant about this on a random Friday in August, and I certainly didn’t expect it to be over a toy cat. I really enjoyed </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, but I guess it’s a good thing I didn’t get too involved with its community, because it sure seems like there are a lot of people in that community who are ill-equipped to engage with the game they’re purportedly fans of.</span></p>
