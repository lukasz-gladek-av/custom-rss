The latest release from the <em>Dark Souls</em> team immediately sprang up the Steam charts to reach over 300,000 concurrent players. That made it the fourth-biggest game on Valve’s storefront and the second-biggest FromSoftware launch on PC behind <em>Elden Ring</em>. Its namesake and its $40 price point clearly did the experimental multiplayer spin-off some favors. </p><p>But it didn’t take players long to realize that <em>Nightreign</em> is very much not <em>Elden Ring</em>. Unlike its slow, plodding predecessor, the spin-off is a battle royale-influenced loot race in which sessions see an entire Soulsborne experience condensed into just 45 minutes. It takes some getting used to, and players are already coming to grips with <em>Nightreign</em>’s notable hostility to explaining itself, even for a FromSoftware game. And while it does allow for offline solo play, its steep difficulty curve—more of a right angle really—heavily rewards group play and coordination. </p><p>“If you don’t have 2 other friends to play with in voice chat, don’t waste your time,” wrote Steam user Hishamm. “Game is <em>Elden Ring</em>, but 3p, and the solo queue is abysmal.” “Gameplay itself seems fun but I can’t possible leave a positive review if a game released in 2025 has no way to communicate in a coop game (neither voice nor text chat),” wrote Lynni. “Impossible to make progress without voice chat,” wrote Vahit Horoz. “If you have 3 friends you can talk to and play regularly, you will have a great time, the connection is smooth, the map is full of events and the game loop is very interesting.”</p><p>The game currently has a Steam rating of 65 percent, making it the lowest-scored FromSoftware release on the platform outside of <em>Dark Souls III</em>’s <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em> DLC. The reviews are full of complaints about the lack of duos (you have to either play alone or with a three-stack) and how matchmaking with strangers often leads to people randomly running around the map without coordinating, a task made harder by the lack of communication tools outside of pings and emotes. I think that might even out in the days and weeks ahead as players learn the basics of the randomized<em> Nightreign</em> map and how much more efficient you are together than split up, but the lack of modern multiplayer features is a real issue. </p><figure id="" data-id="193e46e0697b78f994a60384db271918" data-recommend-id="image://193e46e0697b78f994a60384db271918" data-format="png" data-width="2256" data-height="888" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative Elden Ring Nightreign reviews.

Nightlord bosses are practically impossible at the moment for all but the most experienced and hardcore <em>Elden Ring</em> loners. A mysterious day-one patch alluded to balance changes and other improvements, but didn’t spell out exactly what those changes are. If FromSoftware does decide to dial things back a bit, it wouldn’t be the first time it’s made one of its games easier. The studio quickly made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-update-1-14-dlc-radahn-boss-nerf-1851645615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-update-1-14-dlc-radahn-boss-nerf-1851645615"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s final boss</a></span> much easier when it kicked everyone’s ass last summer.
