              <p>We all have our own sets of small inconveniences that make us irrationally angry. Mine is spotty internet, especially when its my own home. Occasionally when I’m in the bathroom, my router will just decide all by itself to cut its range in half, and then I’m left there caught in loop or refreshing before I give up and resort to reading the back of a shampoo bottle like it’s the dark ages. Stop this from happening in your home. Upgrade to a Wi-Fi mesh network to achieve total coverage around every corner. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4837/">Amazon has the TP-Link Deco S4 mesh Wi-Fi system on sale right now. You can save as much as $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco S4 mesh Wi-Fi system comes in a few different variants. You can grab the Wi-Fi 5 AC1900 router, a Wi-Fi 6 AX1500 router, or the Wi-Fi 6 AX3000 Pro router with dual 2.5G ports. Each are available as either a lone model or as a two-pack or three-pack. The Wi-Fi 5 AC1900 three-pack is down 25% from $120 to just $90, saving you $30. The faster Wi-Fi 6 AX1500 three-pack of routers dropped 23% from $150 to just $115, a savings of $35, and the three-pack of dual-port Wi-Fi 6 routers came down 23% from $220 to $170. That knocks off $50.</p>

<h2>Total Coverage in Your Home</h2>
<p>Choosing the Wi-Fi 6 over the Wi-Fi 5 routers, you’ll be able to set yourself up with a super fast dual-band mesh network — achieving up to 1,201 Mbps on the 5GHz line and 300 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz line. You can cover every’ inch of your home, reach across up to 5,600 square feet. Eliminate dead zones and endless buffering.</p>
<p>The mesh network of routers can support up to 120 devices at a time, keeping them all connected and running at top speed. You can have your smart TV, Alexa, toaster, laptops, Nintendo Switches, and every phone in the family on the Wi-Fi plus a ton of extra tech without any hogging up the speeds and slowing down the other devices.</p>



<p>TP-Link Deco routers are protected with TP-Link HomeShield. This premium security service can keep everything on your home network safe with basic network security scans, device identification, parental controls, and frequent reporting.</p>
<p>Get rid of the daily frustration of bad internet today while saving yourself some cash. Right now, you can get started with a mesh Wi-Fi network for as little $45 (Wi-Fi 5 AC1900 router) or saddle up with a three-pack of the faster Wi-Fi 6 AX1500 routers for even less at just $38 a pop when purchased as a bundle.</p>

              <p>I can’t think of a better pair of brands than Minecraft and LEGO. Minecraft is already comprised of individual blocks so it doesn’t take that much of a stretch of the imagination to adapt the world and it’s inhabitants into LEGO brick form. The two have collaborated, bringing us a whole slew of LEGO Minecraft sets including this one based on the Badlands biome which happens to be on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/"> It normally goes for $60, but the discount has it for 27% off for a limited time</a>. That shaves the price down by $17 so you only have to pay $44.</p>
<p>Minecraft has already been sitting comfortably towards the top of the list of the most popular video games of all time. Following the movie this year starring Jack Black, the name has been launched into the stratosphere. So if you’re an aunt or uncle, looking to find a gift this holiday season for a video game-obsessed niece or nephew, chances are they know what a Chicken Jockey is and they’d be more than delighted to receive a LEGO Minecraft set.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play and Creativity Set</h2>
<p>The buildable Minecraft set includes a number of minifigures including a Badlands Explorer, a Creeper, cave spiders, a husk, a baby rabbit, a donkey with saddlebags, 2 slimes and a bat. The bat can even hang upside down with its wings folded up. the people-shaped minifigures are kind of genius in their implementation here to achieve the Minecraft look. They use the standard LEGO torso and legs, but then swap out the head for a box. It’s perfect.</p>



<p>The 538-piece LEGO set has interactive elements. You can blast stones across your play area with the TNT to operate the explode function. The set is filled with tools like the coveted diamond pickaxe. You load load up your different tools into the donkey’s satchel too. Your Minecraft explorer has a bed to sleep in and a set of rails to ride in a minecart down. There are different colored bricks representing precious ores like copper, gold, redstone, and amethyst crystals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/">The LEGO Minecraft The Badlands Mineshaft set is only one part of a much larger collection.</a> You can also shop for LEGO versions of a pirate ship voyage, a cherry blossom garden, a wolf stronghold, a windmill farm, as well as the ender dragon and end ship. Right now, the Badlands Mineshaft set is on sale for its lowest price on Amazon yet. That’s just $43, down from $60.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marvel Rivals</i> is shedding its PvP-only identity this October with a PvE mode in which you and your friends&nbsp; are gonna have to use super powers to mop up a zombie-infested city. The event kicks off later this month as a collaboration with Marvel Animation following the four-episode <i>Marvel Zombies</i> miniseries on Disney+.</p> <p>Developer NetEase shared the news of its upcoming PvE zombies mode this morning <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847">over on X</a> with a post showing off some fun animation and a slice of the gameplay, as well as a few details of how it’ll work. Though you won’t have access to the full roster of heroes available in PvP, you can choose among Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Shark, and the Punisher to sweep through zombie hordes and take on Zombie Namoor and the Queen of the Dead, who serve as bosses. It all launches on October 23, 2025, just in time for Halloween.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first-ever PvE mode: Marvel Zombies is coming on Oct 23, 2025 UTC. </p> <p>This new mode throws you and your squad into a relentless fight for survival against endless waves of the undead. </p> <p>The city's burning, the infected are rising – and it's up to you to hold the line. <br>Get a… <a href="https://t.co/DodsnAzoRB">pic.twitter.com/DodsnAzoRB</a></p> <p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>These heroes will work a little differently from how they do in the base game, too. Thor, for example, is described in the teaser as having a “persistent awakened state” and Magik has access to an “unlimited Darkchild form.”</p>

 <h2><i>Marvel Rivals</i> could use a Hail Mary</h2> <p>The news follows a pretty significant dip in popularity for the superhero-themed hero shooter. As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/12/marvel-rivals-has-lost-85-of-its-players-in-10-months/">reported by <i>Forbes</i>’ Paul Tassi</a>, the once white-hot shooter has cooled, losing 85 percent of the player base it enjoyed earlier in the year. As Tassi notes, the player count is still quite healthy, with concurrents peaking at 98,000 in recent days. But clearly Marvel Studios could use a bit of a shot in the arm if it wants to reclaim its previous numbers, which saw things top out at 644,000 concurrents.</p> <p>Zombies and horde PvE modes are nothing we haven’t seen before in shooters. The upcoming <i>Black Ops 7</i> this November, for example, continues <i>CoD</i>’s long-running zombies mode alongside its standard multiplayer offerings. That said, <i>Rivals</i>’ PvE gameplay does look pretty fresh in motion. We’ll see if it’s enough to put some spring in <i>Rivals</i>’ step.</p>

              <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is having a big week with </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>out now for Switch and Switch 2, but before fans headed back to Kalos, they learned a whole lot about the future of the series after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>a second massive Game Freak Teraleak</span></a><span>. The info dump included information about future games, including the Generation X games </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>. If you were wondering about the legitimacy of the whole thing, well, it looks like The Pokémon Company is targeting prominent leakers with DMCA takedowns.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978966734452248960"><span>Centro Leaks</span></a><span>, an X account that compiles </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>leaks when they sprout up in places like 4chan or Discord, claims that TPC COO Takato Utsunomiya has contacted X about multiple copyright infringements from the leaks, saying that these posts include images and videos that have been “reproduced and distributed to the public without [the company’s] permission.” Among the posts listed in the screenshotted email are the </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave </span></i><span>logos, and a list of Pokémon supposedly returning in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>. Do with that information what you will.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>Teraleak happened last year</span></a><span>, and included not only information about upcoming projects but also several documents and pieces of concept art for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-budget-canceled-masuda-black-white-remake-2000635371"><span>older games, as well as some canceled ones</span></a><span> that never saw the light of day. Almost exactly a year later, this second wave of information spread, revealing new development footage and design docs for games like </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game set in the Galar region from </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, and an MMO-style game that would take place in multiple regions from previous games. Whether or not these leaks shift plans for any of the games Game Freak has coming down the pipeline remains to be seen, but by trying to take these down, The Pokémon Company may have confirmed their legitimacy. We’ve reached out to the company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s Cleaning House on Its 5-Star Ryzen 7 Laptop at 69% Off (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), $399 Worth of Free Accessories Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dells-cleaning-house-on-their-inspiron-15-touchscreen-laptops-grab-one-now-for-69-off-2000636182</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-cleaning-house-on-its-5-star-ryzen-7-laptop-at-69-off-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-399-worth-of-free-accessories-included.1327678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It seems kind of early to be clearing out the shelves ahead of the big Black Friday and Cyber Week sales to come at the end of next month, but if that’s what Dell is thinking by putting some of their top-shelf touchscreen laptops on sale at massively reduced prices, why say no? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/">This time it’s the Inspiron 15 3535 touchscreen business laptop that’s showing up at Amazon for over $1,500 off — it’s just $750 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The specs of this business laptop and the $399 accessories bundle it’s paired with basically scream for a higher price, especially with the big holiday sales events still over a month away. The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 has an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor with 8 cores and 16 threads, capable of speeds up to 5.0GHz. It comes loaded with 32GB of RAM, expandable to 64GB, and a generous 1TB SSD for storage. Windows 11 Professional with Microsoft Copilot come preloaded.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Touch</h2>
<p>The 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen is an underrated feature. With the huge advances made by tablets, a touchscreen laptop doesn’t quite have the cache it once had, but it’s exceptionally useful. The one on the Dell Inspiron 15 is full-HD with Dolby Atmos and anti-glare coating, so it’s a solid display even before you use the touchscreen features. For our money’s worth, a good touchscreen beats a trackpad any day for ultimate control and ease of use.</p>
<p>We also love the fact that while 32GB of RAM is a real score, and definitely enough to power the Dell Inspiron 15 through multitasking, streaming, and even creative work like photo and video editing, this Dell comes with an empty slot to give you the option of doubling the RAM by adding another 32GB chip. Memory prices have been pleasantly low as of late, so this is a great bit of future-proofing for this laptop.</p>



<h2>Not Just Business</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Inspiron 15 a business laptop, and it’s certainly more than capable if you’re strictly looking for an everyday productivity superstar at a great price. But it would almost be a waste to not use it for more, since it has enough graphics power and a sharp enough screen to lend itself to creative endeavors, and with the FHD Dolby Atmos screen, a little streaming might be in order as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/">The 69% off deal at Amazon that knocks the price of the Inspiron 15 and its accessory bundle down from $2,400 to just $750</a> shows that Dell is serious about reducing its stock of these great touchscreen laptops ahead of the holiday tech deals. There’s going to be no shortage of tech shoppers willing to lend them a hand, so don’t wait too long or the supply might run out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo is making <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873">a lot of Switch 2s</a>. Like, a <em>lot</em> a lot. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, suppliers have been asked to ramp up production enough for the company to sell up to 25 million Switch 2s by the end of the current fiscal year. Nintendo clearly has ambitious expectations for the pricey sequel to its most successful home console ever. The good news for fans is that basically anyone who wants to buy one has been able to.</p> <p>Sources <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDY2MzU1NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMjY4MzU0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM1VMNUZHT1QwSkswMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.LE6GP3UTebmLsJ8NMH5owMDSVfAgjvJ76QZvezdERSM">told<em> Bloomberg</em></a> Nintendo will likely surpass analysts’ sales estimates that have the Switch 2 selling 17.6 million units by the end of March 2026, and could go on to sell roughly 20 million in the device’s first 10 months on the market. If that turns out to be the case, it would put sales of the Switch 2 squarely within the peak years of the original hardware, blowing the Switch 1’s already strong debut out of the water.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636575"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636575">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Nintendo sold roughly 15 million Switches in that console’s first year, peaking at over 27 million sold in 2020. Between the global pandemic and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, that may have been an anomaly. Still, the console has also had an impressively long tail, thanks in part to the release of revised models and special editions. Basically, if the Switch 2 sales curve starts at a higher point and can draft off similar momentum with hit game releases, it could certainly have the potential to match or even outdo the (at least for now) second-best-selling console of all time.</p> <p>For fans though, this big production push has resulted in a comfortable supply of Switch 2 units on store shelves. Despite the pre-order mess and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-day-one-update-live-eshop-mario-kart-1851783549">initial launch chaos</a>, you’ve basically been able to walk into most big box stores and pick up a Switch 2 if you wanted one over the last few months. And that’s despite the ongoing trade war and uncertainty around a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">possible future Switch 2 price hike</a>. For the device’s first holiday season though, it should be smooth sailing.</p>
