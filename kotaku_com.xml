              <p>The race to define what the brutal murder of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk last week means and why it happened has led a lot of people to say a lot of things. Some of those things, like blaming the sci-fi shooter <em>Halo</em> for fomenting class warfare, or suggesting the alleged shooter was <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-discord-reddit-memes-2000625746">radicalized by the “meme-ification” of the internet</a>, look increasingly like absurd, knee-jerk, and ill-informed reactions, as a recent report about the actual contents of one of the gaming Discord servers the suspect was active on suggests none of that.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/15/charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect-discord-chat/"><em>The Washington Post</em> reported</a> that alleged gunman Tyler Robinson had admitted to the crime in a Discord message to friends last week. Yesterday, independent <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/exclusive-leaked-messages-from-charlie">reporter Ken Klippenstein shared actual screenshots</a> of messages allegedly posted on the server, alongside an interview with some of its other members. According to his report, the Discord hangout was far from the hotbed of political radicalization some politicians and pundits have claimed it would be.</p> <p>According to Klippenstein, there were only a couple of mentions of either President Donald Trump or former President Joe Biden in the chat logs, and those were apolitical mentions of recent news events. “Cat memes, weather updates, home improvement and the odd Garfield reference populate Robinson’s posts,” Klippenstein writes.</p>

 <p>“Obviously he’s okay with gay and trans people having a right to exist, but also believes in the Second Amendment,” an apparent childhood friend of Robinson’s told Klippenstein.&nbsp;“To all of us he just seemed like a simple guy who liked playing games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>,&nbsp;and <em>Helldivers 2</em>, loved to fish and loved to camp…it really did seem like that’s all he was about.”</p> <p>This lack of an easily applicable, ready-made narrative about Kirk’s alleged murderer that would paint him has a politically aggrieved radical comes as those leading the national conversation, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/kash-patel-testimony-senate-judiciary-charlie-kirk-assassination/">like FBI Director Kash Patel</a>, <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/charlie-kirk-conspiracy-theories-roil-maga-media-groyper">rush to ascribe motives</a>. “[Gaming] can desensitize to the point where that person involved in these games looks at other people…and they’re not even human beings, they’re simply avatars,” former FBI profiler Dr. Mary Ellen O’Toole <a href="https://x.com/kenklippenstein/status/1967419550817042749">told Fox News this week</a>.</p>

 <p>According to charging documents filed by Utah County prosecutors on Tuesday, Robinson told his roommate in text messages that he allegedly killed Kirk because “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out.” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/us/text-message-tyler-robinson-roomate-vis">The prosecution’s evidence suggests</a> Robinson may have targeted Kirk specifically over transphobic comments he made in the past. But it also didn’t allude to any political radicalization fomented by online platforms like Discord and Reddit. That hasn’t stopped at least one high-profile politician from calling on the executives of those companies to testify before Congress about “the radicalization of online forum users.”</p> <p>“The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/">announced on Wednesday</a>. “To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.”</p> <p>The hearing is set to take place on October 8, 2025 and is the first time Discord in particular will have been called on to testify. Members of Tiktok, X, and Meta <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=twitch+other+companies+called+testify+congress&amp;sca_esv=c6620bc555597255&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifPkzG72RanLTFQQWJFtRCj0QoXIBg%3A1758129266918&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A9%2F3%2F2022%2Ccd_max%3A8%2F3%2F2025&amp;tbm=">were grilled last year</a> about online child safety concerns. A spokesperson for Discord has previously said there was “no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.”</p>

              <p>Have you ever dreamed of playing <em>Halo</em> on an <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-an-original-xbox-easter-egg-thats-remained-hidden-1846926839">original Xbox</a>, but you didn’t want to use a big TV? And you also wanted to risk damaging your game disc and/or fingers in the process while holding a large technological monstrosity in your hands? Well, that’s a strange dream you have, buddy, but I got just the video for you.</p> <p>On September 16, as spotted by <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/handhelds/now-i-can-take-steel-battalion-with-me-everywhere-hey-gamers-ive-found-your-xbox-handheld/">GamesRadar</a></em>, YouTuber, retro console enthusiast, and modder James Channel <a href="https://youtu.be/W3OK9A_RbSI">posted a new video</a> to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Games_for_James">wonderful channel</a> all about his wild and wacky experience turning an OG Xbox into a portable handheld console in the most janky way possible. It’s a fantastic video that involves Channel getting shocked, ripping apart multiple electronic devices, and covering the entire beast in a bunch of duct tape. Here’s the video, which is admittedly 33 minutes long, but totally worth watching.</p>  <p>Something I really appreciate about this video is how committed the modder is to making sure this handheld Xbox looks and feels hacked together. It’s like a Frankenstein’s monster of a console, with pieces and parts from an old iPod dock crammed on top of an Xbox’s motherboard. And while it takes him a few attempts and a lot of tinkering, he does eventually pull it off and is able to play <em>Halo</em> in one of the wildest ways possible. It also seems very dangerous, as there is a DVD spinning incredibly fast just a few inches away from his fingers and face at all times.</p> <p>This monster of a thing even sports a relatively impressive 9 minutes and 40 seconds of battery life. That might not sound like a lot, but keep in mind this slapdash device relies on nearly 20-year-old batteries from an iPod dock. The fact that it can even run at all on just those ancient chemical husks is incredible. And if you were then wondering, “<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/steel-battalion">Can this thing play <em>Steel Battalion</em></a>?” well, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W3OK9A_RbSI?t=1964">Yes, it can.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The upcoming retro-inspired brawler <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is one of the coolest-looking Marvel games in years. And now we know the identities of two more Marvel characters who will be joining the pixelated action when <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> launches later this year. One of them is a very popular character you are likely familiar with, and the other is Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced in March</a> during a Nintendo Direct, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is a side-scrolling 2D pixel-art beat ’em up being developed by Tribute Games. That’s the team behind <em>Mercenary Kings</em> and the totally rad <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler. <em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past work, looks to be another snappy and action-packed retro throwback that I’ll be playing over and over with friends. We’ll all have a huge roster of characters to pick from, as Tribute and Marvel have confirmed that <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/17/black-panther-cosmic-ghost-rider-join-marvel-cosmic-invasion/#:~:text=In%20Marvel%20Cosmic%20Invasion%2C%20one%20of%20our%20biggest%20features%20is%20our%20playable%20character%20roster%20boasting%2015%20Super%20Heroes!">15 heroes</a> will be available at launch. And now we know two more names that have made the cut: Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p> <p>On September 17, Tribute put out a trailer showing off the newly announced<em> Cosmic Invasion</em> characters, which you can watch below:</p>

  <p>I likely don’t need to explain who Black Panther is to most people reading a video game website in 2025. The character has appeared in multiple games, movies, and award-winning comics and has become extremely popular, thanks in large part to the fantastic performance delivered by the late Chadwick Boseman in the MCU. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Ghost_Rider">Cosmic Ghost Rider</a> is a bit more obscure and quite an odd duck. The short version is that he’s an alt-universe version of The Punisher that died and became the Ghost Rider and then met up with Galactus, who made him his Herald aka his new Silver Surfer basically. Yeah, it’s weird. But hey, he’s literally got Cosmic in his name, so he seems like a fine choice for <em>Cosmic Invasion.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Every character confirmed for <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></h2> <p>Here are all the <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> characters that have been officially revealed so far. As mentioned, the full roster will include 15 people, so after today’s reveal, that leaves just three more heroes left to unveil.</p>

 <ul> <li>Captain America</li> <li>Spider-Man</li> <li>Venom</li> <li>Wolverine</li> <li>Storm</li> <li>Phyla-Vell</li> <li>Nova</li> <li>Rocket Raccoon</li> <li>She-Hulk</li> <li>Beta Ray Bill</li> <li>Silver Surfer</li> <li>Black Panther</li> <li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li> </ul> <p>It makes sense that the game will feature a huge roster, as the big gimmick in<em> Cosmic Invasion</em> is that <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">everyone picks two characters</a> that you can then swap between while playing. This means that if four players join the game, you’ll be rolling into fights with eight Marvel characters. Good luck to all the random, nameless goons trying to fight Venom, Storm, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Black Panther.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> looks great and sounds like a blast based on previews</a> of the upcoming brawler. We still don’t have a specific release date for the game yet beyond 2025. Hopefully it lands soon, though maybe not in October. That month is already a mess.</p>
