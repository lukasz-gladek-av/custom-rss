Flash forward to today and that<em> Fallen Order </em>sequel, <em>Jedi:</em> <em>Survivor</em>, launched in 2023.

However, we’ve not heard much about the strategy game. Now, thanks to some leaked screenshots, we have a better idea of what to expect. I hope you like <em>XCOM</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As first reported by <em>MP1st</em></a></span>, a Bit Reactor artist shared some screenshots of the upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> game via their online portfolio. The screenshots indicate that Bit Reactor’s  game is known internally as <em>Star Wars Bruno. </em></p><figure id="" data-id="151f2ef84f56471359bdb827d7d47c92" data-recommend-id="image://151f2ef84f56471359bdb827d7d47c92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Lucasfilm / MP1st / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="151f2ef84f56471359bdb827d7d47c92" data-recommend-id="image://151f2ef84f56471359bdb827d7d47c92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The screenshots are dated to 2023, so it’s very likely that Project <em>Bruno </em>looks different in 2025. Still, based on the screenshots it appears that <em>Bruno </em>is heavily inspired by <em>XCOM</em>. In the screenshots we can see characters like Bo Katan taking cover while aiming at an enemy. Above that enemy’s head is a hit chance percentage. Another screenshot shows two characters entering “overwatch,” aka that mode in <em>XCOM </em>where your soldiers take out any alien that enters their line of sight.</p><p>Of course, it’s possible that two years later <em>Bruno</em> has changed a lot. But I’d bet a few of my Lego <em>Star Wars</em> ships that the upcoming game is still very <em>XCOM</em>-influenced.

It ain’t shocking that their first big <em>Star Wars</em> game is similar to <em>XCOM</em>. And I’m excited about that. I’ve grown tired of every new<em> Star Wars </em>game being a shooter or a third-person action thing.

The release date announcement came as part of a Cinemacon presentation, which included the first footage from the film. Unfortunately, I can’t show you that because it was not released to the public.

Jobst said the following in a May 2021 video about Mitchell:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> He also sued YouTuber Apollo Legend for $1,000,000. I haven’t spoken about this publicly but this lawsuit ultimately ended with Apollo giving in and settling with Mitchell. He was forced to remove all his videos about Mitchell’s cheating and paid him a large sum of money. This left him deeply in debt, which required him to find extra work, but with his ongoing health issues this was all too much of a burden and he ultimately took his own life. Not that Billy Mitchell would ever care, though. In fact, when Billy Mitchell thought Apollo died earlier he expressed joy at the thought. The lawsuit against Apollo was just as frivolous as the rest and Apollo definitely would have won in court, but again he was extremely ill and couldn’t handle the ongoing stress.</p></blockquote><p>It has since been revealed that no money changed hands as part of Mitchell’s settlement with Smith. The YouTuber was forced to remove several videos about the cheating saga, but only had to pay potential damages if he published on the subject again. Jobst ended up retracting the claim about Smith going into debt as a result of the settlement, but the court found that Jobst’s ongoing behavior around the topic continued contributing to reputational harm against Mitchell. (The former world champion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/billy-mitchell-donkey-kong-cheating-doctor-twin-1849511774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/billy-mitchell-donkey-kong-cheating-doctor-twin-1849511774">previously claimed his doctor would no longer see him</a></span> on account of the cheating accusations.)</p><p>The judge in the defamation case, Ken Barlow, concluded the following:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Mr. Jobst defamed Mr. Mitchell by making all the imputations that Mr. Mitchell alleged; (b) Mr. Mitchell has suffered significant personal and reputational harm as a consequence; (c) although he had the previous reputations alleged by Mr. Jobst, and the defamatory video raised other substantially true contextual imputations about him, Mr. Mitchell suffered substantially more personal and reputational harm as a consequence of Mr. Jobst’s imputations about which Mr. Mitchell complains; (d) Mr. Jobst’s conduct since the first publication of the video, including during this proceeding, has been aggravating and has caused additional personal hurt and reputational damage to Mr. Mitchell.</p></blockquote><p>As a result, Jobst has been ordered to pay the former <em>Donkey Kong</em> champion $300,000 in non-economic damages, $50,000 in aggravated damages, and over $40,000 in interest, which amounts to roughly $275,000 in U.S. dollars. “Nothing like the smell of victory in the evening air,” Mitchell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BillyPacman/status/1906918050705862943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BillyPacman/status/1906918050705862943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span>. “Billy Mitchell always has a plan.

I am grateful.”</p><p>Jobst, however, is now facing scrutiny by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1joixt4/billy_mitchell_wins_lawsuit_against_youtuber_karl/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1joixt4/billy_mitchell_wins_lawsuit_against_youtuber_karl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some who were confused</a></span> that the judge’s verdict ultimately didn’t come down to claims about whether Mitchell cheated. “I lost,” Jobst wrote on X. “The judge found Billy to be a credible witness and believed his entire testimony. From that point on unfortunately there was really nothing that could have saved me. I will now obviously consider my options.  I know many of you will be upset with this and I am sorry for that. Thank you again for all the support I have received and I will endeavor to work as hard as I can to repay all that you are owed.”</p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/karl-jobst-legal-defence-fund&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/karl-jobst-legal-defence-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gofundme campaign</a></span> to pay for Jobst’s defense after a second lawsuit from Mitchell had been filed against him raised over $200,000 AUD. “Last year, Billy Mitchell, star of <em>The King of Kong</em> and proven video game cheater, sued me for defamation,” reads the description. “These lawsuits are unhinged and it is highly likely Billy will ultimately lose, but until we go to trial it requires a lot of money to deal with. I would appreciate any help that you are able to provide, as this affects not only me but my family as well. Obviously it’s bad enough to attack me when I’ve done nothing wrong, but to injure them as well takes things to another level.” </p><p>But some now feel the way Jobst repeatedly talked about the lawsuit on his YouTube channel, including one video titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUdKSLjwZTo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUdKSLjwZTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheater Billy Mitchell Just Keeps Losing</a></span>,” misled viewers into thinking the trial was primarily about the cheating allegations. The videos include comments of people donating to his channel specifically over Smith’s death. “There are a lot of lies being spread that I falsely claimed Billy sued me because I said he cheated,” Jobst <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/karljobstgaming/status/1906936348189290503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/karljobstgaming/status/1906936348189290503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> continued on X</a></span> after losing the lawsuit. “I never claimed this, I only claimed it was relevant as part of my defense.”</p><p>He added that his total legal fees “are well over $600k,” and that he hadn’t used the court case to try to drum up donations.  “But the criticism that I should have been more transparent is valid and I’m sorry,” he added. “Truthfully I didn’t want to repeat or mention any claims regarding Apollo Legend because it may have jeopardized my defense.  I never intentionally lied regarding Apollo Legend either. I relied on incorrect information from multiple sources. I retracted the statements once I confirmed it was inaccurate but apparently it was not sufficient.”</p><p>. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
