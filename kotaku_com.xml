Then Mythical Island dropped later that month, followed by Space-Time Smackdown in late January.

It definitely doesn’t seem fake, but I share the rest of the sentiment. I’ve fallen off <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> pretty hard in recent weeks, in part because it feels like my pulls in  Space-Time Smackdown have been demonstrably worse on average than when the game first came out. I’m not getting as many of those dopamine bursts from finding rare cards, and my list of Wonder Picks to choose from has been pretty garbage too. </p><p>Maybe a better battle meta can fix some of that malaise.

Competitive play has been requested since launch, and it would certainly give players something new to grind for, especially if there are decent rewards for hitting new ranks besides just bragging rights or trophy emblems. Though some players are already cracking jokes. “Competitive coin flipping,” wrote one fans. “What a time to be alive.”</p><p>One thing we do know is that <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will not be part of the  Pokémon World Championship anytime soon. “At this time there are no plans for <em>Pokémon Pocket </em>to join, but we’re always looking at things,” director of esports for the franchise Chris Brown <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/no-plans-to-add-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-competitive-circuit-says-the-pokemon-compnay/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/no-plans-to-add-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-competitive-circuit-says-the-pokemon-compnay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in an interview last week</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Meanwhile, the once-feared Mewtwo ex had dropped to merely 2.1 percent. Darkrai ex’s rise to prominence isn’t because it hits hard or has a ton of HP—instead, it’s how it fits into the ways Space-Time Smackdown has changed the competitive landscape of the game, rendering many previously viable strategies borderline obsolete.</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here, so check out our breakdown below to understand just why Darkrai ex has spiked so hard in popularity.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: No matter how much I may or may not hype up any cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, I <em>do not </em>encourage you to spend money on the game, even if you have cash to spare. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">This is a gacha game at its core</a></span>, and with that comes aggressive psychological manipulation to encourage you to spend more than you normally would.

Whenever you place a Dark Energy from your Energy Zone on Darkrai ex, it will immediately inflict 20 damage on your opponent’s active Pokémon. Because this is an <em>ability</em> and not an <em>attack</em>, this will bypass damage reduction effects like Melmetal’s Hard Coat ability or counterattacks like Druddigon’s Rough Skin. <strong>Most importantly, Nightmare Aura works while Darkrai ex is on the bench</strong>. This means that, with the right setup, Darkrai ex can consistently boost your damage output by 20 per turn. That might not sound like a lot, but when cards like Giovanni can completely change the tide of a game by adding 10 damage to a single attack, you can imagine how Darkrai ex can swing matches in your favor.</p><p>Yet as mentioned above, Darkrai ex itself is only a small slice of why it’s so widely used. It’s how it synergizes with Space-Time Smackdown’s new Trainer Cards that make it so evil.</p><figure id="" data-id="89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-recommend-id="image://89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-recommend-id="image://89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h1155"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Trainer Cards to use with Darkrai ex</strong></h2><p>Two new Trainer Cards in particular elevate Darkrai ex to especially dangerous heights. The first of these is <strong>Dawn</strong>, which lets you transfer one Energy from your benched Pokémon to your active Pokémon. <strong>It’s a useful card in isolation, but also a fantastic tool if you want to activate Darkrai’s Nightmare Aura ability from the bench <em>and </em>build up your active pokemon so it can attack too</strong>. This pairs especially well with low Energy cards like Weezing and Weavile ex, both of which require only one Energy to attack.</p><p>The biggest game-changer, though, is <strong>Cyrus</strong>. In fact, <strong>Cyrus is arguably <em>the</em> most meta-shifting card in Space-Time Smackdown, even beyond Darkrai ex</strong>. The way it works is simple: if your opponent has a Pokémon on their bench that has taken damage, you can swap it to the active slot. Prior to Space-Time Smackdown’s release, decks loaded with ex cards thrived because players could retreat strategically. After all, it doesn’t matter if ex cards are worth two points upon being knocked out if you can deny your opponent the chance to finish them off. Now that dynamic is turned on its head; if your opponent has an ex Pokémon with low health on their bench, you can plan on claiming those two points the moment you draw a Cyrus.</p><figure id="" data-id="d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-recommend-id="image://d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-recommend-id="image://d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be clear, attacking a weak benched monster wasn’t <em>impossible </em>before. Cyrus just makes it a <em>lot </em>easier, and it slots into any deck.</p><p>Darkrai ex’s synergy with Cyrus is two-fold. On one hand, it allows you to use Cyrus on an opponent’s Pokémon with only 10 to 20 HP remaining, knock it out with Nightmare Aura, and then use your active Pokémon’s attack on whoever your opponent decides to switch in afterwards. Conversely, <strong>because Darkrai ex is ideally kept on the bench until the late game, it isn’t as vulnerable to a surprise Cyrus switch-in</strong>. Keep it at full health on your bench, make sure you have at least one other Pokémon in reserve in case your opponent has Sabrina, and wait until you’re already down two points before putting Darkrai ex in to clean up the rest of the game.</p><p>Caption: An image of the Giant Cape Pokémon Tool Trainer Card from <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>.</p><p>This isn’t even getting into the new <strong>Pokémon Tool </strong>cards, which can be equipped on Pokémon to either boost their max HP or inflict damage on opponents when they attack. Both of these effects favor tactics that stall the game and encourage chip damage, which Darkrai ex fits into perfectly. You have a perfect storm of ways that Darkrai ex decks can sweep the floor with virtually any opponent.</p><h2 id="h1156"><a id=""></a><strong>Darkrai ex fits into virtually any dark-type deck</strong></h2><p>Darkrai ex is one of the first Dark-type ex cards added to the game, and I’d go as far as to say it makes any Dark-type deck better. Whether you use it with Weezing, Weavile ex, or even Arbok, it adds so much to your team and leaves very little room for your opponent to exploit it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the latter got two DLCs the following year, we haven’t had a new <em>Pokemon </em>RPG in almost three years. February 27 is Pokémon Day, which means The Pokémon Company is about to share what the franchise has coming down the pipeline. So what better time to revisit the best and worst <em>Pokémon </em>games? Here’s our ranking of the mainline <em>Pokémon </em>RPGs, within which I’m sure you will find nothing objectionable.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71f66b4197020860cf2a4112e91c2aca" data-recommend-id="image://71f66b4197020860cf2a4112e91c2aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1358" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dawn and Ethan are shown walking forward with Torterra, Infernape, Empoleon, Palkia, Dialga, Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, Cynthia, and Cyrus all posed behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dawn and Ethan are shown walking forward with Torterra, Infernape, Empoleon, Palkia, Dialga, Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, Cynthia, and Cyrus all posed behind them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Shining Pearl </em>are fine remakes, but play it so safe that they don’t feel quite as magical as the source material.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71f66b4197020860cf2a4112e91c2aca" data-recommend-id="image://71f66b4197020860cf2a4112e91c2aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1358" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dawn and Ethan are shown walking forward with Torterra, Infernape, Empoleon, Palkia, Dialga, Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, Cynthia, and Cyrus all posed behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As remakes of the 2006 DS games, <em>Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Shining Pearl </em>are pretty faithful to the source material. But that same faithfulness holds it back from reaching the potential of a more radical update. These games are colorful, nostalgic, and have a handful of modern quality of life changes that make them at least more approachable than the original games, but they ultimately end up feeling like a missed opportunity to make a more robust update to two great <em>Pokémon</em> titles. This isn’t helped by it being the first of a handful of <em>Pokémon </em>games marred by technical issues not found in the originals. They’re fine! But that’s all they are.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="167c53192a2e12cde846cd72b363dc90" data-recommend-id="image://167c53192a2e12cde846cd72b363dc90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1152" data-height="692" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown preparing to mega evolve Mewtwo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown preparing to mega evolve Mewtwo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Hey, at least we got Mega Evolutions for one generation, right?</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="167c53192a2e12cde846cd72b363dc90" data-recommend-id="image://167c53192a2e12cde846cd72b363dc90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1152" data-height="692" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown preparing to mega evolve Mewtwo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If nothing else, <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y </em>deserve props for introducing the series’ best generational gameplay gimmick in Mega Evolution, and for finally giving a reliable counter to dragon Pokémon by introducing the fairy type. As the mainline games’ first foray into the 3D space, <em>X</em> and <em>Y </em>are a fulcrum point for the franchise, but they’re also filled with a fair bit of quirks that have knocked them down many <em>Pokémon </em>player’s rankings over the years. Its story, held up by a series’ worst evil team in Team Flare, is messy and introduces some pretty wild elements to the universe, including an old man persisting for thousands of years to find his Floette.</p><p>But despite those potentially interesting threads, it never feels like it quite lives up to the promise. Maybe one day we’ll get a <em>Pokémon Legends</em> game set in the Kalos region that will expand upon these ideas, but for now, <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>is a pretty significant moment in the series, but one that is often viewed as a breaking point for its usual formula. Fortunately, the generations that followed were more experimental with the structures of a <em>Pokémon </em>game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5777dfdcb623168f4ee02d402a536f18" data-recommend-id="image://5777dfdcb623168f4ee02d402a536f18" data-format="jpg" data-width="579" data-height="321" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown encountering a wild Pikachu and preparing to battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown encountering a wild Pikachu and preparing to battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>The Gen I games are where it all began, which means things have only gotten better, since.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5777dfdcb623168f4ee02d402a536f18" data-recommend-id="image://5777dfdcb623168f4ee02d402a536f18" data-format="jpg" data-width="579" data-height="321" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown encountering a wild Pikachu and preparing to battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As much as the genwunners might hate to hear it, the original <em>Pokémon </em>games are rough to go back to in light of over two decades of iteration. <em>Pokémon Red</em>, <em>Blue</em>, <em>Green</em>, and <em>Yellow </em>are the blueprint for one of the biggest multimedia franchises on the planet, and a lot of us have childhood memories that center around those Game Boy cartridges. But having replayed <em>Yellow </em>recently on my 3DS, it’s jarring when quality of life staples are missing (like a run button) and old annoyances like HMs are still so prevalent. It’s still refreshing to go back to basics: there are 800 fewer Pokémon, the competitive scene isn’t this lavish, meta-driven affair, and Team Rocket just wants to steal people’s Pokémon for profit instead of recreating an entire universe to their liking. It was a simpler time, but things have clearly improved from a game design standpoint since. We’ll always love you, Gen I, but there are better ways to experience you, and we’ll be ranking them higher on this list.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7376f66d57e0ea84c7d1e21f99ed1ca" data-recommend-id="image://f7376f66d57e0ea84c7d1e21f99ed1ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1085" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Several trainers and wild Pokémon are shown gathered on a cliffside overlooking the Alolan ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Several trainers and wild Pokémon are shown gathered on a cliffside overlooking the Alolan ocean." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Sun </em>and <em>Moon </em>brought a distinct culture through the introduction of the Alolan region.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7376f66d57e0ea84c7d1e21f99ed1ca" data-recommend-id="image://f7376f66d57e0ea84c7d1e21f99ed1ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1085" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Several trainers and wild Pokémon are shown gathered on a cliffside overlooking the Alolan ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>brought the best gameplay gimmick, <em>Sun </em>and <em>Moon </em>bring probably the least memorable one with Z-Moves. Other mechanical twists like Mega Evolution and Gigantamaxing have the benefit of form changes and battle-long impact, whereas Z-Moves haven’t had the same impact on the community because they’re just more powerful moves you get to use once, then they’re over. But while <em>Sun </em>and <em>Moon</em>’s battle mechanics aren’t quite as flashy as other games on this list, the tropical region of Alola is fascinating in its distinct culture, shift in format away from the typical eight gym battles, and introduction to new concepts like regional variants.<br></p><p>These new takes on old ‘mons illustrate how real world phenomena like speciation can occur in distinct regions, and Alolan’s Hawaii-inspired setting is a great place to debut the concept and add new layers to the franchise moving forward. <em>Ultra Sun </em>and <em>Ultra Moon </em>iterate on the original games’ systems, and add new content to further the story of the Ultra Beasts, but even to this day it can be confusing to decide which one you should actually play and what the benefits are to playing either (or both). Alola was a great era of experimentation in <em>Pokémon</em>, and its strides have helped inform further shifts from old formulas and form distinct regions and culture within the universe. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="502ec92db9bdf8ac3855a982b6e0091d" data-recommend-id="image://502ec92db9bdf8ac3855a982b6e0091d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groudon and Kyoger are shown battling where the sea and earth meet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groudon and Kyoger are shown battling where the sea and earth meet." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em> recontextualized Groudon and Kyogre through Primal Reversion.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="502ec92db9bdf8ac3855a982b6e0091d" data-recommend-id="image://502ec92db9bdf8ac3855a982b6e0091d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groudon and Kyoger are shown battling where the sea and earth meet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Omega Ruby </em>and <em>Alpha Sapphire </em>are more along the lines of what people likely wanted out of the <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>remakes. These are beefy reimaginings that riff on the original <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire</em> by making them feel decidedly modern. This includes the visual update that shifts over to 3D models and environments comparable to <em>X </em>and <em>Y</em>, implementing mechanics like Mega Evolution, and adding a pretty dense post-game storyline called the Delta Episode, which manages to add major players in the Hoenn like Rayquaza and Deoxys into the story in a meaningful way. <em>Omega Ruby </em>and <em>Alpha Sapphire </em>are solid revamps of already great games, and revisiting them now just makes <em>Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Shining Pearl</em>’s relative restraint sting all the more.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6710211f06ad77517a064ce4ad8af7b" data-recommend-id="image://a6710211f06ad77517a064ce4ad8af7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arven, Nemona, Penny, and a Pokémon trainer are shown flying on Miraidon's back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arven, Nemona, Penny, and a Pokémon trainer are shown flying on Miraidon's back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Scarlet </em>and<em> Violet’s</em> open world is ambitious, but the game caves under it on a few fronts.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6710211f06ad77517a064ce4ad8af7b" data-recommend-id="image://a6710211f06ad77517a064ce4ad8af7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arven, Nemona, Penny, and a Pokémon trainer are shown flying on Miraidon's back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The main reason <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>aren’t higher on this list is that, as of this writing, these games are still pretty busted. As the first fully open-world entry in the series, they are some of the most ambitious <em>Pokémon </em>games in terms of design (though, I’d argue the ambition felt a bit reckless in some of its open-world feeling more arbitrary and lacking clarity), and their endgame is easily a highlight of the entire franchise. </p><p>But man, they’re still buggy as hell, and central to conversations about the technical capabilities of the Switch, though other developers have made better-looking games sing on the hardware. <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>have so much incredible stuff going for them, like their series-best storytelling, seamless co-op, and, the thrill of freely exploring an entire <em>Pokémon </em>region (even if it’s rough around the edges). Hopefully the reaction to these technical problems can be a wake-up call for whatever comes next.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1f2fdce8ec1d7eace516bec5733156ef" data-recommend-id="image://1f2fdce8ec1d7eace516bec5733156ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer and Hop are seen riding on a train and looking at their phones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer and Hop are seen riding on a train and looking at their phones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>They’re learning type matchups.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f2fdce8ec1d7eace516bec5733156ef" data-recommend-id="image://1f2fdce8ec1d7eace516bec5733156ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer and Hop are seen riding on a train and looking at their phones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield </em>are so mired in the National Dex controversy that it feels like it eclipses conversations about what the games actually are. And that’s a pretty solid pair of games that introduced modes and features that became standard in future titles. The Wild Area is a decent enough proof of concept for what would become the open areas of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, and they bring <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s raid battles to the mainline games, which became a staple for post-launch support. Gigantamaxing is a bit silly, but come on, Pokémon kaiju battles are pretty cool.<br></p><p>The A-plot is one of the series’ weakest, with its environmentalist themes getting wrapped up in some strange character motivations that fans are still reeling from, but it also provides some of the series’ most iconic new characters like Galar champion Leon, his 100% canonical boyfriend Raihan, and Nessa, who came to steal Misty’s throne as the water-training queen of the Pokémon world. Like Sun and Moon before them, Sword and Shield feel like hints at changing times for Pokémon, and while they don’t land every note, they aspire to new things, and helped pave the way for better games that followed. Oh, and the DLC whips. Peony is the GOAT.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5af805f5ea978fc3f9aab3a8a0b49a7e" data-recommend-id="image://5af805f5ea978fc3f9aab3a8a0b49a7e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen confronting N with Reshiram and Zekrom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen confronting N with Reshiram and Zekrom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Black</em> and<em> White</em> made bold decisions on what Pokémon players were allowed to use, which was divisive, at the time.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5af805f5ea978fc3f9aab3a8a0b49a7e" data-recommend-id="image://5af805f5ea978fc3f9aab3a8a0b49a7e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen confronting N with Reshiram and Zekrom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>had some of the best writing in the series, <em>Black </em>and <em>White </em>are probably the <em>Pokémon </em>games most often recognized for their story. Similar to the recent <em>Detective PIkachu </em>movie, a lot of <em>Black </em>and <em>White </em>questions the ethics around the very basis of the franchise. Is it okay that humans use these critters for competitive sport? Should they be kept inside Pokéballs? Is humanity and Pokémon’s co-existence only beneficial to humans at the expense of Pokémon’s freedom? They grapple with these ideas and don’t quite reach a conclusion as revolutionary as the questions themselves, but they are more contemplative than the usual “power of friendship” status quo the series often rests on. They also take some bold choices in Pokémon selection, only allowing players to capture old favorites after they went the entire game using the new ones. Now, if only the Unova region’s Pokémon weren’t <em>the worst</em>. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="279676f747a0b14b9f6aabbe1d9e5b50" data-recommend-id="image://279676f747a0b14b9f6aabbe1d9e5b50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="745" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown petting Pikachu on the head as it sits on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown petting Pikachu on the head as it sits on a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Any game that lets you pet Pikachu throughout gets at least a few placements higher on this list.</figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="279676f747a0b14b9f6aabbe1d9e5b50" data-recommend-id="image://279676f747a0b14b9f6aabbe1d9e5b50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="745" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown petting Pikachu on the head as it sits on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu </em>and <em>Let’s Go Eevee </em>seems to have just been a one-off experiment. On the surface, the remakes of <em>Pokémon Yellow</em> appear to be a <em>Pokémon Go </em>tie-in for your Switch. But their retooling of the series’ usual catching mechanics in favor of <em>Pokemon Go</em>-style motion controls makes a 20-year-old RPG feel fresh, and isa nice, focused detour before heading into <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em>, which expands the lore and competitive scene. While going back to the original Gen I games will give you that same focused experience, the <em>Let’s Go </em>games are an inventive, modern take that let you dress up Pikachu and give him good pets.

The transition to 3D hasn’t been kind to <em>Pokémon </em>across the board, and looking back at games like <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire</em>, it’s hard not to wonder what more recent entries would’ve looked like had the series not made the shift to 3D. But <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire</em> also have a really strong generation of new Pokémon, introduce the double battles that would go on to be the basis of competitive play 20 years on, and start to hint at an ever-expanding universe that future games would go on to fill in.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e86e5d5e54e01ef3e915c607c2d0b44a" data-recommend-id="image://e86e5d5e54e01ef3e915c607c2d0b44a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ho-oh's silhouette is seen as it flies high in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ho-oh's silhouette is seen as it flies high in the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Gold</em> and <em>Silver’s</em> post-game ambition hasn’t been replicated in any game since.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e86e5d5e54e01ef3e915c607c2d0b44a" data-recommend-id="image://e86e5d5e54e01ef3e915c607c2d0b44a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ho-oh's silhouette is seen as it flies high in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver </em>set the bar for <em>Pokémon </em>post-games that a majority of these titles haven’t even dared to touch. The second generation games introduce a hundred new Pokémon, new typings, and a brand new region to explore in Johto. Then, after the credits roll, the entirety of the previous games’ map opens up, and you have basically a second game waiting for you. All of this culminates in a final battle that still remains legendary in the <em>Pokémon </em>community…then Game Freak just never did it again. It’s not like that would be an easy undertaking, but it set an expectation the company never again attempted to meet. These days, the original <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em> fall short in the way most old games do, with new iterations and improvements making them feel decidedly dated and less fun to play. But its ambition, especially for its time, can’t be overstated. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f97a51e1232e4d6a1553d0256a86d033" data-recommend-id="image://f97a51e1232e4d6a1553d0256a86d033" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two Pokémon trainers are shown in front of a mockup of a DS screen playing Pokémon Black 2 and White 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Pokémon trainers are shown in front of a mockup of a DS screen playing Pokémon Black 2 and White 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Black 2</em> and <em>White 2</em> were the last Pokémon games on the original DS.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f97a51e1232e4d6a1553d0256a86d033" data-recommend-id="image://f97a51e1232e4d6a1553d0256a86d033" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two Pokémon trainers are shown in front of a mockup of a DS screen playing Pokémon Black 2 and White 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As previously established, Unova is not my favorite region and <em>Black </em>and <em>White</em> aren’t my favorite <em>Pokémon </em>games. So, when Game Freak announced it was making its first (and, as of this writing, only) direct sequel, I wasn’t particularly enticed by <em>Black 2 </em>and <em>White 2</em>. However, while they’re often iterative of their predecessors, these games are widely considered some of the most robust and feature-complete games in the franchise. Taking a second trip back to Unova is rewarding to learn more about this side of the <em>Pokémon </em>universe, but it also is probably the last pure <em>Pokémon </em>experience before things like Mega Evolution and Terastalyzing started to alter how battles would play out both in the main game and in the competitive meta. It’s just a really solid <em>Pokémon </em>experience, and, for a lot of people, feels like the last bastion for a type of <em>Pokémon </em>game that might not exist anymore.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="92fcb1b2cd72fc94f7dee6ea24fad656" data-recommend-id="image://92fcb1b2cd72fc94f7dee6ea24fad656" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1270" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>revealed more about the creation of the <em>Pokémon</em> world by focusing on the Pokémon who created it.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="92fcb1b2cd72fc94f7dee6ea24fad656" data-recommend-id="image://92fcb1b2cd72fc94f7dee6ea24fad656" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1270" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Generation IV is where <em>Pokémon’s </em>world began to really take shape. Sure, <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire </em>introduce the gods of the earth, sea, and sky, but <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> starts to answer questions of where this world came from. The Sinnoh region is the origin point of the <em>Pokémon </em>universe, and the concepts it introduces make the world feel more vast and unknowable than it had at the time. These ideas are expanded upon in <em>Platinum</em>, which establishes further truths about how the <em>Pokémon </em>world came to be. <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>are the mythology sickos’ <em>Pokemon </em>games, but from a gameplay standpoint, they also offer some of the series’ most infamous challenges. Cynthia’s theme still sends chills up the spine of everyone who hears it as they recount what it was like to face her iconic team and Garchomp ace. Whether you’re here to learn more about the <em>Pokémon </em>world or tackle some of the most challenging fights the series has to offer, <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>are mainstays in the <em>Pokémon </em>canon.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f3903729b19930dbf43cd50f31bec4c" data-recommend-id="image://3f3903729b19930dbf43cd50f31bec4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen smiling at the sky in an open temple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen smiling at the sky in an open temple." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>By sending players back into the past, <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>told a radically different story.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f3903729b19930dbf43cd50f31bec4c" data-recommend-id="image://3f3903729b19930dbf43cd50f31bec4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen smiling at the sky in an open temple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For some, <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>might feel like an empty tech demo, but it also marks the most significant, refreshing leap forward the series has had in over a decade. Its open-world structure isn’t as seamless as <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but it’s more fluid, frictionless, and frightening to explore. <em>Legends: Arceus </em>uses its historic setting to free itself from the shackles of the series’ usual competitive sport, allowing both it and the player to explore new stories, mechanics, and structures. Its traversal feels incredible, its action-oriented systems feel like they remove rigid restrictions that once were part and parcel ofthe <em>Pokémon </em>franchise, and without the Pokémon League to get in the way, it explores the origins of the universe unbound by the series’ usual composition. </p><p><br>It is what I, and many other lore-driven fans, wanted out of <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, and frankly, from the series for a long time. Its maps may not be as lively as other open-world games, but thanks to the stories it tells and the connections it allows you to create as a trainer surviving alongside their Pokémon, <em>Pok</em>é<em>mon Legends: Arceus</em> is the most alive the franchise has felt in quite some time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f703a66e41a704d67d853e45ed0cfaed" data-recommend-id="image://f703a66e41a704d67d853e45ed0cfaed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard and Venusaur are seen posed in front of a red and green background alongside the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen logos." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charizard and Venusaur are seen posed in front of a red and green background alongside the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen logos." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>FireRed</em> and<em> LeafGreen</em> are still the definitive Kanto experience.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f703a66e41a704d67d853e45ed0cfaed" data-recommend-id="image://f703a66e41a704d67d853e45ed0cfaed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard and Venusaur are seen posed in front of a red and green background alongside the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen logos." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While the original Generation I games set the stage for what would come, their Generation III remakes are the definitive place to play through that original journey. <em>FireRed </em>and <em>LeafGreen</em> bring players back to the region of Kanto to re-experience the first <em>Pokémon </em>journey. This was significant in 2004, because it was long before remakes became a staple of the franchise’s business model.<br></p><p>At the time, going back to Kanto in the remakes felt like such a drastic refresh that it was like seeing that setting as you’d imagined it at a younger age. On top of the visual update, <em>FireRed </em>and <em>LeafGreen</em> give the games a contemporary overhaul by adding quality of life changes like the run button, including modern mechanics like breeding, abilities, and cross-gen trading, and swaths of new content to really fill out the package. It is, to this day, the best way to travel through the original Kanto region. It might not have that same classic nostalgia tied to it the way <em>Red </em>and <em>Blue </em>does or have the novelty of <em>Let’s Go Pikachu </em>and <em>Let’s Go Eevee</em>, but it is the definitive Kanto game. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6d1e7a185dc3eed18b00d02e58fd6e3" data-recommend-id="image://a6d1e7a185dc3eed18b00d02e58fd6e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ho-oh and Lugia are shown in front of gold and silver backgrounds alongside the Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver logos." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ho-oh and Lugia are shown in front of gold and silver backgrounds alongside the Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver logos." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>The <em>Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em> remakes perfected the originals’ ambitious endgame.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6d1e7a185dc3eed18b00d02e58fd6e3" data-recommend-id="image://a6d1e7a185dc3eed18b00d02e58fd6e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ho-oh and Lugia are shown in front of gold and silver backgrounds alongside the Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver logos." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All those things I just said about <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> apply to <em>HeartGold</em> and <em>SoulSilver</em>, the remakes of <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em> that launched on the DS. If you’re building off one of the most ambitious games <em>Pokémon </em>has ever had but with better tech and design, you’re bound to come up with a marquee <em>Pokémon </em>game. <em>HeartGold </em>and <em>SoulSilver</em> stand the test of time by polishing what was already one of the series’ most impressive feats. They take everything the original <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver </em>aspired to and wipe away the dust, allowing them to shine beyond so many other <em>Pokémon </em>games over a decade later. While <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>and <em>Legends: Arceus </em>have been taking the series in new, exciting directions, <em>HeartGold </em>and <em>SoulSilver</em> feels like the perfection of what came before it. In retrospect, it makes sense that the games that followed all seemed to be, in one way or another, trying to carve a new path for the series, because when you’ve finally nailed what you set out to do initially, the only place to go is somewhere new.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
