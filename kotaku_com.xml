That won’t be a huge problem later on, for reasons we’ll get into, but at the outset, it means blowing a lot of AP on things that aren’t the major skills you need to do the real damage. So, anything you can slap onto your characters to keep them flush with AP is gonna be your best friend. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sciel-foretell-twilight-1851780506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sciel-foretell-twilight-1851780506">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Sciel In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>Thankfully, aside from an obvious resistance to Light, they don’t have any other major restrictions.

Feel free to take out all four, but if you’ve got the reflexes, <strong>you can keep one lamp alive just to parry that shot for massive damage</strong>. </p><p>Aside from that, Lampmaster’s got a fairly basic move set of combos and jump attacks. The big issue is that there’s so many goddamn arms that it’s hard to figure out where the hit’s coming from. The easy tip is that <strong>only one of the arms is holding the sword, but even that can be hard to see at this stage thanks to the dark background</strong>. Still, if you can get a visual grasp on it, that’s what you’re keying off of.</p><p>The only other move of note is an energy blast where the lights in their hands turn purple and they hit you with a wave of Dark energy. The dodge timing on that is that it’s hitting after the second gathering of purple energy. Go with the visual cue on that.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>Aside from those, they have no weaknesses and is only resistant to Light.

Here, <strong>their sword combo is now four hits and has some genuinely weird delays and timing that makes it hard to dodge</strong>. Best we can tell you there is that <strong>their sword will shake a little before the first hit swings down; and the big delay is between the second and third hits</strong>. The good news is it’s easier to see them against the new backdrop, and no individual hit in the combo is dangerous on its own, just <strong>try your damndest not to eat all four strikes</strong>. They also get a second four-hit combo that’s easier to dodge, but the final hit has them flying backwards to charge at you. <strong>There’s a subtle audio cue when the charge is coming, and it’s easily parried.

But here’s a better idea: Stop them from pulling that shit in the first place. <strong>Just before he busts out the new sword, you’ll get a message about them performing a strange ritual with their lamps. The lamps in their hand will glow red in a particular order. Your job is to shoot those four lamps in Free Aim in that exact order</strong>. Get it right, and <em>Sword of Light never happens</em>, and you do a nice chunk of damage to Lampmaster in the process. They also have a Ball of Light attack that telegraphs itself from a mile away, but you’ll need to jump the attack. </p><figure id="" data-id="9f10394982c62208b317b0553794557e" data-recommend-id="image://9f10394982c62208b317b0553794557e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel prepares an attack on the Lampmaster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sciel prepares an attack on the Lampmaster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f10394982c62208b317b0553794557e" data-recommend-id="image://9f10394982c62208b317b0553794557e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel prepares an attack on the Lampmaster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As before, keep up the steady Burning for passive damage, and unload with everything you have, they’ll go down, but recognizing the dodge on these attacks is crucial. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-maelle-build-stance-virtuose-1851779811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-maelle-build-stance-virtuose-1851779811">A Beginner’s Guide To Maelle In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>When they’re done for, you’ll get the At Death’s Door Picto along with a Shape of Life, some Chroma Catalysts, and some permanent emotional damage once a certain someone shows up and...well, you’ll see.

But this city is actually more bite-sized than you might anticipate by the game’s name, offering a brief but enjoyable romp that doesn’t overstay its welcome.
