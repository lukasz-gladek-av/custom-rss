              <p>Sony’s next <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699">PlayStation showcase</a> might be sooner than some expected. A new State of Play is reportedly planned for later this month pegged to Tokyo Game Show 2025. There’s certainly no shortage of things The PlayStation 5 maker could show-off, including that rumored update on Insomniac Games’ <em>Wolverine</em>.</p> <p>Podcaster and leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1967788911180263523">spilled the beans</a> on X early on Tuesday. It began the night before when people started asking him for information about when Sony’s next showcase would be. “Sony has a presentation soon,” he replied cryptically. Then earlier today he elaborated, “Next week.” NateTheHate’s had a good track record ever since he accurately reported on the Switch 2 reveal earlier this year, and a PlayStation event pegged to Tokyo Game show would make sense.</p> <p>Sega <a href="https://tgs.sega.jp/2025/en/lineup/">recently teased</a> its TGS lineup with four secret slots for unannounced games that are “coming soon.” Capcom, Square Enix, and other Japanese publishers will have a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/square-enix-announces-tgs-2025-lineup-schedule">big presence</a> at the show as well, though fans have already begun speculating about what else could get announced during it. The reported State of Play adds some weight to the possibility of something big, like a tease for<em> Final Fantasy VII</em> remake part three or the rumored <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> remaster. At the very least, we might finally get updates on <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em> and <em>Dragon Quest XII</em>.</p>

 <p>As for what Sony might bring to a State of Play, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer/">Insider Gaming recently</a> reported that the next trailer for Wolverine is complete and all but guaranteed to appear in the next PlayStation State of Play. That would be good news for players waiting to see more of Insomniac’s next Marvel project after years of silence and ahead of a rumored launch in 2026, though a TGS-adjacent showcase also seems like a weird venue to show off new footage compared to, say, The Game Awards.</p> <p>We’re also due for an update on <em>Marathon</em>. Bungie’s extraction shooter was originally scheduled to come out this month before getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">indefinitely delayed</a> following mixed feedback to an alpha test earlier this year. The studio promised fans would get a new release date announced sometime in the fall and Sony has still claimed the live service game will launch before the end of March 2026.</p>

              <p>The Mac Mini is an interesting little product. You get a full Mac computer but for significantly less than a MacBook or the iMac. So long as you got a screen to connect it to, you’re good to go. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">The 2024 Mac Mini powered by the M4 chip normally goes for $599, but right now Amazon has the miniature desktop Mac for $100 off.</a> That 17% discount brings the price down to just $499.</p>

<h2>Tiny But Mighty</h2>
<p>Apple has redesigned the Mac Mini with this 2024 iteration. The footprint is less than half the size of the previous design, measuring in at five by five by two inches. It fits comfortably on any desktop, taking up hardly any space at all. It’s carbon footprint is even smaller. Thanks to the ultracompact design, the Mac Mini is Apple’s first carbon neutral Mac.</p>
<p>A handful of connection options are conveniently found along the front and back of the Mac Mini. You get three thunderbolt ports, two front-facing USB-C ports, an HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet ports, and the headphone jack. That one may no longer be on our iPhones, but lives on at our desks.</p>



<p>MacOS can run all your favorite apps or whatever ones you need to get work done. You get full support for Microsoft 365 as well as the Adobe Creative Cloud software suite such as Photoshop and Premiere.

Apple’s MacOS employs a slew of privacy protections to keep your data from being accessed by anyone but you.</p>
<p>If you have an iPhone or other Apple products, you can get them all to work seamlessly together. View and control what’s on your iPhone from your Mac, or vice versa, with Mirroring. You can copy something from your iPhone and paste it on your Mac. Access you messages or answer FaceTime calls from either device.</p>

              <p>Next year, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-angel-darkness-release-date-1851670508"><em>Tomb Raider</em> franchise</a> turns 30 years old. And while the future of the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:idpr7cxv2u34lmpvap62t7kp/post/3lsypye2edk2v?ref_src=embed">series seems vague</a> at the moment, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949">Amazon saying little about its plans to publish a new game since announcing such in 2022</a>, there are a lot of great <em>Tomb Raider </em>games you can play right now. And thanks to an ongoing Steam sale, you can grab all of the mainline games for under $45.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35801496/sale/preautumn">The <em>Tomb Raider</em> Pre-Autumn Sale started on September 15</a> and goes for the next two weeks. The deal features discounts on most of the franchise that is currently available on Steam. Have you been wanting to play the excellent puzzle game <em>Lara Croft GO</em>? Well, stop waiting and go play it because it’s only $1.50 right now on Steam. Maybe you’ve been meaning to check out that <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-the-kotaku-review-5986619">2013 reboot</a> everyone was buzzing about over a decade ago? I’m not sure why you waited so long, but good news: It’s only $2.25 during the sale.</p> <p>Here’s everything on sale for the next two weeks:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Tomb Raider </em>(2013)</strong> – $2.25 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>Rise of the Tomb Raider </em></strong>– $3 ($30)</li> <li><em><strong>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$8 ($40)</li> <li><em><strong>Tomb Raider: Definitive Survivor Trilogy</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$12 ($91)</li> <li><em><strong>Tomb Raider I-II-III: Remastered</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$12 ($30)</li> <li><em><strong>Tomb Raider IV-V-VI: Remastered</strong> –&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>$15 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Tomb Raider I-VI: Remastered </em>Bundle</strong> – $25 ($55)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: Legend</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$1 ($7)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: Anniversary</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$1 ($9)</li> <li><em><strong>Tomb Raider: Underworld</strong> –</em>$1 ($9)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light</strong> –&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>$1.50 ($10)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$3 ($20)</li> <li><em><strong>Lara Croft GO</strong> –&nbsp;</em>$1.50 ($10)</li> </ul> <p>And if you’re wondering: Here’s how you get all 12 of the mainline games for less than $50. Buy the <em>Definitive Survivor Trilogy</em> bundle, the <em>Remastered</em> bundle, and<em> Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld.&nbsp;</em>If you do it like that, you’ll only pay (not accounting for local taxes) about $42. Not bad! And if you toss the two co-op spin-offs and <em>GO</em> into your cart, you’ll likely be at or just over $50, which is a solid deal for 15 <em>Tomb Raider</em> games, most of which are good to great. Oh, and most of these games play well on a Steam Deck, though be prepared for some fiddlin’ with some of the older titles.</p>
