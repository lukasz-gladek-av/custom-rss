For now, Romero Games is seeking a new publisher to bring its game past the finish line. According to the statement, “several” publishers have reached out to the company about seeing the game through, and the team is “evaluating” its options. So while nothing’s set in stone, it does seem like there’s a chance that some interested party or parties will help salvage the game after Microsoft pulled out of the deal. (The statement itself says it cannot name the publisher due to “confidentiality agreements,” but members of the studio have already stated publicly that they were caught up in the layoffs at Microsoft.)</p><p>Hopefully, whatever Romero Games is working on sees the light of day.

No reason was given for why that didn’t work out. Cleveland, who directed the first game, has now broken his silence, shedding some potential light on a power struggle facing one of 2025's most-anticipated PC releases. </p><p>“We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it,” he wrote on Reddit on Monday. “And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings.” </p><p>According to Cleveland, the sudden upheaval came as a shock. The underwater survival exploration sim was set to come to Steam Early Access at some point later this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479">but as we reported last week</a></span> the cryptic press release from Krafton suggested that might no longer be the case. It alluded to quality controls and a milestone process needed to ensure the game meets player expectations. </p><p>“As part of its oversight, Krafton is committed to achieving regular milestones to assess progress across its creative studios,” the publisher wrote. “These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations.”<br></p><p>Reading between the lines of Cleveland’s Reddit post, it sounds like there was a fundamental disagreement over whether to ship sooner and get<em> Subnautica 2</em> into players’ hands for feedback, or wait  potentially until 2026 to make the game playable to the public. Cleveland and the others sold Unknown Worlds to Krafton in 2021, at which time the publisher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-inc-to-acquire-unknown-worlds-the-developers-behind-subnautica-and-natural-selection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-inc-to-acquire-unknown-worlds-the-developers-behind-subnautica-and-natural-selection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed it would</a></span> continue to “function as an independent game development studio.” I guess in 2025 that means independently of the co-founders.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-1851785764]]></content:encoded>

That led to dinosaurs being brought to the mainland, off their island habitat, and eventually spreading around the world. It was a cool idea that <em>Jurassic World Dominion,</em> the last film in the franchise, never did much with. Dinosaurs spreading around the world is a bonkers idea that could provide you with endless storylines, scenarios, and moments to build movies and TV shows around. That could power 20 years of storytelling. </p><h2 id="h29078"><a id=""></a>Rebooting <em>Jurassic Park</em></h2><p>Sadly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-world-4-rebirth-trailer-screenshots-2025-1851636033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-world-4-rebirth-trailer-screenshots-2025-1851636033"><em>Rebirth</em></a></span><em> </em>tosses that all out the window, reminding viewers four separate times in the opening half hour that dinosaurs can’t survive on modern Earth and most of them are now dead. The survivors can be found on some islands dotted around the equator, but that’s it. </p><p>We do get one scene <em>very </em>early into <em>Rebirth </em>that features a big brontosaurus stuck in New York City, covered in graffiti and trash and causing a traffic jam. The movie then swiftly moves on, but not before reminding you one more time that they are all dead and this big dinosaur is probably the last one in North America. </p><p>So, after essentially retconning the end of the<em> Jurassic World</em> trilogy, what does <em>Rebirth </em>do? It fires up a plot that has nothing to do with the rest of the world and takes place on an island. So why the retcon? Your guess is as good as mine! </p><p>Anyway, <em>Rebirth’s </em>plot involves mercenaries (led by Scarlett Johansson) heading to a top-secret island where dinosaur experiments happened, so they can grab some prehistoric blood samples from massive beasts for a rich pharmaceutical company that wants to make a new heart disease medication that will bring in trillions of dollars. </p><h2 id="h29079"><a id=""></a>Prehistoric questing</h2><p>This half of the movie is where a lot of the dinosaur action happens, and director Gareth Edwards knows how to put together intense, action-packed prehistoric setpieces. One sequence involving large flying dinosaurs and a giant rock cliff is a standout moment. But whenever there aren’t dinos on screen, the mercs’ plotline feels like a boring video game fetch quest.</p><p>Get three DNA samples from these big creatures, each in a different biome, and bring them back to get your reward. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876">Most of them are killed off</a></span> before you can care, and the one death that does leave an impact is undone to provide a nice, happy ending, though fans of corporate assholes getting their comeuppance will be satisfied by one late kill in the movie. </p><p>The other half of <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> involves a small family: A dad, his young daughter, his older daughter who leaves for college soon, and her lazy boyfriend. It’s here that<em> Rebirth</em> really shines, as the family members actually have character arcs and change as the movie goes on. The film’s script, while filled with some dumb moments, does a great job of fleshing the family out and making you care about them. When they were in danger,  I was sitting upright and hoping they’d all make it out alive. </p><h2 id="h29080"><a id=""></a>A mutated, hybrid narrative</h2><p>These two halves of the movie barely interact with each other. The family and mercs crash into each other at the start, but then spend 60 percent of the runtime separated, their paths only merging in the last 25 minutes or so.</p><p>This is when <em>Rebirth’s </em>mutant hybrid dinosaurs become a big threat to the family and the mercenaries. Sadly, because they are featured in the film so briefly, neither the raptor-like Mutadon nor the massive mutated T-Rex, known as a D-Rex, makes much of an impact. Their designs are strange and disturbing, but unlike <em>Jurassic World’</em>s now-iconic Indominus Rex, which played a huge part in that film, neither of these mutants is going on my list of favorite movie monsters. </p><p>As <em>Rebirth </em>wrapped up, and the familiar<em> Jurassic Park</em> music played over the survivors leaving dino island, I felt conflicted. I’m always down for dinosaurs, and the CG beasts in <em>Rebirth </em>are the best-looking in the franchise. And damn scary, too. But <em>Rebirth’s </em>two plotlines don’t come together well, and so I ended up hating one half of the movie  for getting in the way of the other. </p><p>The end result is, ironically, a strange, mutated hybrid of a movie that is mostly enjoyable if you don’t think too hard about what’s happening on screen. In other words, it’s another <em>Jurassic Park</em> sequel. Better than some, worse than others, and nowhere near as good as Spielberg’s original classic. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757]]></content:encoded>

That cultural ubiquity is exactly why Gunn <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Times</em></a></span> he has no interest in movies wasting time telling a story we’ve all known for decades.</p><p>“I don’t need to see pearls in a back alley when Batman’s parents are killed. I don’t need to see the radioactive spider biting Spider-Man. And I don’t need to see baby Kal coming from Krypton in a little baby rocket. We have watched a million movies with characters who don’t have their upbringing explained, like when we see <em>Good Night, and Good Luck</em>—we don’t need to know the early life of Edward R. Murrow to explain how he became a journalist. Who cares?”</p><p>That’s a good question: Who cares? The central purpose those origin stories serve is to connect us with the heroes on a human level. Most of us don’t have more money than God or a Batcave nicer than most homes, but we all know losing our parents could emotionally damage us forever. Yet with the success of grounded superhero movies like Matt Reeves’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-batman-part-2-sequel-delayed-2026-2027-dc-reeves-1851729434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-batman-part-2-sequel-delayed-2026-2027-dc-reeves-1851729434"><em>The Batman</em></a></span>, we’re now seeing more films take a similar approach, relying heavily on exploring their heroes as people as they seek to deconstruct these legendary characters. We don’t need to see his parents’ murder early in the film to grasp the nature of his internal torment later on. He’s a broken man throughout the film for numerous reasons and is only held together by a dutiful compulsion to prevent crime.</p><p>From defending his upcoming Superman movie’s political slant to deriding critics who think his choice for the Man of Steel is a “pussy,” Gunn didn’t hold back in his<em> Times</em> interview. And hopefully, he keeps disrupting the superhero industrial complex known as Hollywood for years to come. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/james-gunn-spider-man-batman-superman-dcu-1851785756]]></content:encoded>
