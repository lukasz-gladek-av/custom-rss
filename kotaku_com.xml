Reading between the lines, the suggestion is that even if Nagoshi’s next game does make it out the door, it won’t get the red carpet rollout fans would hope for, or a new IP might be needed in order to have a chance of standing out in an ever more crowded field. </p><p>NetEase  acquired Grasshopper Manufacture, the studio behind cult-hits <em>Let It Die</em> and <em>No More Heroes</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netease-games-acquires-goichi-sudas-grasshopper-manufac-1847914966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netease-games-acquires-goichi-sudas-grasshopper-manufac-1847914966">back in 2021 as well</a></span>.
