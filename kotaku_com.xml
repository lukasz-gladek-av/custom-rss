Following Warner’s mishandling of so much talent and so many otherwise reliable franchises, the creatives who made great games like the <em>Middle-earth </em>series have now been caught in the crossfire. One deeply frustrating wrinkle in this is that one of Monolith Productions’ greatest claims to fame has been patented by the same company that just shut down the studio.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195922,196345" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>2014’s <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor </em>was one of the best surprises of that year. One of the most notable parts of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> spin-off was the Nemesis system, a clever mechanic that married gameplay and narrative in a way that few games have ever been able to pull off. In short, the Nemesis system tracks your encounters with different Uruk foes throughout the game, and enemies that you face in a fight can be promoted in Sauron’s army, gaining power and rank. What made it so fascinating was that it created micronarratives throughout the game. Instead of facing generic enemies until you hit the credits, you could be facing rivals that grew as you progressed throughout the game. All of this made the experience feel like an emergent, self-authored revenge story reactive to how you played. Monolith further iterated on it in the sequel <em>Shadow of War</em>. In a perfect world, this kind of mechanic would have been copied a dozen times over until teams integrated it into so many games we got tired of seeing it. However, Warner Bros. had other plans.</p><p>After the runaway success of <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, WB started mobilizing to patent the Nemesis system so no one else could use it in 2015 then proceeded to only make use of it one more time with <em>Shadow of War</em> despite plenty of opportunities to integrate it into series like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-shouldve-stolen-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system-1714797977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-shouldve-stolen-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system-1714797977"><em>Batman</em></a></span>.

However, given Warner Bros. has done nothing with it, the patenting of the Nemesis system was especially wasteful. After Warner Bros. took several years to build a winning case, it finally secured the patent<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/after-years-of-trying-wb-games-successfully-patented-s-1846213089&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/after-years-of-trying-wb-games-successfully-patented-s-1846213089"> in 2021</a></span>, which will last until 2035. Now the studio that was responsible for what could have been a revolutionary system in narrative design has been shut down and the project that it spent years working on that would have used it won’t see the light of day.</p><p>While it’s hardly the most important thing that’s happened today, it’s a sad reminder that when corporations own your work, it could disappear with a snap of a finger, no matter how brilliant it is. My heart goes out to folks affected by these studio shutdowns, and it especially goes out to those whose creativity is being locked away in a vault that Warner Bros. may never open up again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ensemble, led by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kirby-grammy-award-8-bit-big-band-meta-knights-revenge-1848745709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-grammy-award-8-bit-big-band-meta-knights-revenge-1848745709">Grammy-winning 8-Bit Big Band director Charlie Rosen</a></span>, performed never-before-heard rock arrangements of music most people had only heard as chiptune tracks backing up a shovel-swinging hero’s adventure. And yet, there are only two planned performances of these arrangements by this group of musicians. The setlist included selections from the base <em>Shovel Knight </em>game, as well as the DLC campaigns developer Yacht Club Games released. When the show reached its final number, Rosen—in defiance of the posted notices to the contrary—asked the audience to record the rest of the performance, lest the entire show become nothing but a memory for the few hundred fans in the audience. If you were wondering why the only footage from the performance seems to be of the <em>Shovel Knight</em> end credits theme, that’s probably why.</p><p>As a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-live-steel-thy-shovel-concert/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-live-steel-thy-shovel-concert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-show concert series</a></span> with performances only happening in New York and L.A., the potential audience for Shovel Knight Live is limited to people who already live in those cities, and those sickest of <em>Shovel Knight</em> sickos willing to invest the time and money into travelling there for one night. So as wonderful as it is to hear talented musicians reimagining these iconic tracks for a live show, it’s sad only a fraction of <em>Shovel Knight </em>fans will ever hear them.</p><p>And my god, what a show it was. Live performances have a way of making you appreciate aspects of a piece’s composition that you might not even process when listening to it on your headphones, or when it’s playing in the background as you whack people with a shovel in <em>Shovel Knight</em>. Rosen and crew’s rearrangements of composer Jake Kaufman’s original score were incredible reimaginings with guitar, horns, and strings that had me and the rest of the audience popping off in the Town Hall. Hearing a violin soar over the rest of the band had me welling up in my seat. It took me back to playing <em>Shovel Knight </em>on my PlayStation Vita in 2015. The grand sense of adventure and stress I felt when playing some of the more challenging levels flowed back into me after having not played the game in a decade, all punctuated by footage of the game playing in the background of each song.</p><p>Even though I hadn’t played <em>Shovel Knight </em>in years, I couldn’t help but get caught up in the passion in the room. In a previous life, I was studying to be a music teacher before I pivoted into journalism, and I’ve only recently gotten back to music as a hobby. Some of my defining musical projects when I was a semi-professional musician involved rearranging songs so my local choirs could perform them, so I know that breaking a piece of music you love and putting it back together as something else is the kind of thing you only do if you’re passionate about the source material.</p><p>Earlier this year I went to see the <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </em>orchestra concert, which was an incredible show full of talented musicians, but those were more or less one-to-one recreations of the tracks you’ll hear in the RPG. Maybe it’s the hibernating composer in me hyperfixating on the little details of how a violin or horn section was able to create something new and exciting out of chiptune music, but seeing a group of incredible performers playing <em>Shovel Knight</em>’s music in ways it never had been before elevated the show beyond what might, on paper, just look like an event for diehard fans. It was an exceptional showcase of musical talent and passion of a sort that only a live show can truly communicate. I hope that these first two shows are successful enough that Yacht Club Games gives more people the chance to experience this performance. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
