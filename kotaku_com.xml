              <p>Is <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> running at 30fps on Switch 2 disappointing or good enough? Is the Game Awards bump really worth an estimated $12 million in new sales? And just how long will fans have to wait for <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> to come out of its self-imposed indefinite delay? It’s the latest edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>We’re just beginning to wrap up our year-in-review coverage here, but my heart is already looking past the upcoming holidays to my favorite time of year: backlog season. I’m making a list, checking it twice<!--StartFragment --><span>—am I </span><!--EndFragment -->gonna maybe finally finish <em>System Shock 2</em> and not just replay <em>Xenogears</em> again?</p>

 <h2><em>Terminator: Survivors</em> is barely hanging on</h2> <p>With just two weeks left to go until it was supposed to release, Nacon’s post-apocalyptic adaptation of the franchise won’t be making its planned 2025 launch after all. Instead of getting a new ship date, however, the open-world game has been indefinitely delayed. It also won’t be launching with the previously promised co-op mode. There won’t be an Early Access phase either.</p>

 <p>“After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “<em>Terminator</em>” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay,&nbsp;we would have to put aside the&nbsp;cooperative multiplayer,” the publisher <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/2000959289918132344">announced on Tuesday</a>. “We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.”</p>

 <h2>Nintendo shareholders are worried about spiking memory costs</h2> <p>That big <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">RAM shortage</a> everyone keeps talking about? Investors are worried it’s about to hit the Switch 2 in a big way. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that the cost of manufacturing the new console could already be going up. “The price Nintendo has to pay for the 12GB RAM (random access memory) modules in the Switch 2 jumped 41 percent in the current quarter, according to market intelligence firm TrendForce,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">it writes</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Why is this happening</a>? Why, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrmunchertoyou.bsky.social/post/3m7zmn5hnkg2b">AI bubble of course</a>.</p> <h2>Players are flocking to<em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> all over again</h2>   <p>A Game Awards sweep, a big free update have, and a small sale on Steam have conspired to catapult the French RPG back up the charts.&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3ma23xntiwk2v">Alinea Analytics estimates</a> that the game has sold another 300,000 copies since the showcase last week. Old players <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7zxuzbclk2f">are coming back too</a>. The Game Awards bump <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/moomanibe.bsky.social/post/3ma2ks7sx7s2a">remains very real</a>, at least for games that everyone already loved.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> has a free demo on Switch 2</h2> <p>The port includes the <em>Intergrade</em> expansion and arrives on Nintendo’s new console on January 22, 2026. Progress from the demo will carry over to the main game. It runs smoothly, though some fans are disappointed it’s locked at 30fps despite the slight visual downgrade. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">I played the opening earlier this year</a> and thought it looked surprisingly great in handheld mode.</p>

 <h2>The Amazon-funded MOBA studio founded by ex-Ubisoft devs has been sold back to Ubisoft</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn2aJ3UmVnk"><em>March of Giants</em></a> was revealed earlier this year. It’s led by creative director Xavier Marquis, the original creative director of <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and producer Alexandre Parizeau, the previous managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6TYgLsRkVYP97hVH0Rhzn7/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-from-amazon">Amazon divested them back to Ubisoft</a> amid its latest round of big gaming cuts. Is this like a life raft seeking shelter aboard the Titanic?</p> <h2><em>Dota 2</em> gets its 128th hero: a frog who plays the mandolin</h2> <p>Largo was just added to Valve’s long-running MOBA in its mammoth <a href="https://www.dota2.com/largo">7.40 update</a>. The most important part? He has a rhythm-based ultimate called Amphibian Rhapsody. “Every time he strums successfully, he gains a stack of Groovin,'” the description reads. “Each stack gives him bonus armor and reduces the mana cost of every song, but he loses a stack if he misses a beat. Stacks linger for a short duration when Largo’s song ends.”</p> <p>Neat! Will this get me to go back to <em>Dota</em> after a multi-year break? Absolutely not.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-atlantis-remake-amazon-show-2000653453"><em>Tomb Raider</em> devs explain where the franchise goes next</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/snl-ai-slop-saturday-night-live-nbc-2000653399">SNL embraces the slop machine</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-review-steam-switch-ps5-2000653418"><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> is the best arcade action game of the year</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>My New Year’s resolution list for 2026 is almost ready, and spending mindfully, aka not overspending, is at the top. It’s going to be a tough one, since I basically hunt deals for a living. If you’re planning to save on everyday groceries, prescriptions, gas, etc, you might want to consider grabbing a 1-year Sam’s Club membership, which gets you access to all these and more at a discounted rate.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/"> A year-long Club membership is usually sold for $50 at StackSocial, but the retailer just took 60% off it, letting you grab it for just $20.</a></p>
<p>The Plus membership (with a bit more perks) is discounted, too. It’s going for $60, down from $110 after a nice 45% off. These are selling fast, and they expire soon. We share how to grab one, plus all the benefits these memberships offer, below.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Save Big On Groceries, Gas, and Medicines</h2>
<p>Before we get into the specifics of each subscription, here’s a bit about how it’s going to work; completing your purchase on StackSocial gets you an instant promotion code via email, which you can use while signing up for the Sam’s Club membership. The code is non-transferable, and it renews automatically every year until you cancel. The membership offer is only available to new Sam’s Club members in the USA, and is valid at over 597 U.S. Sam’s Club locations. You need to redeem your code on or before December 31, 2025, as it expires after that. This digital membership card can be accessed using the Sam’s Club app on your smartphone or even a desktop. There’s a one-person limit per subscription, but you can purchase an additional membership as a gift for a loved one.</p>
<p>Club members get to enjoy wholesale pricing, member-only gas prices, and instant savings on already-discounted items. Over 600 generic prescriptions start at just $14, plus you can enjoy walk-in vaccinations at Pharmacy locations. The Scan &amp; Go option lets you scan items using the dedicated app as you shop, allowing you to skip long checkout lines at the store. Additionally, picking up pre-packaged items is free! You will also save on travel, entertainment, personalized printing, and automotive services all year-round.</p>



<p>Plus members get free delivery on all eligible orders of $50 or more, early access to deals, and free delivery on eligible prescriptions. They will also earn 2% back on qualifying in-club purchases.</p>
<p>Basically, these memberships pay for themselves in the long run by helping you save a ton on a wide range of items and even experiences. The Club membership is going at a $30 discount, while the Plus option can be yours for $50 less. Occasional shoppers looking to save should grab the former, but if you’re a frequent shopper who regularly uses pharmacy services and wants free shipping, Plus is likely going to be a better option for you. Note that at the time of writing, over 20,000 discounted subscriptions have been sold. It’s a popular pick, but it expires soon. It’s best to snap it up while there’s still some time left.</p>
<p>That said, StackSocial is offering plenty of other subscriptions for less at the moment. Now is also a great time to grab magazine subscriptions, a lifetime Microsoft Office license, and more without paying the full price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The second season of Amazon Prime’s </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>series debuts later today, but reviews for the post-apocalyptic atom-punk show are pouring in now—and the vibes seem mostly positive, aside from concerns over the story expanding in too many different directions.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Picking up exactly where season one left off (with Ella Purnell’s Lucy and Walton Goggins’ </span><span>Ghoul setting off in pursuit of Lucy’s evil dad), </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>’s second season takes us to what many players believe is the setting of the best game in the franchise: New Vegas. Goggins’ world-weary and cynical Ghoul and Purnell’s wide-eyed and naive Lucy are a match made in Western heaven, and it seems that their dynamic still feels fresh in this new season—though critics only got to see six out of the eight episodes in season two.</span></p>

 <p><span>Whereas season one spent a lot of time setting the scene and building the audience’s connections to the lead characters (who also include Aaron Moten’s Maximus, a rookie soldier in the Brotherhood of Steel), </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>’s latest installment focuses on the apocalyptic wastelands’ competing factions and their leaders. Much like in the games, their conflicting ideologies and consistent tensions make the wasteland even trickier to navigate, but it seems the time spent on these various factions dilutes the adventures of the three leads: Lucy, the Ghoul, and Maximus.</span></p>

 <p><span>There appear to be numerous flashbacks to the pre-apocalypse in this season, focusing on Goggins’ pre-Ghoul identity of Cooper Howard, who spies on his wife and her work with the Vault-Tec corporation. According to </span><a href="https://archive.is/20251216141105/https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/844926/fallout-season-2-review-amazon-prime-video#selection-1491.235-1491.340"><span>Andrew Webster at </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> the show ensures that the cause of the nuclear wasteland is abundantly clear: greedy tech execs: “</span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> is never subtle with its social satire and that remains true here. The end of the world is brought about by a group of tech oligarchs who wield too much power, and as one character muses early on, ‘every dollar spent is a vote cast.’ Board meetings show billionaires salivating at the business opportunities that come with the apocalypse.” I wonder what Amazon’s Jeff Bezos thinks about that</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-review-episodes-1-6"><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s review,</span></a><span> Matt Purlow writes that </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two is “structured more akin to </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span>,</span><span>” with “multiple other concurrent storylines that make </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> feel like the story of the wasteland itself as much as it is the tale of the key characters.” This results in a “very packed season” with “inevitable casualties,” mostly notably of which are the stories of the vault dwellers, whose silliness Purlow feels is at odds with the rest of the season’s tone.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Here’s what other reviewers had to say about </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> season two, which is currently sitting at a </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s02"><span>100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes</span></a><span> with just 28 scored reviews in:</span></p> <blockquote><p>I worry that <i>Fallout</i>’s downward spiral will only continue. As <i>Westworld </i>soldiered on, the world got bigger, but the story got more generic. By the time HBO canceled <i>Westworld</i>—on a major unresolved cliffhanger!—it didn’t seem like anyone even cared where it was all headed. <i>Fallout </i>risks going down the same path. The last few episodes of season 2 might correct that course (season 3 is also already greenlit, for what it’s worth) but if not, Nolan may develop an unfortunate reputation for setting up exciting sci-fi TV shows that fail to pan out. – <strong>Jake Kleinman, </strong><strong><i>Polygon&nbsp;</i></strong></p> <p><span>Though all the storylines aren’t as compelling as the others, the series’ structure and pacing keep it moving so the audience doesn’t completely lose interest. For viewers who are well-versed in the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game universe, seeing Easter eggs around New Vegas and various factions coming to life on screen for the first time undoubtedly adds a level of interest and delight that may go over the heads of newcomers. – <strong>Aramide Tinubu,</strong></span><strong><i> Vanity Fair</i></strong></p> <p><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> remains a show that glories in high contrast visuals, emotions and characters. There is no shortage of new disgusting ways for the people of this irradiated world to get maimed and die, and no shortage of new mutant creatures for Lucy, Ghoul and Maximus to have to battle, either. Both Parnell and Moten have settled comfortably into their roles, and the latter feels distinctly more natural as buttoned-up Maximus this time around. — <strong>Kelly Lawyer, </strong></span><strong><i>USA Today</i></strong></p> <p><span>Bogged down with world-building, Season 2 feels as if the Amazon Prime Video executives know they’ve got a hit on their hands and can’t help but game out a </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/craft-considerations/fallout-walton-goggins-nose-la-production-design-1235004555/"><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> universe</span></a><span> filled with spinoffs and sequels, even though they still need to develop the characters who first got viewers invested in a post-apocalyptic society that’s still controlled by corporate interests. — <strong>Ben Travers, </strong></span><strong><i>Indie Wire</i></strong></p></blockquote> <p><span>The comparisons to </span><i><span>Westworld </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span> certainly have me worried, but I’ll weigh in myself when I can watch </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two with my own eyes—you know, the same ones that <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937">actually liked the </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937"> TV series</a> (eesh).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two episodes air every Wednesday on Prime Video, starting today, December 16.</span></p>
