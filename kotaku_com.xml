            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anyone of a certain age remembers being absolutely blown away when the first 100GB hard drives hit the market in the early 2000s. <em>So much space</em> — how could we possibly fill it? Today you would need several of those 100GB hard drives — 1,400 of them, to be precise — to equal the immense capacity of this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/">Western Digital Elements 14TB external hard drive that’s selling on Amazon right now for just $170 in a killer Prime Day deal.</a></p>
<p>Care for a little more future shock? Those first 100GB external hard drives sold for around $275 when they were released in 2002. So the 14TB of storage space in this $170 Western Digital desktop drive would have cost you roughly $385,000 not <em>all</em> that long ago. Still wondering how good of a deal this one is?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge, Fast, Safe</h2>
<p>All of that vast space on this WD Elements drive would be only minimally useful if the drive was slow — imagine how many days it would take to move 14 terabytes of data on or off of a pokey drive. But this one has a USB 3.0 interface (also works with USB 2.0) for speedy data transfers. It’s plug-and-play for Windows computers, and getting it ready for a Mac requires only a quick and simple formatting.</p>
<p>The drive itself isn’t pocket-sized like so many of the external hard drives we see today — it’s <em>fourteen terabytes</em> — so expectations should be modulated. But it’s a sleek-looking black device that resembles a book when standing on your desk at a modest 6.53 inches tall, 1.89 inches wide, and 5.31 inches deep. It does require an AC power source, but beyond that, the included USB cable is all you need.</p>



<h2>Who’s This For?</h2>
<p>Better question: Who <em>isn’t</em> this for? Reliable backup storage is a critical need for anyone who has sensitive or valuable files on their laptop or desktop, and that’s basically everyone who owns a computer. It’s beyond inadvisable to not have some form of backup system in place, and the WD Elements drive is almost certainly big enough to back up every single computer in your home. It’s especially valuable if you’ve converted irreplaceable files like family photos or home movies to video format and need to have a safe place to keep them.</p>
<p>When everything else seems to skyrocket in price over time thanks to inflation, it’s good to see something as valuable as digital storage go in the opposite direction. Even so, this Amazon Prime Day deal on the 14TB Western Digital Elements USB 3.0 external hard drive is borderline ridiculous. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/">At 39% off, it’s just $170 for more space than you’ll probably ever need.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-hdd-is-going-for-pennies-at-amazon-now-only-0-01-per-gb-of-external-storage-2000633124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-hdd-is-going-for-pennies-at-amazon-now-only-0-01-per-gb-of-external-storage.1319476/</guid>

              <p>Long-term storage of photos and videos creates a dilemma that most people solve expensively through monthly cloud subscriptions or by purchasing fast but pricey SSDs. Here’s the reality: <strong>you don’t need blazing transfer speeds for archiving memories</strong> you’ll access occasionally. What you need is massive capacity at a reasonable price, and traditional hard disk drives deliver exactly that value proposition.</p>
<p>The Seagate 20TB external drive gives you an enormous amount of space for storing years worth of family photos and backup files without the recurring costs of cloud storage or the premium pricing of solid-state alternatives. Prime Big Deal Day <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">has slashed this drive to $229 from its original $499 price, representing more than 50% off and creating an all-time low for this capacity</a>. This <strong>Prime-exclusive offer</strong> expires tonight when Amazon’s promotional event closes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Practical Storage for Archives</h2>
<p>Smartphones today capture 4K video that takes up gigabytes per minute and high-def photos from today’s cameras easily surpass 25MB per shot. A week-long family vacation can amass 100GB of content before you know it. With 20TB at your disposal, you get <strong>storage for approximately 5 million average-sized photos</strong>&nbsp;or about 2,500 hours of Full HD video.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 interface<strong> reads transfer rates of around 120-160 MB/s</strong> when dealing with sequential file operations which means that you can transfer a 100GB folder in around 10-15 minutes. It will feel slow compared to today’s SSDs reaching 1,000 MB/s or faster, remember your actual use case scenario: you’re performing large one-time moves of photo libraries or full-system backups, then plugging the drive into the machine or storing the drive securely.</p>



<p>The mechanical hard disk technology on the inside is mature, tried and tested storage that’s been perfected over decades. HDDs can’t compete with the shock resistance and speed of SSDs, but they provide <strong>exponentially better cost per gigabyte for the very biggest capacities</strong>. They’re therefore perfect for write-once, read-occasionally data such as photo archives or system backups you hope never to have to use but like to keep on hand should disaster befall you.</p>



<p>Seagate includes <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em> on this drive which provides professional data recovery assistance should the drive fail mechanically. This is the salvation of potentially thousands of dollars’ worth of irreplaceable videos and images that will be forever lost without it. A limited warranty is also included and offers another type of protection that will provide you with redress should hardware issues occur during the course of the coverage.</p>
<p>Data management effectiveness is derived from the presence of sufficient storage to accommodate appropriate backup strategies. The 3-2-1 rule is one that recommends that you have three copies of critical data with two on distinct types of media and one off-site. This 2<strong>0TB unit can be your local primary backup as you keep working files on the internal drive on your computer</strong> and potentially keep significant things in selective cloud storage.</p>
<p>For $229 as part of a 20TB bundle, you’re shelling out approximately 1.1 cents per gigabyte which is one of the lowest methods through which you can archive giant data libraries. Note, <strong>this Prime Big Deal Day deal ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-2025-xbox-wireless-controller-falls-to-new-low-even-cheaper-than-yesterday-on-prime-day%E2%80%99s-final-day.1319443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It doesn’t matter if you primarily do your gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or even an Android tablet or phone. The Xbox core wireless controller is still possibly the best option for a gaming controller to choose from. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">And right now because of Prime Big Deals Days, you can nab one for 21% off.</a> Through today, the 2025 Xbox gaming controller has dropped from $65 to as low as just $50. That amount to a savings of $15. That’s exactly enough extra cash to buy yourself the insanely additive roguelike deck builder <em>Balatro</em>.</p>
<p>Each new console generation, Sony has been reinventing the wheel. The company behind PlayStation has been adding new bells and whistles to the original DualShock controller design. We’ve seen innovations like a touchpad or haptic triggers. These can be cool gimmicks, but most games don’t utilize to their full extent if at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Xbox decided to do things differently. They locked down the current controller design back in 2013 with the Xbox One launch and said, “Yeah this works.” And you know what? It does.</p>
<h2>Unbeatable Controller Design</h2>
<p>There have been some minor innovations since then like the addition of Bluetooth support, a share button, and the change to the now standard USB-C. Though those have been just to keep up with the times. The basic structure, layout, and feel of the controller are mostly unchanged. This certainly comes down to personal preference, but the D-pad on the Xbox controller puts the first party D-pad of the PS5 and Nintendo Switch to shame.</p>



<p>One big thing that has actually changed in that time is the options for customization. You can now map out button layouts at the system level, not just relying on in-game settings. Put together your personal preferences in the Xbox Accessories app to tweak how your controller works. It may not be something everyone needs or wants, but anything that broadens the accessibility for more players is a win for all of us.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">The Xbox controller is available in all sorts of vibrant colors and patterns, as well as the more classic and subtle black or white.</a> The discounts across these various variants very much vary. The robot white model right now is the cheapest at $50. The carbon black is slightly more at just $51. Deep pink is down to $54 with electric volt at $53. Some of the patterned ones like the ice breaker or heart breaker are still sitting at their full prices of $80.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Saros 10R $1,600 Robot Vacuum Is Now Selling for Peanuts, Amazon Is Quietly Clearing Out All Its Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-saros-10r-1600-robot-vacuum-is-now-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-quietly-clearing-out-all-its-stock-2000633116</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-saros-10r-1-600-robot-vacuum-is-now-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-quietly-clearing-out-all-its-stock.1319419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums have evolved far beyond the basic “bump-and-spin” models that once dominated store shelves at budget prices. Roborock has firmly planted itself in the luxury segment of this market, where several of their flagship models now command $1,500 or more. These aren’t machines you can compare to the $200 to $400 entry-level options still available at big-box stores. The difference becomes obvious the moment you watch one work:<strong> genuine autonomy, intelligent navigation, and cleaning performance that replaces human effort</strong> rather than simply supplementing it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">Saros 10R</a> embodies everything that separates premium robot vacuums from their cheaper cousins, handling everything from self-emptying to obstacle avoidance with sophistication that justifies its positioning. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">Prime Big Deal Day has brought this model down to $1,199 from its standard $1,599 price</a>, and creates an all-time low that makes luxury-tier automated cleaning more accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Engineering Excellence That Cleans Deeper</h2>
<p>The Roborock Saros 10R’s 3.14-inch ultra-slim profile represents a fundamental design shift enabled by the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0, which eliminates the raised LiDAR dome that makes traditional robot vacuums too tall to fit under most furniture. This<strong> system uses 3D sensing technology to map your home with precision</strong>, even navigating under narrow-legged furniture and suspended cabinets where dust accumulates undisturbed for months in typical homes.</p>
<p>The VertiBeam lateral obstacle avoidance system illustrates the intelligence gap between this vacuum and low-end robots: It <strong>recognizes and avoids 108 distinct types of obstructions</strong>, including charging cables that would futilely entangle low-end models. It can also vacuum along cords without the need for you to prep your floors, and removes the ironic task that is cleaning before your new robotic vacuum can vacuum.</p>



<p>Cleaning power comes from <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction that pulls embedded dirt from carpet fibers</strong> and extracts debris from tile grout lines with equal effectiveness. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide Main Brush solves the persistent problem of hair wrapping around rollers, a design that handles long human hair and pet fur without creating the tangled mess that forces you to manually cut away accumulated strands.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm</em> riser technology introduces <strong>extendable side brushes and extendable mops</strong> that reach into the corners and edges, beyond the reach of the fixed-position tools that leave messes behind. As the robot senses the presence of a corner or edge, the arms extend automatically to sweep and mop the spaces that would have had to be done manually. This dynamic response closes the cleaning gaps that leave cheaper robots incomplete.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis represents industry-first engineering that Roborock pioneered, and <strong>allows the robot to climb obstacles up to 4cm high</strong> including door thresholds and navigate around U-shaped furniture legs that trap conventional robots. When carpets are detected, the dual spinning mops and their bracket lift automatically to prevent soaking your rugs, then lower again on hard floors for mopping.</p>
<p>The dock 4.0 handles the unglamorous but essential maintenance tasks automatically: It washes mop pads with 176°F hot water that dissolves grease and sanitizes the fabric, then dries them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew. The <strong>60-day automatic dust collection</strong> means you empty the dock’s collection bin roughly six times per year instead of after every cleaning session.</p>
<p>At the price of $1,199 for Prime Day on Amazon, you’re spending money on everyday convenience that is truly luxurious, although <strong>this Prime-member exclusive offer ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-offloads-its-old-t7-external-ssds-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-at-amazon-2000633112</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-offloads-its-old-t7-external-ssds-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-at-amazon.1319383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>External storage needs have exploded as file sizes balloon with 4K video and high-resolution photos that exceed what internal drives can handle. Samsung recently launched their T9 portable SSDs with improved durability features but the performance gap compared to the T7 is minimal for most users while the price difference is substantial.</p>
<p>That makes the T7 SSD the smarter choice for anyone prioritizing value without sacrificing speed or capacity. Prime Big Deal Day<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/"> has pushed the 2TB Samsung T7 down to $129 from its usual $187 price, which marks an all-time low</a> that makes premium portable storage genuinely affordable. This <strong>Prime-exclusive offer</strong> expires tonight, giving members just hours to grab what remains the most popular external SSD on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True Speed and Capacity that Matter</h2>
<p>The Samsung T7 PCIe NVMe technology<strong> can read at up to 1,050 MB/s, and write at up to 1,000 MB/s</strong>, translating to transferring a 50GB video project in just under a minute. Compare that with slower external hard drives plodding along at 120 MB/s and you know why creatives have left spinning platters behind. It makes <strong>the T7 roughly twice as fast as Samsung’s own previous T5</strong>, which is a significant leap that affects your workflow every time you transfer large files.</p>



<p>The 2TB size is just the sweet spot for the average user and offers enough storage room for full-scale libraries of videos, massive collections of photographs or complete sets of computer games without requiring frequent housekeeping. With 2TB, you never have the hassle of rotating files around or determining which ones need deleting as new material arrives. Samsung sells the T7 in capacities as high as 4TB, but the 2TB is the best-value-per-gigabyte at current price points.</p>
<p><strong>Built-in direct video recording abilities</strong> turn the T7 from just storage into a production device: Plug it into compatible cameras or smartphones and capture Ultra High Definition 4K video at 60 frames per second directly to the drive. You can use the iPhone 17 Pro’s ProRes video mode to shoot directly onto the T7 and <strong>skip the phone’s small internal storage</strong> and allowing you to capture multiple hours of professional quality video without clogging up your phone.</p>



<p>The T7’s solid aluminum unibody construction provides <strong>shock resistance with drop protection tested up to 6 feet</strong>. This metal chassis serves double duty by acting as a heatsink that dissipates the heat generated during sustained high-speed transfers, preventing thermal throttling that could slow performance. The compact design measures roughly the size of a credit card and weighs just 0,13lbs/58 grams.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility eliminates the typical hassles of formatting drives for other systems: The <strong>T7 is compatible with Windows PCs, Macs, Android smartphones, and gaming consoles</strong> via the USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface without a hitch. Samsung ships the drive with both the USB-C to C and the USB-C to A cable, providing the capability of plugging into both new and old devices without scrambling for adapters. The drive comes<strong> shipped in the exFAT format</strong>, which is read-compatible on virtually all contemporary operating systems without reformating.</p>
<p>At a price of $129 in the 2TB version, you pay approximately 6 cents per gigbyte on storage that reads the data at almost ten times the speed that the mechanical drives read the data. Keep in mind, this Prime Big Deal Day price ends tonight.</p>
