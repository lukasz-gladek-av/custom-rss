              <p><span>Hideo Kojima dropped a new bit of lore over the weekend: the renowned designer has “always” suffered from nightmares. As he </span><a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2009914266024100002"><span>wrote</span></a><span> on Twitter, Kojima stumbled upon old dream logs in his phone’s notes while preparing to deliver </span><a href="https://gdconf.com/article/hideo-kojima-heads-to-the-festival-of-gaming-for-gdcs-first-keynote-in-5-years/"><span>the first keynote address in five years</span></a><span> at the upcoming GDC Festival of Gaming 2026.</span></p> <p><span>Suggested to him as a remedy, jotting down his dreams proved to be ineffective in relieving Kojima of his nightmares. However, the notes grant us some insight into the subconscious of one of the most influential game designers of his time, in the form of two snapshots from almost exactly nine years ago. </span><span>If you’ve ever tried to explain your own dreams, you can probably empathize with Kojima’s struggle to articulate the goings-on of his sleeping mindscape. Still, for memos that likely weren’t intended to be seen by others, they paint a surprisingly coherent picture.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2017/1/3 Memo<br>The dreams I have are always strange ones. I’ve never had what you’d call a “good dream.” Or maybe I just don’t remember them. Ok. My first dream of the year. It’s difficult to put a hazy dream into words, but I’ll try to turn it into text. Some foreign filmmakers… <a href="https://t.co/ryN1yleObC">https://t.co/ryN1yleObC</a></p> <p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2009915298602951012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The first log he shares is from January 3, 2017: In this dream, Kojima is invited to a film set where he is bitten in the arm by a flying, furry round creature. When he manages to pry the strange ball-like creature off his arm, it flies backward and morphs into an undisclosed new form. “A creature from outer space?” Kojima writes.&nbsp;</span><span>“An object from the fourth dimension? Whatever ‘it’ is, it keeps changing form in midair and returning again and again.” The film directors then point their cameras at Kojima, wordlessly capturing the struggle, which concludes with the creature transforming into a plastic card that lands in Kojima’s palm. </span><a href="https://x.com/DOrynbayev/status/2010025245919560025"><span>Fanart</span></a><span> has already been made.</span></p>

 <p><span>The second dream log comes from the following day, and takes place in a hot spring town. Kojima moves to a boarding house surrounded by narrow alleyways of packed dirt, and decides to clean the walkways. He hoses down the paths to keep the dust down, and on his journey encounters “voluptuous nude women who look as if they’ve stepped straight out of figure sketches or croquis drawings, [and] scar-covered elderly men who speak in foreign languages.”&nbsp;</span><span>The water uncovers corpses decomposing in the soil, posed as if they were swimming. Kojima returns to his rooms to call the police, but the corpses follow him and make themselves at home in his new residence. At the sound of the doorbell, the corpses transform into young men in relay racing gear. Their coach is at the door, and he’s furious.</span></p> <p><span>Any dream interpreters in the chat?</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oh, Thank Goodness Arc Raiders Isn’t A First-Person Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-first-person-mod-console-cheating-2000658944</link>
            <guid>1403677</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It is a tale as old as time itself: a hack gets a third-person game to run in first-person, or vice-versa, and the result is unspeakable horror. Sometimes that horror comes from <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-third-person-bug-reveals-v-is-a-shamblin-1845914278">the monstrosities that result</a>, but other times it can just be that the new perspective makes the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-mod-fps-first-person-pc-ea-remake-horror-1850186468">far more terrifying</a>. It’s the latter that appears to apply for&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, after someone managed to get the game running in first-person mode and discovered it became even more intense.</p> <p>Via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-first-person-view-reddit/"><em>Polygon</em></a>, Redditor Short_Satisfaction_9 showed off the results of his fiddling with&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ console settings to force the game into a first-person perspective, and while the results are very janky-looking, they also show a version of the game where fighting is a far more frightening endeavor.</p>

   <p><em>Arc Raiders’</em> combat is already very tough, even if you’re completely avoiding PvP antics. The game’s PvE bots and drones don’t go easy on you at the best of times, but in third-person you at least have the advantage of somewhat mystical vision of your surrounding area, able to see incoming enemies at a good distance. In first-person, however, that’s all gone. It sets you up for an awful lot more surprise attacks, and given how unbelievably worked up I get playing the game already, this really isn’t something I’d be clamoring for.</p>

 <p>It’s also not something anyone else can do now, as Embark has just removed access to the in-game console. That’s for a good reason too—over the weekend, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">following complaints of widespread player cheating</a>, many realized that the commands enabled PC players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q92qd4/embark_please_ban_everyone_who_use_that_console/">to switch off all fogging</a> and thus increase visibility by a wild amount. Something Xbox and PS5 players could not, giving PC cross players a ridiculous advantage over both them and their fellow PC players who weren’t doing this.</p>

   <p>On January 10, Embark’s community manager posted to the Discord to say that a hotfix was being rolled out to remove the “NewConsole” command, a vestige of its Unreal Engine basis that had accidentally been left in the game. That’s going to reduce an awful lot of cheating, but does mean the rest of us can’t experience the horror of a first-person view.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Asked About Spiraling RAM Costs As Fans Worry About A Switch 2 Price Increase]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-nintendo-ram-shortage-2000658946</link>
            <guid>1403632</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nintendo says it’s actively monitoring the impacts of tariffs and the rising prices of RAM as an AI-fueled scramble spikes computing costs around the world.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The comments came in a rare interview the </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span> maker’s president, Shuntaro Furukawa, gave to </span><em><a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945"><span>Kyoto Shimbun</span></a></em><span>, which was translated </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-monitoring-high-ram-prices-and-tariff-impacts-very-closely-president-shuntaro-furukawa-says/"><span>by </span><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp; In it, the executive noted that the possibility of raising the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 due to future costs is hypothetical and didn’t commit one way or the other. However, he did acknowledge that AI data centers requiring large amounts of RAM, and the scarcity this situation creates, may become a concern in the future.</span></p> <p><span>When asked about the current challenges for keeping Switch 2’s profit margin lower than that of its predecessor, Furukawa explained, “Hardware profitability depends on factors like component procurement conditions, cost reductions through mass production, and the impact of exchange rates and tariffs.”&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The executive previously told investors that Switch 2 pricing was safe for now unless there was another Trump trade war blowup. “While we are aware that the costs of various materials are rising, we also anticipate some areas where cost reduction may be achieved for Nintendo Switch 2 through ongoing mass production efforts,” Furukawa </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086"><span>said in November</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <h2>Is 2026 the year Switch 2 goes to $500?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803"><span>The rising costs of PC parts</span></a><span> aren’t only concerning for gaming firms like Nintendo but also for average people. It’s become pricey and challenging to purchase RAM and graphic cards for PCs. </span><span>It’s gotten so bad that NVIDIA </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-returning-2026-dram-shortage-gpus-expensive-prices-2000656687"><span>is reportedly</span></a><span> considering making its older RTX 3060s graphics cards available again to meet demand.</span></p>

 <p><span>During the interview, the Nintendo president also said that the game company had projected a negative impact from tariffs last year which ended up costing it tens of millions in the first half. </span><span>“This is a crucial period for our game business as we promote the adoption of new hardware and maintain the momentum of our platforms. We are working on this while carefully considering the situation,” he said.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Nintendo is monitoring these rising costs and market changes, it has already responded to them over the last year. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220"><span>In August of 2025</span></a><span>, the gaming firm increased the prices of its original Switch console. The U.S. price for the nearly decade-old Switch console rose from $299 to $339, the Switch OLED from $349 to $399, and the Switch Lite from $199 to $229.</span></p>

 <p><span>At this time, it’s unclear what decisions Nintendo will make due to the market conditions of RAM costs and the tariffs. However, during the interview, President Furukawa said, “While it’s difficult to accurately gauge the future impact, our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost and pass them on to prices as much as possible, not just in the US.”</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Dog Beat Alison Brie And Ethan Hawke For An Acting Award, And No, This Isn’t The Plot Of A New Air Bud]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/good-boy-indy-astra-award-best-performance-dog-horror-2000658943</link>
            <guid>1403629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497"><span>dog-led horror movie starring Indy the retriever</span></a><span>, premiered last year, I said we should give the titular good boy an Oscar for his performance. That was just an offhand comment made in jest, but now that we’re in award season, Indy has actually been winning awards for his performance, though most of them have been against other animal actors. That is, until the Astra Awards on Friday, January 9, where he won the award for Best Performance in a Horror or Thriller, which was met with both happiness for the dog and a surprising amount of cynicism about the state of award shows.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note that Indy had no awareness that he was even “acting” in any real sense of the word. Director Ben Leonberg said in a behind-the-scenes mini-doc accompanying the film that Indy is not a trained canine actor, and the film is edited such that shots recontextualize moments where Indy is just looking at something off-screen as Leonberg makes noise behind the camera.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Indy has won animal performance awards from the South by Southwest Film &amp; TV Festival, the San Diego Film Critics Society, and the Boston Society of Film Critics. However, the Astra Award is the first he’s won against actual human actors, and there were some pretty big standouts in the category:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alison Brie – </span><i><span>Together</span></i><span> as Millie Wilson</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ethan Hawke – </span><i><span>Black Phone 2</span></i><span> as The Grabber</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sally Hawkins – </span><i><span>Bring Her Back</span></i><span> as Laura</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sophie Thatcher – </span><i><span>Companion</span></i><span> as Iris</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alfie Williams – </span><i><span>28 Years Later </span></i><span>as Spike</span></li> </ul>  <p><span>Now, if you look at the comments under Leonburg and Indy’s acceptance speech video, you’ll see an outpouring of support for Indy’s win and his handsome little bowtie. If you look elsewhere, however, you’ll find that both fans of the other nominees and general award season followers are viewing it through a much more cynical lens. Honestly, the more I think about it, the more Indy winning out against excellent human actors sounds like the plot of a Disney Channel Original Movie in which a young kid’s canine companion makes trouble for their owner’s no good, mean-ass bullies by beating them at the local talent show. It’s the kind of move that feels like it was made for the sake of the meme rather than to actually recognize the performance that displays the most craft, skill, and artistry.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Incredibly so,” AdhesivenessFar5588 responded. “Especially since in the ‘making of’ at the end of the movie, they literally say that he’s not acting. There is no performance. It’s simply recording over and over again until you get the reaction you were looking for, and then splicing it together with other scenes. This would be like giving an award to an actor who had to wear an ear piece with their dialogue fed to them line by line. Like, it’s cute in theory to give the dog an award, and incredibly insulting when you think about it for more than 10 seconds.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As some have pointed out, this is an especially annoying move for an award celebrating the horror genre, which is rarely recognized during awards ceremonies, and it’s unlikely several of these actors will be nominated in more general categories throughout awards season.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This kinda sucks, [not gonna lie],” 1080TJ wrote. “Horror performances are barely awarded outside of these specialized categories and it would’ve been nice for any of these actors to get some acknowledgement for their work. Alfie Williams in particular was amazing.”</span></p> <p><span>I’m of the mind that </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>’s most award-worthy aspects are in its editing and directing, especially once you realize Indy has no formal training as an acting dog and it’s Leonburg’s directorial debut. Indy can sweep the animal actor awards, but pitting him against the likes of Ethan Hawke and Sophie Thatcher and giving him the trophy is pretty unserious. </span></p>
