              <p><span>A long-rumoured PlayStation 5 upgrade for Warhorse Studios’ 2018 game </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> has seemingly been confirmed by mistake, as the PlayStation Store description listing now includes details for a “The PS5 version” version.</span></p> <p><span>Although this leak was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qpgd10/kingdom_come_deliverance_ps5_information/"><span>initially spotted</span></a><span> on the PlayStation Store Italia page for the title, the same PS5-specific information has since appeared on the </span><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/227410"><span>British PlayStation Store listing</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>It now states that the game will be “Updated for PlayStation 5” and that the “PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The background of the key art on the PlayStation Store has also changed, removing the militia seen in the original artwork and replacing the scene with a darker orange background. The opening paragraph has also been updated: “(Re)discover Henry’s saga, from the start!”</span></p> <p><span>Neither the PlayStation Store Italia nor the British pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated to specify a new release date, and still display the game’s original 13 February 2018 PlayStation 4 release date.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the “2017 Warhorse Studios” trademark information, which is still present on the US PlayStation Store Page, has since disappeared from both the Italian and British store pages.</span></p> <p><span>No word from any of the </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </span></i><span>social accounts or any sort of announcement from publisher Deep Silver on its legitimacy yet, but rumours of a PlayStation 5 version of the game can be traced all the way back to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mdsewq/kingdom_come_deliverance_1_may_be_getting_a/"><span>July 2025</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Those rumours have only ever mentioned a PS5 version of the game, and as of yet, none of the Xbox store pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated with similar information.</span></p>

              <p><span>Streaming PS3 games through <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-essential-extra-premium-microsoft-xbox-gam-1848722178">PlayStation Plus Premium</a>, Sony’s most expensive subscription tier, has seemingly been busted for at least two weeks now. It’s especially bad timing with <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241"><em>Fallout</em> season 2</a> inspiring some PS5 owners to try to revisit the PS3 version of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Exactly two weeks ago today, one fan on the PS Plus subreddit posted a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qct49v/got_a_problem_with_streaming_on_ps5/"><span>thread titled</span></a><span> “Got a problem with Streaming on PS5.”As they explained, they were unable to boot up 2012’s </span><i><span>Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two</span></i><span> through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud gaming service.</span></p>

 <p><span>After some attempts at troubleshooting, other players in the same thread quickly discovered they were facing the same problem. Every single PS3 cloud streaming game, for seemingly every subscriber, was suddenly refusing to load. No error message, no attempt to boot, nothing. <em>Kotaku</em> just&nbsp;tried to boot up Fallout: New Vegas and other PS3 games from the PS Plus and library menus on PS5 and had the same problem.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>From this point on, dozens more threads detailing the same issue began to crop up on the subreddit. In fact, the issue has become such a problem that, as spotted by </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/ps3-game-streaming-still-broken-and-sony-draws-criticism"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span>, moderators have started deleting threads discussing the matter and guiding users towards a single megathread.</span></p>

 <p><span>Players have discovered a few </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qfg98u/workaround_for_streaming_ps3_games_on_ps5/"><span>workarounds</span></a><span> for the issue, such as booting a Cloud Streaming title from their libraries instead of the store, but the fix doesn’t seem to work for everyone, and appears to be temporary for others. As of today, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qol9xu/comment/o228w5a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>top comment</span></a><span> on the moderator-created PS+ Criticism Thread claims the issue still hasn’t been fixed. “Insane this had been broken for nearly 2 weeks and no comms or fix,” reads one reply.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qj3zs5/contacted_support_about_the_streaming_and_this_is/"><span>have opted</span></a><span> to pester PlayStation Support for answers. One member of the support team reportedly confirmed that Sony is aware of the problem, stating that the “issue only impacts PS3 titles within the Classic Catalog.” But there’s still no explanation of what’s causing the problem and when it might be fixed. Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </span></p>
