The show doesn’t directly follow the plot of the novels, but does reunite the cast of the 2010 live-action adaptation to voice their movie characters in the series. <em>Kotaku</em>’s Kenneth Shepard called it a  “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407">hilarious blend of the [franchise’s] quick wit and well-measured pop culture references</a></span>.” But sadly, the series won’t be getting a second season. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 20</a></span>, to mark the one-year anniversary of the premiere of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em>, series creator O’Malley tweeted that it was “an honor to work with all of the cast &amp; staff around the world”  and called the series “a one of a kind miracle.” The creator also confirmed that Netflix had recently passed on a second season of the animated adaption. </p><p>“Anyway, we were recently informed that the show will not return,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said O’Malley</a></span>. “As you know, we only intended one season, and called in a lot of favors to make it happen, so making more would have been nearly impossible. Still, I know some of you have been holding out hope.” </p><p>“Sorry to all Matthew fans and Gideon fans, I know you will suffer the most,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added O’Malley in a follow-up</a></span> to the tweet confirming the news that there would be no second season. </p><p>While some fans were upset with the Netflix show and how much it deviated from the original graphic novels, many others were happy to get a new story featuring these characters. For now, it seems that’s the end of this chapter of the franchise, despite a post-credits scene included in the final episode of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. </em></p><p><em>&nbsp;.</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While no one associated with the episode explicitly tells us what happens that makes it so bloody, the descriptions we have gotten may be enough to give us a hint. Executive producer Dave Wilson says, “Pac-Man is Joe Pesci and the swordsman is Guy Pearce in <em>Memento.” </em>Seeing how Pesci almost exclusively plays homicidal hotheads, and Guy Pearce strangles a man to death in <em>Memento</em>, the 10-minute <em>Pac-Man</em> episode may just live up to its bloody hype if that comparison holds true. </p><p>As surprised as you may feel about a violent <em>Pac-Man</em> story, the people behind it point out how the original game isn’t all that innocent. JT Petty, teleplay writer of the <em>Pac-Man</em> episode, describes the game as essentially “eating pills in a labyrinth while you’re being chased by ghosts,” in a world where the ghosts’ eyes return to the center of the game to regenerate and repeat the destructive cycle. </p><p>When you look at <em>Pac-Man</em> that way, you can see how there could be a darker side to it; a darker side we’ll have our still-attached-to-our-heads eyes glued to when the episode releases in December.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On November 15, an X user who goes by JimmyBLLT and has a picture of Everton midfielder Iliman Ndiaye as their profile avatar got heated while playing <em>Call of Duty </em>earlier this year (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/billionaire-internet-company-boss-turns-up-to-real-life-1v1-against-cod-player-angry-about-lag-2983623/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/billionaire-internet-company-boss-turns-up-to-real-life-1v1-against-cod-player-angry-about-lag-2983623/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dexerto</em></a></span>). “Xavier Niel je te déteste je te propose un 1v1 devant le Lidl de la rue Sainte à Marseille,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JimmyBLLT/status/1792621813924544782&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JimmyBLLT/status/1792621813924544782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> back in May, which roughly translates to, “Xavier Niel I hate you, I propose a 1v1 in front of the Lidl on rue Sainte in Marseille.”</p><p>That would have been that, just another lizard brain moment evaporating into the endless ether of the internet, except that Xavier Niel caught wind of the insult and decided to visit said Lidl—an Aldi-like discount supermarket—just blocks away from the Old Port of Marseille. The telecommunications tycoon is a majority shareholder in one of France’s largest internet providers, Iliad SA. He’s worth and estimated $10 billion and he was apparently biding his time. </p><p>Last week on November 15, six months after JimmyBLLT sent their original tweet, Niel appeared at the Lidl on rue Sainte in Marseille. “I’m waiting for you,” he wrote in a quote-tweet of the original post. JimmyBLLT apologized but it was too late. Words have consequences, even on X. “Where are you? Come on! Do you want to meet in the car park?” Niel responded <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Xavier75/status/1857423903678775354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1857423903678775354%7Ctwgr%5E3667a4cb532ccb409d4e63bde813b886ec51678c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fcall-of-duty%2Fbillionaire-internet-company-boss-turns-up-to-real-life-1v1-against-cod-player-angry-about-lag-2983623%2F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Xavier75/status/1857423903678775354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1857423903678775354%7Ctwgr%5E3667a4cb532ccb409d4e63bde813b886ec51678c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fcall-of-duty%2Fbillionaire-internet-company-boss-turns-up-to-real-life-1v1-against-cod-player-angry-about-lag-2983623%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a brief video</a></span> according to a translation by <em>Dexerto</em>. </p><p>But JimmyBLLT chickened out. He explained that his original tweet was prompted by losing his temper to really bad lag in a <em>Call of Duty</em> match. Even so, he declined to meet the billionaire and give him justice due to a stomach bug and headache. “Sorry I give up,” he wrote.
