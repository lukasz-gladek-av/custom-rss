            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you dig strolling through empty, abandoned places, immersing yourself in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">backrooms vibes</a>, and enjoying all that’s weird and liminal, then do I have a game to recommend for you. <i>Dreamcore</i> came out in January of this year and it’s a perfectly good time if you love spooky vibes but aren’t too jazzed about screaming monsters and jumpscares.</p>  <p>Developed by Montralulz, <i>Dreamcore</i> is a directionless, HUD-free wandersim that takes you through strange, abandoned levels that almost feel endless. The game intentionally tries to make you feel lost with its lack of clear-cut instructions on what to do. Strange symbols written on walls, seemingly innocuous signs, odd music, and audio cues are the only thing you’re given to figure out where to go and what to do.</p>

 <p>The levels are so massive, in fact, that I’m thinking I might need to keep some graph paper nearby to map out these spaces. I’ve only completed one level thus far, “Dreampools” which is a labyrinth of tiled walls, random pools, and the uncanny use of diffused lighting that often makes those <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-graphics-mods-pc-rtx-4090-1851133618">wild <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> mods</a> or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/better-than-dead-trailer-controversial-bodycam-microprose-2000617981">odd bodycam-footage game</a> look disturbingly close to reality.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636652" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636652"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636652">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And though the game has no jumpscares, it’s still plenty capable of freaking you out–especially with some of the odd objects you’ll come across, like a massive smiley-face ball that, while certainly not intimidating, just feels…wrong. Is it watching me?</p>

 <p>With so few things to actually do in these spaces other than walk around, the real challenge here is not losing your mind and staying focused on slowly unraveling where you should go, following what looks interesting in the hope that you’ll find something unique. It reminds me a bit of <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, but with far simpler environments and the narrative elements ripped out. You often have the sense you’re being watched, that maybe someone’s been here before, and that there’s something you <i>should</i> do, but you can’t quite put your finger on it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636647">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There are currently three worlds to explore: the aforementioned “Dreampools,” an endless expanse of empty suburban homes and white picket fences in “Eternal Suburbia,” and “Playrooms,” described as “a sequence of spaces inspired by children’s play areas, recreated with an artificial and silent aesthetic.” More levels are on the way.</p> <p>So if the spooky season has you in the mood for exploring some creepy spaces without things screaming in your face, and you like a bit of the avant garde, <i>Dreamcore</i> might just be up your alley.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-tips-guide-battle-shiny-wild-zone-2000636641</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/13-things-to-know-before-starting-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1328125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>makes some pretty notable changes to the series’ typical formula. Its battles take place in real-time, it makes the Mega Evolution mechanic a cooldown, and it has several different mission types to juggle while you’re catching and training monsters. That means even series veterans are starting from zero on some things, so before you head into Lumiose City, here are a few helpful tips to make the most of your stay at Hotel Z.</span></p> <h2><b>Read up on </b><b><i>Pokémon X</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Y</i></b><b>’s story</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is essentially a direct sequel to 2013’s </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. The entire game takes place in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired metropolis you pass through in the original 3DS RPGs. There are returning characters and storylines that come up in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s stories and sidequests, so if you’ve never played through the original Kalos games or haven’t played them in a while, I recommend either reading a summary or watching a recap as a refresher. That way, you’ll know why it’s significant that AZ is running your hotel, or that Emma has a full-time detective job, among other bigger reveals later on.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636650"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636650">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Prepare yourself: This game is handholdy for a while</b></h2> <p><span>Sometimes I wish </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games would give me the option to interrupt NPCs with a Ron Swanson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEhHEOIYgMY"><span>“I know more than you”</span></a><span> when they insist on tutorializing every little thing. Like, aw, you think I don’t know what a Potion is, or that I’m not on a first-name basis with every Nurse Joy from here to Kanto? And</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s tutorial is particularly time-consuming, essentially taking up hours. You’ll be dragged around the city by your companions for several in-game days as you’re taught the ins and outs of everything </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has to offer. Your Rotom phone will stop you from venturing too far from the intended path, and it will get very, very frustrating. But when it comes to an end, the rest of the city is open to you right off the bat.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Your moves do different things than you’re used to</b></h2> <p><span>Since </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has a real-time battle system, some classic attacks have been tweaked to fit this new setup. For example, buff moves that once affected your Pokémon for a certain number of turns are now calculated in real-time, lasting however many seconds rather than turns. As you teach your party new moves, familiarize yourself with how they work in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, because they might be slightly different than what you’re used to.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Positioning and timing are everything</b></h2> <p><span>When you give your Pokémon commands, they will move to somewhere on the field that puts them in the right spot to execute the attack based on your opponent’s current position. However, if your opponent moves out of the way, the attack will miss. So rather than accuracy being determined by backend dice rolls, you see the attack land or not as you’re executing it. As such, a big part of learning how to best utilize every attack in your arsenal is understanding where you should be standing when you use it, and keeping an eye on your opponent’s maneuvers and cooldowns to make sure it’s timed well. Some enemies know moves like Protect that will shield them from your attacks, but they will be on a cooldown, so if you can bait your opponent into using it on a weaker move, you’ll have an opening for a counterattack.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636648">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Find attack orders that act as combos</b></h2> <p><span>This new position-based gameplay means that simply attacking at random and cycling through your cooldowns is not always the best play. As you cultivate your Pokémon’s movesets, finding attacks that can synergize together to create combos can help you get the leg up on your opponents. For example, right now, my Pikachu knows Quick Attack, Nuzzle, and Spark. One of my go-to strategies in battles is to have him use Quick Attack to get in close to an enemy, use that closeness to Nuzzle them into a paralyzed state, then use Spark to run out of the fight with a destructive, electric dash. This combo lets Pikachu be a bit of a hit-and-run character that can get in, do some damage, then retreat to safety. Knowing how your moves can work together is just as important as type coverage, and discovering those will take some experimentation.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Stop locking on as a pseudo dodge</b></h2> <p><span>To target enemies on the field, you’ll have to lock onto them with ZL. Doing this will make your active Pokémon square up against whoever you’re looking at, and they’ll stay relatively close to this foe so they’re ready to execute any commands you give them. If you find your partner is getting slapped around and should get out of the scrap, simply stop locking onto an enemy, and your Pokémon will run back to your side. Make sure you’re also out of the way of whatever attack is incoming, too, though.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>You can reach any clothing store once you have free rein&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>The fashion in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is pretty great. It’s a definite upgrade from </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which forced all of us to wear school uniforms. New fits are expensive, but the game is pretty generous about letting you buy whatever clothes you want pretty quickly. Once you’re able to freely roam Lumiose City, you can reach every store without issue. Make a shopping day of running around the city and trying stuff on. Clothes are no longer gender-locked in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, either, so you can wear whatever you want.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636651"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636651">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>You’ll unlock time skip later</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>loves to withhold basic functions for several gameplay hours, including a time skip feature that lets you skip to the night of its day/night cycle. You can only engage in trainer battles during the night, and some wild Pokémon only come out when the sun is gone, so there will be times when you wish you could just sit on a bench and wait for nightfall. I can tell you that you will be able to do that eventually, but for the first few hours, you’ll get an in-game warning that it’s not the time to be resting every time you try and sit down. Once you’re able to sit on a bench without someone yelling, you’ll be able to skip to evenings or hang out with your Pokémon friends on the bench and take photos.</span></p> <h2><b>If you haven’t heard already, Shiny Pokémon don’t despawn</b></h2> <p><span>Shiny Pokémon just became a lot easier to capture in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and it’s because they <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142">no longer despawn</a>. These alternate-colored monsters have a low spawn rate, but in Lumiose City, they’ll stay on the map until you either defeat them or capture them, rather than disappearing as the map refreshes. You can lose a battle, leave a wild zone, or shut the game down entirely, and Shinies will be right where you left them. The hunters have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-despawn-afk-exploit-wild-zone-2000636610"><span>already been exploiting this</span></a><span>, but even if you’re a casual Shiny collector, this will be helpful to your efforts.</span></p>

 <h2><b>More Wild Zones will open as the game progresses</b></h2> <p><span>Though you can go just about anywhere in Lumiose City early on, you won’t find some of your favorite Pokémon right off the bat. The Wild Zone areas where Pokémon reside will open up as you progress through the story, and later ones will feature monsters you couldn’t find in the early hours. It does mean that popular Pokémon aren’t available until much later, so if you can’t find a specific one, just know that more of these zones will appear as you keep going.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636649">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Some story missions pause the day/night cycle</b></h2> <p><span>This isn’t a foolproof rule, but it’s something I noticed when I was running around Lumiose City and hadn’t received any notifications that the sun was getting low and the metropolis would turn into a battle zone. I had been neglecting a story mission that was set to take place during the day to do some side quests; then, when it dawned on me that time hadn’t passed, I realized the game world’s clock had seemingly been frozen until I went to deliver a package to a friend. Sure enough, the sun started setting shortly after I completed the quest. I tested this on a later story mission and noticed the sun was moving as it should, so this isn’t a universal truth. Just keep in mind that sometimes you might need to finish a story mission before the evening will come, or you can use it to your advantage to keep the sun shining while you run some daytime errands.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Photo mode is essentially a first-person mode</b></h2> <p><span>There have been times in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>when I’ve wanted to examine some objects in the environment that were a bit far away in the game’s usual third-person camera angle. However, if you open photo mode with the minus button, you’ll shift to a first-person perspective that you can walk around in. This is helpful if you want a closer look at an area </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-arceus-lumiose-museum-ingo-hisui-2000636160"><span>or museum display</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>You can pick up lost Poké Balls from collectors</b></h2> <p><span>Part of Lumiose City’s redevelopment plan is that there are now Poké Ball collectors stationed outside the Pokémon Center. These guys are keeping the city clean by picking up trash and spare Poké Balls that hooligans leave lying around the city. If you throw one of these capturing devices and miss, or a Pokémon breaks out of its hold, these guys will be holding onto them at the Center. Before you go stocking up on Poké Balls, check in with them to see if they have any of your litter on hand. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last night, as I browsed the Xbox Store on my Series X, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-october-2025-ninja-gaiden-grinch-price-2000633269">I spotted the newly released Grinch game, which is now available on Game Pass</a>. Curious how players were receiving the not-so-great-looking family-friendly Christmas platformer, I decided to check out the user reviews. What I stumbled into was a warzone filled with shots at Xbox’s recent price hikes and way too many people wanting to fuck the Grinch.</p> <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures</em> was a sloppy co-op platformer that had few fans and was promptly forgotten after it launched. But now it’s back and updated and is being sold as a new game with a new subtitle: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-grinch-christmas-adventures-merry-mischievous-edition/9ppjp7x77nnb"><em>Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em></a>. I’m not sure how many people were clamoring for a new version of this bleh Grinch game, but it’s here just in time for Halloween. It is also one of the first games to be added to Game Pass after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">massive price increase earlier this month</a>, which explains why so <em>many</em> user reviews for <em>TGCAM&amp;ME</em> (as the kids call it) are dunking on the subscription service.</p> <hr> <blockquote><p>“$30 A MONTH FOR THIS???? A GAME THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AWFUL 360 MOVIE TIE IN GAME?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣”</p>  <p>“BE ACTUALLY REAL XBOX. Awful clunky game about the grinch in the middle of october????? I AM THE SECOND REVIEW?????? 50% PRICE INCREASE. UBISOFT COLLECTION WITH 50% BOARD GAMES. I AM LEAVING THE SERVICE. THERE ARE FISH HOOKED UP TO WIRES RUNNING EVERYTHING AT THE XBOX H.Q. APPARENTLY IM SUBSCRIBED TO XBOX GAME PASS BABIES WITH DAY ONE DROPS OF THE GRINCH. UNACCEPTABLE . P.S if you dislike this review i’m automatically assuming ur a dev. “It’s for kids” argument DOES NOT WORK AS IT IS SLOP AND WHAT PARENT IS GONNA SPEND 30 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THIS”</p> <p>“Bruh. You’re telling me for 30 dollars a month? I get this?…. Yeah, I’m glad my ultimate ends the 23rd. I got BF6 and multiplayer access all i need.”</p> <p>“Lolz. Ms wants $30 a month for this clunky ****?👀”</p> <p>“$30 4 this?? Cancel Gamepass.”</p> <p>“50% price hike for the Grinch is CRAZY. If xbox is raising the prices they better start putting out games that aren’t this”</p> </blockquote> <p>While these reviews make some sense–people are mad about the price increase and are lashing out at being given a bad shovelware game right in the wake of it–I can’t as easily explain why there are also so many horny reviews for this updated Grinch platformer. Seriously, what the heck is going on? Here’s just some of what I found. Be warned, a lot of this is NSFW. Oh, and the first two reviews below are the very first two reviews you’ll see on Xbox and the website as of this story’s publication. Merry Christmas, kids!</p> <hr> <blockquote> <p>“Grinch took my v card. He sat me down and bounced that grussy on it.”</p> <p>“My Parents Love the Grinch. My parents had a little too much egg nog and stayed up ALL night with Mr. Grinch. They said his heart grew 3 sizes! I woke up once and heard my mom yelling, ‘You’re a mean one, you’re a mean one!’ They must’ve had a good time, though, because I’ve never seen my parents smile so much!”</p> <p>“The Grinch. The Grinch assaulted me in a bad area…”</p> <p>“GOATED. Watched this green ahh hunk o’ junk bounce that mcboy grus ALL OVER max’s red rocket. Best 30 a month”</p> <p>“Grinch grew 3 sizes alright. 3 sizes in my Christmas stocking stuffer if you know what im sayin 10/10 would Grinch again”</p> <p>“Horny. He made me wet”</p> <p>“I stole lakes v card. The Grinch stole Lake v card”</p> <p>“This game gave me hard b0ner. The Grinch turned me on”</p> <p>“Something in my pants keeps moving. While I was playing as the Grinch, a snake kept growing in my pants. I decided to put it in my mouth and it tastes like BBC!”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, I’m not sure what else to add to all of this. I guess this is what I get for reading the user reviews on a Grinch Xbox game. My bad, everyone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-pro-plus-microsd-card-with-adapter-drops-to-just-0-07-per-gb-likely-clearing-out-stock-2000635774</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-pro-plus-microsd-card-with-adapter-drops-to-just-0-07-per-gb-likely-clearing-out-stock.1328014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of space as a creator or gamer is never ideal; it kills your momentum and affects your productivity. An easy way to make sure that never happens is to invest in a high-capacity, high-speed memory card. Right now, Amazon is offering a solid deal on one of the best in the category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD memory card plus adapter is down to $75, which is 38% off its regular price</a>. You’re saving $45 on a solution that fixes your storage problems for the long term, but the deal won’t be around for long. We suggest acting fast to grab it for less while you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Paired With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>1TB capacity is more than enough to house tons of high-resolution media content, games, important documents, programs, and so much more. You get read speeds up to 180MB/s and write speeds up to 130MB/s when used with compatible Samsung readers, meaning you won’t have to deal with frustrating wait times or an overall slow performance. If you’re using it with a GoPro or drone, these translate into smooth 4K UHD video capture and quicker burst shots. Even better, it is UHS-I, U3, V30, and A2 rated, so you can also run apps directly from the card on Android devices.</p>
<p>The included SD card plays nicely with your computer, handheld gaming console, tablet, drone, etc. Basically, if your device has a microSD or SD card slot, you’re good to go. Just note that this version isn’t compatible with the latest Nintendo Switch 2 yet.</p>



<p>The card is also built to last. It’s water, temperature, X-ray, magnet, drop, and wearout proof, so everyday wear and tear won’t affect the performance. It can handle a few splashes and drops without throwing a fit, which makes it great to take with you on the go.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re a creative, work professional, or just someone whose storage needs are growing and want a solution that won’t give up on you this is a smart pickup. The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD offers the right mix of speed, performance, and space. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">You really won’t have to deal with that “storage full” message for a while. It is now down to $75, after a whopping $45 discount.</a> We don’t see it go for less than $100 often, so this is definitely a rare sight. Just be sure to grab it for less while you can.</p>
