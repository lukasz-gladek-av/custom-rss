              <p>It’s time for your monthly reminder that your Amazon Prime subscription also comes with a bunch of free games. And in many cases, while that “free” perhaps deserves scarequotes for falling under a subscription fee for a monstrously evil corporation, they’re actually yours to keep forever, with no DRM, and no requirement to keep up your sub. That’s true for eight of this month’s offerings, including&nbsp;<em>Civilization III </em>and&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition.</em></p> <p>The reason for this proper, actual ownership is Prime partners with GOG for a lot of the games it includes in the subscription, meaning that you’re getting a code that allows you to download a DRM-free version of the game that boots from an .exe, rather than requiring any launchers or proprietary software. So while you may observe that&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> is a 24-year-old game, and as such perhaps not quite matching the sorts of games added to services like PS Plus or Game Pass, in this case you’re getting&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> to&nbsp;<em>keep</em>. You could also point out that the game is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">currently available on GOG for $0.75</a>, which is approximately 185 times cheaper than an annual Prime subscription, and there I couldn’t argue back.&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em>, however, is $25, so that’s definitely a sweeter deal. And, you know, as much as that game definitely shouldn’t have been called “<em>Thief</em>,” and as embarrassing as its <em>The Crow</em> cosplay may have been, it’s actually a pretty decent game in its own right.</p> <p>Amazon Prime likes to make it as confusing as possible to acquire your freebies, releasing the games in four separate batches across the month, guaranteeing you to forget at least some of them. It also removes other games from the selection at the same times, really keeping you on your toes. But the two headline games for August are <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">both there to grab right now</a>, along with big names added in July like&nbsp;<em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> and&nbsp;<em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em>. Also coming later this month are&nbsp;<em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em>–an expandalone entry in Travis Baldtree’s legendary&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like series–and last year’s deckbuilding roguelite&nbsp;<em>Necroking</em>. Here’s the full list of games for August:</p> <p><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>The Academy: The First Riddle</em> (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 14</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Filthy Animals – Heist Simulator</em> (Epic Games Store)</li> <li><em>Tin Hearts</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Necroking&nbsp;</em>(GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 21</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective&nbsp;</em>(Amazing Games App)</li> <li><em>Silver Box Classics</em> (GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 28</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Heroes of Loot 2</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Fantasy Empires</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>City Legends: The Ghost of Misty Hill Collector’s Edition</em> (Legacy Games)</li> </ul> <p>You also get a bunch of games via the Amazon cloud gaming doodad, Luna, which rotate in and out. It currently contains&nbsp;<em>Saints Row: The Third</em>,&nbsp;<em>SkateBIRD</em>,&nbsp;<em>Overcooked! 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, among others.</p>

              <p>Nintendo, apparently dissatisfied with being a stalwart of nearly every school child’s life, is aiming even younger. A new range of products under the banner of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/index.html"><em>My Mario</em></a> has been announced, including wooden block toys, board books, and a Switch and mobile app that’ll let kids mess with Mario’s face, all focused on a preschool market. Gotta get ’em young and impressionable.</p> <p>Initially launching in Japan, the physical toys will be available in select Nintendo stores, but will almost inevitably find their way to international markets soon enough. The range includes plastic crockery, a mini-backpack, rattle plushies, and super-adorable teeny clothing, so you can deck your toddler out as a nearly-walking Nintendo billboard.</p> <p>The app, which is confirmed as coming to Switch and iOS, lets little kiddos goof around with Mario’s face, pulling and stretching the poor plumbers various features, causing him to react in different ways. It sounds super-basic, which is precisely what kids that age will want, reacting to their experimental input. Also, it’ll be free, so they can keep their complaints to themselves.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616597" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616597"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616597">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This new range launches in Japan on August 26, and will include the most beautiful-looking building block sets, but each block is also an amiibo! There’s a Mario, Toad, Yoshi, Luigi and Peach, along with items like&nbsp;? blocks and green pipes, letting your kid build up a gaming scene, or just smash them into each other before chewing on the side of Yoshi’s face until the paint wears away. A Mario picture book looks equally well made, each board page interactive in some form. And oh my goodness, I want to go back in time and get the Mario romper suit with a hoodie for when my boy would fit in such things.</p> <p>There’s also a collection of stop-motion animation videos that’ll appear on the My Mario website when it goes live, each about a minute long telling stories about the mustachioed hero, again aimed at the youngest kids.</p> <p>All the physical objects will initially go on sale in Nintendo stores in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, but hopefully Nintendo will see the demand for international customers once everyone realizes those wooden blocks are secret amiibos and adults go insane trying to buy them. It’s unclear if the app will be available in English, but again, it’d be pretty daft not to.</p> <p>I shall never stop finding it incredibly weird that an ambiguously aged, mustache-wearing portly Italian plumber is such a staple of everyone’s lives, and it only gets more strange when aimed at preschoolers. And yet he’s the best! Nintendo’s clearly aiming to ensure kids are fully enculturated before they can even say his name.</p>

              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism-1851787197">controversy erupted</a> around the art for an animated card in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>‘s latest set, Wisdom of Sea and Sky, where a drawing of legendary monster Ho-Oh looked almost identical to that of a piece of commissioned art by a Chinese creator. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">The Pokémon Company swiftly apologized</a>, and announced the art for both the “immersive” Ho-Oh and Lugia cards would be temporarily pulled from the new set, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1950406273150693652%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">while making it extremely clear</a> that the fault for the issue did not lie with the artist. Now, both cards have been added to the mobile app, with new art by the same artist.</p> <p>Every set of cards in&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> comes with at least one so-called immersive card: a card that when tapped on comes to life, showing a short but elaborate animation that eventually loops back around to the original image. They’re absolutely magical, and offer something real-life cards could obviously never do. For Wisdom of Sea, those cards were intended to feature legendary Pokémon Ho-oh and Lugia, the two mascot characters from 2000’s <em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>. However, when the artist whose Ho-Oh drawing had been so clearly been copied drew attention to this, both immersive cards were pulled from the set at the eleventh hour–the result being both cards featuring nothing but some placeholder text and a black screen instead of an animation. It was clearly embarrassing for the company. TPCi made it clear at the time that the responsibility for the issue lay entirely with themselves, providing dodgy reference materials for the artist to work with.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616592"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616592">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It was odd at the time that both cards were pulled, given no accusations had been made about the Lugia art, but today’s new cards feature a brand new piece of art for that Pokémon too, suggesting TPCi noticed something had been amiss there.</p>

 <p>That’s all been fixed now, with both cards added to the set overnight, featuring a brand new pieces of Ho-Oh and Lugia art from the same artist, the excellent Sie Nanahara. When you launch the app today, a very small patch will be added, and if you already pulled the cards you’ll find the new art and animations will appear.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We'd like to share a new update with you. Please take a look. 🙇 <a href="https://t.co/Gh6wgL7G3Z">pic.twitter.com/Gh6wgL7G3Z</a></p> <p>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1953683542182924568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>By sheer luck I’d pulled both immersive cards already, so when I started&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> first thing this morning, as is my routine, I was able to watch both animations, and they’re both utterly splendid. Each shows the legendary pocket monster either descending from the sky or rising from the sea to meet their counterpart, with all manner of other Pokémon appearing along the way. (Including, in the Lugia animation, my beloved Mantine.) Oddly enough, those strange rectangular artifacts on the original Ho-Oh card remain, the elements sliding apart as the animation begins.</p> <p>Sie Nanahara is responsible for all the incredible art in both cards, which is clearly a stunning amount of work, and includes a brand new rendition of Ho-Oh and Lugia. While <em>Pokémon</em> card art is usually based on each artist’s own vision, when it comes to the immersive cards it’s become clear that far more precise instructions are provided, and this is how things went wrong. It’s excellent that Nanahara has been able to react so quickly to demonstrate her skill, and hopefully this whole messy incident will result in her receiving far more work.</p>
