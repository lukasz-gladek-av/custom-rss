But one of the most essential aspects isn’t your class or abilities; it’s the gear you wield. If you’re rocking standard-tier gear, you’re in for a bad time. You need to up your game by farming uniques in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> to stand toe-to-toe with end-game bosses and other players.</p><h2 id="h6748"><a id=""></a><strong>Increase your odds of acquiring unique item drops in PoE 2</strong></h2><p>While you’re not guaranteed to receive a unique drop from any activity in the game, you can increase your odds through farming, utilizing key items, and gambling a bit with your gold. The latter is, of course, one of the more challenging and bland ways to gain power, but some people like that challenge.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e23fc5dd2cfa9fafb63a4e751a3a61ea" data-recommend-id="image://e23fc5dd2cfa9fafb63a4e751a3a61ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fighting the Mighty Silverfist boss in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fighting the Mighty Silverfist boss in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e23fc5dd2cfa9fafb63a4e751a3a61ea" data-recommend-id="image://e23fc5dd2cfa9fafb63a4e751a3a61ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fighting the Mighty Silverfist boss in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The most common way for most players to obtain a rare, unique item in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is by farming. You can either farm high-level enemies throughout key zones, or farm bosses across the campaign and the countless optional bosses scattered about each act. In total, there are around 100 bosses in the game, and they all have a chance to drop rare and unique items that bolster your power levels.</p><p>It’s usually best to visit a zone that’s two or three levels below your current one; that way, you stand a chance at farming rather than simply surviving an enemy’s onslaught. Furthermore, choose a boss you genuinely enjoy fighting, as you’ll wind up repeating the battle repeatedly by clearing the instance and starting a fresh one.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="455b19492ee22e6a22bab4a44015d4be" data-recommend-id="image://455b19492ee22e6a22bab4a44015d4be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A unique random shield in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A unique random shield in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="455b19492ee22e6a22bab4a44015d4be" data-recommend-id="image://455b19492ee22e6a22bab4a44015d4be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A unique random shield in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>An Orb of Chance is a rare gemstone-like item that offers a chance to evolve a normal item into a unique item, or outright destroy the item.

No other console has gone on this strong and this consistently for this long, and none of it might have been possible without the constellation of factors that serendipitously collided to make the Switch launch one for the history books.</p><p>First there was the drama surrounding Nintendo, the storied gaming company whose name had once been synonymous with “video game console,” but whose Wii U had bombed so spectacularly that many thought it should exit the hardware business entirely. At only 13.56 million units sold, the white box with the clunky tablet controller performed even worse than the GameCube. Nintendo’s handheld at the time, the 3DS, was similarly its worst performing portable ever, though by a much smaller margin. </p><p>Nintendo had long ago abandoned the gaming graphics arms race, but by the mid-2010s it seemed like it had abandoned common sense as well, taking overly ambitious swings at superfluous hardware gimmicks instead of making decent hardware in service of great games. The fact that the Switch did exactly that, bringing Nintendo franchises into HD for the first time ever, felt like a remarkable coup considering the basement-level expectations coming out of the Wii U era. </p><p>But it also made a great first impression based on a novel insight: portable gaming doesn’t have to be secondary. The conventional wisdom at the time was that no one wanted to play big, deep games on the go. They had <em>Candy Crush</em> for that. The rise of smartphone gaming was thought to be one of the main factors in dooming the PlayStation Vita. It turns out that Sony just didn’t make the right games. Being able to take console-like experiences from home on the go, or just to the bedroom, made the sleek but otherwise humble-looking Switch feel revolutionary.</p><figure id="" data-id="91faaf8fdf1ebe4539e31a4b030e917d" data-recommend-id="image://91faaf8fdf1ebe4539e31a4b030e917d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Someone plays BotW in bed.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And there was no better showpiece for that than<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a></span>. Most systems launch with a few visually dazzling but mechanically shallow games. They gesture at what the new tech is capable of but belie the developers’ inexperience in being able to completely capitalize on it. Few console launches get full-fledged sequels in one of the biggest franchises around, let alone a GOTY that redefines a genre. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was all of those things, and eight years later its reverberations throughout the medium are still being felt.</p><p>The real magic of the Switch launch was feeling both of these things smashed together: a mechanically deep, richly emergent, gorgeous open-world adventure on a small tablet that could (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-is-your-favorite-gaming-handheld-of-all-time-1844962828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-is-your-favorite-gaming-handheld-of-all-time-1844962828">almost</a></span>) fit into your pocket (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-gear-are-you-using-with-your-new-nintendo-switch-1793234536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-gear-are-you-using-with-your-new-nintendo-switch-1793234536">or sock</a></span>).<em> Breath of the Wild</em> was a return to form for a series that had previously grown stiff and predictable, on a device that showed leaving the graphical arms race behind wasn’t a retreat from making great games, but the opposite. Hundreds of amazing games came to the Switch in the years that followed, but have any of them ever topped that feeling of first leaving the Great Plateau in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>? The fact that it’s even still debatable is remarkable. </p><p>There’s one final, less impressive reason why the Switch 2 will have a hard time living up to the  original Switch’s launch window hype: there’s no graveyard of Wii U games to cannibalize this time around. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> was ported to Switch within its first two months, eventually becoming its most popular game ever. Plenty of other first-party Wii U orphans have been rescued this way, filling out the Switch’s release calendar as needed while Nintendo consolidated its console and portable game development teams into a single, streamlined machine. </p><p>Maybe the Switch 2 will launch with a brand-new 3D <em>Mario </em>whose sprawling levels and inventive designs rival those of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Maybe <em>Mario Kart 9</em> will revolutionize the racing series the way <em>Breath of the Wild </em>did for<em> Zelda</em>. Maybe somehow, someway, a new mainline <em>Zelda</em> will also hit the Switch 2 in its first year even though <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>will only be three years old. In any case, though, it’s still only possible to experience the feeling of playing those types of games on a handheld for the first time once, and that already happened eight years ago. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
