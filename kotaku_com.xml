              <p>We all deserve a pair of top-notch, headphones. Don’t be the person on the subway blasting TikToks at full volume. With a quality set of noise-canceling Beats Studio Pro headphones, you can enjoy watching some guy’s top five movie twists of all time in peace, without disturbing those around you. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/">Right now, you can save a massive 49% on a pair of Beats Studio Pros over at Amazon, with each set priced at just $180.</a></p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro headphones support active noise cancellation, so you can filter out distracting background noises when you really want to focus in on whatever it is you’re listening to. This is great for when flying to overcome the loud noise of the plane engine as well as when just trying to ignore nearby conversations in a chatty office. Then when you do want to engage with the world once more, you can switch over to transparency mode to let outside noises come through.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The personalized spatial audio utilizes dynamic head tracking, ensuring you are placed right in the middle of a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience. Through the USB-C connection, you’ll enjoy pristine, lossless audio, making every track sound sharper and more detailed.</p>

<p>The multi-function on-ear controls allow you to effortlessly manage your music playback, activate Siri, or take phone calls—all without fumbling through your device. The voice-targeting microphone isolates your voice with incredible precision, ensuring that the person on the other end of your call hears only you, even in noisy, crowded environments.</p>
<h2>Match Your Style</h2>
<p>With a wide selection of colors to choose from, you can find a pair that fits your personal aesthetic. The classic black is always a reliable and timeless choice, but there are other fun options if you want to switch things up. Warm, earthy tones like deep brown or sandstone can complement your winter wardrobe, while bold options like matte white offer a fresh, eye-catching look. Personally, I’m partial to the two-toned sand gray.</p>



<p>When it comes to battery life, you’re covered. You’ll get a whopping 40 hours of total listening time before needing to recharge, which is more than enough for long flights or all-day listening sessions. And if you find yourself in a situation where you forgot to charge them and need your headphones immediately, don’t worry. Just 10 minutes of Fast Fuel charging will give you 4 hours of playback time. No more stressing over a dead battery.</p>
<p>Connecting these headphones to your devices is incredibly easy, thanks to their NFC compatibility. Simply tap your phone or tablet to pair it with the Beats Studio Pro. Whether you’re using an Apple or Android device, and you will be ready to go in seconds.</p>
<p>Normally, the Beats Studio Pro Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones are priced at $350, but right now, Amazon is offering them at a steep discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/">You can grab a pair for $170 off, bringing the price down to just $180.</a> That’s an impressive 49% savings, making it the perfect time to upgrade your audio experience.</p>

              <p>It’s officially last-minute-panic time with just a week left to get your presents bought and wrapped, and the number of items on Amazon with the “arrives before Christmas” is dwindling, and dwindling&nbsp;<em>fast</em>. Our advice? Don’t panic, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">take a quick look at this awesome 36% off deal on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet</a>. It’s one of those rare tablets that’s kid-friendly while not being a glorified toy, so it’s a stellar $140 last-minute option for friends and family from young to old.</p>
<p>This 11-inch tablet comes with a robust 7,040mAh battery for hours of games, streaming, or actual work. Split-screen capability lets you run and see multiple apps simultaneously, and the slim and lightweight construction is good for little hands while also being tough enough to endure the occasional knocks and bumps that go hand in hand with kids using tech devices.</p>

<h2>Travel Sanity Saver</h2>
<p>There’s really not a bad time to share the Galaxy A9+ with the kids, but the time for it to truly shine is when you’re taking a trip and need something — <em>anything</em> — to maintain sanity as you’re buckled in for a long flight or drive. The Galaxy Tab A9+ isn’t one of those kids-only tablets that keeps its allure for a short while before the conversation turns to “I want to use&nbsp;<em>your</em> tablet.” Nor is it a high-priced device that you hand over very reluctantly for fear of damage. Pass it to the backseat, or hand it across the aisle of the plane, fire up the Samsung Kids app, and rest easy while they’re engrossed in only the content you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>Chances are that will include some streaming or videos, and the Galaxy A9+ brings that out in vivid fashion across its generous 11-inch screen with 1200p resolution and a brisk 90Hz refresh rate. The built-in speakers are loaded with Dolby Atmos tech for cinema-quality sound, or you can easily pair the A9+ tablet with wireless headphones or earbuds to keep the sound private. Preloading the Galaxy A9+ is easy when you have a generous 64GB of built-in storage and microSD card expansion options.</p>



<h2>Do It All for $150</h2>
<p>Once back in your hands (assuming you can actually get it back), the Galaxy A9+ is a stellar midrange tablet at an entry-level price. It’s especially good if you’re adding it to other Samsung tech products, from big-screen TVs to smart home devices, smartphones, and wireless earbuds. Casting content from the Galaxy A9+ to a Samsung smart TV is remarkably easy, and you can hand off calls and texts from a Samsung smartphone to the Galaxy Tab A9+ and take them across the house, even if you leave the phone behind.</p>
<p>Last-minute holiday shopping panic isn’t fun. But the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is, for adults and kids alike. It’s also the cure for your shopping anxiety because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">Amazon’s offering it for a crazy low $140 price and they can get it to you in time to make it under the tree.</a></p>
