              <p>Advent calendars have become essential for building holiday excitement with kids, but finding one that offers genuine value beyond cheap chocolates or throwaway trinkets is harder than you’d think. LEGO’s approach solves this problem by delivering 24 actual building surprises that kids can play with long after December ends.</p>
<p>Amazon initially offered a modest discount when the LEGO City Advent Calendar 2025 launched in September, followed by another price drop last week. Now, for Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/">the retailer has slashed the price even further to $20, down from $34</a>. This <strong>40% discount</strong> represents a record low that you won’t see again before the holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twenty-Four Days of Building Joy</h2>
<p>The LEGO City Advent Calendar<strong> turns the countdown to Christmas itself into a daily building challenge</strong>. Behind each of the 24 doors is a surprise for kids aged five and older, from minifigures to mini builds and holiday accessories. There’s even <strong>Santa and Mrs. Claus minifigures</strong>, perennial crowd-pleasers, and costumed characters in irreverent dress such as polar bear, reindeer, and holiday tree.</p>



<p>Each surprise includes building instructions printed right in the calendar window itself so there is never any need for instructional booklets or digital apps separately. This considerate touch makes it ideal for little builders who are just beginning their LEGO adventures or for hectic mornings when you do not wish to go searching for instructions. Children can pull their door, read right off just what they must build and finish their surprise of the day all on their own before schooltime.</p>
<p>The included playmat opens up to <strong>provide a holiday-themed backdrop for all the builds</strong>. This turns the calendar from its constituent part list into an integrated play scene in which children may host holiday parties and concoct seasonal stories. The playmat puts the builds in context and invites creative storytelling in addition to building the parts. Your child may position the minifigures, place the mini builds, and develop stories that change over the month as more elements arrive in the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Each of the 186 elements</strong> in this set is designed to serve the purpose of facilitating imaginative storytelling. Mini builds could consist of holiday ornaments, wintery accessories or seasonal buildings that populate the LEGO City landscape. Together, these pieces accumulate to form an entire wintertime celebration scene once Christmas is near. Its real value, however, is that all of these elements all remain part of the LEGO City sets once December is finished. Children at that point may use these minifigures and accessories in their own LEGO inventory, beyond just the advent calendar itself.</p>
<p>For just $20 in this Prime Big Deal Day deal, you’re getting <strong>186 LEGO pieces and 24 days of fun for just under a dollar each surprise</strong>. These all-time-low prices won’t linger once demand climbs closer to the holidays and inventory is gone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-hits-meta-hard-the-quest-3s-vr-bundle-just-got-suddenly-a-lot-cheaper.1317097/</guid>

              <p>Virtual reality is slowly carving out its place in the tech world, but let’s be honest: it’s still a niche market. If you’re curious about VR and mixed reality, dropping $4,000 on an Apple Vision Pro that has limited content and unclear use cases doesn’t make much sense. Your better bet is going with the company that’s been all-in on VR from the beginning: Meta.</p>
<p>The <strong>Quest 3S represents the most affordable entry point into Meta’s VR ecosystem</strong>, and for Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon is offering an exclusive <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/">Cardboard Hero Bundle at $299: This package includes the headset plus the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor, and 1,000 shiny rocks for Gorilla Tag, adding $45 worth of in-game content to sweeten the deal</a> +<strong> three months of Meta Horizon Plus</strong> at no cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mixed Reality That Actually Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S bridges the gap between pure virtual reality and the real world through <strong>mixed reality capabilities</strong>. This means you can blend digital objects into your actual environment, playing games where virtual characters interact with your furniture or working on multiple virtual screens while still seeing your room. The headset uses <strong>passthrough cameras to show you your surroundings in high-definition resolution</strong>, which makes the experience feel natural rather than disorienting. You can dial up the immersion and go full VR when you want complete escapism, or keep your environment visible when you need to stay aware of your surroundings.</p>



<p>Meta also fitted the Quest 3S with the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 platform which provides twice the Quest 2’s graphics performance. This means less stuttering in highly demanding games and <strong>sharper in-game detail</strong> that enhances the realism of virtual worlds. Better processing power also allows smoother operation of experiences that would stutter or lag in older headsets for a better immersion even in long gaming sessions or highly detailed virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The home theater-like effect in itself is worth thepurchase for some users. You get to make whatever room is available your own in-home cinema by darkening your space and watching content on a giant and colorful virtual screen. You’re essentially <strong>getting a 100-inch TV that only exists in your headset</strong>. You plug in your USB-C headphones for the 3D-like sounds, or use your regular 3.5mm headphones with your USB-C adapter (available separately) and this is perfect for watching movies.</p>



<p>Physical activities feel comfortable due to the wireless freedom and compact nature: Virtual exercises put your heart rate up with no cables limiting your mobility, and full-body games make your whole living room your playground. <em>Touch Plus Controllers</em> deliver realistic feedback and precise pinch and tilt for games involving fine motor controls and hand tracking enables you to move menus and interact with content with your hands alone.</p>
<p><strong>Meta included strong parental controls</strong> within the system so that you could control screen time, see daily use, and assign permissions for your household members. You could also initiate multiple user profiles and sharing accounts for content, so it is simple for all household members to have their own customized experience. Accounts for users who are 10 years and older are turned on and special safety recommendations are on hand online.</p>
<p>Your membership entitles <strong>you to three months of Meta Horizon Plus at no cost</strong>&nbsp;which entitles you to immediate access to a seasonal game library, monthly content drops, and special experiences. You get to test the library in VR for free without additional purchases right away, subject only to eligibility and auto-renewing terms.<br>
At just $299 for the special bundle, the Quest 3S is an affordable portal to VR and mixed reality at just a tiny fraction of the price of competition in headsets.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-1000xm4-is-now-3-times-cheaper-than-the-airpods-max-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-for-prime-day-2000631836</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-1000xm4-is-now-3-times-cheaper-than-the-airpods-max-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-for-prime-day.1317091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The high-end noise-canceling headphone market is more crowded than, say, Times Square during New Year’s Eve celebrations. Apple, Bose, Sonos, Sennheiser, and Sony are all fighting for your attention, each claiming their model is the best. Here’s the reality: <strong>over the past five years, the improvements in high-end ANC headphones have been incremental at best</strong>. A few tweaks here, minor updates there, but nothing revolutionary.</p>
<p>That means buying the latest model doesn’t make sense, especially when a slightly older flagship delivers nearly identical performance at a fraction of the cost. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">Sony’s WH-1000XM4 is on sale for $228, down from $348, during Prime Big Deal Day</a>. To put that in perspective, these headphones cost <strong>almost three times less than Apple’s AirPods Max</strong> while delivering similar performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation that Truly Works in the Real World</h2>
<p>The Sony 1000XM4 incorporates <strong>Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor</strong> tech which employs microphones both externally and internally in each earcup to absorb ambient noise. The earcups then create an inverse sound wave to eliminate the noise before it hits your eardrums. Unlike less expensive alternatives, this dual-sensor method is the distinguishing characteristic of high-end ANC. And Adaptive Sound Control takes it one better and adjusts the level of noise cancellation according to your activity and location.</p>



<p>Battery life is also where the WH-1000XM4 is way better than many competitors: You’re <strong>talking up to 30 hours of playback with the ANC in use</strong>&nbsp;so you could use these ‘phones for an entire week at the workplace and never have to recharge them. There’s quick charge too, and that’s the real convenience aspect: <strong>charge for 10 minutes and you’re getting five hours of playback</strong>. And that’s all through USB Type-C cable, included in the packaging.</p>
<p>The right earcup’s touch controls do it all without having to pull out your phone: You swipe up or down to volume-control, swipe forward or back to skip songs, tap once to pause or start, and tap twice to answer calls. You get used to it in a day or two. The <strong>Speak-to-Chat</strong> is actually brilliant: when you initiate speaking, the headphones automatically pause your tunes and admit background noise so you may converse. When you cease speaking, your tunes start again after a brief pause. You never have to take your headphones off when asked a question, for instance.</p>



<p>Call quality is improved with five in-built microphones and fantastic audio signal processing technology. With cooperative operation, the microphones block background noise and capture your own voice, causing calls to ring out even in background-noisy locations like crowded city intersections or bustling airports.</p>
<p>Sony revised the physical appearance to <strong>minimize pressure points</strong> which is important for long listening sessions. Earcups employ foam, pressure-distributed padding that sits evenly around your ears in place of resting on them directly. The headband does the same along your forehead. These design elements translate to wearing the WH-1000XM4 for hours without pain, and that is critical for long-haul flights or all-day work commutes.</p>
<p>At $228 for Prime Day, these Sony earphones provide flagship performance in an affordable package.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pricier-than-a-macbook-at-launch-microsoft%E2%80%99s-512gb-surface-laptop-is-now-selling-like-a-budget-laptop.1317085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding a laptop that will keep up with your hectic schedule without constantly hunting for an electric outlet is more difficult than it should be: You want one that is built for serious multitasking, video conferencing that won’t make you look like you’re calling from a basement and sufficient battery life to make it through an entire workday plus your nightly Netflix binge.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s latest Surface Laptop meets all these requirements and right now it’s going through an unprecedent price reduction for <em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> on Amazon. The manufacturer just debuted a whopping $400 off its highest-end laptop configuration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4499/">cutting the cost from $1,399 to just $972</a>. This is the configuration with high-end specs such as <strong>512GB SSD storage and the Snapdragon X Elite processor</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4499/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Copilot+ PC Revolution Now Here</h2>
<p>This is not another Surface Laptop refresh: Microsoft is entering its <strong>second computing epoch with Copilot+ PCs</strong> and this 2024 laptop is its most ambitious yet to date when it comes to integrating AI capabilities. The <strong>Snapdragon X Elite processor is 12-core and incorporates a dedicated NPU</strong> (neural processing unit) that does AI tasks on your device, locally.</p>



<p>The 13.8-inch touchscreen display employs vibrant HDR technology concentrated in an ultra-thin form that ensures screen real estate is maximized and doesn’t increase the laptop’s footprint size. With the touch aspect of the display, it changes your dynamics with your work, and it feels second nature to annotate pages of your document with your hand, navigate through web pages, or zoom in on pictures with fluid gestures. With razor-thin bezels, it gives you more viewing real estate in a small form factor, and it makes a difference if you’re looking at trying to display two documents side by side or if you’re editing a detailed spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Battery life has always been a pain point for Windows laptops, but the Surface Laptop flips that narrative: You’re <strong>getting up to 20 hours of usage on a single charge</strong>, which means you can work through an entire day and still have juice left for streaming or gaming in the evening. This extended battery life comes from the efficiency of the Snapdragon X Elite’s ARM-based architecture, which sips power rather than guzzling it like traditional x86 processors.</p>
<p>The Copilot+ features genuinely change how you work: Windows Studio Effects enhances your video calls by improving lighting conditions, canceling background noise and blurring distracting elements in your environment. If you’ve ever taken a call from a poorly lit room or worried about the mess behind you, these features solve those problems in real time. The Recall feature creates an explorable timeline of everything you’ve done on your PC which makes it easy to retrieve that document you worked on last week or find that website you can’t quite remember. Real-time subtitle translation supports 44 languages during video calls or streaming.</p>
<p>At $972, this Microsoft Surface laptop features high-end specs and <strong>up-to-the-minute AI capabilities</strong> in a package that is affordable for more consumers. With this Prime Big Deal Day offer, it is a unique chance to own Microsoft’s flagship laptop at close to average PC prices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/now-far-cheaper-than-a-switch-game-this-15-portable-monitor-lets-you-enjoy-big-screen-play-2000631855</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch became the best-selling console because you can take it anywhere. But here’s the frustration: playing on that small built-in screen, especially when two people are huddled around it, can strain your eyes and diminish the experience. Portable monitors solve this problem by giving you a bigger display that weighs barely more than a notebook: The <em>Forhelp</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/">15.6-inch portable monitor is now on sale for $59, down from its typical price of $79, during Prime Big Deal Day</a>. This screen lets you display your Switch games on a much larger canvas and makes multiplayer sessions actually enjoyable. The same monitor works with your laptop for dual-screen productivity, your PlayStation or Xbox for gaming sessions without hogging the TV.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Display for Everywhere You Go</h2>
<p>The 15.6-inch screen features <strong>1920×1080 Full HD resolution from an innovative IPS matte panel</strong>. This kind of panel technology provides you with a 178-degree viewing angle so colors and contrast do not suffer even if you’re looking at the screen off to the side. This matters if more than one person is looking, or if you’re in a room that doesn’t put you right in front of the screen. This technology produces accurate and vibrant colors that make games and movies appear real life with high detail. The matte finish reduces glare from lights or windows above.</p>



<p>The monitor has various <strong>display modes that adjust to varying circumstances</strong>. Copy mode reflects your main screen, ideal for presentations when you have to display your laptop screen to others in the room during meetings. Extension mode uses the portable monitor as an additional screen, greatly expanding your display real estate for use in productivity activities such as documenting comparisons or having reference materials up and see while you work. HDR mode delivers improved image quality with higher highlights and more natural color reproduction and improves your viewing for video and games.</p>
<p>The screen is equipped with <strong>blue light blocking technology</strong> that eliminates hazardous wavelengths without it having any impact on colors. This is useful in long gaming sessions or if you’re using the screen as another screen for working during the day. Flicker-free tech eliminates the imperceptible screen throb that contributes to eye strain, and you’re able to effortlessly look at content or game for long periods without experiencing that burning, tired feeling that low-end displays create.</p>
<p>Aluminum alloy build is employed for the body that maintains the <strong>overall weight at only 1.52 pounds</strong>. With a measurement of 0.3 inches thin, this screen fits seamlessly in your backpack along with your laptop or Switch. You get to use the magnetic smart cover that does two jobs: it safeguards the screen from scuffs when you’re carrying it and doubles as a stand with two positions for varying the viewing angle. The cover incorporates sturdy PU leather on the outside that gives it that premium look and delivers full coverage protection.</p>



<p>What’s more, there are two full-featured USB-C ports and one mini HDMI port on the monitor. Both video signal and power transmission result from the USB-C connection via a solitary cable and minimize cable mess. You must have equipment that supports Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode in order for the USB-C connection to function. There is universal compatibility with game consoles, older model laptops and non-USB-C video output equipment on the mini HDMI port.</p>
<p>Dual built-in speakers render the use of external audio redundant when on the move. These speakers handle dialogue well and provide adequate volume for personal use, although hard core gamers might still desire the immersion that only headphones provide. These speakers prove handy when rapidly setting up in the case of a hotel room or even in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>Right now for Prime Day, this transportable display is cheaper than many premium competitors and gives you a full second display outcome.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-wont-admit-it-needs-discounts-so-its-quietly-offloading-macbook-airs-through-amazon-2000631829</link>

              <p>Here’s something you likely know: <strong>Apple never goes on sale</strong>. The tech giant carefully guards its premium image by refusing to slash prices on its official website or in its retail stores. But here’s the thing—even Apple needs to boost sales, and that’s where authorized retailers like Amazon come in.</p>
<p>For this October’s <em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> (essentially the fall version of Prime Day), Amazon is offering record-low pricing on the 2025 MacBook Air lineup, and these deals are too good to ignore. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">13-inch model with the new M4 chip and 256GB storage has dropped to $897, down from $999</a>, and<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/"> the 15-inch 256GB version is available for $1,078, reduced from $1,199</a>.</p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Changes Everything</h2>
<p>At the heart of this 2025 MacBook is Apple’s M4 chip which represents a significant leap forward in performance and efficiency. The M4 delivers big improvements when you’re juggling multiple applications or running graphics-intensive games. The chip’s architecture allows for seamless multitasking without the fans kicking in (because there aren’t any) and without draining your battery. Speaking of which, you’re getting up to 18 hours of battery life which means you can work through an entire day and well into the evening without hunting for an outlet.</p>



<p>The screen warrants particular admiration: Both t<strong>he 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch Liquid Retina displays handle one billion colors</strong>, translating to extremely lifelike photos, videos bursting with deep contrast and text that’s crisp enough to minimize eye strain when working for long stretches. The larger 15-inch variant provides additional screen real estate for productivity applications such as working on spreadsheets or designing projects in which you desire multiple windows in sight at all times. When it comes to video conferencing and content creation, the 12MP Center Stage camera automatically positions you in the center of the picture when you’re in motion.</p>
<p>Connectivity is another aspect in which the 2025 MacBook Air excels: <strong>You have two Thunderbolt 4 ports</strong> that manage blazing-fast data transfer rates of up to 40Gbps which is ideal for external storage or high-end monitors. There’s the MagSafe power port that ensures you won’t pull your laptop off the desk if you kick your foot against the cable—the cable automatically disconnects magnetically without causing damage. Wi-Fi 6E support prepares you for the newest router tech with increased speeds and less traffic, and Bluetooth 5.3 ensures seamless connections for wireless peripherals. You’re connectable to up to two external displays as well.</p>



<p>Apple Intelligence is the company’s new personal intelligence system and it is baked right into the MacBook Air. This feature helps streamline your writing, creative expression and daily tasks with groundbreaking privacy protections that ensure your data stays yours (even Apple can’t access it). The system integrates with macOS to make common tasks faster and more intuitive. If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone, the integration becomes even more powerful: iPhone Mirroring lets you control your phone directly from your Mac screen, while Universal Clipboard means you can copy text on your iPhone and paste it on your Mac.</p>
<p>The audio system is backed with <strong>six speakers for Spatial Audio and three microphones</strong>, and it produces an immersive listening experience for music, movies, and games. Speakers deliver exceptionally deep bass and crisp highs for such thin case depths. Both models come with 16GB unified memory and 256GB SSD storage in this configuration, and unified memory architecture allows the system to distribute resources back and forth between processor and render tasks dynamically.</p>
<p>At <strong>these all-time-low Prime Big Deal Day prices</strong>, you’re getting the best laptop technology from Apple at a discount that doesn’t originate from an authorized dealer. They won’t stay on sale like this forever.</p>

              <p>Cutting the cord on cable TV has never been easier, but choosing the right streaming device can feel overwhelming with so many options flooding the market. Amazon launched its Fire TV Stick lineup years ago to compete directly with established players like Roku and Google’s Chromecast, and the battle for your living room has been fierce ever since.</p>
<p>Here’s the twist: while Amazon’s own <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-launched-new-gadgets-yet-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-is-practically-free-at-50-off-2000630324">Fire TV Sticks are hitting record low prices</a> during Prime Big Deal Days, <strong>the retail giant is pushing Roku devices even lower</strong> to clear out remaining inventory from its biggest rival. The Roku Streaming Stick HD has dropped from $29 down to $17, the Streaming Stick 4K fell from $49 to $29, and the Streaming Stick Plus landed at $24 instead of $39.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Differences in Roku’s Lineup of Streaming Sticks</h2>
<p>The <strong>entry-level Roku Streaming Stick HD</strong> is the least costly model at $17, ideal if <strong>you’re working with an older TV that tops off at 1080p resolution</strong> or just don’t worry about 4K content. It streams high-definition content effortlessly on all major platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and thousands of other channels. Its included Roku Voice Remote allows you to search for shows by speaking instead of painstakingly entering using an on-screen keyboard, averting frustration when you’re trying to locate that one film whose name you just couldn’t quite manage to recall. It hooks up via HDMI and is powered from your TV’s USB port or from the included adapter.</p>



<p>Upgrading from the base model to the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> for $29 unlocks significant visual gains if you own a 4K TV. This model is HDR (High Dynamic Range) and Dolby Vision capable, two technologies that achieve massive picture quality improvements beyond resolution bumps. HDR provides greater dynamic range between blacks and whites which results in more realistic pictures with higher-contrast levels. Dolby Vision does one better and adjusts brightness and colour dynamically on a scene- or even frame-by-frame basis, and it looks fantastic in supported content from services like Apple TV Plus, Netflix, and Disney Plus. Long-range Wi-Fi in the specs means that this stick should maintain stable connections even if your router is in another room or on another floor, reducing infuriating buffering that ruins key narrative points.</p>
<p>The <strong>Streaming Stick Plus</strong> at $24 is a tempting compromise with 4K and HDR support but no support for Dolby Vision, so it is relatively less capable in its ultimate picture quality compared to the Streaming Stick 4K, but importantly still much more capable compared to the HD-only base model. There is only real-world practical differentiation in the non-Dolby Vision versus HDR pictures largely on high-end TVs with excellent panel technology, so if your 4K TV is an economy or mid-range model from several years ago, you’re unlikely to see much differentiation in the pictures versus the Plus model and the full 4K model. The Plus model does, however, come with the Voice Remote and has the same massive library of streaming services, free live TV services in the form of the Roku Channel, and private listening in the form of the Roku smartphone app.</p>
<p>Each of these three models gives you access to the Roku platform which is still one of the best streaming interfaces. Installation takes just a minute or two: <strong>stick the stick in your TV’s HDMI port, connect it to your network and start viewing</strong>. compact size makes these sticks disappear completely behind your television with no apparent clutter.</p>
<p>With these aggressive discounts and the fact that non-Prime members have access to these deals, now is truly the perfect time to upgrade your streaming setup.</p>
