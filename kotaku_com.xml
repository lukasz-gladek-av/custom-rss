The raid happened on April 15, and police allegedly even took the YouTuber’s personal phone and didn’t return it until June. <br></p><p>According to Salicini’s video explaining the entire situation, law enforcement in Italy is apparently not required to disclose what he is being charged with or who specifically brought the charges against him until the initial investigation is finished. At that point, a judge would decide to dismiss the case or take it to trial.</p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Salicini about his legal issues. </p><p> The complaint Salicini received from Guardia di Finanza cites him violating Article 171ter of Italian Copyright Law. That same complaint also lists Sony and Nintendo, but it’s possible that Italy’s Ministry of Economy and Finance was responsible for bringing forward the charges against the YouTuber. Salicini believes this is because he has reviewed retro handhelds from companies like Anbernic, which sometimes come pre-loaded with classic game ROMs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946">While emulation is legal</a></span>, ROMs exist in a weird, murky grey area.<br></p><p> The law that Salicini might have violated was written in 1941 and comes with a maximum punishment of €15,000 and up to three years of jail time. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salicini has started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal fees</a></span>. On the fundraiser page, he explained that the Guardia di Finanza is now taking “precautionary measures to block all my social media channels.” He also says he has already contacted a defense attorney and expects that he will have to go to trial.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/youtuber-retro-gaming-jail-time-italy-once-were-nerd-1851786451]]></content:encoded>

It ain’t an easy task, as over 20 million games of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magnus-carlsen-jeans-chess-blitz-championship-fide-1851730179&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magnus-carlsen-jeans-chess-blitz-championship-fide-1851730179">chess</a></span> are played on the platform every single day. But the team has gotten pretty good at detecting cheaters and banning their accounts. </p><p>One interesting stat that Chess.com’s Fair Play team shared in the blog post is that nearly 40 percent of closed accounts are less than two weeks old. This means the team’s methods of finding and punishing naughty players and bots are doing a solid job of catching cheaters early. But Chess.com thinks it can do an even better job at keeping cheaters out. </p><p>“One of the ways we’re tackling this phenomenon is by screening players more frequently early in their journey on the platform,” said Chess.com’s Fair Play team. “This means we’re generating reports for players that essentially serve as checkpoints as they play more games. It is entirely reasonable (and expected) that it may take time for someone to establish their rating, so these checkpoints go beyond games played and rating earned, but also include strength of play and over 100 other gameplay factors.”</p><p>The team also shared that it uses algorithms to look out for extraordinary examples of cheating or inhuman behavior. With only 30 people watching and 20 million games a day, it makes sense that the team would need extra help. All of this is in service of making sure most players who hop onto Chess.com have a good time. Now, the real question is: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639">How many of these cheaters were using anal beads?</a></span> </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/chess-cheaters-100k-banned-monthly-chess-com-anal-beads-1851786443]]></content:encoded>
