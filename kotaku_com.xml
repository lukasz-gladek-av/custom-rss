              <p>Have you heard the whispers? According to my sources, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> has been delayed again.</a>&nbsp;It’s weird, because <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-strauss-zelnick-ceo-take-two-interview-rockstar-games-2000617237">a guy&nbsp;<em>promised</em> me this wouldn’t happen</a>. Anyway, PlayStation Plus subscribers can somewhat console themselves with word from the extremely reliable leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">over at&nbsp;<em>Dealabs</em></a>:&nbsp;<em>GTA V</em> seems to be making its way back onto PS Plus yet again later this month.</p> <p>This is the third appearance of <em>GTA V</em> on PS Plus, last disappearing from the service in May this year. It seems likely that had the game met its original release plan of fall 2025, it would not have returned, so as to push all focus onto <em>GTA</em> VI without a surrogate “free” earlier entry for people to play instead. Then the game was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799">surprise-delayed</a> in May this year to May 2026, and none of that made much sense any more. So, then with the intention of seeing the game come out in May 2026, Rockstar seemingly made plans with Sony to return it to the sub for a bit.</p>

 <p>Except, now that’s gone wrong too! However, what seems definitely impossible is that this news of <em>GTA V</em>‘s return to PS Plus has anything to do with last night’s shock announcement—such things would have been organized long ago. Instead it’s perhaps a rather timely coincidence for Rockstar, given it gives the appearance of saying, “Look, play this one for ‘free’ for a bit to cushion the blow.”</p>

 <p><em>GTA V</em> <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/03/grand-theft-auto-v-game-pass-gtav-enhanced-april-15/">was also added to Microsoft’s Game Pass last year</a>, and has remained their since, rather than following the odd six months on, six months off pattern the game’s had with PlayStation. And even if there had been plans to yoink it from the Xbox subscription some time soon, that’d be a pretty disastrous PR move at this point. So it seems reasonably likely that both PS5 and Xbox players will be able to keep playing for the foreseeable. Although definitely expect it to disappear from both should the game actually manage to come out November 2026, with Rockstar wanting everyone as hungry as possible to spend money on the shiny new game.</p> <p>Or perhaps we’re just six months away from the announcement of the next delay, when&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em> gets slated for May 2027, just in time for it to then get held back again as a PS6 release, and everyone who loved <em>GTA V&nbsp;</em>ages out shortly before the heat death of the universe.</p>

              <p>Advent calendars turn the December countdown into a daily ritual of surprise and anticipation, and LEGO’s Star Wars version delivers on exactly that with a galaxy far, far away twist. This year’s LEGO Star Wars Advent calendar <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5387/">has dropped to an all-time low of $26 on Amazon, slashed from its original $44 price tag</a>.</p>
<p>The calendar is <strong>packed with 24 surprises behind its doors</strong>, and turns each day in December into a mini building adventure that brings iconic droids and characters into your home. LEGO clearly wants to move inventory before Advent begins and that urgency creates an opportunity for anyone planning their holiday celebrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5387/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twenty-Four Days of Galactic Discoveries</h2>
<p>Behind each numbered door waits a Star Wars surprise that builds anticipation throughout the month. You get C-3PO and a Holiday Jawa as minifigures and gives kids immediately recognizable characters to play with right out of the gate. Babu Frik makes an appearance as a LEGO figure, bringing the tiny droidsmith from The Rise of Skywalker into your collection. Five droid figures round out the character lineup including R7-A7, BD-72, a Scrap Battle Droid, BB-8 dressed as a snowman for the holidays, and a Super Battle Droid ready for action.</p>
<p><strong>Eight buildable droids</strong> across several days keep hands busy with construction challenges. Kids will assemble a Pit Droid, Gonk Droid, and Buzz Droid, each with different building techniques that develop spatial reasoning skills. Holiday versions of a Medical Droid and Mouse Droid add festive touches to familiar Star Wars machinery. B2EMO from the Andor series joins the roster alongside a Treadwell Droid and Probe Droid, giving fans droids across different eras of Star Wars storytelling.</p>



<p>Of course, the calendar is not limited to characters and droids. Mini builds create Babu Frik’s workshop piece by piece, with a workbench, chair, tool rack, and shelves making an appearance as the days progress. It also includes a box of extra parts, crane, and bucket to enhance the workshop setup for kids to play out the busy work of the droidsmith fixing and upgrading mechanical companions. A Jawa buildable vehicle expands play possibilities, and a Christmas tree brings holiday cheer to the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>With <strong>263 pieces in total</strong>, this calendar allows the building experience to be spread out throughout the month rather than overwhelming kids with one huge construction project. Every day, a manageable build is accomplished, which feels rewarding without hours of focus, perfect for children aged 6 and up who are still developing their LEGO skills.</p>
