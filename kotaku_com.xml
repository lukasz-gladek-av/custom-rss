Others are trying to balance how to remember someone who was both arguably one of the most famous wrestlers in history and also, in the eyes of many, a terrible human being who caused a lot of pain, suffering, and trauma. For some, it’s easy to forget his in-ring accomplishments and focus solely on his bad behavior. For others, it’s hard not to remember his iconic look and status as the ultimate American hero during his run in the WWE.

Most content creators are trying to get viral soundbites in their interviews, but streamer and YouTuber Loserfruit had a much better idea and asked Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Joseph Quinn to try out their respective heroes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span>. So if you’ve ever wanted to see Pascal use Mister Fantastic’s stretchy limbs to help claim an objective, you can finally do that now.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Loserfruit sat down with the <em>First Steps </em>cast and had each of them jump into <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’s practice range to try out their heroes. Pascal played as Mister Fantastic, Kirby controlled Invisible Woman, Moss-Bachrach did some clobbering as the Thing, and Quinn ignited the skies as Human Torch. Before they get started, Kirby says she loves playing games, and Pascal mentions she’s big on <em>The Sims</em>. The rest of the crew says they have pretty limited gaming experience. Quinn played <em>FIFA</em> as a kid and Pascal says he never played anything past the original NES. So by and large, it sounds like the actors are about to enter uncharted territory playing NetEase’s hero shooter.</p><p>Loserfruit shows the cast some of the cosmetics in the game, including Invisible Woman’s wildly popular Malice skin depicting her villainous alter ego, which was a real crowd-pleaser. It seems like a missed opportunity to not have the actors play with the skins <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015">based on their movie appearances</a></span>, but those unfortunately aren’t live until tomorrow, July 25, so the default skins will have to do.</p><p>The actors all face a bit of a learning curve, and Pascal even jokes about needing “console classes” to learn how to play. After some time in the practice range, the group entered a real online game, but Loserfruit asked the other players to “pls be nice” to the actors in chat. The cast passed the controller around during a match, and it wasn’t until Pascal played that any of them managed to get a kill on the enemy Venom. Well, an assist, but let’s not get technical.</p><p>Check out the full video below:</p><p>All four actors are pretty busy right now, so it’s not like they have time to become pro gamers in the midst of promoting <em>First Steps </em>and shooting their upcoming MCU appearances in <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>.

That movie was independently produced and then picked up by Disney, and went on to become a big hit, spawning 14 sequels and spin-offs. Yes. That’s not a typo. There have been 14 follow-ups to a movie about a dog that plays basketball. Weirdly, most of them have nothing to do with basketball. </p><p><em>Air Bud Returns</em> is being written and directed by Robert Vince. He was a producer on the original <em>Air Bud</em> film in the ‘90s and then produced all 14 sequels, as well as writing and directing 10 of them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-bud-returns-aint-no-rule-says-a-dog-cant-release-another-movie-302512830.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-bud-returns-aint-no-rule-says-a-dog-cant-release-another-movie-302512830.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the official synopsis of the upcoming movie</a></span>, which is set to start filming this summer in British Columbia, Canada: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> In <em>Air Bud Returns</em>, 12-year-old Jacob has always dreamt of being a star basketball player. After the passing of his father, that dream felt even more impossible. But everything changes when he and his mom move into his dad’s childhood home in Fernfield. There, Jacob discovers an original VHS of the <em>Air Bud</em> movie in his father’s belongings and has a chance meeting of a stray golden retriever he names Buddy. Together they embark on a journey of healing, unite a team of misfits, and chase a championship. Through it all they learn to play from the heart, believe in each other, and always take the shot!</p></blockquote><p> “<em>Air Bud Returns</em> isn’t just another sequel or remake—it’s a unique story,” said Vince in a press release. “This movie will engage nostalgic <em>Air Bud </em>fans while introducing a new generation to the beloved basketball-playing golden retriever, Buddy. It builds upon the legacy of the OG <em>Air Bud</em> with all the fun, the magic, heartwarming scenes, and Buddy playing basketball. More than anything, it’s a deeply human story about a dog and boy, centered on themes of adaptation, redemption, and teamwork.”</p><p>I can’t say I’m excited for a new <em>Air Bud </em>movie, as the previous films have all been low-quality, straight-to-DVD garbage made on the cheap in an effort to milk a decades-old franchise. But hey, maybe this one will be good. Or not. There’s not a damn thing I can do to influence that. The universe is a chaotic place that can’t be controlled by any one person. Events happen. We live through them. <em>Air Bud Returns </em>hits theaters next year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/air-bud-returns-air-bud-15-new-film-2026-poster-teaser-1851786906]]></content:encoded>
