Generally, for the vast majority of the game, <strong>when you step into a new area, most of the enemies will all be weak to one specific element</strong>.You’ll want to build around that. Of course, you could find yourself up against an elemental weakness that Lune doesn’t have at her disposal. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515">Grab These Skills First In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>When Verso joins the party, for example, his first major plot area features enemies weak to Light. In those situations, 90-percent of the time, the best move is to lean towards Fire. Burning is just nearly universal in being useful. The 10-percent situations where it’s not?

In addition, <strong>every skill also can activate a modifier for itself depending on if particular Stains are on the board</strong>. </p><p>For example, Immolation is Lune’s bread-and-butter Fire Skill. It generates a Fire Stain, but if you have Ice Stains on the board, you do extra damage. In addition, some skills will generate a more generic Light Stain that can be used like a wild card. </p><p><strong>Watch: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/4-tips-clair-obscur-expedition-33-first-hours-1851777856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/4-tips-clair-obscur-expedition-33-first-hours-1851777856">4 Essential Tips To Survive <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>’s Brutal First Hours</a></span></p><p>Building up useful Stains often means using a Skill that doesn’t do jack shit to the enemies in a particular area, and that’s a bigger problem as you progress and start running into enemies that outright absorb specific elements. But you’re easily 20 hours in before you have to factor that in. In the early going, it’s best just to get familiar with which Pictos to pain up to maximize weaknesses. Speaking of…</p><h2 id="h243876"><a id="synergy"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>In the early going, Lune will be drowning in Fire-focused Pictos/Lumina, so by all means, build Pictos/Lumina around that up through the Gestral Village. Keep at least three burns on at any given time and you’ll be doing your part. The Lighterim Weapon allowing you to build up Burns without a specific skill is also going to be a huge help, especially when Maelle joins and a single burning enemy is all it takes to put her in Virtuose mode. Even later, though, Fire is gonna be your go-to element. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-long-to-beat-1851777481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-long-to-beat-1851777481">How Long Of A Journey Are You Signing Up For With <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><div><p><strong>While Ice won’t do much to damage every enemy, it does generate Stains that boost Fire attacks</strong>, and even better, <strong>Ice actually slow enemies down no matter what they’re weak to</strong>, which is a huge help when facing off against baddies fast enough to schedule two turns in a row. That also means speedsters are a damn fine excuse to get a board of four Ice Stains, then unleash Hell at your leisure. Way later, that can be very literal, but, we’re here just to get you on your way.</p><p>All this stuff does cost quite a bit of AP, though, and Lune’s base attack isn’t always able to generate enough. <strong>Energizing Attack and Dead Energy Pictos/Lumina can help</strong> with that, especially the latter since an enemy that dies from Lune casting the spell that set it on Fire still counts, giving her a nice AP bonus when you least expect it.</p></div><h2 id="h243877"><a id="skills"></a>Skills to aim for</h2><figure id="" data-id="29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-recommend-id="image://29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-recommend-id="image://29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br><strong>If there’s any one skill you want to get your hands on as soon as possible, it’s Mayhem.

Thunderfall is another good one to have in your back pocket, just because it can come in clutch in those situations where nobody can capitalize on all the Burns going around and you want to take an enemy off the field. </p></div><p>Lastly, you won’t be able to take it until way, way later, but <strong>Revitalization is your ultimate target as far as Lune’s healing skills go</strong>; it’s a skill that heals and casts Regen on the whole crew.

Ver. 20.0.0, released overnight, adds system transfers to Switch 2 as well as support for the new console’s GameShare feature and the sharing of virtual game cards. Players have quickly discovered a major caveat for that last part: when using virtual game cards, you can’t simultaneously play a game online across two separate Switches. It’s a confusing hang-up with significant consequences. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,194644,196181" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s the full list of changes in Switch firmware <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 20.0.0 which went live on April 29</a></span>. In addition to adding virtual game cards, GameShare for Switch 2, and Switch 2 system transfers, the update also allows for save data from multiple games to be transferred simultaneously. Additionally various Nintendo character icons have been tweaked, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1917391209967821073&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1917391209967821073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with Donkey Kong</a></span> getting revised to reflect his goofier, friendlier new<em> Donkey Kong Bananza </em>design. </p><p>GameShare was revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194">during the Switch 2 Direct</a></span> earlier this month and allows certain games to be played simultaneously with other nearby users on separate consoles, including older Switch models, though it has to be initiated by someone with a Switch 2. The Switch 2 transfer feature also includes a nice bonus in that current users can temporarily store their data in the cloud in the event that they’re trading in their console and won’t have both available at the same time to do the transfer directly. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706">Virtual game cards</a></span>, meanwhile, were outlined in a regular Nintendo Direct near the end of March, and essentially overhaul how games are shared within family account groups. Instead of being able to access one owner’s games across multiple devices their profile is installed on, the digital games have virtual cards that will transfer between consoles, limiting who can play at any given time. </p><p>While more straightforward and flexible than the current system in theory, Switch owners have already discovered an important shortfall. Notably, two users on two different Switches in the same household can no longer play games like<em> Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> online together. Previously, whoever owned the game digitally could register their profile on a second Switch and access it there while a user on the first Switch was playing as well. That no longer appears to be the case, with at least one user needing to be offline in order to play a game at the same time as the other. </p><p>There is a way for users to revert back to the old sharing system instead of using virtual game cards. A new option under user settings allows players to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kb48ai/psa_for_multiswitch_owners_you_can_reenable_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kb48ai/psa_for_multiswitch_owners_you_can_reenable_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn online license settings back on</a></span> and essentially bypass the virtual card system. But the loophole for playing an online game together now appears to have been closed even when doing that. “Now my wife and I have to buy our own licenses of each other’s games when we didn’t have to do that before, or on other consoles like PlayStation, so stupid,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kb31a4/nintendo_switch_firmware_update_version_2000_is/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kb31a4/nintendo_switch_firmware_update_version_2000_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one frustrated user on the Switch subreddit. <br></p><p> “We think many people will enjoy the benefits of virtual game card, but it is an optional feature, and the original method can be used instead,” a Nintendo spokesperson previously told the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.crossplay.news/p/sharing-switch-games-with-family-changes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.crossplay.news/p/sharing-switch-games-with-family-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parent-focused gaming newsletter <em>Crossplay</em></a></span>.

Must see in a cinema and stay through the end credits!” he wrote.</p><p>If you’re confused as to why he would say that, let’s just say that there are not one, but t<em>wo important scenes</em> that pop up as the credits roll that add a bit more layers to the film. We won’t spoil it for you but it’s necessary viewing to get the full context of the storyline.</p><p>In the comments section, “Sinners” stars Michael B. Jordan reacted to the post.</p><p>“Thanks for the love and support!!!” he wrote, while his costar Miles Caton dropped fire emojis in a separate comment.</p><p>Do yourself a favor and go see the film, if you haven’t already. Even if you’re not a horror movie person, there’s a whole lot more in there for you to enjoy that the scares won’t hardly phase you.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Tuesday, April 29.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
