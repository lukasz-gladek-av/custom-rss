            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-leon-grace-capcom-ps5-pc-2000673329"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span> is basically two games in one, and both its protagonists have different tools and rules to follow as you swap between them over the course of its campaign. With that in mind, we have a few tips that should come in handy as you head back into Capcom’s horror series on February 27.</span></p> <h2><b>If you can’t enter a room, assume it’s for the other character</b></h2> <p><span>Throughout </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, there will be stages where both playable characters, Grace and Leon, will walk through the same space. When playing as one character, you might not be able to access a room, open a cabinet, or use an item. The game does a decent job of using flavor text to communicate when you won’t find a solution to these problems with your current character, but that doesn’t mean these locations and items are useless. Sometimes something only works for Grace, or Leon can use his axe to pry open a door. Just remember these oddities when you inevitably walk near them again as a different character.</span></p>

 <h2><b>The map is very generous about marking supplies</b></h2> <p><span>When playing as Grace, supplies are limited and can be the difference between getting through a room with all limbs intact and meeting an untimely demise. Luckily, if you’re running low on bullets or herbs to heal with, </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s map is pretty generous about marking those items even if you don’t see them when you’re passing through a room. There were several points when I opened up the map and saw that I’d overlooked an herb in a different room and went back to grab it before heading into an area full of zombies. So if you’re ever hurting for healing or bullets, just open the map and you can probably find some stashed away somewhere.</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a knife at all times for collecting purposes</b></h2> <p><span>One of the collectibles you’ll find in </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> are dancing raccoon bobbleheads hidden around various areas. You’ll hear them rattling if you’re in the right room, but you’ll have to destroy them with either a bullet or a melee weapon to “collect” them. With <a href="https://kotaku.com/leon-kennedy-resident-evil-requiem-hot-thirst-trap-2000673666">Leon</a>, this is pretty simple because he always has his hatchet on hand. For Grace, whose sections are defined by scarcity, simply striking a collectible could cost you. Don’t waste a bullet if you don’t have to. Grace is able to craft a makeshift knife out of scraps you’ll scoop up while exploring. Not only is it helpful for fighting off zombies that get to close, but they can also be used as a quick melee attack to strike both enemies and the raccoon collectibles without wasting ammo.</span></p>

 <h2><b>If you have arachnophobia, this game is not for you</b></h2> <p><span>No need to get into spoilers here, but if you have a debilitating fear of spiders, I’m sorry to say that </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> has an entire segment that will make your skin crawl. Just something to be aware of until someone inevitably makes an arachnophobia mode mod.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Use the crafting menu, not items</b></h2> <p><span>There’s a whole crafting section of the pause menu, and it streamlines the mechanic of combining items to get something better. If you so choose, you can use the inventory tab to do some trial and error and try to find recipes, but the crafting tab makes this much more simple by listing not only the recipes you know, but automatically listing what you have the components for. Old </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>heads might like the feeling of manually sifting through your inventory, but if you want to save time and headache, there’s a whole menu for you.</span></p> <h2>It’s better to stun an enemy than kill them as Grace</h2> <p>Because ammo is so limited in Grace’s sections, you’re better off using what little resources you have to stun an enemy, rather than wasting bullets trying to take them out. A few shots to the head or kneecaps will typically put a zombie in a stunned state, which will allow you to shove them to the ground and run past them. It’s not a permanent solution, but it’s a more strategic one that will benefit you in the long run when you have more bullets to use.</p>

 <h2><b>Get upgrades before you leave an area</b></h2> <p><span>In some sections, you’ll be able to secure upgrades for things like your health, damage output, and inventory space. For Grace’s segments, these are things you have to find in locked rooms or in areas that have them in secured cases you’ll unlock by inserting coins you find. These upgrades won’t be available to you in future acts, as </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>changes locations a few times over the course of the story. So if you see a permanent upgrade behind a locked door, try to unlock it before you progress the story too far.</span></p> <h2><b>Don’t neglect your storage case as Grace</b></h2> <p><span>Grace’s inventory is much more limited than Leon’s. Whereas he has a case that you can manage by repositioning items so they’ll fit, Grace has fixed slots for various items. She’s able to place items in storage cases found throughout each area, however, and if you’re not using an item such as a weapon you don’t have bullets for or a component for a recipe you don’t have every piece to, stash them away so you don’t have to discard items you might still want to use due to lack of space.</span></p> <h2><b>Don’t forget the quick turn</b></h2> <p><span>I completely spaced on the quick turn for most of my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, even though it’s usually part of my muscle memory for these kinds of games. Don’t make my mistake. If you need to quickly turn around to either run away or reposition yourself in a scrap, pressing back and either circle or B will make Leon and Grace do a 180, rather than slowly turning to run away.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Defeating enemies with one character might help you as the other</b></h2> <p><span>Part of the whole “Grace and Leon share the same space” deal is that taking out zombies as one can help the other more easily get through an area when you swap over. More often than not, you’re playing as Grace first in an area, so it can sometimes be better to leave an enemy for Leon and his superior firepower to handle, but if you find something particularly annoying and want to take it out before you proceed, the other character will no doubt be grateful you did.</span></p> <h2><b>There’s one benefit of first-person for Grace</b></h2> <p><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is playable in both first- and third-person, and the game recommends you play Grace’s sections in first person and Leon’s in third. I played both in third-person because that’s just my general preference in most games, but there is one slight advantage to playing in first-person for Grace. When you play in third-person, Grace will stumble as she runs away from monsters to amp up the drama, but this detail doesn’t play out in first-person so you aren’t disoriented as she falls down. I’ve seen some folks say speedrunners will probably opt for first-person because this will shave off a second or two of time because you won’t have to get back up off the ground during those sequences.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Either read up on </b><b><i>Resident Evil 2 </i></b><b>or watch a walkthrough</b></h2> <p><span>If you’ve come into the </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>series recently or </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is your first game in the series, it’s worth playing </span><i><span>Resident Evil 2</span></i><span> beforehand, or at least reading or watching a summary or walkthrough. </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>has pretty direct callbacks to a lot of old </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> lore, but none is more prevalent than its connections to </span><i><span>Resident Evil 2</span></i><span>, and being aware of Leon’s past will help drive some segments home.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-development-tencent-layoffs-funding-2000674069</link>
            <guid>1447465</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-patch-note-mode-ps5-2000674000"><em>Highguard</em>‘s developers</a> have spoken openly about how the game’s looting and raid mechanics <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">were loosely inspired by the crafting survival sim <em>Rust</em></a>, but a new report shows the game was originally conceived of as something quite different. Developers hoped to even potentially launch a single-player mode to explore the hero shooter’s fictional background more, but funding ran out sooner than anyone expected.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc">A new report by <em>Bloomberg</em></a> lays out<em> Highguard</em>‘s evolving design and why it was so intent on sticking to a potentially fatal PR strategy of staying in stealth mode until a disastrous Game Awards 2025 reveal. Originally designed to be a survival-focused shooter in the mold of <em>Rust</em>, things weren’t congealing the way the team had hoped. Two years in, they pivoted to a more competitive-shooter-focused design. The survival crafting elements were streamlined into the game’s current idea of a “raid shooter.”</p>

 <p>Wildlight Entertainment reportedly explored matches of up to four teams before eventually settling on just 3v3. The result is giant maps with a big focus on looting and mining resources, a concept which <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">feels empty and underbaked</a> in the final version of the game that launched last month. Despite releasing to over 100,000 concurrents on Steam, nobody stuck with the game.</p> <p>An open player beta might have caught these issues, but the team was reportedly committed to launching <em>Highguard </em>via a shadowdrop as Wildlight’s veteran staff had done with <em>Apex Legends</em> back in 2019. Multiple developers told Bloomberg that “hubris” was to blame for them not changing course sooner, thinking that past success was indicative of <em>Highguard</em>‘s future chances in an ever more crowded and hostile multiplayer gaming market.</p>

 <p>[If players were shocked that Wildlight had layoffs just weeks after launch, well, so were developers at the studio. One of the most revealing pieces from the<em> Bloomberg</em> report is that staff thought they had months of runway to ship content and respond to player feedback to potentially improve the game. Instead, the majority of the studio was laid off almost immediately after the game didn’t succeed.</p>

 <p>Some speculated that Tencent’s funding was contingent on launch metrics that <em>Highguard</em> fell way short of. The company’s TiMi Studio Group <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790">still hasn’t publicly acknowledged</a> that it helped ship the “self-published” game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metacritic Removes Resident Evil Requiem Review From Website That Replaced Humans With AI]]></title>

              <p>A <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> review published by long-standing UK gaming news site <em>Videogamer</em> has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-best-reviewed-main-entry-in-over-20-years-2000673626">removed from Metacritic</a> after readers pointed out it was written by a fake AI journalist who doesn’t actually exist. <em>Videogamer</em>‘s human masthead was gutted last week, sources tell <em>Kotaku</em>, and the site has been publishing apparent genAI slop ever since.</p> <p><span><em>Videogamer,</em> purchased BGFG a few years back and recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-escapist-esports-insider-clickout-media-layoffs-2000669743">sold to gambling seo spam agency Clickout</a>, gave <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> a 9/10 in its review this week. But readers pointed out that the writing “reeks [of] AI,” and its author, “experienced iGaming and sports betting analyst” Brian Merrygold, appeared to be a made-up person complete with an AI profile image.</span></p>

 <p><span>The review in question is full of clichés and generalities rather than specifics about the game and how it plays. Here’s an excerpt:</span></p> <blockquote><p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem is not just a victory lap for Capcom’s survival horror dynasty; it is a chainsaw-revving, blood-soaked testament to why we love getting scared stupid.</strong>&nbsp;It is the sort of finale that effectively grabs the franchise by the lapels, shakes it violently, and demands you acknowledge just how far it has come since the tank-control days of 1996. While other series limp toward their conclusions,&nbsp;<strong>RE9</strong>&nbsp;arrives with the confidence of a Tyrant smashing through a brick wall.</p> <p>It happens like clockwork with every major&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem leak, doesn’t it? We worry if the developers can balance the scales. After the southern gothic reinvention of&nbsp;<em>RE7</em>&nbsp;and the action-hero theatrics of the recent remakes, the franchise has been having something of an identity crisis. This game solves it by simply doing both.&nbsp;<strong>It bonds the trauma of Raccoon City with modern design sensibilities</strong>, proving there is plenty of life left in this undead horse. It frames the horror not just as a series of jump scares, but as a legacy that haunts its characters as much as it haunts our backlogs.</p></blockquote> <p><span>It was previously scraped and featured on Metacritic for its review score roundup on launch day. It raises concerns about quality control for the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/metacritic-co-founder-marc-doyle-lifts-the-veil-on-how-the-site-works">primary video game review aggregator</a> that fans consult before buying games and that companies mention in their quarterly earnings reports when touting the success of recent releases.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's bleak. I was reading some RE Requiem reviews and found this thing published by videogamer. Can't find anything about the writer, everything about it reeks AI (dead giveaway being the image). Low effort, gargabe.</p> <p>Mind you, this review made its way to Metacritic. <a href="https://t.co/4STN8DjAwe">https://t.co/4STN8DjAwe</a> <a href="https://t.co/awk26P9wSA">pic.twitter.com/awk26P9wSA</a></p> <p>— Andrés (@Andrew_east) <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_east/status/2026919935641895380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“The <em>RE Requiem</em> review and a handful of other Videogamer reviews from 2026 have been removed from Metacritic,” site cofounder Marc Doyle told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email.</p>

 <p><span>As spotted by </span><i><span>Gfinity’s </span></i><span>Andrés Aquino in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/Andrew_east/status/2026919935641895380?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span>, everything about Brian Merrygold’s profile on <em>Videogamer</em> comes off as suspicious. The byline appears to have no prior online history and the profile image url is tiled </span><span> “ChatGPT-Image-Oct-20-2025-11_57_34-AM-300×300.png.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Several other authors on the site have similarly suspicious-looking AI-generated profile pictures that don’t mention they were generated by ChatGPT in their file names, suggesting this may have been a slip-up on by <em>Videogamer</em> site management as it pivots the outlet to completely AI-generated junk. </span><span>Other current bylines on the site include </span><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/author/shooter-orson/"><span>Shooter Orson</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/author/steven-danielson/"><span>Steven Danielson</span></a>. Like the <span>Merrygold account, all three had their X profiles created in October 2025.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000674047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674047"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674047">X</figcaption></figure> <p>Sources told <em>Kotaku</em> that Clickout began publishing AI-generated content under the casino and gambling portions of <em>Videogamer</em> around that time last fall, but it wasn’t until the staff was axed last week that AI content started being pushed out into the gaming news, reviews, and features sections as well. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhiki.bsky.social/post/3l7qicbpbza2n">Older human bylines</a> from the site’s 15-year history have been completely wiped out as well and overwritten with fake AI profiles.</p>

 <p><span>While it’s impossible to verify what content is or isn’t generated with AI with complete accuracy, multiple AI checkers <em>Kotaku</em> used to verify the legitimacy of the </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> review sounded alarm bells. It wasn’t the only recent <em>Videogamer </em>review to get picked up by Metacritic either. A Recent </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</span></i><span> review, which was published on <em>Videogamer</em> and subsequently featured on Metacritic on February 23, has also been removed from the aggregator’s roundup.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ethan Gach.&nbsp;</em></p>
