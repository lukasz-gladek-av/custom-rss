              <p>A new report claims that following high-profile examples of rich people being killed or robbed, the wealthy elite are more nervous than ever about poor people or criminals robbing them, or worse. To defend against this, many are turning their multi-million dollar mansions into spaces that closely resemble <em>Hitman</em> levels.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/luxury-home-security-aca080d7">A new <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report</a> shows that a lot of the richest people in the United States are on edge after events like the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/among-us-luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-murder-1235199846/">assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson</a> in New York City in 2024 and the shooting of Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner and others in 2025. There have also been some high-profile burglaries, including the homes of Brad Pitt, Nicole Kidman, and Kansas City Chiefs star QB Patrick Mahomes. Reportedly many rich celebs and executives are also nervous about sites that <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-leak-sgf-2025-rumor-gabe-newell-yacht-1851783832">let people track private jets and yachts</a>. To ease their fears, many of the richest people around are spending millions on adding security features like laser grids, moats, armed guards, and AI-powered cameras to their mansions.</p>

 <p>“Prior to the wide use of social media, most CEOs—whether they’re in private equity, finance or tech—no one knew their names or what they looked like, with few exceptions,” said Miami luxury real estate agent Danny Hertzberg. “Now, people are tracking them.”</p> <p>One former tech mogul turned real estate agent showed off a $15 million mansion compound in Arizona that included 32 “casino-grade cameras” and a “laser intrusion detection system” around the home’s large perimeter. The house’s front door is made out of three-inch-thick solid steel and includes 13 deadbolts. Around the house are also sour orange trees with four-inch spikes intended to deter people from sneaking around. And in front of all that is a moat. Meanwhile, inside the house is a reinforced concrete bunker with a 2,000-pound door and an air filtration system built to extremely high standards.</p>

 <p>And this is far from the only mansion being turned into a challenging <em>Hitman</em> level. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> says roughly 45 percent of high-end homes sold last year included a reference to privacy or security. That’s up from 38 percent in 2024.</p>

 <p>In Vegas, a luxury design firm says clients are now spending $100,000 to $1.5 million just on security features like safe rooms and cameras. In Florida, another building company is working to incorporate biometric access, facial recognition, and iris scanning into its security systems.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in places like Beverly Hills, developers are contracting security firm Arsec Group to provide 24/7 armed guard for their latest collection of high-end homes inside a gated community. Mikey Arana, founder of Arsec, says many of his clients in California are increasingly worried about being followed and robbed after a night out on the town wearing pricey clothes and jewelry. &nbsp;The armed guards carry 9mm pistols and observe the property via infrared cameras.</p>

 <p>“Sometimes, unfortunately, the only way to stop violent action is with a violent response,” said Arana.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>We first learned that the frosty survival game <em>The Long Dark&nbsp;</em>was getting a sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/24">during 2024’s Game Awards</a>. Called&nbsp;<em>Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2</em>, the follow-up to 2017’s excellent first-person game about surviving in the Canadian wilderness was said to be coming to early access in 2026. That’s no longer the case, with developer Hinterland’s founder Raphael van Lierop now saying it won’t be out in any form this year, and as a consequence 10 full-time developers and four contractors from the studio are being let go.</p> <p>“I’m sad to share the news that I’ve made the difficult decision today to part ways with 10 of our cherished colleagues,” begins a statement from van Lierop <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rvanlierop_some-very-sad-news-from-hinterland-today-share-7427536054947045376-f305/">posted to LinkedIn</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hinterland-confirms-layoffs-after-delaying-the-long-dark-sequel"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). “We also will not extend some existing fixed-term contracts when they expire, impacting another 4 team members, bringing the total affected to 14.”</p>

 <p>The reasons given allude to wider industry issues, but suggest the primary issue is that <em>Blackfrost</em> won’t be in a state to enter early access this year, which van Lierop says “means pushing significant expected revenue out as well, and these layoffs will help us preserve the financial resources required to get the game to launch, as well as to continue supporting our other games.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000668230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668230"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668230">© Hinterland / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>The Long Dark</em> was first released in its earliest form in 2014, following a successful Kickstarter the previous year. One of the rare examples of a truly purposeful early access development, the shiver-inducing first-person survival sim then released regular significant updates, each developing its core ideas in new and interesting directions, until its splendid 2017 final version. And all of them ensured you were always likely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-impres-oh-ive-been-eaten-by-a-wolf">to be eaten by a wolf</a>. Its only stumble was the initial addition of its Wintermute story mode, the first two of the five chapters failing to win many over, but even these were later recreated in a far better form. Astonishingly, the fifth chapter still isn’t out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">last said to be arriving on March 31, 2026</a>, and van Lierop says the new layoffs will not affect its release. Planned updates for the original game that are scheduled to appear this year are also apparently unaffected.</p>

 <p>“This is a heavy, heavy day for Hinterland,” says the CEO, “and our hearts are with all those affected by today’s layoff. I’m sorry to have had to let these people go.” The statement says efforts have been made to help those affected find new work, adding, “Any development studio in the industry would be fortunate to have any single one of these team members. We are a weaker studio for losing them, and they will be sorely missed.”</p>

 <p>Being a weaker studio will surely further hinder development of <em>Blackfrost</em>, not least given the intention was never to release a finished game this year, but rather its earliest playable version. Hopefully some additional money will come in to Hinterland with today’s news that the original <em>The Long Dark</em> is finally returning to GOG, after <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/the_long_dark_removal/page1">being mysteriously pulled from the store in 2018</a>. It’s <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_long_dark">on the freshly independent PC gaming store with a 25-percent discount for the next week</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Who remembers<a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661"><em> Spectre Divide</em></a>? It was a 2024 tactical first-person multiplayer shooter with an eye-catching visual style and a novel gameplay hook: you could swap between clones during matches as you hunted enemies and defended objectives. It came out around the same time as <em>Concord</em> and briefly seemed like an antidote to its excesses and shortcomings. Instead, it just failed more slowly and less spectacularly.</p> <p>It was made by Mountaintop Studios, which was founded in 2020 by ex-Oculus guys Nate Mitchell and Matt Hansen, who had the ears of investors. Seizing on gaming’s boom during the early pandemic, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/mountaintop-studios-30m-funding-shoud-zedd/">they turned $5.5 million in seed money into a $30 million early funding round</a>. They continued raising tens of millions as the game approached launch and tried to make a splash with contributions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0wXIu-HUq0">high-profile streamers like Shroud</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Spectre Divide</em> came out in September 2024 and peaked at over 30,000 concurrents on Steam, only to instantly begin its long and painful descent. A barrage of complaints about server issues and latency immediately tanked the Steam rating, followed by frustrations over matchmaking fairness and the lack of common features like a battle pass. It was a free-to-play game, so the barrier to entry was low, but some cosmetic bundles were absurdly overpriced.</p> <p>“That fucking killed us,” Hansen <a href="https://80.lv/articles/nate-mitchell-and-matt-hansen-on-the-death-of-spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios">told <em>80.lv</em></a> last year. “It killed our early momentum, which is critical for any new game.” By they time they addressed all of the early problems, the player counts were too low on PC to get fast and fair matchmaking, let alone generate meaningful post-launch revenue to keep the game afloat. Mountaintop pivoted to releasing a console version as soon as possible but it was already too late. <em>Spectre Divide</em> was in a death spiral.</p>

 <h2>The dead game death sentence</h2> <p>It made a bad first impression, with intrigue over the innovative take on what was essentially <em>Counter-Strike</em> meets <em>Valorant</em> in a bubblegum wrapper overshadowed by review-bombing over legitimate but temporary issues. Most players quickly popped back to their existing online games of choice. Anyone new who came along found a much slower, more lopsided matchmaking pool to introduce them to the game.</p>

 <p>Who wants to be caught buying a ticket for the Titanic after it’s already hit the iceberg? Who wants to be seen eating at a restaurant that’s almost entirely empty, no matter how good their tacos or smash burger are? A month after launch,<em> Spectre Divide</em> had a peak concurrent count of just under 3,000 players and was already battling the “dead game” stench wafting around its subreddit and Steam review comments.</p> <p>“The player count is such a self-fulfilling prophecy in and of itself,” Mitchell told me at the time. He called Steam concurrents the new Metacritic scores, a metric to batter games around with in service of competing agendas and narratives. “If people see the player count going up, then their articles get written about it, and then people come in, if it’s going down, people write articles, they’re like, this game’s not going to be around so I’m not going to invest my time in it. And it’s such a tough thing. I don’t think we expected that [back when we started development].”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000668229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668229"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668229">Mountaintop Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>He continued, “‘Dead game’ is not the most constructive feedback. So I much prefer when someone writes online, ‘Hey, the gunplay is not for me, and here’s why, and here’s how I think they should change it.’ But ultimately, it’s okay, you know, it’s on us…we deserve some of those, you know, sort of dead game memes at the end of the day.” In hindsight a year later, Hansen told <em>80.lv</em>, “Some players were saying it was a dead game within one day of release but we always felt like we were one update away from turning things around.”</p> <p>The Mountaintop founders have tried to Monday-morning-quarterback what might have turned things around for <em>Spectre Divide</em>. Delaying development to launch in a better place? Saving the marketing and media blitz for day-one instead of a closed beta? Mountaintop took a $65 million shot and missed. Some players looked at <em>Spectre Divide</em> and immediately felt it was destined to fail. Even months after the game shut down in early 2025, Mitchell believed that wasn’t the case. “In a parallel universe where we didn’t have the server issues, where the community wasn’t frustrated with our early pricing that rankled people, where maybe we had a bit more money for marketing, we could have gotten the critical mass going,” he said.</p> <p>I’m sure all of these questions are similar to the ones currently facing Wildlight Entertainment’s developers, the majority of whom <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">were laid off</a> this week, less than a month after <em>Highguard</em>‘s launch. When online multiplayer projects get such a small window to make their mark and find a foothold in an ever more competitive landscape that’s already crowded with too many games, how can you not begin to second-guess every little choice, from where to allocate resources early in development to how many heroes and modes to debut at launch?</p>

 <h2><em>Highguard</em>‘s race against time</h2> <p>Would deciding against revealing <em>Highguard</em> at the Game Awards 2025 have saved it weeks and weeks of bad online buzz, or would it have just made it that much harder to get anyone to pay attention once the game was out? Would a 5v5 mode on day one have kept more players around than the more boring 3v3 it started with? Would better performance on PC for less powerful gaming rigs have spared <em>Highguard</em> an immediate onslaught of negative drive-by Steam reviews? Would pitching its launch as an open beta or early access period have lowered the expectations it got graded against?</p> <p>No one knows the answers to these questions, or whether magically knowing them would matter in the scheme of a game that, at the end of the day, many agree can be interesting and fun but just isn’t as fully baked as its mountain of competition, from <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Deathlock</em> to <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>. What has become increasingly clear, however, is that once caught in a live-service death spiral, you need more than good ideas and some extra runway to escape it.</p>

 <p>It seems absurd to launch a multiplayer game and lay most of its creators off before the one-month anniversary, but short of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, it’s hard to imagine momentum ever meaningfully shifting back in a game like <em>Highguard</em>‘s favor. Comeback stories like those around <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> are still extremely rare in the live-service space. When it works, it’s usually because you have massive publishers with huge franchises on the line–<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>,<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Fallout 76</em>–and even then it takes tons of money, years of scrambling, and more than a little luck to pull off a miracle.</p> <p>Most multiplayer games have none of those things, and sometimes even when they check all the boxes it’s still not enough. Wildlight wanted to create a game that “people love and [that] becomes a part of them,” studio head and game director Chad Grenier <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-wildlight-interactive-interview/">told <em>Polygon</em></a> a week before<em> Highguard</em>‘s launch. “Whether it gets a thousand people or a hundred million people, it doesn’t matter. What matters most is that the game is loved by the people who played it.” It might have mattered most, but it didn’t matter enough.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First Trailer For Nicolas Cage’s Spider-Man Series Has Me Cautiously Optimistic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/spider-noir-amazon-episodes-premiere-date-nicolas-cage-2000668226</link>
            <guid>1433749</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nicolas Cage’s Spider-Man Noir was one of the surprise fan favorites from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-beyond-the-spiderverse-release-date-images-1851774004"><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span>. The actor used his Massive Talent and put on one of the more memorable performances in a movie full of them, even though he didn’t have as much screentime as Miles, Gwen, and Peter. The idea of a broody, monochromatic detective Spider-Man was a new concept to some fans, but Spider-Man Noir was introduced long before he showed up in the multiversal animated movies. Now, he’s getting his own live-action show, but not as Peter Parker; instead as Ben Reilly, and that name carries a lot more questions than answers. We have the first trailer for the series, and it looks pretty cool.</span></p> <p><span>The eight-episode series stars Cage as an older version of Spider-Man who is a detective in New York during the 1930s. Ben is a bit of a burnout, which is refreshing after every Spider-Man being a standup citizen who saves the day because it’s right. But if you’re unfamiliar with Ben, this might not be the best introduction to him, as Cage’s character seems to be a composite character of Spider-Man Noir and the Scarlet Spider. In the comics, Ben Reilly is a clone of Peter Parker who has taken on different roles and aliases as the years have gone on. It’s unclear if naming Cage’s character Ben is a nod to another </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>story, or if it’s going to actually play into some twist down the line.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Spider-Noir </span></i><span>will premiere on Amazon on May 27, and will be available in both color and black-and-white to capture the character and comic’s original black-and-white color scheme. Based on the views of the YouTube trailers, it looks like folks might be gravitating toward the monochromatic filter. That feels fitting.</span></p>  <p><span>Though it’s being released on Amazon, this show is technically part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709"><span>Sony’s extended </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>universe</span></a><span>, which has mostly bombed with absolute stinkers like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/madame-web-movie-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-reaction-1851264337"><i><span>Madame Web</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-jared-leto-movie-theaters-marvel-sony-bom-1849024089"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. The </span><i><span>Venom </span></i><span>movies were kind of okay, sometimes. Really, </span><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>is the best thing Sony has done as it’s held onto the movie license, other than partnering with Marvel to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-trailer-leaks-avengers-doomsday-2000654144"><span>bring Peter Parker to the MCU</span></a><span>, and hopefully some of the brilliance of those animated movies has rubbed off on </span><i><span>Spider-Noir</span></i><span>. If not, Cage is usually still worth tuning in for, just to see what he does with bad material.</span></p>
