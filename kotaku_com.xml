              <p>Now that the film and TV industries have finally cracked the code to making decent, sometimes great, live-action adaptations of video games, there’s actually good reason to pay attention to the developments of these works. To be excited about them, even. One of the latest games to get the treatment is none other than Xbox 360-era darling <i>BioShock</i>. The first one (not <i>Infinite</i>, thank god).</p> <p>As reported by <i>The Direct</i>, producer Roy Lee (<a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><i>A Minecraft Movie</i></a>, <i>Weapons</i>, <i>The Long Walk</i>) said that while everything else about the movie must be kept secret, “it’s definitely going to be based on the first <i>BioShock</i> game.” The deep sea adaptation hit a snag after some necessary script work, but it looks like it’s on track; now it just awaits director Francis Lawrence (<i>Constantine</i>, <i>The Hunger Games</i>, <i>The Long Walk</i>) who first has to wrap work on <i>The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</i>.</p> <p>While I’ve been something of a hater of the non-stop barrage of live-action video game adaptations, I find the idea of bringing the first <i>BioShock</i> “to life” as a big-budget movie a neat proposition. Sure, the story is the most obvious expression of why <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>’s themes are stupid, but the setting, the underwater city of Rapture, was a real treat to explore, and seeing it reproduced on the big screen should be a treat.</p> <p>As a thematic device, Rapture is a pretty straightforward tool for skewering libertarian-minded politics, but as a setting, it’s dreamy and atmospheric, with tremendous potential for some seriously cool set and prop design. And if Francis Lawrence’s work on 2007’s <i>I Am Legend</i> is anything to go by, the man knows how to work well with evocative settings. Who knows, maybe we’ll take some better lessons away from this trip down to the doomed ocean floor city than we did the first time.</p>

              <p>Yesterday, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-iii-the-kotaku-review-1844848772">Crusader Kings 3</a></em> released a new DLC for the popular historical strategy game. The reaction to it was very negative, with complaints about it being small and broken, as well as including features that some players felt should have been in the main game. Now, the game’s QA manager has issued a lengthy apology and explained what happened.</p> <p>On September 9, Paradox Interactive released the “Coronations” DLC pack for <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>. This is just one of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">many, many DLCs and expansions</a> that have been released for the large-scale strategy game since it launched back in 2020. However, shortly after Coronations launched on Steam, players began sharing negative reviews and complaining that one feature of the small DLC, oaths, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd6c2j/i_completed_my_oath_years_ago_wtf_paradox/">was completely broken and causing problems during campaigns</a>. Others complained that the small DLC should have been a free update and argued that Paradox has been squeezing player wallets more and more with these smaller DLCs. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/">The Coronations DLC now has an overall negative rating on Steam</a>.</p> <p>In response to all this negative feedback and anger, Paradox’s QA manager has posted an apology, explained what happened, and promised that the studio would do better in the future to prevent this from happening again.</p>

 <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991">On Thursday, <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>‘s QA manager, Riad, shared a message</a> with fans on the game’s official Steam page. According to Riad, he’s been wanting to apologize to the community for the last 24 hours and asked the “higher-ups” for permission to write an apology.</p> <p>“I’m sorry. <wbr>Coronations was not up to the standard you deserve, and that’s on me,” said Riad. “As the QA Manager for the studio, it is my job to ensure that our releases meet the [quality assurance] vision we have set out. It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly.”</p>

  <p>Riad explained that the studio has been “pouring enormous effort” into the next massive <em>Crusader Kings 3</em> expansion, All Under Heaven. According to the QA boss, it’s the biggest expansion the studio has ever made and “basically every resource” is “committed” to making sure the expansion is “up to [fan] expectations.” However, this led to other projects at Paradox, like the Coronations DLC, having fewer resources and staff. And while Riad is “very proud” of what the team was able to pull off with limited resources, the QA boss called the whole situation “unfair” to both fans and the devs. Riad also blamed “last-minute” changes for oaths being broken in the new DLC and claimed the studio was going to be more “stringent” about these tweaks.</p> <p>“Many of us on the team, myself included, joined Paradox as fans of the games. Meeting you at events…hearing your stories, and seeing how much <em>Crusader Kings 3 </em>means to you is what makes this work so meaningful,” said Riad. “That’s why it hurts so much when we fuck up like this. We don’t take your trust for granted, and I want to do my best to ensure we earn it back.”</p> <p>Riad says that there is at least one more patch on the way to fix more issues in the Coronations DLC and added, “Thank you for holding us accountable and for continuing to care about this game as much as we do. We will do better.”<wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/frys-electronics-store-abandoned-liminal-phoenix-az-2000624785</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/soon-to-be-demolished-fry%E2%80%99s-electronics-is-your-daily-dose-of-liminal-dread.1294182/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The world of gaming and consumer electronics kinda feels like a liminal space right now if you grew up during the ‘00s, ‘90s, or earlier decades. The brick-and-mortar locations that many of us would visit to pick up a new game or simply to wander around and kill some time are increasingly empty, destined for destruction or for uses far removed from what they were before. And as physical media continues to be squeezed out of gaming thanks to the convenience of digital distribution and silly stuff like Nintendo’s Game Key-Cards, it doesn’t look like that’s likely to change anytime soon.</p> <p>If you’re looking to steep yourself in that strange feeling of seeing a world frozen in a state of abandonment, might I divert your attention to a set of photos from a vacant Fry’s Electronics store in Phoenix Arizona?</p>  <p>This emptied store came up on my radar while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/1nd42uk/frys_electronics_soon_to_be_demolished/">browsing Reddit’s r/LiminalSpace</a> (an experience that pairs well with <a href="https://somafm.com/darkzone/">SomaFM’s Dark Zone station</a>, I might add). Vast empty aisles and hanging signs advertising products that are nowhere to be found–it sure is a mood. And though the Aztec-themed stylings of this particular location use some different cultural affectations, its abandoned state reminds me of <a href="https://youtu.be/oysS9lBP644">the Las Vegas section of <i>Horizon: Forbidden West</i></a>, with notably less water and fewer robot dinosaurs (I hope).</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, this location is destined for demolition, so future Aloy will not be battling a Tideripper in here. Check out a walkthrough of <a href="https://youtu.be/Mx92kBmxzAY">this abandoned location here</a>:</p>   <p>Fry’s Electronics started closing all of its stores on February 24, 2021, a victim of the massive shift toward online shopping and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. Being an East Coaster, I never had the chance to check out one of these stores. We have plenty of MicroCenters here, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/1nd42uk/comment/ndejf78/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">as one Redditor commented</a>, MicroCenter “lacks the personality” of what we can see even in the shots of this abandoned Fry’s.</p>

 <p>Elsewhere in the comments of the Reddit post highlighting the Phoenix Fry’s location, folks are shouting out the variety of themes Fry’s had across its various locations. A San Fernando Valley one was<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5SBIy4xBdA/?hl=en"> based on <i>Alice in Wonderland</i></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/kC9clA3oRPg">Another in Austin, Texas had music themes</a>, with a piano-shaped entrance. San Jose’s had <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CWUPs3TViVBdt5o28">a Mayan temple motif</a>.</p>  <p>It feels a bit strange to be basking mournfully in the liminal vibes of an abandoned big box store, since Fry’s was, after all, just another business like any other, a capitalist enterprise concerned only with amassing profit. Now the big chains are the food. Circle of capitalist life. I’m sure there’s an interesting academic article on that somewhere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, here’s something unexpected: Kong Studios is back. The OG <a href="https://kotaku.com/gorillaz-fornite-festival-leaks-forza-horizon-japan-xbox-sony-evo-analogue-2000619149">Gorillaz</a> Flash-powered site from the late ’90s was a popular destination for fans and features mini-games, music, and more. And now you can return to an updated and modern version of Kong Studios.</p> <p>Kong Studios first launched in 1998 and was the coolest place for fans of the fictional animated band. I should know, I used to visit it many, many years ago and struggled to use it on my dial-up connection. <a href="https://kotaku.com/over-36-000-flash-games-have-been-saved-and-are-now-pla-1841389493">The site was powered by Flash (RIP</a>), and over the years following its launch, it grew bigger and bigger, adding more content to find, virtual rooms to explore, songs to jam out to, and lots of fun Easter eggs for fans. Then in 2008, after a decade of support, the site was closed and forgotten. However, that all changed today as Kong Studios is operational once more.</p>  <p>On September 10, <a href="https://kongstudios.gorillaz.com/">Gorillaz released a new updated version of Kong Studios</a> that features a <em>Doom</em>-like first-person shooter experience where players have to fight off the zombie apes as seen in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V_xRb0x9aw">band’s video for “Clint Eastwood.”</a> You can skip that and just enter Kong Studios directly, and if you do, you’ll find a much higher-res version of the nostalgic site. There’s plenty to click on and explore in the lobby of the place, and Gorillaz promise that more rooms and content will be added to Kong Studios in the future.</p>

 <p>“Kong Studios is the home of Gorillaz and a gamified fan experience where you can explore the rooms and spaces of 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel,” explained Gorillaz on the site’s <a href="https://gorillaz.com/Kongstudiosfaqs/">FAQ page</a>. “It’s also a place to go to find out everything you want to know about Gorillaz, first.”</p> <p>I’m very happy to see Kong Studios return, and not just because I’m a big Gorillaz fan. Over the last decade or so, we’ve seen more and more of the internet and the culture around it move from distinct places to large social media networks and apps. <a href="https://kotaku.com/please-stop-closing-forums-and-moving-people-to-discord-1847684851">Forums are closing. Fan sites are dying</a>. Instead, everyone and every brand is just using Facebook, Instagram, Discord, and TikTok to interact with fans and other people. And while that’s fine, it isn’t as cool as the old internet, where every band and person had their own site. Or where forums were controlled directly by the companies or groups themselves.</p>

 <p>The old internet was a weirder, wackier, and often more interesting era that I miss. While Kong Studios won’t bring that back by itself, it’s great to see a band as popular as Gorillaz realize that having your own place on the web might be valuable in 2025 as apps and networks get stuffed more and more with AI and bots.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s a walkthrough of the old Kong Studios so you can see what they took from us.</p>
