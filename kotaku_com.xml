              <p>Portable monitors from competing brands typically cost between $100 and $150 for similar specs which makes budget options hard to find. The <em>MNN</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor spent most of the past year hovering between $80 and $90, which already undercut the competition significantly. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $55 for Black Friday</a>, smashing through previous pricing despite the modest 7% discount label. You get a <strong>Full HD IPS display with dual USB-C ports, HDR support, and a smart cover that doubles as a stand</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Display Quality Without the Premium Tax</h2>
<p>An <strong>IPS panel of 15.6 inches offers a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels</strong> with good color representation and wide viewing angles of 178 degrees. Text remains sharp and readable at usual working distances, which turns this screen into a usable tool for productivity instead of just media consumption. The matte finish helps cut down on glare from overhead lights and windows, allowing you to work comfortably in bright environments.</p>
<p>It <strong>features HDR mode</strong> that extends the color gamut and increases the contrast to show more vivid visuals while gaming or playing videos. You notice it right away in dark scenes where the shadows retain detail instead of crushing to pure black. Bright highlights pop without washing out surrounding elements. The HDR implementation is best with content that’s mastered for high dynamic range, though standard content still benefits from the enhanced processing.</p>



<p>Dual USB-C ports handle both power and video signal transmission through a single cable connection. To utilize this plug-and-play functionality, your laptop will require Thunderbolt 3.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C with DP Alt Mode support. When your device supports it, you simply connect one USB-C cable, and the monitor powers on and displays immediately. This does away with the rats’ nest of cables that can plague traditional monitors that need separate power adapters and video cables. The monitor features a mini-HDMI port for devices without USB-C video output, making it compatible with older laptops, game consoles, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The smart cover protects the screen during transportation and turns into an adjustable stand when you’re ready to work. The PU leather exterior resists scratches and minor impacts that would damage an unprotected screen. The stand operates in both landscape and portrait orientations, supporting various workflows and content types. You can set the screen at different angles to reduce neck strain and find optimal viewing angles. The magnetic attachment of the cover keeps it secure during transportation without adding bulk.</p>



<p><strong>Multiple display modes</strong> adapt intelligently to different use cases throughout your day. Extended mode treats the portable monitor as additional desktop space, letting you drag windows between screens. Copy mode mirrors your laptop display for presentations or sharing content with nearby viewers. Second screen mode dedicates the portable monitor to specific applications while your laptop handles others. Portrait mode rotates the display 90 degrees for reading documents, coding, or browsing social media feeds that favor vertical layouts.</p>
<p>The monitor is less<strong> than half an inch thick and weighs less than 2 pounds</strong>, so it fits easily in most laptop bags and backpacks. Once you’re traveling, you barely notice the additional weight, and the profile doesn’t consume valuable bag space.</p>
<p>At $55, this portable monitor delivers Full HD quality and dual USB-C connectivity for half what it cost earlier this year. You’re getting display specs that match $150 competitors while saving nearly $100.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-makes-zero-profit-play-on-hogwarts-castle-harry-potter-set-sold-at-cost-just-to-move-inventory-2000646703</link>

              <p>The LEGO Harry Potter <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> set is the most popular Wizarding World building set on Amazon this year. Large LEGO sets are significantly more expensive than smaller boxes, but this particular model offers the iconic display value that makes it worth the investment.</p>
<p>And the good news is that A<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">mazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $140, down from its usual $169 price tag</a>. You get <strong>2,660 pieces that build an incredibly detailed scale model of Hogwarts Castle</strong>, and measures over 13 inches wide, complete with the Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, and surrounding grounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Display Model That Captures the Magic</h2>
<p>This scale model is incredibly detailed and reproduced the Hogwarts Castle and its surroundings. You build the Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, and Great Hall as separate sections that then connect to form that quite recognizable silhouette from the films. The courtyards, bridges, and connecting passages keep true to the generally mazelike way the castle is built. Greenhouses are put at the edge of the castle, while the Boathouse extends towards the Black Lake.</p>
<p>The build process takes you through iconic locations inside the castle walls. The Chamber of Secrets is deep beneath the structure, accessible through hidden passages. The Winged Key room suspended keys above a locked door reference the obstacles that protect the Philosopher’s Stone. The Potions Classroom contains brewing stations and places for ingredient storage. The Chessboard Chamber recreates the life-sized wizard chess game found in the first film.</p>



<p>The Durmstrang Ship floats on the Black Lake and arrives for the Triwizard Tournament as depicted in Goblet of Fire. The Beauxbatons Carriage sits on the grounds, towed in by flying horses in the movies but here showcased as a static display piece. With these two additions, the model extends far beyond the castle itself to become a complete representation of the Hogwarts grounds.</p>
<p>The <strong>2,660-piece count provides an extensive building experience over multiple sessions</strong>. You work through numbered bags that organize pieces by section, gradually watching Hogwarts take shape on your table. The building itself can take hours, offering screen-free entertainment that feels meditative and satisfying. Lego designed this set specifically for adult builders, with techniques and details that challenge and engage experienced builders.</p>
<p>The completed model stands at<strong> 8.5 inches high, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong>, which makes it a substantial display piece that demands attention without being overwhelmingly large for most shelves or desktops. Its size feels impressive without overwhelming most shelves or desks. The gold-colored statue of the Hogwarts architect adds a finishing touch, placing next to the “Hogwarts Castle” nameplate to complete the museum-quality presentation.</p>



<p>This set joins the large number of Harry Potter builds that LEGO has made specifically for adult collectors. Fans love how such projects make for hands-on, mindful activities that help them relax after work-you can do it yourself over a few days or make it a group activity with fellow Potterheads. It was complex enough not to be frustrating for beginners but challenging for more advanced builders, who appreciate a lot of the architectural techniques and hidden details incorporated.</p>
<p>At $140, this 2,660-piece Hogwarts Castle set is a great value considering LEGO’s usual pricing and the size of the model. You’re getting a highly detailed and displayable creation of the series’ most iconic location for $30 off retail.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-makes-zero-profit-play-on-samsung-512gb-microsd-half-a-terabyte-storage-for-pocket-change-2000646699</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-makes-zero-profit-play-on-samsung-512gb-microsd-half-a-terabyte-storage-for-pocket-change.1362184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MicroSD cards solve the storage problem on phones, tablets, cameras and gaming devices but their tiny size makes them ridiculously easy to lose in couch cushions or washing machines. But the <strong>Samsung EVO Select 512GB</strong> somehow manages to pack half a terabyte of storage into something smaller than your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/"> just dropped it to an all-time low of $32 for Black Friday, down from its usual $46 price tag</a>. You get r<strong>ead speeds up to 160 MB/s</strong>, U3 and V30 ratings for 4K video recording, and <strong>an SD adapter</strong> that makes it work with virtually any device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps Up With Modern Files Size</h2>
<p>The <strong>512GB capacity holds about 100,000 photos, 80 hours of 4K video</strong> or 150 full console games, depending on file sizes. You can load your entire photo library onto it, download Netflix shows to watch on flights, and install dozens of Switch games without constantly juggling what stays and what goes. Considering modern smartphone cameras capture massive RAW files and 4K video that chew through storage in a blink, this much space is necessary rather than excessive.</p>
<p><strong>Read speeds of up to 160 MB/s</strong> means that files actually transfer to your computer instead of taking hours. You can move an entire vacation’s worth of 4K footage in minutes rather than leaving your camera or phone plugged into your computer overnight. The write speeds support real-time 4K video recording at 60fps without dropping frames or stuttering.</p>



<p>The U3 speed class guarantees minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s which makes it suitable for burst photography and high-bitrate video. V30 video speed class certification ensures sustained performance during extended 4K recording sessions. A2 app performance class means you can install and run Android apps directly from the card with acceptable responsiveness.</p>
<p>UHS-I interface technology maximizes transfer speeds when combined with compatible card readers and devices. The interface supports bus speeds up to 104 MB/s, which the card utilizes to the fullest during file transfer operations. On the other side, older devices still operate using the standard SD interfaces, but at slower speeds. The <strong>included SD adapter transforms the microSD card into a full-sized SD card</strong> that fits cameras, laptops, and desktop card readers.</p>
<p>Water, extreme temperatures, X-rays, magnets, drops, and wear are all covered by six-proof protection. You can wash the card in your pocket or drop it in snow by accident without losing data. The durability goes beyond common consumer electronics, which makes these cards reliable for outdoor photography, action cameras, and rough handling.<strong> Samsung backs such durability with a 10-year limited warranty</strong>, well over what most competitors can offer, and indicative of confidence in long-term reliability.</p>



<p>The card will <strong>work perfectly with Nintendo Switch consoles</strong> for storing downloaded games and screenshots with no performance issues. You may finally create a digital library of your games without being forced to delete previously purchased titles just to make space for newer ones. Smartphones with microSD card slots receive huge boosts in storage for photos, videos, music, and apps. Android phones that have low internal storage benefit hugely from offloading media files onto the card. Action cameras, like GoPros and DJI drones, rely on fast and reliable cards to capture high-bitrate footage, and this Samsung card does so consistently.</p>
<p>For $32, this Samsung EVO microSD card offers flagship capacity and performance for less than what a good phone case usually costs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-shows-no-shame-on-galaxy-a16-budget-phone-now-cheaper-than-generic-android-garbage-2000646688</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-shows-no-shame-on-galaxy-a16-budget-phone-now-cheaper-than-generic-android-garbage.1362163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung built its reputation on reliability across all price points, and the <strong>Galaxy A16 5G proves that you don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a phone that actually works well</strong>. This budget-friendly device covers everything more than half the population actually needs from a smartphone: decent screen, solid camera, all-day battery, and years of software support.</p>
<p>And the good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5852/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $169 for Black Friday, down from its usual $199 price tag</a>. For that, you get 5G connectivity, a large AMOLED display, expandable storage and six years of guaranteed updates. All combined, the essential features with Samsung’s proven quality make this the smart choice if you don’t need flagship overkill.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5852/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Features Without the Flagship Tax</h2>
<p>This <strong>6.7-inch AMOLED display</strong> shows punchy colors and deep blacks that make budget LCD screens appear washed out in comparison. Since AMOLED technology means each pixel is its own source of light, this allows for better contrast and energy efficiency compared to a screen using a backlight. That screen size provides ample real estate to read articles, watch videos, and navigate apps without having to squint.</p>
<p>The <strong>triple-lens camera system</strong> handles various shooting scenarios without requiring you to carry a separate camera. The main lens captures detailed photos when there is great lighting; such photos look great on social media and in photo albums. An ultra-wide lens expands your field of view for group shots and landscape photos where you cannot step back far enough. Further, the macro lens brings you close to small subjects, like flowers or food, adding to the creative flexibility it gives a user.</p>



<p>Although Samsung doesn’t say the exact model in marketing materials,<strong> the A16 5G runs on a capable chipset</strong> that handles everyday tasks without hiccups. You can browse your socials, stream videos, message your friends, and even use navigation apps with no noticeable hitches or hangs. Performance is good enough for casual mobile gaming, although more demanding titles with higher graphics settings might show a few frame rate drops.</p>
<p>Super fast charging juices up the battery quickly when you’re running low: Samsung includes a compatible charging brick in the box, so you don’t have to buy any additional accessories. The battery capacity will get you through a full day of typical use: calls, texts, social media browsing, and some video streaming. Heavy users might need a midday top-up, but the fast charging at least minimizes how much time you spend tethered to an outlet.</p>



<p>Internal storage starts at 128GB which holds thousands of photos, dozens of apps, and plenty of offline music or video content. The <strong>microSD card slot accepts cards up to 1.5TB for massive expansion</strong> if you need it. This flexibility beats phones with fixed storage that force you to delete content or pay for cloud subscriptions when you run out of space.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP54 rating gives basic protection</strong> against dust and splash water. You can use the phone without the panic of immediate damage in light rain or while at or near a pool, but it can’t sustain full submersion. Compared to older budget phones that had zero water resistance, this is a big upgrade.</p>
<p>It promises <strong>six years of OS and security updates</strong> which is simply unmatched in the budget segment. You’ll be getting Android version upgrades and monthly security patches well into 2031, stretching the useful lifespan of the phone far beyond that of typical budget devices. This longstanding support makes the A16 5G the better value investment, because you won’t necessarily be forced to upgrade after just two years.</p>
<p>For $169, this Android device provides everything the average user needs and none of the extraneous features that one might not need.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-offloads-forerunner-265-with-no-profit-amazon-piles-on-extra-cut-for-all-time-low-price-2000646707</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running watches often force you to choose between basic models that lack serious training features or flagship devices priced like rent payments. The<strong>&nbsp;Forerunner 265</strong> sits perfectly in the middle of Garmin’s extensive lineup and delivers advanced metrics and recovery insights without the $500+ price tag of their top-tier models.</p>
<p>And Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/"> just dropped it to an all-time low of $299 for Black Friday, down from its usual $449 price</a>. The watch is great for both weekend warriors building consistency and seasoned runners chasing PRs thanks to its training readiness scores, personalized workout suggestions, and multi-band GPS accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Training Intelligence That Makes You Faster</h2>
<p>The <strong>morning report</strong> greets you each day with a comprehensive overview of your sleep quality, recovery status, and training outlook. You see your HRV status, which tracks heart rate variability to assess nervous system recovery. The training readiness score combines sleep quality, recent training load, HRV status, and recovery time to tell you if you’re primed for a hard workout or need an easy day.</p>
<p>Daily suggested workouts automatically adapt based on your performance and recovery status. The watch creates personalized training plans that adjust after every run, increasing intensity when you’re recovered and dialing back when you need rest. Plug in an upcoming race and course into the Garmin Connect app, and the watch produces a race strategy widget with pacing guidance. The recommendations consider your current fitness level and how well you are progressing toward race day. This is like having a personal coach on your wrist.</p>



<p>Training status uses HRV data, recent exercise history, and performance metrics to determine if you are training productively, peaking, or overreaching. The system can distinguish when effort leads to improvements in your fitness versus when you’re accumulating fatigue without improvement. This can help you see the larger picture of your training cycle rather than getting hung up on individual workout results. Your feedback remains objective and data-driven, stripping out the emotional bias in training decisions.</p>
<p>The <strong>vibrant colors and crisp text on the 1.3-inch AMOLED touchscreen</strong> remain readable under direct sunlight. The always-on mode keeps your stats visible at a glance without needing wrist gestures or presses. The traditional button controls provide tactile feedback during runs when the touchscreen turns sluggish from sweat or rain. The 46mm case size will fit most wrists comfortably without looking oversized, while the lightweight design feels barely noticeable during long runs.</p>
<p>In smartwatch mode, with normal notification and activity tracking on, battery life extends to 13 days. The battery life does not last so long in GPS mode, yet it gets 20 hours of continuous use, which would cover ultra-marathons and multi-day adventures.<strong> Multi-band GNSS with SatIQ technology locks onto several satellite systems- most importantly GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo for superior accuracy</strong> in challenging environments. The system automatically switches between single and dual-frequency modes to optimize both the battery life and positioning accuracy without a trade-off.</p>



<p>The watch features<strong> more than 30 preloaded activity profiles for running, triathlon, cycling, swimming, strength training</strong>, and more. Open-water swimming mode uses GPS for distance and pace and does not rely on pool length. Every profile is designed to capture specific metrics for the given sport, like cycling power zones, swimming stroke type, or running dynamics. Data screens are customizable for each activity so you can see the metrics that matter most to you.</p>
<p>Safety features include <strong>incident detection</strong> which automatically sends your location to emergency contacts if the watch detects you’ve taken a hard fall during an outdoor activity. Assistance allows you to manually trigger an emergency alert when the watch is paired with your smartphone. Neither of these features works without cellular coverage on your phone, but both give peace of mind on solo runs down remote trails.</p>
<p>At $299, this running watch combines flagship training intelligence with AMOLED display technology for $150 off the usual price. You get advanced recovery metrics, personalized coaching, and multi-band GPS accuracy that normally requires an outlay of $500 or more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-makes-zero-profit-gamble-on-galaxy-z-fold7-foldable-flagship-drops-to-iphone-killing-price-2000646681</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-makes-zero-profit-gamble-on-galaxy-z-fold7-foldable-flagship-drops-to-iphone-killing-price.1362148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold7 faces virtually no competition in the premium foldable space, and Apple still hasn’t officially announced any plans to enter the foldable phone market. These Samsung devices typically launch at eye-watering prices that make flagship phones look affordable by comparison. But Amazon just dropped both configurations to all-time lows for Black Friday:<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/"> the 256GB model sits at $1,599 down from $1,999</a>, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/">the 512GB version hits $1,657 instead of $2,119</a>. These prices put the <strong>Z Fold7 in the same territory as a base iPhone 17 Pro</strong> which make tablet-sized screen real estate suddenly feel accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Screens That Make Sense Together</h2>
<p>The <strong>6.3-inch cover screen</strong> allows you to handle minor tasks without unfolding the device, and when you’re on the go, it’s just like using a regular smartphone. This external <strong>AMOLED display runs at 120Hz with HDR10+ support</strong> and makes scrolling smooth and content vivid. You can respond to messages, view notifications, control music, and snap photos using only the cover screen. Meanwhile,<strong> the inner 7.6-inch main display unfolds</strong> to show tablet-level real estate that revolutionizes how you work and play. This huge Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel also refreshes at 120Hz and provides great color accuracy due to its broad color gamut coverage.</p>
<p>Over seven generations, the folding mechanism has been refined to include a hinge that feels robust and that operates smoothly through thousands of opening cycles. Samsung has also engineered <strong>the display crease to be less noticeable than it was before</strong>. In fact, the layer of Ultra Thin Glass protection does feel more natural under your fingers than the plastic screens on earlier foldables.</p>



<p>Samsung gave the Galaxy Z Fold7 the<strong> latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor</strong>, which was built specifically for Galaxy devices. This processor brings desktop-class performance, handling resource-intensive multitasking, 3D gaming or video editing without any thermal throttling. The 12GB of RAM keeps multiple apps running simultaneously without reloading-a feature which matters a lot more on this device because you actually will use split-screen mode regularly. The 256GB model has plenty of storage for most users, but the 512GB version gives room for extensive photo libraries and big apps without having to constantly manage space.</p>
<p>A 4,400mAh dual-cell battery system means <strong>battery life extends through a full day of mixed use</strong>. Samsung splits the battery between both halves for optimal weight distribution in the phone. It<strong> supports 25W fast charging via USB-C</strong>, and reaches 50% capacity in about 30 minutes. The device also features wireless charging at 15W and reverse wireless charging at 4.5W and allows users to top up Galaxy Buds or other Qi-compatible devices using the back panel of the phone.</p>



<p>The rear camera array boasts <strong>a primary 50MP sensor</strong> with optical image stabilization, capturing high-definition pictures in different light conditions. A 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens extends your framing for landscapes and group shots. A 10MP telephoto camera offers 3x optical zoom to get closer without losing quality. The cover screen features a 10MP selfie camera for quick snaps, while the inner screen houses a 4MP under-display camera that remains nearly invisible when inactive. AI-powered photo editing automatically enhances images, removes unwanted objects, and suggests further adjustments, thanks to scene analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Android 15 runs underneath Samsung’s One UI 7 interface</strong> which is optimized for foldables. Apps automatically resize and reformat when you unfold the phone, smoothly expanding from the cover screen to fill the main display. Multi-Active Window allows running three apps simultaneously on the main screen, with windows that are resizable and can be moved around however users want. Drag and drop between apps makes intuitive tasks like moving photos into documents or sharing links between browsers. App Continuity ensures whatever you’re doing on the cover screen picks up exactly where you left off when unfolding to the main display.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold7<strong> includes tablet and phone capabilities in one device</strong> for hundreds less than its launch price, with 256GB costing $1,599 and 512GB costing $1,657. For the first time, foldable technology finally feels like a practical upgrade rather than an expensive experiment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-slashes-roborock-saros-10r-22-000-pa-monster-hits-lowest-price-ever-seen.1362133/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock’s latest generation pushes robot vacuum technology into territory that leaves competitors scrambling to catch up. The <strong>Saros 10R is their most advanced machine yet</strong>, and it justifies its premium positioning: it can deliver an excellent cleaning performance that surprises the pickiest homeowner.</p>
<p>This robot vacuum handles tasks that used to require manual intervention, from untangling hair to reaching impossible corners under furniture. And the good news is, it just dropped to an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">all-time low of $999 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from its usual $1,599 price tag</a>. The<strong> combination of 22,000 Pa suction</strong>, zero-tangling brushes, and a <strong>3.14-inch ultra-slim profile</strong> makes this a different beast compared to standard robot vacuums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Technology That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The ultra-thin design of 3.14 inches solves the biggest frustration with robot vacuums: they can’t reach under most furniture. Traditional models with raised LDS towers get stuck or skip entire sections beneath beds, sofas, and cabinets. The Saros 10R employs the <em>StarSight Autonomous System 2.0</em> to relocate all navigation sensors into the body instead of having them in a raised dome. This<strong> robot glides under furniture where dust bunnies actually live</strong>, and reaches spaces you’d normally clean with a stick vacuum on your hands and knees.</p>
<p>The <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce suction is strong enough to pull embedded dirt</strong> from carpet fibers and grab debris from hardwood crevices. This level of suction doubles what most competitors offer, making a visible difference on high-pile carpets and textured floors. The<em> Zero-Tangling DuoDivide Main Brush</em> splits incoming hair to prevent tangles, meaning you will never have to spend time cutting wrapped hair off the roller every week. The <em>FlexiArm Riser Side Brush</em> extends automatically to sweep corners and edges that circular robots normally miss, then retracts when moving through open spaces.</p>



<p><em>StarSight Autonomous System 2.0</em> brings true intelligence into navigation and obstacle avoidance. The 3D sensing technology maps your home with precision, <strong>recognizing and adapting to 108 different obstacle types</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis tackles transitions that stop other robot vacuums cold: It <strong>climbs thresholds and obstacles up to 4 cm high</strong>, including door transitions and U-shaped furniture legs that trap circular robots. In the case of carpet detection, the system automatically lifts the dual spinning mops to protect your rugs from getting soaked.</p>



<p>The Multifunctional Dock 4.0 takes care of maintenance tasks that usually require your attention: It washes mop pads with 176°F hot water and then dries them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew and odors. In the dock, <strong>collected dust is automatically emptied and can be stored for up to 60 days</strong> before you need to replace the bag. Auto tank refilling keeps the robot ready to go in any further mopping sessions, while the auto detergent dispenser adds cleaning solution at the right concentration.</p>
<p>At $999, this robot vacuum is giving you flagship performance for a full $600 off its usual price. You’re getting suction power, navigation intelligence, and self-maintenance features that exceed what $2,000+ competitors offer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-ssd-for-ps5-crashes-to-0-08-per-gb-turning-storage-expansion-into-a-near-freebie-this-black-friday-2000645584</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-ssd-for-ps5-crashes-to-0-08-per-gb-near-no-margin-black-friday-deal-on-amazon.1362118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="98" data-end="647">If you spend a lot of time gaming on a PlayStation 5, now might be one of the best moments all year to give your console a serious storage upgrade. Seagate has quietly rolled out discounts on one of its officially licensed PS5 expansion SSDs ahead of Black Friday, and the savings are pretty substantial. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5846/">Right now, the 2TB Game Drive PS5 NVMe SSD—complete with a built-in heatsink for PlayStation 5 compatibility—is going for 21% off.</a> Instead of its usual $215 price tag, it’s temporarily down to $170, which is a solid $45 cut for a drive that’s tailor-made for Sony’s latest console.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5846/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="98" data-end="647">Triple Your Games Downloaded</h2>
<p data-start="649" data-end="1250">Anyone who owns a launch PS5 is probably familiar this one drawback… the built-in storage fills up fast. Although Sony advertises an 825GB internal drive, a good chunk of that space is reserved for system software, leaving you with about 667GB for your actual games. Considering that many modern titles push well past the 100GB mark, it doesn’t take long before you’re staring at that “storage full” message yet again. Adding a Seagate Game Drive more than triples your usable space, which means far fewer hard choices about which games to delete when something new drops.</p>
<p data-start="1252" data-end="1751">Performance-wise, these SSDs keep up with the specs needed to support use with a PlayStation 5 (it is officially licensed Afterall). With read speeds reaching up to 7,300 MB/s and write speeds reaching up to 6,000 MB/s, they’re more than capable of handling the PS5’s fast load times. Games launch quickly, transitions feel smoother, and you can keep your entire library at your fingertips instead of constantly juggling downloads.</p>


<p data-start="1252" data-end="1751">The custom heatsink is there to help minimize thermal throttling so your PS5 can maintain peak performance over long play sessions. It’s also marked with the official PlayStation logo, though you’ll never see that again after installing.</p>
<p data-start="1753" data-end="2465">Seagate is also sweetening the deal with a little bonus. Every purchase includes a 14-day trial of PlayStation Plus Premium. That gives you access to a huge catalog of games you can immediately start downloading to that new drive. If you want to dive into something big, you can try titles like <em data-start="2048" data-end="2064">Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em data-start="2068" data-end="2090">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> without spending an extra dime. And if you prefer something a bit more offbeat, consider checking out <em data-start="2193" data-end="2218">Another Crab’s Treasure</em>. It’s a quirky indie take on the souls-like formula, blending colorful, retro-inspired visuals with surprisingly challenging combat. For anyone who hasn’t dipped into <em data-start="2388" data-end="2400">Dark Souls</em>-style games yet, it’s a wonderfully approachable starting point.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-quietly-dumps-ipad-air-on-amazon-only-selling-for-pocket-change-where-early-buyers-wont-look-2000646655</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-quietly-dumps-ipad-air-on-amazon-only-selling-for-pocket-change-where-early-buyers-won%E2%80%99t-look.1362115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple never does Black Friday sales on its site or in its retail stores, instead quietly passing discounts through Amazon. For example, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/">iPad Air 11-inch with M3 chip, 128GB storage and WiFi connectivity just hit an all-time low of $449 from the usual $599 price tag</a>.</p>
<p>This model fits perfectly between the base iPad and the Pro lineup and<strong> gives you pro-level performance with the M3 chip without paying for the OLED display and extra features</strong> most people never use. You get Apple Intelligence baked in, a gorgeous Liquid Retina screen, and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. This Black Friday deal makes the iPad Air the obvious choice if you need more power than the base iPad offers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M3 Performance Meets Everyday Portability</h2>
<p>The M3 chip provides desktop-class performance, <strong>all in an 11-inch tablet that weighs just over a pound</strong>. It’s the same processor architecture that lies at the heart of MacBook Air laptops for smooth multitasking across demanding apps and graphic-intensive games. You can edit 4K video, work with multiple layers in photo editing apps, and run complex productivity software without slowdowns. The chip also enables Apple Intelligence, which helps you write better, organize information, and get tasks done faster with AI features built directly into the operating system.<strong> All-day battery life</strong> means you can work through meetings, flights, and coffee shop sessions without hunting for an outlet.</p>



<p>This <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display offers razor-sharp visuals</strong>&nbsp;including P3 wide color gamut and True Tone technology. Colors appear accurate whether you’re editing photos, watching movies, or reviewing design mockups. <strong>Ultralow reflectivity coating</strong> keeps glare down in very bright locations like outdoor patios or offices with big windows. It <strong>refreshes the screen at 60Hz</strong> which is otherwise fast enough for just about everything one would do on an iPad despite lacking the 120Hz ProMotion smoothness of the Pros.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6E connects to the latest router technology for faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments. The 6GHz band reduces interference from neighboring networks and translates into more stable connections during video calls and quicker file transfers. The USB-C port takes care of charging, data transfer, and connections to external displays or storage drives.</p>



<p>The 12MP front camera features Center Stage technology and allows the camera to automatically pan and zoom during video calls, keeping you properly centered as you move about. That shines during presentations or family calls when you need to move naturally. The rear 12MP camera takes sharp photos and 4K video, making it surprisingly capable for document scanning and quick content creation.</p>
<p>The iPad Air slots between the $349 base iPad with its older A14 chip and the $999 iPad Pro with its OLED screen and M4 processor. You get the modern M3 chip and Apple Intelligence features the base model lacks but you skip the premium display tech and extra cameras most folks don’t need. At $449, this configuration delivers pro-level performance at a price that makes sense for anyone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Pushes the TP-Link WiFi Extender to Peanuts as It Dumps Remaining Stock After 10K+ Sold Last Month]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-pushes-the-tp-link-wifi-extender-to-peanuts-as-it-dumps-remaining-stock-after-10k-sold-last-month-2000645602</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-pushes-the-tp-link-wifi-extender-to-peanuts-as-it-dumps-remaining-stock-after-10k-sold-last-month.1362109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Pictures taking minutes to download? Social media feed doesn’t refresh as much as it should? Struggling to send messages? That’s not just frustrating, but can also affect your productivity when you’re trying to work or study at home. Heck, it even makes relaxing while watching some fun reels hard. If you have been facing all this and more while paying for speedy internet, the issue might not be with your internet service provider, but something at home – the router.</p>
<p>This is especially common in bigger homes, where everyone is trying to enjoy a fast, stable connection (as they should). The solution is simple. A WiFi extender can provide the boost you’re looking for, and these devices aren’t really on the expensive side, either. Most standard options sit around or under $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/">Thanks to an early Black Friday sale, the TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender has dropped by 37%</a>. It normally retails for $30, but after the discount, you can snap it up for just $19. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast, which also shows how common the slow internet issue is. It’s best to grab it as soon as you can, since we don’t expect it to drop any further during the main event. In fact, there’s a good chance the stock will run out by then.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No More Dead Zones</h2>
<p>One thing to note before proceeding is that WiFi extenders are made to improve/increase the WiFi coverage around your house, so they won’t have an effect on the internet speed directly. In most cases, getting stronger signals gives you the performance you’re paying for, but if there’s a speed issue on your internet provider’s end, it won’t fix that.</p>
<p>This extender offers coverage up to 1600 sq. ft., which makes it great for apartments, condos, and even homes. There are two adjustable external antennas that offer a reliable connection and fast speeds to up to 32 devices at the same time. You can connect your smartphone, laptop, tablet, computer, gaming consoles, and more, and still enjoy an impressive, strong connection on each.</p>



<p>Dual-band support gets you speeds of up to 300 Mbps on 2.4GHz and 867 Mbps on 5GHz, which means a combined 1.2 Gbps of total bandwidth. That translates into much faster browsing, lag-free streaming, better video calls, and more efficient gaming. Want an even stronger connection on one of your devices? There’s a fast Ethernet port for an improved wireless connection. This comes in handy for when you want to play a game or hop on an important video call and don’t want to leave anything to chance.</p>
<p>Access Point Mode support lets you convert a wired internet line into a WiFi hotspot, while EasyMesh compatibility lets you expand the network by connecting the extender to any EasyMesh-compatible router for a bigger setup.</p>
<p>Setting things up is quite straightforward. TP-Link’s intelligent signal indicator helps you find the ideal place to position your extender for maximum coverage. Once you have installed it into place, head over to the TP-Link Tether app on your phone and follow the on-screen instructions to get started. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to get everything going, even if it’s your first time doing this!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5845/">It was already quite affordable at $30, but this deal lets you grab it for $19.</a> That’s practically nothing, considering the features and peace of mind it gets you. It’s better to get your orders in quickly, as the price can shoot back up anytime.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackery-decided-margins-dont-matter-300w-power-station-now-cheaper-than-fancy-power-banks-2000646676</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Jackery Explorer 300 has become the <strong>best-selling portable power station on Amazon this Black Friday</strong>, and here’s why. This compact unit creates backup power during winter outages, camping trips and emergencies and only <strong>weighs a mere 7.1 pounds</strong>.</p>
<p>And the good news is, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/">just dropped it to an all-time low of $159 from its usual $259 price tag</a>. The 293Wh lithium-ion battery packs enough capacity to charge laptops, phones and small appliances without requiring a noisy gas generator.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious power in a grab-and-go package</h2>
<p>The 293Wh battery capacity gives you real runtime that you can actually plan around. You will have enough to <strong>recharge a smartphone about 24 times</strong>, power a laptop for about 4 to 5 hours, or run a small LED light for days.<strong> Two Pure Sine Wave AC outlets deliver clean 300W power</strong> that’s safe for sensitive electronics like medical devices and modern computers. Pure sine wave output matches the quality of electricity from your wall outlets to prevent the voltage spikes and fluctuations that damage equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Recharging takes just 2 hours to reach 80% capacity</strong> when you plug into a wall outlet and use the 60W PD USB-C port simultaneously. This dual-charging approach gets the battery ready fast when you need to head out quickly. You can also recharge through your car’s 12V outlet during road trips, slowly building capacity while you drive.</p>



<p><strong>Six output ports</strong> support multiple devices simultaneously with no need for adapters or splitters. Two AC outlets power standard household devices such as fans, portable heaters, or small appliances. A <strong>60W PD USB-C port</strong> quickly charges laptops, tablets, and modern smartphones and can double as an input to recharge the power station itself. A Quick Charge 3.0 USB-A port supports rapid charging in compatible phones and accessories. Additionally, <strong>a standard USB-A port</strong> supports older devices, and the DC car port powers 12V equipment such as portable coolers or tire inflators.</p>
<p>At 7.1 pounds, this power station is really portable compared to the much heavier models that require two hands to carry. You can grab it with one hand and move it around your campsite, vehicle, or home during power outages. The compact footprint fits within car trunks, under seats, or within closets without occupying any valuable space.</p>



<p>Winter power outages become less stressful when you have backup power for essential devices. You can keep your phone charged to stay connected, power a small space heater for warmth, or run medical equipment that can’t go offline. Silent operation means you can use it indoors without the noise and exhaust fumes of gas generators. An LCD screen displays remaining battery percentage, input/output wattage, and charging status at a glance, so you always know how much power you have left.</p>
<p>At $159 during Black Friday, this portable power station provides peace of mind and practical backup power for $100 less than usual. You’re getting enough capacity for emergency situations and weekend camping trips in a package that actually stays portable.</p>

              <p>Over-ear and noise-canceling headphones are not for everyone. Sure, these block all external noise for a more immersive experience, but if you prefer a more minimal design and like to stay aware of your surroundings, in-ear headphones can be a better fit for you. Best of all, now is a great time to treat yourself to a top-rated option without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a week away, but you don’t have to wait till then to start saving. Almost all big retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart are offering plenty of early deals already, and we’re spotting deep discounts on some of the best earbuds out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5843/">Amazon, in particular, is being the most generous right now and has dropped the price of Shokz OpenFit 2 to just $125.</a> That’s after a nice 31% discount on the usual price of $180, and the deal applies to the black option. It’s open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their orders, as well.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to grab yourself a pair, it’s best to do it as soon as you can, as early deals tend to disappear fast. We’re not expecting this one to last more than a couple of days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5843/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable to Wear, Plus Powerful</h2>
<p>This pair is super lightweight and comfortable to wear. Each earbud weighs just 9.4g, and is designed using Shokz Ultra-Soft Silicon 2.0 for a natural fit. The flexible nickel-titanium ear hooks contour to your ears for a personalized fit, meaning you can wear them for hours without feeling uneasy. The secure fit also makes them great for physical activities like workouts or runs, as you won’t have to constantly worry about them slipping and falling out.</p>
<p>There are multifunction buttons on the earbuds that let you adjust volume, manage music, take calls, and more with a single tap, without reaching out for your phone. As for the performance, you will enjoy detailed, rich sound that’s made possible with the Shokz DualBoost composite drivers and OpenBass 2.0 algorithm. Expect bass to remain clear and deep even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. Songs will come to life, and podcasts will feel more engaging. In fact, calls will get better, too. The four built-in beamforming microphones are paired with smart noise canceling technology and AI algorithms to cut out the background noise as you hop on meetings or catch up with friends; great for when you’re out and about.</p>



<p>Battery life is better than any other option in this range. A full charge gives you 48 whole hours of continuous jamming with the charging case. Without it, you can enjoy 11 hours of battery in total. Running low and don’t have the time to fully juice them up? No worries. A quick 10-minute top-up gets you an additional two hours of listening.</p>
<p>Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds also offer IP55-rated water resistance, so sweat while working out or light rain on the way back home won’t hurt. Multipoint pairing is supported as well, which means you can connect to up to two devices at the same time, and switch between them within seconds. Those who prefer having a bit more control over their music will appreciate how the Shokz app lets you tailor your listening experience with four preset EQ modes or create your own. You can also customize the physical button’s actions through the app.</p>

              <p>There’s no reason gamers need to spend big bucks on a Logitech MX Master for office productivity when all they want is pure gaming performance. The <strong>G305 Lightspeed mouse</strong> delivers everything competitive players actually need without the ergonomic bells and whistles you’d use for spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Right now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/">it’s hit an all-time low at $27 on Amazon, down from its usual $49 price tag for Black Friday</a>. This wireless gaming mouse packs Logitech’s Hero 12K sensor, Lightspeed wireless technology with 1ms response time and runs for 250 hours on a single AA battery.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wireless That Performs Like Wired</h2>
<p>Lightspeed wireless technology eliminates the lag that plagued older wireless mice. The <strong>1ms report rate matches what you’d get from a wired connection</strong> which means your cursor moves exactly when you move the mouse. You won’t notice any delay during flick shots or quick building edits in competitive games. The wireless receiver stores inside the mouse body when you’re traveling, so you won’t lose that tiny USB dongle in your bag.</p>



<p>The <strong>Hero 12K sensor tracks up to 400 IPS</strong> and offers <strong>adjustable sensitivity up to 12,000 DPI</strong>. High IPS ratings come in handy when one is making fast swipes across the mousepad in the heat of an intense firefight. It retains its accuracy even when you’re making those swift moves that would confuse cheaper optical sensors. You’ll be able to dial in your preferred DPI settings and save them to the mouse’s onboard memory.</p>
<p>The <strong>weight of 99 grams keeps the mouse agile</strong> without feeling cheap or flimsy. Lightweight mice reduce fatigue during marathon gaming sessions and allow for easier and quicker adjustments. Pro players who want to shave off even more remove the AA battery cover and install much lighter AAA batteries with foil adapters to do so. The shape works well for different grip styles from palm to claw down to fingertip, though smaller hands might find it more comfortable than larger ones.</p>



<p><strong>Six programmable buttons</strong> are enough to provide options for most games without overcomplicating the design. You can use Logitech’s G Hub software to map things like abilities, building modes, or weapon swaps to the side buttons. Your button configurations are stored in the onboard memory, so you don’t need to install software on every computer you’re using it with.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life extends to 250 hours of continuous use on a single AA battery</strong>. You can game for months before needing to swap batteries, and the mouse warns you when power runs low. Using standard AA batteries means you can grab replacements anywhere instead of hunting for proprietary charging cables. This extended battery life is possible without sacrificing tracking performance thanks to the efficient Hero sensor.</p>
<p>At $27, this mouse delivers professional-level wireless performance for less than half its normal price. You’re getting the same sensor and wireless tech that Logitech puts in its $150 flagship mice.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-clearly-isn%E2%80%99t-prioritizing-profit-as-the-nasa-apollo-lunar-roving-vehicle-goes-cheaper-than-expected-this-black-friday.1362082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Space (or the universe as a whole) never ceases to amaze me, and I’m sure it’s the same for everyone who likes looking up at the sky and wondering about all that could be out there. Well, a couple of us (humans) have actually been to the moon, and while the rest can’t exactly visit it as of now, there’s definitely a way to celebrate one of our biggest celestial achievements by bringing the iconic rover from the Apollo 17 mission home.</p>
<p>Lego’s Technic NASA Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle LRV building set lets you build a detailed replica of the rover, plus includes a wealth of accessories to pay the mission a tribute. On a regular day, this set would run you around $220, which isn’t exactly budget-friendly, but that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5842/">Thanks to an early Black Friday deal, you can grab it for $154, after a whopping 30% off its retail price.</a></p>
<p>The discount is available to all shoppers, whether you’re a Prime member or not. There are no long coupons to worry about, and no complicated procedures to follow. The catch? The deal is selling out fast, which means it’s likely going to wrap up soon. If you’re a space freak, now is the time to build your very own collection of NASA-themed builds. Have an enthusiast in your life who just can’t stop talking about all the cool possibilities out there? Gift it to them for holidays; it’s going to make their entire year!</p>

<h2>Packed With Authentic Details</h2>
<p>At this point, I am convinced there is a Lego set for every cool thing that exists out there; which is a good thing. This set, in particular, isn’t really a small one. You’re getting 1,913 pieces in total, but don’t let that overwhelm you. Building it is going to be fun, and you can even invite friends over to join the project!</p>
<p>The model, once made, measures over 5.5 in. (14 cm) high, 15 in. (38 cm) long, and 10 in. (25 cm) wide, so it’s going to be display-worthy. You will be building the main rover with its seats, steering, suspension, and scientific tools, plus three detailed equipment attachments. There’s a battery pack with heating and cooling elements, a dedicated communications unit, and even tools to collect the samples. You can attach all of these to the rover, or place them nearby; whichever you prefer. Lego even includes a model interpretation of the famous rock sample in the set! The attention to detail is truly impressive, as you’re literally getting everything that played a part in the mission.</p>



<p>It’s quite detailed on its own, but you can also pair it with the Lego Creator 31152 Space Astronaut set to create a bigger, more detailed display to appreciate our heroes. Like most Lego sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If the book feels hard to follow, you can also install the Lego Builder app. This platform offers 3D instructions where you can zoom in from every angle, track your progress, save sets, and more.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this set, especially now that you can bring it home without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5842/">The current Black Friday deal drops it to $154, which is quite affordable considering all that you’re getting</a>. It won’t last forever, though, which is why it’s best to act fast to grab it. Once the discount or the stock is gone, it might not even come back for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-makes-zero-profit-play-on-dualsense-edge-sonys-pro-controller-drops-to-black-friday-chaos-2000646641</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is slashing prices across Sony’s entire gaming lineup this Black Friday, from the PS5 Slim and PS5 Pro consoles to the PS Portal and every controller in between. And the good news is that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">DualSense <em>Edge</em> just hit an all-time low at $169, down from its usual $199 price tag</a>. This is the <strong>pro-level controller that separates serious players from casual gamers</strong>&nbsp;and it fixes the biggest complaint about the standard DualSense: <strong>limited customization</strong>.</p>
<p>You get mappable back buttons, swappable stick modules and deep control customization that the regular $74 DualSense (now on sale at $54) simply can’t offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the Edge Different</h2>
<p>The standard DualSense works just fine for most gamers but the Edge takes things several levels further. You get <strong>two mappable back buttons</strong> that sit right under your middle fingers, ready to handle actions you’d normally stretch your thumbs to reach. These buttons let you jump, crouch, reload or activate abilities without taking your thumbs off the analog sticks. For competitive players, this means never having to break their aim during heated firefights. You can <strong>save multiple control profiles and swap between them</strong> depending on which game you are playing.</p>
<p>When drift inevitably happens, the stick modules pop out and swap in seconds. You don’t have to buy a whole new controller or go through warranty claims, just switch out that single affected module and you’re good to go. Sony <strong>includes different stick cap options</strong> in the box: standard, high dome, and low dome variations that change how the sticks feel under your thumbs. The low dome caps are preferred by many fighting game players for quick, precise inputs while FPS fans like the high dome for finer aim control.</p>



<p>The<strong> trigger customization goes even deeper</strong> than the standard DualSense’s simple trigger effect toggle: You can adjust the travel distance of the triggers along with the dead zones to perfectly suit your playstyle. For racing games, it feels more responsive with shorter trigger pulls, and for shooters, longer pulls seem better, enabling accuracy more.</p>
<p><strong>All the core DualSense features are present in the Edge model</strong>: The haptic feedback still delivers those subtle vibrations that make you feel raindrops or footsteps through the controller. Adaptive triggers dynamically resist your fingers to create tension when drawing a bow or accelerating a vehicle. A built-in speaker and microphone handle quick voice chat without needing a headset. The <strong>controller connects to your PS5 via USB-C or wirelessly</strong>, and the included braided cable charges while you play.</p>
<p>At $169, this controller is a $30 savings off the usual price for a pro-grade set of features. You’re paying nearly twice what the standard DualSense hardware costs, but the customization options and replaceable parts are so much worth the premium. For competitive players, this controller offers precision control and longevity not found in the basic model.</p>
