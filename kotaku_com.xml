Despite the different name, Strategists serve the same role as a Support: Keep your team healed, use utility effects like revival, damage boosting, and other augmentations. At launch, there are seven Strategists on the <em>Marvel Rivals </em>roster.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-heroes-similar-main-1851725562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-heroes-similar-main-1851725562">5 <em>Marvel Rivals</em> Characters That Will Remind You Of Your <em>Overwatch</em> Main</a></span></p><p>Not all seven are made equal, though. Even in the game’s launch weekend, a few superstars are rising to the top.<strong> Here are the two best Strategists in the game</strong>, keeping in mind that much could change in the game’s developing meta.</p><h2 id="h148814"><a id="raccoon"></a>Rocket Raccoon is the second-best Healer</h2><figure id="" data-id="f92f3b1f04c396872077411b4e647e2c" data-recommend-id="image://f92f3b1f04c396872077411b4e647e2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Rocket Raccoon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Rocket Raccoon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f92f3b1f04c396872077411b4e647e2c" data-recommend-id="image://f92f3b1f04c396872077411b4e647e2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Rocket Raccoon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Despite what his foul-mouthed and abrasive exterior may indicate, Rocket Raccoon cares about his friends. So, it’s incredibly fitting that he makes the cut as the runner up for the best Strategist in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. His healing grenade launcher can quickly heal multiple allies at once. And his ultimate ability can help damage boost any surrounding allies, which can be a great boon in team fights.</p><p>Rocket’s best asset, though, is his revival ability: the Battle Revival Beacon. The B.R.B. can revive a single fallen ally, and it also produces armor packs. The beacon has a 45-second cooldown, but negating even one death is a huge boon. It can also help a costly mistake become nothing more than a small inconvenience. Adam Warlock has similar strengths in this department–especially with his Team-Up Ability–but Rocket’s ease of use and flexible healing output gives him a slight edge over the golden guy.</p><h2 id="h148815"><a id="jeff"></a>Jeff the Land Shark keeps your team healed better than anyone</h2><figure id="" data-id="870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-recommend-id="image://870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-recommend-id="image://870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s incredibly difficult to recommend <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">anyone but Jeff</a></span> as the best healer in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.

Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962"><em>Marvel Rivals </em>Fans Are Ready To Curbstomp Jeff The Land Shark</a></span></p><p>What makes Jeff so great comes down to one thing: <strong>speed</strong>. Other healers like Loki and Cloak and Dagger also heal with their primary fire, but they all have much less ammo. On the other hand, Jeff just has a sustained beam that needs to be reloaded much less. Because of this, he can focus on a strong tank and let them wreak havoc. This is in addition to his fast movement speed, aided by his movement skill that lets him swim underwater while self-healing.</p><p>And to top it all off, there’s his ultimate. There’s no way to make this sound fancy or formal. Frankly, it’s absolutely wild that this is in a hero shooter. Jeff can swallow up both enemies and allies (in a <em>very generously large </em>area), and spit them wherever he’d like. nine times out of 10, this results in enemies being spit off of a cliff and the deaths of quite a few teammates. It sure can change the tide of a team battle in a flash. Don’t let his cute face fool you. Jeff is an absolute menace.</p><p><br><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PC.  </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
