Goethe’s <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> was blamed for a string of suicides, with little to no evidence, the moral panic itself far more likely the cause.</p><p>In 370 BCE, Plato writing Socrates’ words in <em>Phaedrus</em> took the helm of another moral panic. He wrote, “This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.” Socrates was talking about the act of <em>writing</em>.</p><p>The concern that the new thing the kids are into is causing society’s ills is as old as society itself, and it has long served a very specific purpose: to distract from the far more obvious causes.</p><figure id="" data-id="a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-recommend-id="image://a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-format="jpg" data-width="870" data-height="370" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Canterbury School of Humanities</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-recommend-id="image://a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-format="jpg" data-width="870" data-height="370" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are very many examples of how video games are used as scapegoats for far more serious, fundamental causes of issues. But generally, the same purpose applies: it’s misdirection. The politician’s one hand is frantically waving around over here, gesticulating about the harm these games are doing to our youth, while the other hand is quietly passing an unseen wad of cash to a rich chum.</p><p>When Mike Johnson drops in his line about young men requiring Medicaid support because they’re “playing video games all day,” this is a very deliberate act of misdirection. In his speech, he even suggests that this act by these dastardly fellows is taking money away from the deserving recipients of…access to healthcare, single mothers, the elderly, and the disabled. See, video games are not only hurting these foolish men, but also indirectly causing suffering toward other groups you care about! Do not be in any doubt for a single moment that Johnson wouldn’t instantly turn on single mothers, the elderly, the disabled, or anyone else, if it were politically expedient for him, but in this example, he’s carefully chosen his specific misdirection.</p><p>Hell, let’s not lose sight of the fact that just one month ago, Mike Johnson trotted out the exact same line about “able-bodied” men mooching off the state with their games. Except that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/mike-johnson-issues-medicaid-warning-2037182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.newsweek.com/mike-johnson-issues-medicaid-warning-2037182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time it was as a part of his promises to <em>not</em> cut Medicaid</a></span>. And this is the same Mike Johnson who, in January this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/18/politics/house-remote-voting-new-moms-congress/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/18/politics/house-remote-voting-new-moms-congress/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tried to stop a bill</a></span> that would allow new mothers to remotely vote in the six weeks after they’ve given birth.

The point is, he doesn’t give a shit about single mothers and the awful effects video games are indirectly causing them.</p><p>What he—and the Trump administration at large—actually care about is ensuring their rich friends get richer, and if that involves nickel-and-diming the poorest, then perfect. We’re all arguing over whether video games cause lethargy or whatever, while Medicaid intended to be raided for $880 billion at the same time as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://newrepublic.com/post/193865/mike-johnson-donald-trump-budget-cuts-medicaid&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://newrepublic.com/post/193865/mike-johnson-donald-trump-budget-cuts-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporations and billionaires receive tax cuts</a></span> totalling $6.8 trillion.</p><figure id="" data-id="99acf07cc33f221f7a8bedc6cddaadea" data-recommend-id="image://99acf07cc33f221f7a8bedc6cddaadea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leader Jeffries at a press conference about Republican cuts to Medicaid." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leader Jeffries at a press conference about Republican cuts to Medicaid." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kayla Bartkowski / Staff<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="99acf07cc33f221f7a8bedc6cddaadea" data-recommend-id="image://99acf07cc33f221f7a8bedc6cddaadea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leader Jeffries at a press conference about Republican cuts to Medicaid." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To actually, meaningfully address the issue of those in long-term joblessness would take not only a lot of hard work, but also require money be taken from the richest to afford the changes. The fact that most of these apparently languorous men who play games all day are in fact in part- or full-time jobs, but are paid so badly that they cannot afford even the most basic healthcare, would seem like a systemic societal issue that should demand addressing. Something is fundamentally wrong when those who work the hardest are paid the least, and then it’s <em>those people</em> (including single mothers, the disabled, and every other category of the working poor) who are not only demonized, but targeted to have even more money taken from them. That’s an atrocity, but don’t notice! Look at the wavy hand pointing at the video games!</p><p>Or take the incessant blaming of video games (and all the other media that came before it) for real-world violence. Since <em>Doom</em> was co-blamed for the Columbine High School massacre, the scapegoating of gaming for violence and gun crimes in the United States has become commonplace.

The epidemic of school shootings, happening with a frequency and gruesome normality that’s utterly unlike any other developed nation, demands politicians deal with the reality of the lives of America’s young people in a way that is close to impossible without being decried as—boo, hiss—socialism.</p><figure id="" data-id="582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-recommend-id="image://582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-recommend-id="image://582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, blame it on video games!

Video games are as political as any other form of media, and they can absolutely be used to attempt to spread harmful ideas or normalize bigotry. Just like cinema, theater, books, songs… We should absolutely always be thinking critically about the games we consume, and providing counterpoints when we disagree with messages. But despite this, and despite the vital importance of it, whenever the words “video games” are coming out of a politician’s mouth as a culprit for society’s ills, immediately redirect your eyes to see what their other hand is doing. Because there’s always something there they don’t want you to see, think of, or ask questions about.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, we found out back in 2021's “The Matrix: Resurrections.” Despite other stars like Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss returning and reprising their roles in the fourth film in the franchise, Laurence Fishburne, who played and helped shape the iconic role of Morpheus, did not return.<br></p><p>Instead, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II joined the film as an alternate “version” of both Morpheus and the franchise’s villain, Agent Smith. Fans, of course, were confused and many let down by the omission of the Emmy and Tony Award-winning actor in the film. Now, on a recent appearance on “The View,” Fishburne is finally opening up about why he was not involved in the film, and his answer will surprise you.</p><p>A fifth installment is currently in the works, and when asked by “The View” host Sara Haines asked if Fishburne would return, Fishburne replied, “It depends on the circumstances — who is involved, how well the script has been written, if they offer me.” He then said, “You know, I offered my services to the fourth <em>Matrix</em>, and they didn’t respond well.”</p><p>To the shock of the hosts including Sunny Hostin, Whoopi Goldberg and more, Fishburne continued, “So hey, it’s not like I didn’t say, ‘Oh, I’d like to offer my services.’ I did. And for whatever reason, that didn’t happen.”</p><p>He then called it,  “the truth” of the situation, before adding, “So we’ll see.” Hostin chimed in then, saying, “You need to come back!” Haines added, “It sounds like a decision as to whether they want it to be a great ‘Matrix’...”</p><p>At the time of the fourth film’s announcement, Fishburne did publicly state that he was not invited, though did not go into the depth the same way he went today on “The View.” He simply said at the time, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923">we reported,</a></span> “I have not been invited. Maybe that will make me write another play. I wish them well. I hope it’s great.”</p><p>The fourth film was certainly a success and did well enough at the box office to justify a fifth installment. Hopefully this time the powers that be wake up and consider Fishburne’s offer, after all, he is all but synonymous with this series!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
