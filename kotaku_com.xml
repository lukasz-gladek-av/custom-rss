The chances are, if you’re among them, the massive amount of content and currencies can be a bit overwhelming, especially if you don’t have any previous experience with the series or other free-to-play games. This guide will explain everything you need to know about <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket.</em></p><h2 id="h89482"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket?</em></strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-recommend-id="image://89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-recommend-id="image://89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name implies, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is a free-to-play mobile version of the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> and is available on iOS and Android. The app offers a lighter simulation of the excitement of the physical game, letting you open up booster packs, add them to your “binder,” and use those cards to build decks and battle other players or the computer. Much like the real TCG, you can choose to approach it as you prefer, whether that’s by collecting all the cards to admire the stellar artwork, or to create a brutal arsenal of <em>Pokémon </em>that will crush other players online.</p><p>You can also engage in different missions that provide rewards upon completion. Some of them can be fairly simple, such as opening a pack, while others could require you to collect specific cards or register a set number in the Card Dex—basically the record of your collection. Most of these will be completed just by playing the game, but you do need to remember to go into the Mission Menu to collect your rewards.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-recommend-id="image://1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-recommend-id="image://1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much like the real world, you get more cards by opening booster packs. However, unlike their physical counterparts which contain ten cards, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>boosters (like those gained through code cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em>) only contain five. The launch set is called Genetic Apex, with three different booster pack arts, Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. These three types each have some specific cards unique to them: for example, if you want the Pikachu ex card, it’s only available in the Pikachu pack.</p><p>If there’s a particular card you’re looking for, make sure you are opening the correct type of pack. The card list for each, as well as their percentage chance of being pulled, can be viewed by tapping the “Offering Rates” Button in the left corner.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just open as many packs as you want. You need to make sure you have enough Pack Stamina, which refills automatically on a timer. Every 12 hours, the bar refills, allowing you to open up another pack. For those bad at math, this means you can open two packs a day, receiving only ten new cards a day. Fortunately, the game has some ways to speed up this timer, as well as other methods to get new cards, like the Wonder Pick.</p><p>The Wonder Pick is basically a roulette where you can select one random card from a pack that another player has opened. Don’t worry, you aren’t stealing from them, you are just getting a chance to get the same card they pulled. Depending on the rarity of the cards in their booster, it could cost up to three Wonder Stamina, which also refills on a timer. Wonder Pick can be a great way to get a specific card, but given the randomized nature of what you get, it can be frustrating spending three Wonder Stamina trying to get a full-art or EX card, only to get a garbage common one. Still, the option is there, so you might as well use it, especially once you start filling out your collection and need incredibly specific cards to complete it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-recommend-id="image://54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-recommend-id="image://54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you open a pack, your cards are automatically added to the “My Cards” section, which can be viewed by pressing the second button from the left on the bottom of the screen. From here, you can create specific binders to show off cards from your collection, or build a display board to highlight a favorite card. This section also lets you add “Flair” to individual cards, which is just a cosmetic effect such as sparkles or bubbles, by consuming duplicates and Shine Dust. If you are having trouble adding flair to a card you have multiples of, make sure you have the correct quantity of copies of the card and ensure you will still have at least two remaining after the flair is purchased. Also note that Shine Dust is only used to add flair, so don’t worry about hoarding it.</p><p>By pressing a tab near the top of the screen, you can also toggle between recently added cards and their quantities, or have the cards organized by their placement in the expansion. The former is useful in quickly searching if you have enough duplicates to add flair, while the latter can be incredibly helpful in determining what is needed to fill holes in your collection.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-recommend-id="image://83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-recommend-id="image://83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the many ways to spend money in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is the Premium Pass subscription. This gives you access to an additional Stamina bar that refills every 24 hours, allowing one more pack to be opened per day. You will also gain access to Premium Missions that offer a unique currency called “Premium Tickets,” used for special rewards and cosmetics such as promo cards, or battle cosmetics like coins and sleeves. It costs $9.99 per month, which is a little steep for what you get, but there is a two-week free trial if you want to try to complete all the missions to snatch up the first set of redeemables, which are Mewtwo themed.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-recommend-id="image://e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-recommend-id="image://e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>By playing the game and completing missions, you will probably notice you’re obtaining at least two types of hourglass items: Pack Hourglasses and Wonder Hourglasses. Both of these are consumables that can be used to refill their respective Stamina bar by one hour. For example, if you just opened a booster pack, you can use 12 Pack Hourglasses to immediately open another one.</p><p>You will gain these items by completing daily missions, or by leveling up, but you can also purchase them in the Shop by using a whole different type of currency called “Shop Tickets.” These are gained by completing the game’s “Step Up Battles,” which are <em>TCG Pocket’s</em> Computer Controlled fights, by completing Event Missions, and from gifts sent by other players after you’ve battled or Wonder Picked with them. It may be tempting to hoard your Hourglasses, but they can only be used to open packs, so don’t feel bad about using them to do so. Though, if you do save up 120 Pack Hourglasses, you can open ten packs at once which is a very cool experience.</p><p>When you first start the game, it’ll throw buckets of hourglasses at you, until you get very used to having them. Then it rather sharply reduces that rate, while nudging that you could always buy some more, so be careful not to get sucked into the sense that they’ll keep on flowing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-recommend-id="image://71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-recommend-id="image://71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It wouldn’t be a free-to-play game without a premium currency, so of course <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has one of those. Among many other ways to spend it, the creatively named Poké Gold can be used to speed up your Stamina bar if you find yourself short on hourglasses. You can use a combination of both Gold and hourglasses, and the game will automatically apply the most efficient usage of both. There is also currently bonus gold for buying the $1, $5 and $10 packages, but note these bonuses can only be used for each increment once.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-recommend-id="image://1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-recommend-id="image://1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Yes, there are more currencies. Mentioned briefly above, Shop Tickets are obtained by completing different missions or battles, and can be redeemed to buy item cards, different cosmetics, or hourglasses. These are probably the most versatile currency in the game, so they should be used on whatever you prefer. There are also Emblem Tickets which are awarded by completing Dex milestones, such as registering a set number of cards, and can<em>&nbsp;</em>be<em>&nbsp;</em>used to buy Emblems from the Store. Emblems are just badges you can apply to your profile, and don’t really have any impact on the game. Right now, the options are Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo, so if you have enough, just use it on whatever monster is your favorite of those. There are also Special Shop Tickets which can be gathered by spending regular Shop tickets, or consuming high-rarity cards. These let you purchase Special Series cosmetics such as coins and playmats, though they aren’t too exciting.</p><hr><p>For a game about collecting cards, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>complicates this simple hobby by including an obscene amount of currencies and cosmetics that may leave you with a headache even Psyduck could’t handle. While it is a lot to take in at first, most of these currencies can only be used on a specific aspect of the game—such as hourglasses—so you don’t need to worry about spending it on the “wrong” thing. Just play the game however you want, and good luck collecting ‘em all.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And you know what’s pretty great about that? The console and mobile versions of <em>Stardew Valley </em>just received the 1.6 update that introduced a million changes that fans have explicitly asked for over the years, as well as fresh content by way of new events and dialogue.

It has never been a better time to hide away by moving to a small town, inheriting your grandfather’s farm, and hitting on some cute locals.</p></div><div><p>There are a lot of things going on in the world that I have zero control over, but I can clean my own home, and that’s often enough for me. For years, I took for granted the euphoria of a clean space I could call my own, as well as the actual act of cleaning itself.

I’ve done my part already, despite how badly I want to clean up the messes that others keep making. But I can’t, and it’s important to know when to take care of others, and when to take care of myself. And when I finally make the call to do a little something for me, it often means turning off the lights, crawling into bed, throwing on some relaxing music, and powerwashing my troubles away. Let this be a balm for your soul like it has for me.</p></div><div><p>Okay, so I understand that I screamed at you all to ditch big RPGs that charge you with making huge decisions, so why not take on an even bigger one that doesn’t ask you to do any such thing?

But the great thing about <em>FFXIV</em>–and this is a staple of most MMOs if we’re being entirely honest–is how many supplementary things there are to do to immerse yourself in the world beyond the main story quest. Do you want to earn some titles and cute minions? Do literally anything else on offer, like become a master crafter, or fisher. There are multiple jobs that you can take on that have nothing to do with combat, dungeons, trials, or anything remotely like that. You can lock in to the most idle game content ever and spend your hours relaxing, casting a line, and chatting with friends in a Discord call. Take it from one of said friends who has been on that call, my friends seemed utterly blissed out, and that could (and perhaps should) be you, too.</p></div><div><p>Music is how I most often come down. The minute I pop my overpriced earphones into my head and put on my messy, uncurated playlist of liked songs, my worries wash away. Even now, I’m listening to Phoebe Bridgers and Connor Oberst’s joint record <em>Better Oblivion Community Center </em>to simultaneously listen to a record I’ve meant to throw on for some time now, put on something folk-adjacent to relax the nerves, and motivate me to write today.

I came to peace with the things I could and couldn’t do, and became better at seizing opportunities to make triumphant and huge plays. I learned to take my time and pick my moments, and by internalizing that, I made peace with some part of myself that rarely enjoyed it.</p><p><em>Tetris Effect actually </em>gave me that, but it’s also just a thoroughly relaxing version of <em>Tetris </em>set to trippy visuals and the aforementioned house music with lyrics about connectedness. If what you really need is a semblance of unity, perhaps in the face of overwhelming dread and an existential threat, there are few experiences that can soothe you like <em>Tetris Effect</em>.</p></div><div><p>My <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4"><em>Sims</em></a></span><em> </em>girlies have always been ahead of the curve on this one, if I’m being totally honest. These games aren’t for me, but I can understand how they could be for others. Hell, life has gone sideways a million different ways, and a game enabling me to be delulu, remake myself, and act out my fantasies sounds like a wonderful gift.</p><p>I think it’s good that we all have something that we can have control over that routinely brings us some bit of joy or peace of mind. <em>Sims </em>is the blueprint, in this regard; the original feel- good game to relax withto and drown out the noise of the world with. <em>The SiIms 4</em>, like the rest of the series before it, is an exercise in complete and selfish control, a luxury so many of us are often denied, and risk having taken away from us at numerous disappointing junctures.</p><hr><p>I don’t know about you all, but I could stand to pull a bit of a disappearing act right now. The <em>Final Fantasy XIV Online </em>icon on my desktop is looking mighty tempting, and while I’ve resisted it for some time now, maybe I owe it to myself to go somewhere better. At least, until the real world begins resembling my greatest fantasies a bit more. Anything but this, y’know?<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For some who forked over nearly $100, for the fanciest version that provided the earliest access, the game was basically unplayable due to server issues for days. Other players shared videos of physics and graphical bugs. In other words, <em>Solar Crown’</em>s launch was a big mess, and now, for those early players, the developers are offering a free (digital) Porsche as an apology, alongside a large update. </p><p>On November 4, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4505380324428942357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4505380324428942357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Test Drive</em> publisher Nacon and developer KT Racing posted an update to Steam</a></span> thanking players for their “patience and support.” And to help win people back, those who logged into <em>Solar Crown </em>before October 12 will automatically receive the “Adventurer” edition of the 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe after Season 2 launches. </p><p>Meanwhile, Nacon and KT Racing announced that on Tuesday the second major patch for <em>TDU Solar Crown </em>will be available on all platforms. This patch is focused on improving stability and performance on Xbox, PS5, and PC. The patch also promises to fix many of the server login issues players have been encountering since September. </p><p>“Over the past few weeks, we’ve worked hard to roll out multiple maintenance phases and hotfixes aimed at enhancing the game,” explained Nacon. “We know there’s still work to be done, and we hear you. Please know that your feedback is invaluable, and our development team is fully dedicated to addressing the issues you’re encountering as quickly as possible, while also refining features to ensure a smoother, more enjoyable gaming experience for everyone.”<br></p><p>Will a free car and the promise of more fixes be enough to win players over? I’m not sure. So far, the game’s Steam review rating is still standing at Mostly Negative.

Unfortunately, there was a bug that made their custom appearance revert back to one of the default settings found in the character creator when starting the game. Folks, it was a massive bummer to get to some of those big story moments and not see my old hero as he should look. But hopefully this patch will rectify that issue so no one else has to deal with that when they reach the ending. The short list of some of the patch notes includes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>- Fixed an issue where some customizations were not applied to the Inquisitor correctly in one scene.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>- Fixed an issue where DLSS options could end up “grayed-out” on a 40-series Nvidia GPU.

By the time I got to the ending and saw some stranger posing as my Inquisitor, I was taken aback by such a cataclysmic bug rearing its head after nearly 60 hours.

Isn’t it just for kids? Aren’t you supposed to be playing <em>PUGB</em> instead? No! Because as nauseating as the infinite merch and all-pervading presence of the game may seem, it’s actually a <em>really </em>fun multiplayer shooter. And given it’s free, it’s still worth a look. But ho boy, seven years of development has piled up into one ridiculous mess of a lobby screen, making even just finding the core game a bemusing exercise. So, let us guide you through the madness.</p><p>Starting <em>Fornite</em> is, in itself, deeply confusing. Once you’ve created an account, you’ll be faced with a ludicrous wall of game modes before realizing there are multiple tabs to look through, piles upon piles of quest types, ongoing storylines, and a Battle Pas–and that’s all before you’ve figured out how to just start a game of vanilla <em>Fortnite</em>. On top of that, if you want to unlock a skin, you’ll either need to complete a quest or purchase them. That’s not even mentioning the game’s weapon color system. But don’t worry because this guide will break down everything you need to know about playing <em>Fortnite</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-recommend-id="image://96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-recommend-id="image://96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When loading into <em>Fortnite</em>, you’ll automatically be in the “<strong>Play</strong>” section. This is where you can select various game modes to play. The majority of the modes are fan-made and can be played with friends. But if you want to play the vanilla <em>Fortnite</em> or other official Epic modes, you’ll need to scroll down until you see “<strong>By Epic</strong>.” From there, you should see all of the official Epic Game game modes that <em>Fortnite </em>is known for alongside the studio’s logo on the thumbnail.</p><p>Once you’re here, you’ll see modes such as “Ranked Reloaded, Ranked X Trials,” and much more. The Ranked modes are lobbies usually meant for people looking for more of a challenge. Most of these people are looking for other high-skill players to improve their rank on the <em>Fortnite</em> leaderboards.<br></p><p>If you’re looking for a more casual game, keep scrolling until you land on the Battle Royale mode, AKA vanilla <em>Fortnite</em>. This is the type of game that <em>Fortnite </em>is mainly known for. The rules for this mode are simple: The last one standing wins. From here, you can pick between two types of Battle Royale: Build and Zero Build.<br></p><p>If you’re looking for a faster Battle Royale, you can always play Reloaded. Like the normal mode, this can also be played in Build or Zero Build. However, it’s worth pointing out that this mode significantly differs from the normal BR mode. The map is much smaller and takes inspiration from OG <em>Fortnite</em>. When players die, they can respawn as long as the feature is enabled and their teammates are still alive. If this sounds a bit familiar to you, it’s because this is Epic’s version of <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> Rebirth Island mode. The games usually play a lot quicker and can be more intense. So, don’t jump in expecting a slow game.<br></p><p>To change lanes a bit, there’s <em>Lego Fortnite</em>, which is like an entirely different game. In a nutshell, this is Epic’s version of <em>Minecraft</em> and other survival games. There is a bit of a story to it, but the main goal is to build a base and survive for as long as possible. This is a third-person mode in which you’ll go toe-to-toe with various fantasy beasts and monsters.<br></p><p>In the vein of shaking things up, there’s also a mode called Rocket Racing. As the name suggests, this is a mode in which you and other players race against one another. The rules are fairly simple: be the first one to cross the finish line, and you’ll win. Think of this mode as Fortnite Mario Kart, if that helps.<br></p><p>The last big mode is Fortnite Festival. This mode allows you and other players to play licensed music from artists such as Lady Gaga, The Weeknd, and even Fortnite original songs. This is a rhythm-based mode in which you’ll be tasked with pressing the right buttons as they appear. There are two types of Festival modes you can play. The first is the Main Stage. This is where you all work together and jam out to get the highest score. The other is Battle Stage, where you’ll compete against one another to see who gets the highest score.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-recommend-id="image://f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-recommend-id="image://f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Build and Zero Build play similarly, but each mode has a few significant differences. Players must destroy structures around the island in Build to get building supplies. They can farm and build from three different structures: wood, brick, and metal.</p><p>Wood structures build the fastest but have the least health. Brick takes a bit longer to build and has a decent amount of HP. Metal takes the longest to build but it has the most HP out of all three materials.<br></p><p>When playing Zero Build, you won’t have the option to do that. To combat this, players have an additional 50 overshield that automatically refills itself up. So, players can potentially have up to 150 shields throughout the match.<br></p><p>Other than that, both Build and Zero Build play the same.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-recommend-id="image://154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-recommend-id="image://154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you play the game, you’ll unlock various items such as Back Bling, Gliders, and sometimes Skins. To equip these, you’ll need to be in the main menu once more and scroll over to the “<strong>Locker</strong>” section.</p><p>You can change various aspects of your character. So, if you unlocked a Back Bling and think it’ll be nice on Peely, you can mix and match it all you want. On top of that, you’ll be able to change up the Glider, which you use at the beginning of the game, to land. You can also change your contrail, which is the ora you see as you descend from the bus.<br></p><p>That’s not the only thing you can switch up. On top of unlocking cosmetic items, you can do the same with emotes. To do this, scroll down one tab in the Locker section, and you’ll be able to equip up to <strong>seven </strong>at a time.<br></p><p>If you want to change the skin of your gun, you can change it by looking at the “<strong>Wrap</strong>” section. Just like character skins, these vary from wrap to wrap. Some are more colorful and dynamic than others. These don’t give you any special edge, as they just personalize your current gun.<br></p><p>The last main thing you can personalize is how your car looks in-game. Like everything else mentioned in this section, they don’t give you any kind of edge. They just make you look cool.<br></p><p>Occasionally, Epic will allow players to unlock free car skins, but most of the time, they’ll have to purchase them with real-world money using V-Bucks. The car skins can range from cool-looking generic ones to real-world cars such as the BMW. You’ll also be able to change how the car rims look, smoke, and even boost.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-recommend-id="image://225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-recommend-id="image://225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s always good to go into a game to complete a quest. These quests vary based on which game mode you’re playing. So, make sure the quests are compatible with the standard BR mode if you’re jumping into a BR game. Most of the time, these quests will reward you with XP, and you’ll unlock more cosmetic items on special occasions.</p><p>It’s also worth pointing out that there are story-based quests players can complete. As the name suggests, these tell the story of what’s happening in the current BR season. These are worth doing because they trigger audio clips and reward you with many XP.<br></p><p>If you have a particular quest you want to complete before jumping into a game, you can track it. To do this, go to the specific quest you want to do and press “<strong>Track Quest.</strong>” When you load into a game, it’ll be highlighted for you and guide you through what you must do.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-recommend-id="image://01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-recommend-id="image://01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While playing <em>Fortnite</em>, you’ll notice that guns and items will have a specific color to them. This is extremely important because the color tells you much about the weapon at face value. For instance, whenever you’re rebooted back into a lobby, you’ll spawn in with a grey pistol, which isn’t the best because grey is the lowest-ranking color. </p><p>Below is a list of every weapon color, alongside its rank.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Grey - Common</li><li>Green - Uncommon</li><li>Blue - Rare</li><li>Purple - Epic</li><li>Orange - Legendary </li><li>Gold - Mythic</li><li>Cyan - Exotic</li></ul><p>One thing worth mentioning is that Epic often changes its mind about adding exotic weapons. Sometimes, they replace Mythic guns with Exotic ones, and other times, both are available in a single season. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9c7b6e9e3457cf901bd60c48d766e7f3" data-recommend-id="image://9c7b6e9e3457cf901bd60c48d766e7f3" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A zoomed out Fortnite map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A zoomed out Fortnite map" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c7b6e9e3457cf901bd60c48d766e7f3" data-recommend-id="image://9c7b6e9e3457cf901bd60c48d766e7f3" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A zoomed out Fortnite map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The key to not dying immediately is to land where others are not. For example, if the bus is flying from Sandy Steppes to Castle Doom, you’ll want to avoid places like The Raft, Reckless Railways, and Restored Reels because they’re all within the immediate area.</p><p>Instead, you’ll want to land at places like Brawler’s Battleground or Rebel’s Roost. The further, the better. Because more often than not, most players won’t bother to land that far off from the bus route. Since you’ll be landing at a named land, the odds of finding good gear are incredibly high, and if you’re one of a handful of people there, you could loot up the entire area before anyone else.<br></p><p>If you do this, you should be able to at least survive the initial drop and get some good items along the way. It’ll also give you some time to experiment with guns so you can decide which ones you like.<br></p><p>We recommend always having at least one to two healing items at all times. Because you never want to be in a situation where you’re low on HP and die immediately in a fight.<br></p></div></div><div><p>Now that you have a solid load out, you’ll need to keep things going. There’s nothing worse than getting a bunch of kills just to die immediately. Finding a car is a good rule of thumb for long-term survival. These offer protection and allow you to travel across the map with ease. Plus, there are plenty of gas stations across the island. These let you refill your tank and recover from whatever damage it took.</p><p>You’ll also want to keep an ear out for other players fighting. The second you hear shots, get there as quickly as you can. More often than not, both players will be on the verge of death, and this is a fast way to earn an easy double kill or single kill. But be warned, you’re probably not the only person doing that. (This is also great if you’re in the final circle, too)<br></p><p>In <em>Fortnite</em>’s current season (Chapter 5 Season 4), vaults will open as the storm closes. These vaults will always have good loot, and on top of that, each one has a workbench that allows you to modify your gun. Those mods will make all the difference in a fight and can carry you to a victory royale. The catch is that the lobby will be notified when a vault opens up, so it’s a high-risk reward.<br></p><p>We also suggest you avoid Loot Island. It’ll always spawn mid to late-game. If you capture it, you’ll be rewarded with top-notch items. But the thing is, most of the lobby will be going there, and more often than not, the best players in the lobby would like to capture it. We don’t recommend going to the island unless you’re willing to risk it for the biscuit.<br></p><p>There you have it! Our ultimate guide on how to play Fortnite. Hopefully, this made things a bit more digestible for you to understand and made it easier to survive until the late stages of a Battle Royale match.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
