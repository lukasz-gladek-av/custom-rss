The streamer declined and the man responded that he was just going to keep following the group. </p><p>At this point the streamers leave and tell the young man they don’t need any more stalkers. But as they nervously discuss what happened and try to get some food, the stalker returns and stands nearby, watching them. When the women decide to leave, the man gets aggressive and charges at them. At one point he can be heard yelling: “I’ll kill you right now.” After the man charged the women and security got involved, the IRL stream ended abruptly.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokiSage/status/1896424451652350106&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokiSage/status/1896424451652350106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The entire incident was captured on camera</a></span> and broadcast online.

At first he portrayed a rapping villain. Over time he became very popular, and in 2005—after winning his first WWE Championship—he became a babyface aka a good guy in all future storylines and events. And for the last 20 years, as he granted over 600 kids their dreams as part of the Make-A-Wish foundation and became a movie star, he’s remained a babyface despite many wrestling fans wishing he’d turn heel aka become a bad guy again. But with each passing year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1j2de7s/john_cena_heel_turn_after_he_won_the_wwe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1j2de7s/john_cena_heel_turn_after_he_won_the_wwe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and as Cena himself joked</a></span> about it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028/slides/2#:~:text=To%20properly%20execute,his%20inner%20villain.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028/slides/2#:~:text=To%20properly%20execute,his%20inner%20villain.">it became more and more unlikely that the face of the WWE brand would ever be a villain again</a></span>.

But that was when Cena signaled to Rock that he was willing to make that deal, and the soon-to-be-retiring wrestler attacked Rhodes signaling his heel turn. The moment received one of the loudest crowd pops I’ve ever heard as people lost their mind watching Cena finally go bad. <br></p><p>After the historic heel turn, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsPKjOOB5k/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=cd7d9aad-33e3-4f7b-9cfb-b8b19950384e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsPKjOOB5k/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=cd7d9aad-33e3-4f7b-9cfb-b8b19950384e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cena posted an image of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> on Instagram</a></span>, a reference to the meme that we have received so many long awaited things before Rockstar’s open-world sequel. Meanwhile, wrestling fans have started doing what they always do in these moments: Speculate on what will happen next, get excited about the next big event, and explain how actually this wasn’t surprising at all because they saw it coming. </p><p>Regardless of all that, Cena turning heel in the final weeks of his WWE career as he enters his last WrestleMania to face one of the company’s biggest new good guys, Cody Rhodes, feels like a exciting end to one of the greatest wrestling careers of the century. Will he turn back to babyface at the very end? Will he win it all? Will he go out a villain? We’ll have to wait until April to find out, but even I, someone who barely watches wrestling, am excited to see how it all plays out. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it felt eerily like one late last month when an in-game reward was locked behind a busted community event. “We are not looking to transform <em>Space Marine 2</em> into a full live-service game,” the developers said in a recent update. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195928,195371" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The event in question was called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1iu413x/new_community_event/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1iu413x/new_community_event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperial Vigil</a></span> and went live on February 21 and ran through March 3. Players had to compete to earn victories with each of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-classes-explained-1851641688&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-classes-explained-1851641688">the game’s six classes</a></span> in operations mode to win the emblem-less Mark VIII Errant Helmet. Two things rubbed players the wrong way about this. </p><p>The first was seemingly locking a cool in-game cosmetic behind a timed-event, leveraging FOMO (fear of missing out) to make fans play the game in an arbitrary way during an arbitrary time period. The second was that both the progress meter for the event and unlocking the cosmetic were busted. </p><p>“This is some of the worst implemented ‘rewards’ system I have ever seen! I played my 6 games of each class on ruthless yesterday, then play some regular lethals while I waited for it to update,” one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1iwk0ji/never_do_this_again/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1iwk0ji/never_do_this_again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> on the<em> Space Marine</em> subreddit early on during the event. “Hours later it said 3/6 so I ran through all 6 again on substantial then went to bed. When I woke up it said 4/6 and now having run all 6 again it’s still on 4/6! I have played a minimum of 21 games in the past 24 hours 18 of them focused on getting this damn helm!”</p><p>Many others <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1ixfas6/this_event_was_sponsored_by_nurgle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1ixfas6/this_event_was_sponsored_by_nurgle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were struggling too</a></span>. The event had to be twice taken offline for fixes, narrowing the 10 day window for it even further. Plus, the whole appeal of <em>Space Marine 2</em> is that it’s not a game you have to constantly keep up with like a second job. In a world of <em>Destiny</em>s,<em> Apex Legendses</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>s, it’s one of the rare online multiplayer shooters where you can log on, have some fun, and then forget about it for a while. Unless you were trying to get the Mark VIII Errant Helmet or other recent event-gated cosmetics. </p><p>“We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items,” <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s developers at Saber Interactive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on February 28. “We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform <em>Space Marine 2 </em>into a full live-service game.”</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">message continued</a></span>:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone.</strong> We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone. </p><p>However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far. We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining.</p></blockquote><p>So in addition to having community events run more smoothly in the future, Saber also confirmed that their rewards will eventually be circulated into the game for everyone else regardless of whether they were around to participate in the original event or not. It’s unclear if this was always the plan or only something the development team arrived at after the recent Imperial Vigil train wreck. But given the Live-Service Lite™ nature of <em>Space Marine 2</em>, players will be more eager to know when the game’s next major content update and first story DLC will arrive. <br></p><p>The developers also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently confirmed</a></span> that a big 7.0 patch is on the way and teased what players can expect from<em> Space Marine 2</em>'s long-awaited Horde mode. “You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now,” they confirmed. “One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the <em>Space Marine 1</em> Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
