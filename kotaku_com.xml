              <p>A bus load of Homer Simpsons appeared with little warning in Southern California earlier today. And it’s all part of an elaborate marketing stunt to promote the newest update to the ongoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296"><em>Fortnite x Simpsons</em> season</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, after plenty of teasing and leaks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">Epic released a massive update for <em>Fortnite</em></a> that changed the game into a big ol’ <em>Simpsons</em> crossover, complete with a new island that is modeled after the long-running animated show’s Springfield. The season has been a big hit for Epic, and each week in November, Epic and Disney (the owners of <em>The Simpsons</em>) have published new animated <em>Simpsons</em> short telling a story of what happens when <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142"><em>Fortnite</em> collides with the longest-running sitcom in history</a>. And the season’s next update involves a lot of Homers, with some of them spilling into our reality.</p> <p>On November 18,&nbsp; a few dozen people wearing Homer Simpson costumes invaded the Promenade in Santa Monica, California. You can see what that looks like in the video uploaded by Santa Monica Closeup on YouTube earlier today. You’ll also spot a Peely-fied version of Professor Frink, too. This new <em>Fortnite</em> season is weird.</p>

  <p><a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1990733727857582299">As reported by<em> Discussing Film</em> on Twitter,</a> the horde of Homers was also spotted at a donut shop in the area, where they then proceeded to take it over and cause chaos. I assume the owners gave permission and were paid, but imagine being a random person walking in there for some coffee and a glazed donut and running face-first into 12 Homer mascots ripping the place apart.</p> <p>The cloned Homers are part of the next update for <em>Fortnite</em>, as seen in the short below, and will start appearing in the game on November 19. And Epic, please stop adding character skins based on <em>Simpsons</em> characters. I only have so much money.</p>

No, it’s not about microtransactions or a bad character design, as often happens with gacha games.

              <p><span>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched this summer, a cheaper, Japanese-only version of the console was made available domestically. Some speculated the more affordable console (which cost around $340 compared to the multi-language Switch 2’s $480) was offered to address a weak yen or the cost of living in Japan, but whatever the reason, it helped: the Switch 2 was Japan’s biggest ever console launch, according <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-is-by-far-japans-biggest-ever-console-launch-likely-clearing-1-million-units/">to <em>VGC</em></a></span><i><span>.&nbsp;</span></i></p> <p><span>In June, the other Japanese gaming behemoth, Sony, said it was keeping an eye on the Switch 2 in terms of competition, but wasn’t all that concerned because of the PlayStation 5’s “differentiated strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/606826/sony-ps5-vs-switch-2-sales/"><span>as reported by </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishini said that the PlayStation 5 was “the best place of play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“We believe PS5’s level of performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering to players and creators in this current console generation,” Nishino said.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>But over the last few weeks, Sony has displayed a renewed interest in its Japanese market, holding a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049"><span>Japan-centric State of Play on November 11</span></a><span> that focused on games developed in the region, and also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085"><span>announced a cheaper PS5 that</span></a><span>, similar to the Switch 2, is only for use in Japan. It’s the first region-locked console Sony has released since the PlayStation 2, and a new report suggests this maneuver may be because Sony is finally considering Nintendo a proper competitor.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to a report from </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/playstation-ceo-pushed-through-cut-price-ps5-in-japan-after-seeing-system-slump-against-switch-2"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span> (based on a translation from </span><a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/media-create-sales-week-45-2025-nov-03-nov-09.4147/page-7#post-367685"><span>Install Base user Hartmann</span></a><span>, which lines up with machine translation of the segment), Japanese media outlet </span><a href="https://txbiz.tv-tokyo.co.jp/original2/vod/post_329817"><i><span>TV Tokyo</span></i></a><span> discussed the price drop with local experts, who suggested that Sony wasn’t bothered by PlayStation’s shrinking market in Japan until hearing of Nintendo’s cheaper Switch 2. According to the </span><i><span>TV Tokyo </span></i><span>segment, Sony executives decided to ape Nintendo’s approach, and allegedly approved the PS5 price cut in just four months.</span></p> <p><span> The reporters also suggest that Sony president Nishino, who stepped into the role this past April after taking over for Dutch-born Hermen Hulst, felt so strongly about PlayStation’s flagging brand in Japan (Nishino is Japanese) that he helped push the region-specific console to market.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Japanese-only digital version of the PS5 goes on sale on November 21.&nbsp;</span></p>
