              <p>So, you’ve invested in a good gaming PC, a high-resolution display, and an immersive sound setup, but the whole thing still feels incomplete? You need good lighting to match your in-game mood and aesthetics. Hardly any brand does smart lighting better than Govee, and we just spotted its gaming light bars going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/">This pair of lightbars, with a smart controller, retails for $90, but you can pick them up for just $55 today, after a sweet 39% discount.</a> There are no coupon codes to enter or long checkout steps to follow; just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free shipping with their purchase, which ultimately brings the total cost down even further. Best of all, if you place your orders today, you’re going to get them before Christmas, which is great for anyone looking to host game nights with friends during the holidays. However, considering how this is the lowest price these have dropped to since launch, we’re not expecting the discount (or the stock) to be around for long. If your current play setup is in need of a bit of personality, now is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Gaming Experience</h2>
<p>You’re getting a sleek pair that can sit nicely on either side of your desk, and lets you choose from 16.8 million colors for DIY lighting effects for a personalized experience. There are over 60 preset scene modes, as well; basically one for every mood. The dedicated app lets you tweak settings, adjust modes, play around with colors, and more. In fact, the scenes are divided into categories like emotion, games, festival, and funny, which makes the light bars great for year-round use. Go for a brighter setting when you’re feeling a rush of energy inside, a warmer tone during holiday dinners, and maybe switch to something a bit calmer on those slow nights.</p>
<p>The lights are capable of syncing with audio from both your speakers and headphones, a feature that lets them react to whatever’s happening on your computer screen. Expect a cozy setup during those cute Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin moments in Crash Landing on You, and let the lights go wild when it’s time to take out some bad guys in Valorant. Translation? A much more immersive viewing and gaming experience that makes you feel like a part of the action.</p>



<p>The smart desktop dial takes the experience even further by allowing you to adjust the brightness, change the modes/colors, and turn the light bars on/off without pulling your phone out. Just keep it on your desk, and make necessary adjustments in seconds when needed. Voice control is supported, too, as the lights play nicely with Alexa and Google Assistant. This way, you can simply speak to command; ideal for when you can’t afford to take your hands off the controller or keyboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/">These smart LED gaming lights are now down to $55, thanks to this 39% discount at Amazon.</a> They not only offer a ton of colors to choose from, but also include preset modes and music syncing capabilities to upgrade the entire vibe of your place. Snap it up quick, though, as the deal could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MagSafe 5000mAh Portable Charger for iPhone Drops to All-Time Low, But Only for Prime Members]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/magsafe-5000mah-portable-charger-for-iphone-drops-to-all-time-low-but-only-for-prime-members-2000652131</link>
            <guid>1378483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fumbling with charging cables while trying to use your phone feels like a problem from the previous decade, and <strong>MagSafe technology finally removes this annoyance by magnetically snapping power banks directly to your iPhone’s back</strong>. This <em>TRKOY</em> wireless charger delivers 5,000mAh of backup power in a slim profile that stays attached while you scroll, call, or photograph without requiring any cables during use. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6331/">Amazon has dropped the price to a record low of $19, down from the usual $32, though you’ll need a Prime membership to access this deal</a> and grab one of the most practical iPhone accessories available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6331/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Magnetic Strength That Stays Strong</h2>
<p>The<strong> 15N magnetic force makes a connection that is strong enough</strong> to keep the power bank attached even when you’re walking, talking on the phone, or taking pictures at weird angles. This magnetic strength is just right because it keeps the charger connected during normal use but lets go easily when you pull it off on purpose. This way, you don’t have to deal with magnets that are either too weak to hold or too strong to separate without a lot of effort. You can answer calls, look at social media, or take selfies while the charger stays perfectly aligned on the back of your phone and this solves the cable management problems that come with regular power banks.</p>



<p>The phone and charger package is easy to handle with one hand because it is <strong>only 11.8 mm thick and weighs 120 grams</strong>: This is not the case with bulky power banks that make your phone feel like a brick and this slim design doesn’t get in the way of your phone’s cameras, so you can take pictures and videos without the charger blocking the lenses or making weird shadows. The design works well for situations where you need power but can’t put your phone down for a long time, like following GPS directions while walking, streaming events live, or keeping video calls going during your commute.</p>
<p>The <strong>5,000mAh capacity gives you enough power to fully charge an iPhone 17 once</strong> but for larger Pro Max models, this means about 50–80% of a full charge, and for standard and Mini models, it means a full charge. This amount of power is a good balance between useful backup power and keeping the charger slim enough to carry every day. However, people who use a lot of power every day might find the capacity limiting.</p>



<p>With dual charging, you can charge your iPhone wirelessly with MagSafe while also charging another device, like AirPods, an Apple Watch, or even an iPad, through the USB-C port at faster wired speeds. You won’t have to carry around a bunch of chargers or decide which device gets power first when you’re away from outlets because of this flexibility. You <strong>can also use the USB-C port to charge the power bank itself</strong>&nbsp;which makes things easier because you can use the same USB-C cable that charges many modern devices.</p>
<p>Comprehensive protection circuitry keeps an eye <strong>on the temperature, voltage, and current during the charging process</strong> to stop overheating, overcharging, and short circuits that could harm your phone’s battery or put your safety at risk. The smart cooling chip controls how heat is released which makes sure the charger stays at safe temperatures even when it’s charging for a long time.</p>
<p>When you compare it to other magnetic chargers from well-known brands that cost $40 to $60 or more, spending $19 on a MagSafe power bank is a great deal. The usual price of $32 already made it competitive with other options, but the 39% discount for Prime members makes it so cheap that people will want to buy it right away because it’s so convenient.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-union-busting-firing-keir-starmer-2000652135</link>
            <guid>1378480</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">recent firings of 34 <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> developers</a> at Rockstar UK have generated a lot of suspicion that the action was <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">a response to these workers being unionized</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030">Protests have ensued</a>, and today the topic was raised in the UK’s Parliament, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer describing the situation as “deeply concerning.”</p> <p>The 34 members of the Scottish development team were fired in October based on claims of “gross misconduct” by Rockstar, but this was quickly refuted by the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) representing unionized developers, saying that it was in fact an act of “union busting.” Rockstar has heavily denied this, but <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/">the IWGB has pressed ahead with a case for unfair dismissal</a>, and the protests continue.</p>

 <p>This furor has now reached the UK government, after the MP for Rockstar’s constituency of Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, Chris Murray, raised the matter during Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions. Asking a question of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Murray raised the claims of union busting, and explained that he had met with Rockstar and that they had “failed to reassure me they are following employment law.”</p>

 <p>“It’s a deeply concerning case,” said Keir Starmer. “Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we’re determined to strengthen workers’ rights and ensure they don’t face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case that he raises and keep him updated.”</p>   <p>For context, Prime Minister’s Questions is a weekly event in the UK Parliament that takes place every Wednesday lunchtime, where the leader of the opposition and other members of Parliament are able to put questions to the Prime Minister. This usually begins with a tiresomely performative piece of theater as the two main rival party leaders exchange overly scripted insults designed to win headlines, before it then moves on to a more useful period in which genuine concerns can be raised in the House.</p>

 <p>However, it’s important to note that while opposition questions will usually be loaded with point-scoring, questions coming from the PM’s own party are very rarely combative, and usually pre-planned—the likes of, “Would the Prime Minister agree that we’re all doing a completely splendid job, and the Conservatives were super-extra rubbish?” Murray’s question, while obviously not sycophantic, was certainly planned and Starmer’s reply was pre-written.</p>

 <p>Labour is, in theory, a pro-union party, and has historically been in large part funded by the UK’s various major unions, as opposed to the Conservatives who are mostly funded by big businesses and Satan himself. However, in recent years Labour has betrayed its union roots to the degree that it’s now losing the support of many trade unions. Starmer actually saying something pro-union will be a relief to many, and hopefully put a chill down the spine of many corporations who thought there was no more need to worry about stomping all over their workers.</p> <p>Or it’ll be another lie and nothing will happen. But it’s fun to pretend to have hope.</p>

              <p>The holiday season is a great time to finally make the purchases that feel a little out of budget the rest of the year. If you’ve been eyeing a laptop upgrade for yourself, or want to gift one to someone who really needs to let go of their old machine, now is a great time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/">The latest Lenovo IdeaPad in the stunning cosmic blue color, just dropped by 73% on Amazon, which brings its price down to $1,235</a>. It typically sits over $4,000, so this discount puts it in a much more affordable price range. This version comes packed with features that are great for professional use, and apart from the discount, you’re also getting an accessory kit thrown in for free with your purchase. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, as well, meaning you’re getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box. It ships before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to gift it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals, Powerful Performance</h2>
<p>For a little over $1,200, you’re getting a machine that flaunts a Cosmic Blue aluminum chassis that’s both refined and rugged. It gives off a premium feel, but meets military grade standards that protect it from everyday wear and tear well. There’s a stunning 16-inch WUXGA (1920×1200) IPS touchscreen offering 300 nits of brightness and an anti-glare finish; both making for an immersive, yet comfortable viewing experience. Integrated Intel Graphics takes care of your late-night streaming sessions, online meetings, creative tasks, and even some gaming with ease, plus is paired with intelligent power allocation that maintains smooth visuals even when things get intense.</p>
<p>You’ll find a high-quality FHD 1080p IR camera with a physical privacy shutter for better video calls. It supports Windows Hello facial login, which adds another layer of security and lets you safely log in to the system even in dim lighting. Speaking of dimmer settings, the keyboard features a bright backlight that makes it easy to type long documents and work your way through projects 24/7; great for those of you who often find themselves pulling all-nighters.</p>



<p>As for power, you’ve got a muscular 10-core Intel Core 7 240H processor capable of hitting speeds up to 5.2 GHZ, and an on-chip AI Boost NPU rated at 18 TOPS. These make the machine more than capable of running resource-intensive programs and handling everyday workload without a hint of lag. The 32GB DDR5 RAM lets you multitask through busy days like a pro, while the massive 2TB SSD is spacious enough to house all your important content and files in a single place. The latter also offers much faster boot and load times, making the whole system snappier from the moment you power it on. What’s more, the memory and storage are expandable up to 64GB and 4TB, respectively, so you can always make necessary adjustments as your needs grow.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity comes from WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. Port-wise, it gets you dual USB-C (DP 1.4 + PD 3.0), dual USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (one Always On), HDMI 1.4b, microSD reader, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/">And finally, the accessory kit includes a Redragon patented wireless mouse, an external optical drive, a screen wipe, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed.</a> That’s everything you need to get started with work and play right away. Just be sure to snap the deal up fast, as it is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is out now, and it adds new Mega Evolutions, timed roguelike expeditions, and some more story to tie it all together. However, hidden in all this new stuff is the death of a dream that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans have nurtured for years. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu’s two mega forms</span></a><span> may have been met with celebration from fans, but by finally giving the boy his due, Game Freak put the final nail in the coffin of Pikachu’s original final form, Gorochu.</span></p> <p><span>For those who don’t know, Gorochu was meant to be a third form in the Pikachu evolution line back in the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>days. This mysterious form never saw the light of day, but Game Freak has described </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/"><span>it in interviews</span></a><span>. While discussing the original Pikachu design process in 2018, artist Atsuko Nishida said that her original parameters for the electric mouse that would become the series’ mascot were that it had to be an electric-type monster that would evolve twice. Nishida designed Pikachu, Raichu, and Gorochu, but this third and final monster never made it into the final game. It had fangs and horns, and Nishida said it looked like “a god of thunder.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the same interview, artist Ken Sugimori says there was “nothing wrong” with Gorochu’s design, and </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>designer Koji Nishino said it was ultimately cut for game balance purposes and because there was only so much space on older Game Boy cartridges, so some monsters got cut along the way. In 2020 the original source code for these games leaked, which included <a href="https://tcrf.net/Development:Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue/Pok%C3%A9mon#Pok.C3.A9mon_Index_175">Gorochu’s back sprite</a>. This is the only “official” look we’ve gotten of the monster, but one of the </span><a href="https://x.com/VivinkArt/status/993360938613915649"><span>most popular pieces of Gorochu fan art</span></a><span> captures </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>Sugimori’s style</span></a><span> so well that many fans believe it to be an in-house artistic rendition of the scrapped monster.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently Raichu had an evolution named Gorochu, so I had a go at the design of it. Tried to keep consistent to the first generation of Pokemon's look and style. ⚡️ <a href="https://t.co/U4KrTr1DKW">pic.twitter.com/U4KrTr1DKW</a></p> <p>— VivinkArt (@VivinkArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/VivinkArt/status/993360938613915649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>All this mystique has had fans asking for Game Freak to bring Gorochu back and make the Pikachu line the first “four-stage” monster, now that </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver </span></i><span>added Pichu, a pre-evolution to Pikachu. However, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC may have killed this dream, as it gives </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>Raichu two Mega forms</span></a><span>. As AZ lays out in the main game, Mega Evolution is only possible if a Pokémon has reached its final stage of Evolution. This isn’t just a fan assumption, and </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s endgame makes a point of driving this home by allowing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>AZ’s Floette</span></a><span>, which was unable to evolve due to its exposure to the Ultimate Weapon thousands of years prior, to Mega Evolve.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now that Raichu is out here doing what only fully evolved Pokémon can do, Gorochu seems to be officially dead, but both of its Mega designs have some elements that feel like echoes of Gorochu. Both forms have fangs, and the Y variant has jackalope-style horns. The X form also flies around like he’s Superman, and that’s giving “god of thunder” in my eyes.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We’ll have a full review of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>in the coming days.</span></p>

              <p>The fighting game lineup for Evo 2026 has been revealed and there’s a notable absence: <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></a>. Just three years after it launched, the content-complete sequel is not getting invited back to the world’s biggest annual fighting game event.

Ultimate&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-ultimate-melee-nintendo-switch-evo-2022-sony-1848598680">was a no-show</a> at Evo 2022 back when the event was owned by competitor Sony.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">EVO Las Vegas 2026 lineup:<br>-SF6<br>-Tekken 8<br>-Fatal Fury CotW<br>-Under Night In-Birth Sys:Celes<br>-Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising<br>-Rivals of Aether 2<br>-2XKO<br>-Guilty Gear Strive<br>-BlazBlue Centralfiction<br>-Virtua Fighter 5 REVO World Stage<br>-Vampire Savior<br>-Invincible Vs <a href="https://t.co/Ar5In2RCNn">pic.twitter.com/Ar5In2RCNn</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1998566054268907575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This year’s big changes see <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> dropped from the lineup while games like <em>BlazBlue Centralfiction</em>, released a decade ago, get called back up to the majors. Some fans are wondering if it will be a wake-up call for NetherRealms, whose reboot of the franchise wasn’t bad but never quite hit the “we’re so back” vibes many were hoping for.</p>

 <p>Other notable swap-ins include the new <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>, which despite some issues and a content-lite launch has marshaled a passionate community around it, and <em>Rivals of Aether II</em>, the 2024 2D platform fighter that some fans argue still feels like an Early Access sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em> is also MIA</h2> <p>Even more notable than what was ditched is what wasn’t added. The Sony-published comic book fighting game <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384"><em>Marvel Tōkon</em></a> has a 2026 release window but won’t be on tap for Evo 2026. That suggests the heir apparent to <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> won’t be out until late in the year. <em>Marvel</em> <em>Tōkon</em> feels like the only recent new fighting game reveal to break through to a more casual audience and gin up excitement outside of the hardcore crowd, so it would have been a neat pick-up for next year’s event.</p> <p>Developer Arc System Works has been using Evo to reveal new bits about the 4v4 fighting game, so it seems likely it’ll still be involved with the tournament series in some way, just not as an esport. The game’s continued to run closed betas that have garnered lots of positive buzz so far. Hopefully it doesn’t get delayed to 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="517">As much as some of us wish for an official handheld Xbox console, I wouldn’t recommending holding your breath. However, Asus is giving us something very close. In partnership with Microsoft, Asus has updated the ROG Ally, adding official Xbox branding. Enter the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, a new handheld gaming device aimed to rival the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/">Released less than two months ago, the device is already seeing a solid discount. Originally priced at $600, it’s now 18% off, dropping to $490—a savings of $110 this soon after launch.</a></p>
<p data-start="519" data-end="803">So what makes this model stand out from the previous Asus ROG Ally? For starters, it now features an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and runs on a redesigned Windows OS, both of which promise to deliver a smoother, more seamless experience both while gaming and navigating the interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="805" data-end="837"><strong data-start="805" data-end="837">Play Xbox Games Anywhere</strong></h2>
<p data-start="839" data-end="1315">With the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, your entire PC game library is at your fingertips, and you can boot straight into them from the new Xbox App UI. This handheld lets you stream Xbox games from your console or from Microsoft’s cloud service, and the Xbox Game Bar can be accessed with a press of the dedicated Xbox button on the left side. Beyond just Xbox titles, the device supports Steam, the Epic Games Store, and other platforms, so you’re not limited to Xbox-exclusive content.</p>
<p data-start="1317" data-end="1557">In terms of hardware, the ROG Xbox Ally comes equipped with 16GB of dual-channel RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD. If that storage doesn’t quite cut it for your game library, the storage is upgradeable, giving you room to expand as needed.</p>


<p data-start="1559" data-end="2051">The device features a 7-inch display with 1080p HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, putting it on par with other high-end handhelds like the Steam Deck. At just under 1.5 lbs, it’s roughly the same weight too. The redesigned chassis pulls inspiration from the Xbox wireless core controllers, with contoured grips for better comfort during long gaming sessions. You can play on the go or connect to your TV via the dual USB-C ports, giving you plenty of flexibility.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">To keep you gaming longer, the handheld includes a 60Wh battery that can recharge quickly. Just half an hour of charging gets you back up to 50% battery life.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">With these upgrades, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally series is shaping up to be a strong contender in the portable gaming market, offering versatility, performance, and a solid gaming experience. And right now, it’s down $110 for the holiday season.</p>
<p data-start="2233" data-end="2544">For those seeking more power, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is also available, offering an upgraded processor, additional RAM, and a 1TB SSD—doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery for even longer playtime, making it a solid option for those who want a premium handheld experience.</p>
