              <p>Gaming laptops usually cost over $1,000 for basic performance and high-end models can easily reach $2,000 to $3,000 for complete gaming capabilities. However, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">Asus TUF gaming F16 laptop (RTX 4050, 512GB SSD, 16GB DDR5 RAM, Intel Core 5 chip) breaks this trend with a price of $749, down from $1,099</a>. This deal on Amazon for Black Friday <strong>offers real gaming hardware at an all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class GPU</h2>
<p>The <strong>Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU with a maximum TGP of 115W delivers true 1080p gaming performance</strong> in modern games: It uses DLSS 3 technology to upscale images and keeps high frame rates while keeping visual quality intact. The ray tracing support creates realistic lighting effects in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Motorsport and Control without slowing down frame rates, thanks to AI-assisted rendering.</p>
<p>The GPU can run esports titles such as Valorant, League of Legends and Counter-Strike <strong>at competitive frame rates over 144fps</strong>, matching the display’s refresh rate. Creative tasks like video editing, 3D modeling and AI image generation also benefit from GPU acceleration and greatly speed up rendering times compared to integrated graphics.</p>



<p>The I<strong>ntel Core 5 210H processor provides balanced power through an efficient hybrid design</strong> that includes performance and efficiency cores. This setup manages demanding tasks while conserving battery life and gaming sessions experience steady frame rates as the performance cores focus on game logic and physics, while efficiency cores handle background tasks without detracting from gameplay.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ display has a 144Hz refresh rate and a 16:10 aspect ratio</strong>, and offers an immersive gaming experience through smooth motion that avoids the stuttering of standard 60Hz displays during fast actions. The taller ratio adds vertical space, which is useful for productivity tasks like coding, document editing, and web browsing, where having more vertical pixels reduces the need to scroll. The <strong>display achieves 100% sRGB color accuracy</strong> and ensures correct color representation for photo editing and other creative work beyond gaming.</p>



<p>The cooling system is equipped with <strong>Arc Flow Fans, four exhaust vents, five dedicated heat pipes, and anti-dust filters</strong> and keeps temperatures steady during long gaming sessions without too much noise. This thermal design prevents performance drops caused by overheating to ensure consistent frame rates during extended play. The <strong>anti-dust filter</strong> keeps internal dust build-up in check, which helps maintain cooling efficiency over time, extending the laptop’s lifespan compared to systems that quickly degrade in dusty conditions.</p>
<p>At $749, this Asus TUF laptop offers a great mix of true gaming performance and sturdy build, and at this price point, it offers outstanding value in the gaming laptop market.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-enters-chaos-mode-now-selling-galaxy-z-fold7-at-record-low-and-cheaper-than-old-fold6-2000648076</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung stands out with their folding smartphones and faces almost no direct competition from major manufacturers. After seven generations of improvements, the Galaxy Z Fold series has matured into a product category that Apple has yet to enter, despite ongoing rumors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/">Currently priced at $1,657, down from $2,119, the 512GB Galaxy Z Fold7</a> is available at a record low on Amazon for Black Friday which makes this powerful productivity device more accessible than ever. The <strong>Z Flip7 also sees major discounts on Amazon</strong>&nbsp;but the Fold’s tablet-sized unfolded screen offers different use cases for users who want a pocketable alternative to laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expanded Design That Balances Size and Portability</h2>
<p>The <strong>wider cover display makes the Fold7 feel more like a traditional smartphone</strong> when closed and addresses past complaints that earlier models were too narrow for one-handed use. This increased width is closer to standard flagship phone dimensions and makes typing, browsing and using apps more comfortable without needing to unfold the device for simple tasks. The improved design encourages users to rely on the cover display for quick tasks instead of treating it as a backup when unfolding is inconvenient.</p>
<p>When unfolded, <strong>the 8-inch internal display creates a tablet-sized screen</strong> that allows for real multitasking with three apps visible at once. You can run email, a web browser, and messaging apps side-by-side, watch YouTube while browsing Twitter and responding to texts or follow recipe videos while taking notes and setting timers. This multitasking ability changes how tasks are completed by reducing the constant app switching that can disrupt workflow on traditional phones.</p>



<p>The <strong>200MP main camera is Samsung’s most ambitious camera</strong> technology to date on a folding phone, competing with flagship models that don’t have to deal with the challenges of hinges. The large sensor captures incredible detail, allowing for significant cropping while keeping clarity, so you can capture far-off subjects as clear close-ups without the limitations of optical zoom. The <em>Pro-Visual Engine</em> processes images using advanced computational photography techniques to analyze scenes, optimize exposure for different lighting conditions and apply smart enhancements that keep the natural look while increasing quality.</p>
<p>The customized <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</strong> (from Qualcomm) is designed specifically for Galaxy devices and delivers top performance with improved speeds and optimizations that enhance efficiency. This powerful processor can handle demanding games, 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without overheating or draining the battery like lesser models. What’s more, with 512GB of storage, you can manage a large library of apps and professional content creation tasks without constant worry about storage space.</p>



<p>Durability is boosted with advanced <strong>armor aluminum framing and Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 protection</strong>&nbsp;which help ease concerns about the fragility of folding phones that once discouraged early adopters. The reinforced hinge can handle hundreds of thousands of folds thanks to precise engineering that ensures smooth operation over years of daily use. The <strong>displays are more resistant to scratches than earlier models</strong> and still maintains the flexibility needed for folding, achieving durability that rivals traditional slab phones. <strong>Water resistance</strong> allows you to use the device in light rain or near water without worry.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life lasts through full days</strong> of mixed use despite the demands of dual displays and powerful processors, achieving longevity that matches or exceeds single-screen flagship devices. Samsung’s smart power management adjusts display refresh rates, processor speeds, and background activities based on how you use the device, maximizing battery life without requiring manual adjustments.</p>
<p>At $1,657, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 with 512GB offers an 8-inch folding display, a 200MP camera and Snapdragon 8 Elite processing at 22% less than its retail price this Black Friday. Samsung’s seven generations of refining folding phones have created technology that Apple has yet to match, despite its resources and engineering expertise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/keep-all-your-crap-fully-charged-with-the-anker-prime-usb-c-charger-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000647672</link>
            <guid>1366417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="627">With Black Friday weekend just around the corner, we’re only a couple of days away from one of the biggest shopping events of the year. While the official start of Black Friday may still be a little ways off, many popular items on Amazon are already seeing some substantial discounts. If you’re getting a head start on holiday shopping, or maybe treating yourself to something special, now is a fantastic time to snag a deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">Right now, Amazon is offering the Anker Prime Charger at 33% off.</a> Normally priced at $150, this high-tech USB-C compatible charging block is available for just $100—a savings of $50—for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">Nowadays, we carry a lot of devices with us that need to stay charged. It’s not just our smartphones that need to be plugged in at the end of the day anymore. If you’re someone who likes to listen to music or podcasts while on the go, your earbuds or wireless headphones also need to be juiced up. If you’re using a smartwatch to track your fitness or health, keeping that battery full is essential for getting the most out of its capabilities. And that barely scratches the surface. Tablets, laptops, even portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch 2, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, or the Steam Deck all need to be regularly charged to stay powered throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="629" data-end="1269">Support for Multiple Devices</h2>
<p data-start="1271" data-end="1839">The Anker Prime Charger is designed to make charging all of these devices easier. Equipped with three USB-C ports, this compact charging block can handle any device that uses USB-C for charging. Each of the three ports can deliver up to 140W of power, which means you can quickly charge even larger devices like a 16-inch MacBook Pro. In fact, the Anker Prime Charger can take your MacBook Pro from zero to 50% battery in just 25 minutes. All three of its USB-C ports can charge at that max speed simultaneously, so it doesn’t matter which port you use.</p>
<p data-start="1841" data-end="2380">When all three ports are in use, the charger adjusts to distribute power efficiently. One port can charge at the full 140W, while the other two can each provide 35W of power. This makes it easy to charge multiple devices at once, whether you’re on a trip or just need to power up your devices at home. For example, if you’re traveling with a MacBook Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and an iPad Pro, the Anker Prime Charger can deliver the same amount of power to each device as their individual chargers would.</p>


<p data-start="2382" data-end="2791">The Anker Prime Charger has a smart touch display, located on top of the device. This LED display offers helpful information about your connected devices, allowing you to check the power status of each port when a device is plugged in. You can also customize charging modes via the app.</p>
<p data-start="2793" data-end="3256">Measuring only 2.56 inches by 2.05 inches by 1.38 inches, it’s small enough to easily fit into your bag or pocket. The prongs even fold into the block, preventing them from catching on anything while you carry it around. For folks on the go, whether you’re working remotely or just want to reduce the number of chargers you carry, the Anker Prime Charger is a travel-friendly solution to your charging needs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Practically Dumping the 15.6″ Portable Monitor After Selling Thousands Last Month, Black Friday Makes the Price Even Wilder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/innoview-portable-monitor-15-6-inch-2000647776</link>
            <guid>1366375</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you need extra screen space on the go, adding a portable monitor to your setup makes sense. These screens are bigger than tablets, connect to laptops, phones, and other devices using a cable, plus offer multiple viewing options for different needs.</p>
<p>Most solid options with basic functionality out there sit around $100, but you can treat yourself to one for less today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 15.6-inch InnoView portable monitor for just $57, after taking 42% off its retail price.</a> It’s an early Black Friday deal, but there’s a catch. At the time of writing, the deal is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members can grab it at a modest 5% drop, for $94. Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their purchase.</p>
<p>That said, now is a good time to grab a Prime subscription if you’ve been wanting to try it out. Black Friday is tomorrow, and just like this early deal, you can expect plenty of member-exclusive discounts. These are usually much steeper than the regular ones. Prime subscription costs $10 per month or $100 a year, and new users can enjoy a 30-day free trial before committing.</p>

<h2>Portable, But Powerful</h2>
<p>For a little over $50, you’re getting a 15.6-inch portable screen. The size matches that of most standard laptops out there, so you’re getting the same experience, just without the bulk.</p>
<p>This screen pushes a 1920×1080 resolution for clear, bright visuals, plus features an IPL panel for superior color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle makes it easy to enjoy consistent visuals from all angles, meaning you won’t always have to sit right in front of the monitor to see what’s being displayed. It’s great for when you’re sharing the screen with multiple users, as everyone can see clearly without trying to squeeze in. Additionally, low blue light support keeps it easier on the eyes by reducing the blue light radiation damage. You’ll be able to keep using the screen for longer hours without the usual eye strain.</p>



<p>Exceptional compatibility comes from 2 fully functional Type-C ports and 1 HDMI port that let you connect the monitor to a range of devices. Your device should just support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP ALT-mode. The setup is plug-and-play, meaning you only need a single USB-C cable to get started. If your device does not support a USB-C connection, you can still connect it through HDMI, but you’ll need both an HDMI cable and a separate power cable to proceed. There’s no single way to use it; you can expand your laptop’s display to work on the go, pair the monitor with your smartphone to stream on a bigger screen, and even use it with a console to play better. There are multiple display modes to choose from. We’re talking an Extend mode for a large desktop that spans across both screens, a Second screen mode to use both the screens for different tasks, and a Duplicate mode that mirrors your primary display.</p>
<p>The monitor comes with a scratch-resistant smart protective. Beyond protection, it can be used to prop the screen up. Two grooves let you find the right angle, so you can set it up literally anywhere you want, from a desk to even your couch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">The InnoView portable monitor is now down to just $57, all thanks to Black Friday.</a> It not only offers you a large screen, but also delivers stunning visuals, plus lets you choose between multiple viewing modes and even comes with a durable case. It’s great for freelancers, work professionals, students and even gamers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 9100 PRO SSD Falls Below $0.10 per GB Across All Capacities, Black Friday Just Broke the Price Floor]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/upgrade-your-pc-or-playstation5-storage-by-as-much-as-8tb-samsung-9100-pro-up-to-33-off-2000647606</link>
            <guid>1366333</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="318">As game sizes continue to grow with new releases sometimes topping 100GB, it’s becoming harder to make room to play them all. You have two options: either delete games after you finish them or expand your storage. The simpler and more permanent solution? Upgrading to a larger solid-state drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5983/">Currently, the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD is on sale at Amazon, offering discounts up to 33%.&nbsp;</a>This SSD is available in several storage sizes, including 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, and an enormous 8TB option. With the sale, you can save anywhere from $60 to $250 depending on the version you choose. The 1TB model is now $135 (down from $200), the 2TB version is $220 (down from $280), the 4TB model is priced at $370 (down from $470), and the 8TB version is available for $750 (down from $1,000).</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="318">Instead of constantly juggling downloads, you can switch between games whenever you feel like jumping back into an old favorite. This convenience extends to other large applications as well, whether you’re editing 4K footage from large files or storing extensive media collections.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5983/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1136" data-end="1568">Beyond just giving you all that extra storage space, the Samsung 9100 Pro will deliver solid performance. With read speeds reaching 14,700 MB/s and write speeds of up to 13,300 MB/s, this SSD offers blazing-fast data transfers while remaining power-efficient. Whether you’re gaming, editing videos, working with large datasets, or whatever else it is you do at your computer, the Samsung 9100 Pro provides the performance you need without putting unnecessary strain on your system’s power usage.</p>
<h2 data-start="1136" data-end="1568">PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2047">If you’re a PlayStation 5 owner, you’ve probably noticed that storage can be tight. The PS5 comes with only 825GB of internal storage, and with the growing size of AAA games, you’ll find yourself deleting and reinstalling games just to make room for new ones. Fortunately, the PS5 allows you to expand its storage with a compatible M.2 SSD, and the Samsung 9100 Pro is one such option. However, if you want to avoid overheating, it’s crucial to get the version with a heatsink. These are small metal casings that sit around the SSD which allow heat to dissipate.</p>


<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Installing the SSD in your PS5 is a straightforward process that you can follow along with watching any number of YouTube tutorials. Right now, the 2TB version with a heatsink is priced at $209, the 4TB version is $399, and the big 8TB version is $800. The 1TB with heatsink option is currently out of stock.</p>
<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Heatsinks on their own go for about $10 to $20. Now when you compare each of the Samsung 9100 Pro SSDs here, with and without heatsink, there’s definitely a drop off in value. The 2TB option with a heatsink is actually cheaper than without so there’s not reason not to pick up that one (where you end up using the heatsink or not). The 4TB model is about $20 more with a heatsink. That isn’t bad but you might be able to pick up the standard version and find a different heatsink for less. Then the 8TB price difference is laughable. It’s $50 more to get it with the heatsink. Don’t do that. Get yourself another one for far less.</p>
