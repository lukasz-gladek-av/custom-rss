            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When the original <i>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</i> arrived in 2002, it threatened to dethrone <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>’s tight grip on the stealth genre. And for some purists, it likely succeeded, given its groundbreaking technical displays of light and shadow that were more than just pretty to look at. The game also pushed you to move with more caution, with enemies that, in some instances, were far more perceptive than what <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> offered at the time. <i>MGS3</i> would arrive shortly after to up its stealth game, perhaps having learned a thing or two from <i>Splinter Cell</i>, but the original <i>SC</i> and its two direct sequels remain incredible challenges for those of us who like to lurk around in the shadows. And if you’ve been craving a return to Sam Fisher’s first outing, then let me tell you about this incredible mod that makes it hard to go back to the original.</p> <p><i>Enhanced SC</i> is a project from modder Joshhhuaaa that you can <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC">grab on GitHub</a> right now for both Windows and Steam Deck. It introduces a suite of improvements, which include a mission statistics tracker that lets you know just how stealthy your current run is, proper widescreen support, fixes to movement speed, better controller support, maps based on original Xbox versions, the Nuclear Power Plant level from the PS2 version, and <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC/blob/main/PatchNotes.md">so much more</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616402">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While many mods of this kind sometimes make for an experience that feels quite different from the original game, <i>Enhanced SC</i> feels remarkably faithful to what it was like to play <i>Splinter Cell</i> on PS2 or Xbox back in the day. There are some notable tweaks to the gameplay, such as the inclusion of whistling (which would show up in later <i>SC</i> games), and distinct commands for opening a door fully or partially to peek into the next room. These feel like very natural inclusions to the original game–in fact, until I read through the patch notes, I didn’t realize they <em>weren’t</em> in the first <i>SC</i>.</p>

 <p>Steam Deck support, however, is where this mod really shines. It runs surprisingly well for such an old game on a Linux machine. There’s also a dedicated “EnhancedSC Layout” controller scheme you can download from the community layouts that allows for precision aiming by way of the right touchpad, and a quicksave and load feature mapped to the left one (this makes quickly resetting to your last save for save-scummy playthroughs a breeze).</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616403"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616403">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If it’s been a while since you’ve jumped into Sam’s sneaking suit, do yourself a favor and check out this mod. Who knows when (or if) we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-7-canceled-games-splinter-cell-assasin-s-creed-1849976552">that damn remake anyway</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-boss-says-game-coming-to-xbox-was-all-playstation%E2%80%99s-idea.1265013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Sony’s massively popular third-person online sci-fi shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573"><em>Helldivers 2</em> is coming to Xbox later this month</a>. Many fans had assumed that developers Arrowhead had been the ones behind the decision, likely pushing PlayStation to let them port the game to the company’s rival console. But it turns out it was actually Sony’s idea, and that’s just more evidence that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars are over.</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851"><em>Helldivers 2</em> launched in early 2024</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sony-steam-pc-ps5-players-1851268838">rave reviews and huge player counts.</a> And since then, the game has continued to receive frequent updates, growing larger in scale as it adds more enemies and its massive galactic story of war continues to evolve. But for the last year, the only way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> was on PS5 or PC. This left Xbox players out of the loop. That changes on August 26, when Helldivers lands on Xbox Series X/S with full crossplay support. And according to Arrowhead’s CEO Shams Jorjani, the decision to port <em>Helldivers 2</em> came entirely from PlayStation.</p> <p>On August 6, as reported by <em>Windows Central,</em> when a player praised Arrowhead for bringing the <em>Helldivers</em> sequel to Xbox, Jorjani stepped in and gave Sony all the credit. “It was all PlayStation. Send them your thanks,” posted Jorjani in the game’s official Discord server. “We were all in support, of course.” The Arrowhead CEO later added, “I think it’s one of the coolest things [Sony’s] done. They’re killing it.”</p> <p>While it might at first seem odd that PlayStation would bring one of its most popular video games in years to a rival platform, the reality is that the console wars have mostly fizzled out. Thanks to crossplay, cross save, Xbox ditching the whole affair after losing last gen, and Nintendo doing their own thing, there’s just not much of a war anymore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">Xbox has found great success bringing its hit games like <em>Forza</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, and Sony is following in their footsteps now by bringing games like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> to Xbox, as well as continuing to port games like <em>Spider-Man</em> to PC. At this point, it just makes more sense to put your games on more platforms. This is especially true for big, expensive live-service games that rely on lots of players actively engaging with the game daily to make money. So I’d expect to see even more Xbox and PlayStation games hopping across platforms in the future. I mean, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-1-reloaded-remaster-ps5-xbox-pc-summer-1851779167"><em>Gears of War</em></a> is coming to PlayStation this year.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">The walls have fallen. The console wars are over. And only Nintendo seems to care about keeping stuff exclusive</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>On Tuesday, an Indiana Fever and Los Angeles Sparks WNBA game was <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45911373/sex-toy-tossed-sparks-court-third-incident-7-days">temporarily disrupted after someone tossed a large green dildo</a> at the players on the court. This is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1760105008213278">third such incident</a> of a sex toy being tossed onto a WNBA court during an active game in the last two weeks. And with some betting markets now taking bets on whether or not a dildo will be tossed at WNBA players at future games, it’s very likely this terrible trend will continue, even as the WNBA reportedly looks to ban fans from bringing bags into venues in an effort to prevent this from happening.</p> <p>The first incident of a dildo being thrown onto a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k-announces-wnba-players-a-river-of-sexism-follow-1837111136">WNBA</a> court happened on July 29 during a match between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream. Like what happened on Tuesday, a neon green dildo was reportedly thrown onto the court. On August 1, a similar incident involving a sex toy happened during a match between the Valkyries and the Chicago Sky. There are also at least two reports via social media of people attempting to toss dildos onto the court at other WNBA games, but these didn’t make it out of the crowd.&nbsp; However, one of these sex toys, also neon green, reportedly thrown during an <a href="https://x.com/osnapitsari/status/1952914027618943453">August 5 WNBA game in New York City</a>, came close to hitting a child. It’s clear this is becoming a “thing” and players and coaches are understandably frustrated and upset about the situation.</p> <p>“I think it’s ridiculous, it’s dumb, it’s stupid,” Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said after the game on Tuesday. “It’s also dangerous, and players’ safety is number one. Respecting the game. All those things. I think it’s really stupid.”</p> <p>On August 1, <a href="https://x.com/OMG_itsizzyb/status/1951462340890861689">New York Liberty&nbsp;forward&nbsp;Isabelle Harrison posted on social media</a>: “ARENA SECURITY?! Hello??! Please do better. It’s not funny. never was funny. Throwing ANYTHING on the court is so dangerous.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.talkbasket.net/201156-wnba-enforces-no-bag-policy-to-stop-dildo-throwers">Polymarket Sports is reporting</a> that the WNBA is enacting a ban on bags at some upcoming games. However, I was <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/no-bag-policy-wnba-games-234957914.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIkDZKqrCCX828IDt1RKFGShi0R616NjV0DwR8coONtETZz7gAejcUjpqB0mtSlMwCAmHfs7CXFv-TFrRNg-FV226KCC0yhNs9GP1TqjuqoyMicJ-eEuRHINLQHy0fdcLAMbrXBKCut1eoQ3s4WfGaZqDJw2rFQdZM_pprHaYDp1">unable to corroborate this claim</a>, and Polymarket itself might have a vested interest in the dildo tossing as the gambling site is <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/dildo-thrown-at-wnba-game-on-august-6-13/will-a-dildo-be-thrown-onto-the-court-at-a-wnba-game-on-wednesday?tid=1754503557149">now taking bets on whether sex toys will be tossed at WNBA games</a>. Yes, we are living in a timeline where people are betting on whether someone will toss a sex toy at professional female athletes just trying to play basketball. Shit sucks.</p> <p>On August 2, police in College Park, Georgia, arrested 23-year-old Delbert Carver, the man who allegedly tossed the first dildo during the Valkyries/Dream game.&nbsp; According to law enforcement, he <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45901403/wnba-fan-accused-throwing-sex-toy-faces-multiple-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces counts of disorderly conduct, public indecency, and criminal trespass</a>. In an affidavit, as reported by ESPN, Carver admitted that tossing the dildo onto the court was “supposed to be a joke” and that it was “supposed to go viral.” Sadly, it seems like it has, and copycats are now tossing more green dildos onto WNBA courts.</p> <p>Not only is this dangerous and annoying for players, but throwing sex toys onto the court of a WNBA game is <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a65614990/why-throwing-dildos-wnba-games/">clearly a misogynistic act against these women</a> who dare to be professional athletes. In an era when professional women’s sports are thriving, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2023/womens-sports-viewership-on-the-rise/">with high ratings and stars being created</a>, it’s clear some young men, likely fueled by anti-women politics and the horrible online manosphere, feel empowered and even forced to “fight back.” Tossing dildos at women is done to embarrass them and remind them that, according to these shitbags, they are only sex objects who shouldn’t be playing basketball in front of adoring crowds of fans. Hopefully, WNBA security steps things up and we can stop this shit from happening in future games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Xbox console exclusive <em>Contraband</em> was first revealed back in 2021 and has been MIA ever since. The co-op heist shooter from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-3-the-kotaku-review-1745359451">makers of <em>Just Cause</em></a> has now officially been canceled, as first reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lvt7g4p7fs2k"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. It’s the latest Xbox-backed project to land on the chopping block amid recent mass layoffs across Microsoft’s gaming division.</p> <p>“Over the past several years, Avalanche Studios Group and Xbox Game Studios Publishing have collaborated on<em> Contraband</em>,” the studio confirmed in a statement on social media. “Active development has stopped while we evaluate the project’s future. We’re thankful for the excitement we’ve seen from the community since we announced and well give an update on what’s next as soon as we can.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Smuggling’s your business, and business is booming.​</p> <p>Dive into the open world of Contraband solo or with friends: <a href="https://t.co/e7ndNT9M3B">https://t.co/e7ndNT9M3B</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxBethesda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxBethesda</a> <a href="https://t.co/0RUXreFxts">pic.twitter.com/0RUXreFxts</a></p> <p>— Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1404126314177519621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The game was first shown at Xbox’s 2021 summer showcase, just six months after the new Xbox Series X/S launched. It was positioned as one of a number of “next-gen” exclusives that would make the console an appealing platform to invest in. “To fully deliver on our vision for <em>Contraband</em>, we have an amazing team at Avalanche Studios that are pushing the boundaries with the next generation of our Apex Engine, the technology behind all our games, including the Just Cause series,” Avalanche Studios game director <span>Omar Shakir <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/13/announcing-contraband/">wrote</a> at the time. “</span>We built the engine to unlock the creativity of our developers and we’re excited to take full advantage of the unique capabilities of Xbox Series X|S.”</p>

 <p>But<em> Contraband</em> never resurfaced, continually raising questions about whether it was in development hell or still slated to eventually arrive at some point. <span>Shakir left Avalanche after over a decade in 2023 to join Rockstar Games.</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://tech4gamers.com/avalanche-hiring-contraband-despite-rumors/">A studio job posting</a> in June for a Project Lead on <em>Contraband</em> suggested the game was very much still in production up until recently. It’s not yet clear why Microsoft decided to ultimately cancel the game.</p> <p>“We have made the decision to stop development of <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild</em> as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio,” head of Xbox Game Studios, Matt Booty, wrote in a letter to staff during the last round of Microsoft layoffs in July. “As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape.”</p>
