              <p><span>Tomonobu Itagaki, the lead director of the </span><i><span>Dead or Alive </span></i><span>fighting series and the </span><i><span>Ninja Gaiden </span></i><span>3D revival, has died at age 58.</span></p> <p><span>This news was confirmed in a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki/posts/pfbid02kPXD7uXWaU3ZrRTXB1x2kYPH9SXjakibwS2poX8QU6oPXC7w5occ4GuidXECSUpZl"><span>Facebook post on Itagaki’s account</span></a><span>, which included some parting words from the storied developer. The post said he had no regrets and stood by his beliefs, but apologized to his fans for not being able to produce more games.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Words I Leave Behind</span></p> <p><span>The flame of my life is finally about to go out.</span></p> <p><span>If this message has been posted, it means that the time has come.

But you… isn’t it a bit too soon? Didn’t you say you were going to defeat me someday? Didn’t you come to my wedding, wearing your usual black leather jacket and sunglasses, and call me your comrade-in-arms? Didn’t you tell me to come to you whenever I was in trouble? I never even got the chance to consult you about anything.”</span></p> <p><span>Itagaki founded Tecmo division Team Ninja in 1995, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/itagaki-and-tecmo-settle-legal-brouhaha-5480807"><span>left the company on bad terms</span></a><span> in 2008 and formed </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/devils-third-the-kotaku-review-1726640863"><i><span>Devil’s Third</span></i></a><span> developer Valhalla Game Studios.

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s OptiPlex 7020 Mini PC Falls 71%, From 6× the Price of a Mac Mini to Clearance-Level Pricing]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-only-thing-skinnier-than-this-powerhouse-dell-desktop-is-its-71-off-amazon-deal-2000635765</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-optiplex-7020-mini-pc-falls-71-from-6%C3%97-the-price-of-a-mac-mini-to-clearance-level-pricing.1326439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe you’re still unconvinced by the recent wave of mini PCs, but you’re still not willing to plop a full-sized PC tower onto your desk, or even under it. Here’s a massive new Amazon deal on a desktop PC that’s slightly bigger than the other minis, way smaller than the towers, and quite possibly blows them both all of the water when it comes to performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">The skinny Dell Optiplex 7020 is a fat 71% off at just $996.</a></p>
<p>The heart and brains of the Optiplex 7020 is the 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor that delivers enough power to handle all of your productivity tasks and even some creative ones too, and it can do so at sizzling speeds of up to 5.2GHz. There’s also 32GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive inside the slender sub-2-inches-wide body, along with enough ports so it can easily handle being the centerpiece of your home workstation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mini In Name Only</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Optiplex 7020 a “mini PC,” but it’s a weight class or two above the palm-sized PCs that have been all the rage lately. Still, at just 7 inches high and 7 inches long, and just 1.42 inches thick, it definitely qualifies as portable, and can even be mounted on the back of a monitor for ultimate space-saving efficiency. You might have to choose which monitor to mount it behind, though, because the Dell Optiplex 7020 can support up to 3 displays at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, there’s nothing “mini” about the Optiplex 7020, with all of that memory and Intel processing power driving the pre-installed Windows 11 Professional. The Intel UHD Graphics 770 chip will have all three of those 4K monitors looking crisp, if you so choose, in which case you’ll have plenty of visual real estate to put Microsoft Copilot to work as your AI assistant.</p>



<h2>All Your Hookups</h2>
<p>The HDMI 1.4b and two DisplayPort 1.4a outputs handle the external monitor situation more than amply, and there are also two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 to satisfy all of your expansion and peripheral needs. The Ethernet RJ-45 port will give you outstanding hardwired internet speed, but it also has Wi-Fi 6 to keep your online work and play moving at a nice clip.</p>
<p>Dell’s foray into the small-PC world originally showed up at Amazon with a bloated $3,399 price tag that we wouldn’t recommend in a million years, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">but with that number slashed down by 71% to just $996</a>, the Optiplex 7020 is a solid buy as a high-powered performance desktop PC that happens to be shrunk down to portable size.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-15-portable-monitor-turns-your-nintendo-switch-into-a-big-screen-console-for-pocket-change-2000635990</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-15%E2%80%B3-portable-monitor-turns-your-nintendo-switch-into-a-big-screen-console-for-pocket-change.1326373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch’s built-in screen is fine for quick sessions on the couch, but squinting at that 6.2-inch display during long gaming marathons gets old fast. The <em>MNN</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/">15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to an all-time low of $59 on Amazon, down from $89</a>, and it transforms your handheld console into something that feels closer to a proper gaming setup without sacrificing portability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>What’s especially desirable about the monitor in its own right, is its real plug-and-play ease: The <strong>dual USB-C receptacles let you connect your Switch with one cable</strong> that handles power and video signal simultaneously. Not a distinct power brick in play, no HDMI converter to carry around but one cable from the Switch dock to the monitor.</p>
<h2>Why Size and Portability Actually Matter</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display produces 1920×1080 Full HD resolution</strong> which is an enormous leap from the Switch’s native display at 1280×720. Text becomes crisper, game worlds display more detail and the experience becomes more immersive in general. The IPS panel technology allows for stable colors and<strong> clarity throughout a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you can see the display from the side without the colors washing out or contrast changing. The large viewing angle becomes beneficial in the case that you’re playing with friends huddled around a small table.</p>



<p>The screen’s <strong>matte finish cuts down glare from ceiling lights or windows</strong> which becomes essential in rooms you can’t completely control. Glossy screens are wonderful in lightless rooms but become mirrors in well-lit rooms. The diffusing effect the matte coating gives this MNN monitor prevents the picture from being obscured in well-lit rooms such as coffee houses, air terminal lounges, or sunlit hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Internal speakers reduce one cable and device from your carry-on equipment. Audio quality won’t be the same as with dedicated gaming headsets but the fact that you can have audio without the added hardware makes spontaneous gaming sessions easier. Speakers are loud enough for personal use in quiet spaces and headphones can always be plugged in via your Switch if you want superior audio or prefer the stealth.</p>



<p><strong>HDR support improves compatible games</strong> with increased contrast and wider range of colors. Games developed with HDR in view feature brighter highlights and richer shadows at the same time, and the result is more visual complexity. The contrast becomes particularly apparent in highly lit games such as Breath of the Wild or neo-noir games where atmosphere relies so highly on light and shadow interaction.</p>
<p>The monitor weighs <strong>a little more than two pounds and less than half an inch thick</strong>, so it can fit in laptop bags or backpacks right next to your Switch. The built-in smart cover shields the display in transport and doubles as a stand that tilts the monitor up at a comfortable viewing angle. Since the stand solution is built right in, you’re not searching for something to prop the monitor up against or wrestling with a standalone kickstand accessory.</p>
<p>At $59, this is fantastic value for a transportable display which really enhances your mobile gaming experience.</p>

              <p>Misplacing your keys five minutes prior to when you must go, desperately searching for your wallet in advance of a meeting, or walking up to baggage claim and questioning which carousel will produce your suitcase – these daily terrors have an easy cure. Good news is, Apple’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">AirTag 4-pack has reached its lowest price ever at $64 at Amazon, down from its regular $99 price</a>. That’s $16 per tracker which is less expensive than the price of replacing a lost wallet and the hassle of making a lost luggage claim. In the single-pack size, the solo AirTag can be found at its lowest price ever too at $24, down from $29.</p>

<p>The brilliance behind AirTags is their compatibility with Apple’s current ecosystem. Installation takes quite literally one tap when you press an AirTag close to your iPhone or iPad. The device automatically shows up in your Find My app which you can then assign a name and emoji to. No pairing menus, no setting up an account, no fussy configuration: <strong>In a matter of seconds, that AirTag’s ready to track anything you attach it to</strong>.</p>
<h2>How AirTags Tap Into a Massive Network</h2>
<p>The actual magic occurs via Apple’s <strong>Find My network</strong>&nbsp;which depends on the hundreds of millions of Apple devices globally in order to find your belongings. Here’s the process: your AirTag broadcasts a secure Bluetooth message that can be picked up by Apple devices in close range. Those Apple devices then report the location of your AirTag anonymously back to you via the Find My network. It’s all anonymous and encrypted and therefore no one else can see the location of your AirTag or exploit in an attempt at tracking you. Even Apple can’t see the location of your AirTag or which device assisted in tracking it.</p>
<p>This crowdsourcing model enables AirTags to be extremely efficient in highly populated locations.<strong> Leave the backpack at the popular coffee shop in town and there’s a high possibility an iPhone-carrying person will pass by the backpack in minutes and report its location without ever realizing they assisted</strong>. The network also functions when your AirTag is outside the range of your own devices, which happens to be essential in pinpointing luggage in planes and identifying things left behind while you are moving from point to point.</p>



<p><strong>Precision Finding</strong> goes one better on iPhone 11 and later with Ultra Wideband technology: When you’re near a target item with your AirTag, your iPhone can also report directional arrows and distance in feet and inches, and leads you straight to the item with remarkable precision. Take the example of searching for your buried keys in the couch cushions: Precision Finding lets you know the exact direction in which the keys are and how far away in inches the keys are.</p>
<p>Each AirTag also comes with a <strong>internal speaker that produces a tone when you activate it from the Find My app</strong>. The tone enables you to locate things in close range, such as keys that went down in the space between the car seats or a wallet kept in a coat pocket that hangs in your closet. The speaker produces a tone that can be heard in the next room and enables very swift searches compared with having to search each possible location manually.</p>



<p>Battery life is extraordinarily sensible. The AirTags are powered by a standard <em>CR2032</em> coin cell battery<strong> which lasts around a year</strong> with normal usage. You can buy these batteries anywhere: supermarkets and gas stations and so on. Replacing them only takes a second: push down the stainless steel rear and turn counterclockwise. No spanners required, no shipping devices back to Apple, no annual fees in order for them to stay operational.</p>
<p>At $64 for a set of four AirTags on Amazon, you can protect your most commonly lost belongings without spending too much money. Hook one onto your keys, put one in your wallet, add one in your daily tote and have a fourth for suitcases or seasonal gear.</p>
