After playing around with the PS5 Pro for a week ahead of its November 7 launch date, I’m both impressed by what it offers and reluctant to recommend that everyone picks one up. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Yet, for some, the PS5 Pro will be a worthwhile upgrade. The question is: Are you one of those potential people who will care about what the PS5 Pro offers? Let’s find out! I’m going to ask some questions, and we’ll figure out if you should buy a PS5 Pro. I’m here to help, so answer truthfully, and we’ll get through this together.</p><h2 id="h21376"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you have a 120hz 4K TV?</strong></h2><p>The PS5 technically supports 120 FPS video games, but in practice, most games can only manage 60 FPS on the base console. If that annoys you and you wish for more opportunities to play 120 FPS games, then the PS5 Pro will provide that. But you’ll need a 120hz TV to actually play games at 120 FPS. Likewise, the PS5 Pro—thanks to its AI upscaling tech known as PSSR—can run many games at 4K, leading to a sharper and cleaner image. But, again, if your TV is only 1080p, you won’t really get to enjoy that fancy upscaled 4K image.</p><p>I have a big, 4K 120hz TV with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), which ensures gameplay is often smooth because my TV adjusts to the game’s frame rate, and all the bells and whistles. I bought it a few years ago during a really good Black Friday sale. So I’m able to fully enjoy all the PS5 Pro’s features and improvements. If you don’t have a television like that, or if you aren’t even sure if it supports 4K or 120hz, then you probably don’t need a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h21377"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you care about ray tracing?</strong></h2><p>One of the big selling points of the PS5 Pro is the ability to play games at higher frame rates while not sacrificing all the visual features you get from 30 FPS fidelity modes. For many games, this means being able to play at 60 FPS while still having ray-traced reflections or lighting. This can make a game look more realistic and is better than screen space reflections, which tend to look messy and ugly, especially when viewed too closely. </p><p><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morale</em>s, for example, looks incredible at 60 FPS on PS5 Pro, with high-resolution reflections on skyscrapers helping it look almost photorealistic. <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s reflections also look amazing on Pro, though the game is capped at 30 FPS. If you don’t care about enhanced reflections and shiny surfaces looking more accurate, then a lot of the PS5 Pro’s more subtle improvements, like increased draw distances in some games, will likely not matter to you either. So you probably don’t need to go buy a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h21378"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you prefer fidelity modes over performance modes?</strong></h2><p>The moment I start a new game, the first thing I do is hop into the settings to see what I can tweak. Can I increase a game’s frame rate? Are there options to turn motion blur on or off? Is there a way to make it look nicer or run better? So, for me, a person obsessed with visuals and performance, the PS5 Pro has been a lot of fun. Most Pro-enhanced games offer multiple graphics options and performance tweaks, letting me enjoy games the way I want. </p><p>If you are someone who boots up a game and never checks the settings unless something breaks or annoys you, then the PS5 Pro might not be for you. The PS5 Pro is a console built for people who tinker with HDR settings, care about FOV, and flip between different performance options to see which they prefer. If that sounds annoying or tiring, then you likely aren’t the kind of person who would be happy spending $700+ on a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h21379"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you already own a PS5?</strong></h2><p>If you already own a PS5 or bought one recently, then an upgrade is likely not your priority. However, if you don’t already own a PS5 and are looking to hop into this current generation of games, you might wonder if the PS5 Pro is the best option. You might think it being the most powerful console on the market and the best version of the PS5 makes it the default device to buy. But, as I’ve laid out above, the PS5 Pro isn’t for everyone. </p><p>If you just want to enjoy PS5 exclusive games like <em>Spider-Man 2, Horizon: Forbidden West, Silent Hill 2, </em>and a litany of other titles (and don’t own a PC that can run those games), a standard PlayStation 5 will get the job done. Games still look great on the console, and most offer solid performance modes, too. The only reason you should even think about buying a PS5 Pro as your first PS5 console is if you own a high-end TV already and care about things like VRR, 4K output, and 120 FPS options. Otherwise, just buy a base PS5 this holiday season and enjoy it.</p><h2 id="h21380"><a id=""></a><strong>So, who is the PS5 Pro for?</strong></h2><p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is for a rather meticulous gamer. This gamer is someone who already owns a high-quality 4K/120hz TV or plans to buy one. They’re someone who has already invested heavily in the PlayStation ecosystem and has a collection of PS5 games they can enjoy on the PS5 Pro. They’re the type of person who cares about in-game settings and visual options, and who gets excited over the various graphical settings each game offers. You need to be the kind of person who can spot the difference between a game running at 30 FPS versus 60 or 120. You also need to care about higher resolutions and image quality. You should not only know what ray tracing is but be excited to enable it when you can. </p><p>In other words, you need to be something of an A/V enthusiast to truly enjoy the PS5 Pro.</p><p>I’ve enjoyed playing around with the one Sony sent me over the last week, as I’m the kind of person this $700 super-console was designed for. But I’m not convinced most people should buy a PS5 Pro. That’s not to say the Pro is worthless or a bad idea. </p><p>While some online have scoffed at the idea of a more powerful PS5, I think Sony’s plan makes sense. As confirmed by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/X24BzyzQQ-8?t=174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/X24BzyzQQ-8?t=174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s own data</a></span>, players generally prefer performance modes over fidelity modes in most games. So building a console focused on letting players enjoy smooth frame rates without sacrificing fancy visuals or high resolutions is a sensible strategy.</p><p>The challenge Sony faces is that many people are satisfied with their base PS5 and the options it provides. And after spending a week with the PS5 Pro, I’m confident in saying it’s really for the detail-obsessed gamers willing to spend $700 to make already great-looking games look even better on their big 120hz TVs. That might not be you, and that’s okay because you aren’t missing out on anything you care about anyway.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead of a linear campaign, you select a squad of fighters, choose a region, and then progress through random map encounters until you get to a boss fight.</p><p>On the battlefield, fighters like Eri, Fio, and Marco each have unique equipment and skills that can be improved and customized throughout a run. Unlike traditional grid-based strategy games, most attacks happen along a straight line from where the character is currently stationed, making positioning, terrain, and elevation key factors in whether a fight goes your way or not. </p><figure id="" data-id="8430624a57c37f35886e60eb191b5235" data-recommend-id="image://8430624a57c37f35886e60eb191b5235" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A GIF shows a synergy combo in Metal Slug Tactics.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Harkening back to <em>Metal Slug</em>’s original 2D side-scrolling shooter incarnations, your characters accrue a bonus called “adrenaline” as they move around the battlefield. It grants additional advantages and buffs, rewarding versatile and aggressive play rather than just sitting back and turtling. Synergy abilities, meanwhile, let nearby allies join in follow-up combo attacks to press the advantage. </p><p>The result is combat that requires you to think on your feet and adapt to the situation at hand instead of devising a strategy ahead of time and just worrying about the execution. Combined with slick, retro pixel art and a solid soundtrack, the overall <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> experience feels tight, rewarding, and well-balanced between thoughtfully teasing out solutions to the combat puzzles at hand and keeping the action moving with quick missions and straightforward objectives.</p><figure id="" data-id="3ff8857c4603aea8aaa1cbdcac163390" data-recommend-id="image://3ff8857c4603aea8aaa1cbdcac163390" data-format="png" data-width="1137" data-height="631" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An upgrade menu screen uses incredibly tiny text.

While the finished <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>mostly lives up to the gorgeous trailers fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-slug-tactics-is-metal-slug-but-with-turn-based-t-1847076096&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-slug-tactics-is-metal-slug-but-with-turn-based-t-1847076096">have been gawking at for years</a></span>, there are some real shortcomings. I’ve been playing on PlayStation 5 (it’s also on Game Pass), where I’ve experienced both a frustrating amount of stuttering on the performance end and, even worse, some really poorly optimized UI and font sizes on the quality-of-life side.</p><p>Most games nowadays feel designed with a PC monitor a couple of feet from your face in mind when it comes to screen layout and the size of features like action menus and text boxes. Even starting at that baseline, however, <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> was particularly painful to try and read and navigate from a living room setup, even when I moved within five feet of my TV. Checking through Steam and various subreddits, I’ve seen complaints specifically about font sizes and readability for the Switch and PC versions cropping up as well.</p><p>Both the shaky performance and miserable UI (I really wish the UI and fonts weren’t such a headache to decipher on console) can probably be fixed with post-launch patches, but the missing polish and strained eyes are hard to ignore. The rest of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is a compelling, if not super deep, retro roguelike strategy experience that’s worth checking out for fans of <em>Metal Slug</em> and games like <em>Into the Breach</em> alike—especially if the team behind the game can get the other issues worked out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
