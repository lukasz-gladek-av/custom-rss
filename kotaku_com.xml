              <p><span>I want to like </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>, the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/office-spin-off-first-look-the-paper-nbc-peacock-teaser-1851780331"><i><span>Office </span></i><span>spin-off premiering on Peacock</span></a><span> next month, but it sure knows how to make a bad impression. The show’s first trailer was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-office-paper-trailer-peacock-release-date-oscar-2000616348"><span>miraculously devoid of jokes</span></a><span>, but I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and hope that its true brilliance would shine in sequences too long to come through clearly if shoved into a two-minute teaser. Well, we now have our first clip of the show, and unfortunately </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>continues to come across like the work of people trying desperately to emulate </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span> without understanding what made it work.</span></p> <p><span>The scene Peacock put out today shows Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson), the new editor-in-chief for the </span><i><span>Toledo Truth-Teller</span></i><span>, trying to impress people on the newspaper’s office floor by looking like he and his staff are having a very enthusiastic meeting in one of the private rooms. Important people are watching, and Ned wants them to think that things are going swimmingly and that the team is energized and synergized. But instead of just actually having a meeting, he instructs his employees to pantomime a productive one so the suits outside will think he’s running a productive ship.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As unfunny as it is, it works. Good for him. I hope he can follow up that content meeting with actual content. But what is the joke here? </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>had absurd sequences that lasted long enough to be uncomfortable, but they were laced with one-liners, had pointed criticism of its office of assholes, or at least made you cringe from second-hand embarrassment. This whole charade doesn’t go anywhere. It’s just a couple of people being confused, most of the group playing along, and a suit being successfully hoodwinked. No punchline.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Paper | New Series Sneak Peek | Peacock Original" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xbuaBS3LtWA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>’s 10-episode season premieres next week on September 4, and I really hope that Peacock is just holding back the good stuff. I don’t need the spin-off to be exactly the same as the original, but it would be nice if it didn’t feel so sauceless. </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s 18th season</span></a><span> began this week, and it’s overhauling every hero’s Perks. These are buffs and tweaks to each character’s abilities that the player chooses between over the course of a match. Cassidy, the gunslingin’ cowboy of the roster, has a pretty packed season between his new fire-based mythic weapon and being the face of the </span><a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1960039614049059292"><span>Luka Dončić collaboration event</span></a><span>, but his greatest boon is that his new perk is absolutely busted.</span></p> <p><span>One of Cassidy’s new perks is called Silver Bullet, and it replaces his rapid-fire “Fan the Hammer” secondary fire with a piercing shot that inflicts Bleed on its target. So not only does it shoot through enemies, but it inflicts damage over time on them as well. You can also zoom in when using it for more precision, which is always helpful for a hitscan hero. Its cooldown resets when you use his dodge roll, so you can pop these suckers off in rapid succession and do some real damage. Combine it with his mythic weapon Blazing Sun and you’ve got a fireworks show going on over the payload. However, it looks like it might be busted, as players found that if you press both primary and secondary fire at the same time, the damage is doubled.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So there is a bug with silver bullet that if you aim it and like instantly cancel it with roll and shoot in quick succession it does like double the damage it's supposed to <a href="https://t.co/QyNcbfmSQk">pic.twitter.com/QyNcbfmSQk</a></p> <p>— Kaladin (@KaladinMeow) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaladinMeow/status/1960502342706717042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Fans are calling this latest patch one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s buggiest, but I guess when you’re overhauling a system like Perks there’s bound to be stuff that falls through the cracks. Wrecking Ball, the mech-piloting hamster tank, has been temporarily removed from standard play while Blizzard </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1n0ylfz/comment/navcxot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>fixes a game-breaking bug</span></a><span> that gave him too much momentum when moving while grappled to an object, and Hazard is able to use his block ability forever, rather than having to stop for a cooldown as he’s supposed to.</span></p>    <p><span>As indicated by the comments on @mi7supp’s video above, some players are reporting issues with Venture and Ashe as well. Hopefully Blizzard will have these squashed in the coming days. While it’s not a great start to the season, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has a lot going on in season 18, including a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-persona-collaboration-skins-joker-2000619195"><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span> that will add new skins and cosmetics based on Atlus’ high school social sim RPGs.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded,</em></a> the newly released remaster of the original <em>Gears of War</em>, has a low review score on Steam due to crashes and missing split-screen support. This follows a day-one patch that was supposed to fix a number of bugs and crashes on both console and PC.</p> <p>On August 26, Xbox launched <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>–a remastered version o<em>f Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, itself a remaster of <em>Gears of War-</em>-on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and for the first time in franchise history, PlayStation, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-remastered-reloaded-running-ps5-xbox-weird-2000620092">a leap it made via a PS5 port.</a> And the game is totally fine if you want to replay<em> Gears of War</em> again. But on PC, players are encountering some annoying issues and are upset about the lack of split-screen. Meanwhile, the Xbox port has a weird FPS bug, and I’ve experienced some issues on PS5, too.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded’</em>s user review score on Steam sits at 49 percent</a> as of 1 p.m. EST on August 27. That’s not great! Checking out the reviews, it seems a big issue with this new remastered shooter is that it crashes a lot for some folks. What’s odd is that some players claim that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> was running fine shortly after launch, but has started crashing more since then. One fix floating around online involves deleting a specific folder and not connecting to Xbox Live, which seems to imply there might be some server shenanigans happening. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-reloaded-hammered-in-steam-reviews-for-missing-splitscreen-co-op-and-microsoft-accounts-seemingly-crashing-everyones-fun-including-mine/#:~:text=I%20ended%20up%20refunding%20it%20on%20Steam%2C%20renewing%20my%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass%20sub%2C%20and%20redownloading%20the%20game%20through%20the%20Xbox%20PC%20app.%20This%20version%20of%20the%20remaster%20has%20performed%20fine%20for%20me%20for%20a%20few%20hours%20now%2C%20suggesting%20there%20is%20genuinely%20something%20wrong%20with%20the%20Steam%20version."><em>Gamesradar</em> reports that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a> works fine when downloaded and installed via the Xbox PC Game Store, suggesting that the version on Steam, or at least how it connects to Xbox servers, might not be working properly.</p>

 <p>Other players report that changing the game’s graphical settings leads to frequent crashing. I’ll say that on PS5, I ran into two crashes and some weird performance problems as well. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/08/digital-foundry-praises-gears-reloaded-on-xbox-but-points-out-glitch-with-the-120fps-mode"><em>Digital Foundry</em> also reports</a> that there’s an odd FPS bug on Xbox Series X that causes the campaign to improperly run at a not-so-stable 120FPS. I also ran into weird FPS issues on PS5 and had to turn off VRR. The PC port also lacks an FOV slider and has some weird limits on keybinding.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The team is investigating crashes on Steam when launching the game and missing pre-order character skins for some users, as well as initial reports of matchmaking issues.</p> <p>You can see all known issues by going to <a href="https://t.co/LNNEO2vf0H">https://t.co/LNNEO2vf0H</a></p> <p>Thank you for your patience.</p> <p>— Gears Community (@Community_Gears) <a href="https://twitter.com/Community_Gears/status/1960483079082139975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/gearsofwar/status/1960084806831608233?s=46">A day-one patch was supposed to iron a lot of this out</a>, but it doesn’t seem to have completely worked. As a result, <a href="https://x.com/Community_Gears/status/1960483079082139975">Xbox and The Coalition posted on social media</a> on Tuesday that the team is currently “investigating” the PC crashes and reports of online matchmaking errors, as well as an issue in which people who pre-ordered did not receive the cosmetics they were promised for doing so. Keep in mind, this is a remaster of a 10-year-old remaster. It’s wild to me that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> seemingly shipped in such a wonky state.</p> <p>Another reason for the game’s low rating on Steam is that players thought<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> would support split-screen co-op on PC. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitscreen/comments/1kg674q/gears_of_war_reloaded_pc_split_screen_confirmed/">Split-screen was reportedly listed on the game’s official Steam store page</a>. There’s also evidence that split-screen co-op support was mentioned in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1n0t0ud/the_pc_version_of_reloaded_is_still_under_cooked/"><em>Reloaded’s</em> Steam page trailer</a>. But it appears all mentions of split-screen support have since been removed. My guess is that this was a mistake and Xbox never intended to add split-screen to PC. Regardless, it’s just one more reason PC players are disappointed with <em>Gears of War: Reloaded.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642">Where is <em>Judas</em></a>? That’s the question <em>BioShock </em>creator Ken Levine keeps getting asked. On Wednesday he took to the PlayStation Blog to tell players he still doesn’t have an answer. “While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that,” he writes, though he does offer some other details.</p> <p>His new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">“lo-fi” dev log</a> explains that<em> Judas</em> has no set villain. NPCs called the “Big 3” will share secrets with you, give you quests, and talk shit about the others. Depending on who you engage with and how, one of characters will be elevated into the game’s main antagonist, unlocking additional powers with which to hamper your journey in the process.</p> <p>“In <em>Judas</em>, you’re going to get to know these characters intimately,” Levine writes. “We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you’ve got to decide who you trust and who you don’t.”</p>

 <figure><figcaption>Credit: Ghost Story Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Ghost Story Games, the studio making <em>Judas</em>, also revealed the game’s key art. It includes the Big 3, killer robots, and ’80s iconography like floppy disks, cassette tapes, and an Atari-esque game stick. Levine confirmed the game recently held a closed playtest and will likely feature over 100 speaking roles by the time it’s complete. He also teased that the key art is intended as more than just an homage to the work of movie poster artist Drew Struzan. “Let’s just say there’s some stuff in this game that we’re not going to talk about right now, but everything here is relevant,” Levine writes.</p> <p>Despite its already lengthy development cycle, with early elements teased as far back as 2015 and a reveal trailer at The Game Awards 2022, <em>Judas</em> seems unlikely to be launching anytime soon. I’d peg it for a fall 2026 release at the earliest, though spring 2027 seems like a better bet. “As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it,” Levine writes.</p> <p>The director’s infamously <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-ken-levines-ghost-story-studio-is-nowhere-near-1848297126">difficult production style and the high turnover</a> at his current studio probably haven’t helped. Can <em>Judas</em> live up to all of the procedural narrative ambition Levine is promising? Will it still manage to come out before <em>BioShock 4</em>? We still have way more questions than answers.</p>
