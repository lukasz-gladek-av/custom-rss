If you don’t count the time it takes to wait for the game to boot up, you can likely unlock him in about three minutes and without even skating at all. </p><h2 id="h79684"><a id=""></a>How to quickly unlock Bam Margera in <em>THPS 3+4</em></h2><p>All you need to do is head over to the character select screen, click on one of the bottom boxes that contains a plus icon instead of a face, and create a character. You don’t even have to change any of the details, like the character’s name or hometown. Just mash through that screen. Doing so will complete a challenge. </p><p>Next, hop over to the challenge menu and look for an exclamation mark indicating a completed challenge. Open up that marked challenge and claim your reward of $5,000 in-game dollars. Then just shoot over to the shop menu and visit the “Secrets” section to find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Bam_Margera#Tony_Hawk's_Pro_Skater_3_+_4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Bam_Margera#Tony_Hawk's_Pro_Skater_3_+_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bam Margera</a></span>. He costs $5,000 to unlock, and if you’ve created a character—like I <em>told</em> you to—you’ll have all the money you need to buy Bam. </p><p>Now he’s a playable skater in your game and you can play all of <em>THPS 3+4</em> as West Chester’s famous jackass. </p><p>I find it very interesting that the game locks Bam behind such a relatively small amount of money and makes it so that most players will quickly stumble into $5,000 early on. Even the reward text for creating a character seems to reference the skater, telling players not to spend it all in one place, before teasing that maybe they should do that. </p><p>If I were a conspiratorial person, I’d ponder this scenario: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278">Tony Hawk reportedly pushed for Bam Margera</a></span> to be added to the game very late in the process. That could have meant it was tricky to add him to the full roster, so they added him as a secret character, but they really wanted people to be able to play as him. It’s been nearly two decades since Bam was in a <em>Tony Hawk </em>game! So the devs set his price to something pretty low and made it easy to unlock him within minutes of booting the game, effectively making him a playable character right from the moment you start.<br></p><p>Regardless, you’ve probably stopped reading this blog ages ago because you went to unlock him<em>.</em> So I’ll just keep thinking about this grand conspiracy alone. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804]]></content:encoded>

She has a family and a life here on their farm in Jackson, and that is something precious in this post-apocalyptic world. Fist-fighting your sworn enemy can’t be more important than that, right? Nevertheless, Ellie leaves her idyllic farm life and ventures across state lines once more to see if this time, it will make her feel something. It’s been five years since that game came out, and lately I feel like I’ve been caught in that same cycle of violence, cutting away at my own sanity to spite an assembly line that will not let one of my favorite games of all time rest.

That doesn’t detract from the original experience, nor does it make it any less the ‘canonical’ version of the story.” Sure, disembodied voice. Devoid of all other context surrounding this game and franchise, it just sounds like a neat way to experience a story the second time around. If it were an unlockable mode that becomes available after you finish the game for the first time, maybe I could buy into that. People have made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9TZQ2eKkdY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9TZQ2eKkdY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a></span> based on this very idea. However, the Chronological Experience didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. It exists in the context of all in which it lives and what came before it.</p><p>To call <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>a divisive game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">would be a massive understatement</a></span>, but a core part of what made it such a prickly game for some folks was the way it walled off the player from certain vital context until a deliberate moment. This is why the flashback-heavy format is so crucial to the story it tells, and is one of the many reasons HBO’s show feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of the story it’s adapting. Denying the player cathartic, easy answers is a core part of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and laying out its story in the most straightforward, literal way feels like capitulating to an audience that already didn’t like the story you told in the first place, whether they knew why Abby killed Joel early on or not. There are plenty of criticisms to be thrown at <em>Part II</em>, but you can’t say it wasn’t deliberate in the experience it was trying to convey. I’m going to quote a guy who has written about this series extensively over the years (it’s me), who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-2-joel-abby-death-1851776976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-2-joel-abby-death-1851776976">wrote this about the show in one of his episodic recaps</a></span> when talking about how HBO re-arranged parts of the narrative in what felt like an attempt to avoid some of the blowback the game received in 2020:</p><p>“[HBO’s] <em>The Last of Us</em> is so preoccupied with recounting plot points like a Wikipedia summary that it lacks any real insight into why those events were arranged in a way that made them meaningful to play through.”</p><p><em>The Last of Us Part II </em>remains one of the boldest games in the AAA space, and that boldness has been categorically undermined at nearly every turn by Sony, Naughty Dog, and HBO ever since. But hey, at least you’ll be able to play as Joel and Tommy dressed as <em>Uncharted </em>characters in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-roguelike-no-return-remaster-ps5-1851153264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-roguelike-no-return-remaster-ps5-1851153264"><em>No Return</em> mode</a></span> once you beat the game in chronological order, right? </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-chronological-experience-update-in-order-1851785807]]></content:encoded>
