Once again, this was a PlayStation console exclusive, with a PC release, and—rather bizarrely considering—inclusion in Game Pass For PC. But still, nothing on Xbox.</p><figure id="" data-id="4cee181f19deed022924180b0b4820b8" data-recommend-id="image://4cee181f19deed022924180b0b4820b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the widdle baby from Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's the widdle baby from Death Stranding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cee181f19deed022924180b0b4820b8" data-recommend-id="image://4cee181f19deed022924180b0b4820b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the widdle baby from Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, with the game’s fifth birthday arriving, it seems very likely some sort of exclusivity deal has expired, meaning the game was able to be surprise-launched on Xbox overnight. It’s the <em>Director’s Cut</em> version, and as mentioned, it’s half-price for the next couple of weeks.

In promotion of the event, Netflix released the first two episodes of the three-part docuseries <em>Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson,</em> showing a behind-the-scenes look at the lead-up to the bout. It didn’t take long before Paul was knocked out by Tyson...sort of.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196196,196452" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Within the first six minutes of the docuseries, before we see more than 10 seconds of Paul throwing punches—and after watching Tyson pummel his trainer’s protective vest—we see Paul endure a fate he’s too young to have seen anyone else suffer: blowing on a <em>Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out</em> NES cartridge, hoping it will work. He unironically remarks that his failed attempts to tap the rust off of the ancient console to play the game “teaches you gratitude, kids, for the consoles we have today,” as if his life experiences are that far removed from the children he addresses. After a few bangs, TV screen taps, and surely some silent prayers to the Nintendo gods, the game starts, and Paul quickly experiences a simulation of what will likely happen when he steps into the real ring with the real Tyson—Iron Mike is nothing to fuck with.</p><p>The first taste of digital Tyson’s overpowered uppercut makes Paul acknowledge he needs to improve his speed and reaction time just before he lets out a frustrated yell after Tyson’s first-round knockout. Then, he was knocked out again. And again. And again. Paul intimated in the episode that Tyson’s boxing prowess only exists to his generation in the myth-building knockout compilations on YouTube, underscoring the generational divide that both makes this fight unnecessary and intriguing. <em>Punch-Out </em>gave him a small taste of just how unbeatable Tyson was in his prime—and maybe a glimpse into his future.</p><p><em>Punch-Out </em>was released in America in October 1987, two months after he became the youngest undisputed heavyweight champion, boasting a 31-0 record and striking fear in boxers trained to destroy people. He was a nightmare in the ring; <em>Punch-Out </em>made him a terror in everyone’s lives. The speed of his punches in the game were coupled with an infamously dangerous upper cut that was almost always a surefire knockout.

There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nes/s/KobHx8Gb9R&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nes/s/KobHx8Gb9R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit threads</a></span> as recent as 2023 of grown humans who still haven’t figured out how to beat 8-bit Tyson. The baddest man on the planet was once the hardest boss to beat in a game.</p><p>Admittedly, 58-year-old Tyson is a Jake Paul lifetime removed from his former boxing dominance and had to postpone this very fight with Paul after a health scare. While Gen Z and younger generations’ thirst for idol dismantling is palpable, there are older crowds who’ll watch the petulant troublemaker struggle to escape the first round in <em>Punch-Out</em> and hope real-life Tyson can duplicate his video game exploits one last time to give Paul the knockout he deserves. </p><p>The final <em>Countdown</em> episode streams on Netflix on November 12. <em>Countdown </em>narrator (and serial check chaser) Ice-T asks a question in the docuseries that kept repeating in my mind while watching Paul struggle against <em>Punch-Out </em>Tyson: “Why are both of them here demanding our attention at all?”</p><p>No matter the answer, I just wish they didn’t. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
