Was it the dark days where every single big blockbuster movie got a shitty tie-in video game crunched out by some poor dev team in six months to launch alongside the film? Or is it the present, where new movies rarely get tie-in games at all outside of the occasional throwaway mobile game? Yes, of course there are exceptions, but for every <em>Goldeneye 007</em>, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, or <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, there are a dozen <em>E.T.</em>s, <em>Rambo</em>s, or <em>Fight Club</em>s. Meanwhile, we’ve finally got kind of a good thing going in the other direction, with enough quality movie/TV adaptations of games that an outright shitburger like <em>Borderlands</em> feels like a rare exception and not the rule. </p><div><p>I get it, games take longer and more effort to make, especially the kind of quadruple-A thing most film studios would prefer their cash-ins to look like. But here’s the secret sauce, kids: Most of the best movie-to-video-game adaptations aren’t even direct adaptations of a specific movie, but are instead parallel stories, spinoffs, off-brand prequels and sequels, and weird anthology tales existing in the same universe. <em>Star Wars </em>has been proving that theory right for decades now, but even ambitious-yet-average one-offs like <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> have the right idea. </p><p>And that’s the sweet spot we’d like to look at, especially in the wake of the rather excellent <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>: The games that took a film’s ball and ran with it. There’s quite a few of them, but here’s 10 that are especially worth your time. </p></div></div></div><div><p>Probably the indisputable winner of this entire list, if we’re honest. Creative Assembly took a good hard look at everything<em> Aliens: Colonial Marines</em> did and made the exact opposite of that. The extent to which <em>Isolation</em> applies pressure to the player and <em>dares</em> them to make a wrong move or make the wrong noise is breathtaking. Quite literally, too, if you turned on that option on select platforms where the alien can hear you through your controller, laptop, or camera microphone. And how gloriously sadistic is the fact that they even included that option?</p></div><div><p>There are elements of <em>The Thing</em> that show its age, especially the gunplay that becomes a drag once you start getting fewer alien monstrosities and more generic humans in your way. But wrapped around a fairly bog-standard survival horror game is a suite of brilliant mechanics that truly makes it feel harmonious with the Carpenter film of the same name. Once you start rescuing survivors, any one of them could be infected at any time, and deciding just how much to trust them–or not–with resources and tasks still feels tense and unique. Nightdive Studios just shadow-dropped a very pretty remaster of the game. It’s still very much worth a look today as it was back in 2002 when it first arrived. </p></div><div><p>Here we have the rarest of rare scenarios: <em>Escape From Butcher Bay </em>is a game that is an outright triumph in every way the film it was meant to tie-in with is not. Yes, there’s still a goofy charm to <em>Chronicles of Riddick</em>: The Film, the kind of bro-ey nerd charm you can only get from one Vincent Diesel, Esq. It actually feels more like a one-shot <em>D&amp;D/Warhammer</em> campaign than anything else, and nobody was even attempting that in 2004. </p><p><br><em>Escape from Butcher Bay</em>, however, is every inch the sequel to <em>Pitch Black</em> the world needed and wanted. The game is a down and dirty, stealthy prison escape scenario with an excellent “see-in-the-dark” mechanic, awash in character actors, and <em>a lot </em>of Riddick shanking people in the spine. And the game pulled all this off while still serving some satisfying Furyan lore expansion. For some reason, we haven’t gotten 10 sequels to this yet.   </p></div><div><p>Oh sure, there’s an argument to be made that <em>Shadow of Mordor/Shadow of War</em> are the better games to include here, considering how much of their presentation is lifted from the Peter Jackson films. However, I’d argue for a more unique experience, look no further than <em>The Third Age.</em> As literally anyone who plays it for five minutes can tell you, the game is basically just <em>Final Fantasy X</em> in Middle Earth. Thing is, what seemed like a derivative choice in 2004 feels far more novel in 2024. The story, with a kind of parallel Fellowship ensuring the A-team gets to Mount Doom, runs roughshod over the established canon, but the group’s backstories are all solid enough to maintain interest for the entire play time, and hey, least they don’t do anything too stupid like, say, oh, idk, for instance, make Shelob a goth baddie, or make the last thicc female Ent fight a Balrog. </p></div><div><p>Every once in a while, somebody threatens to try and do a new <em>Back to the Future</em>, or maybe turn that Broadway musical into a film. Meanwhile, Telltale got there first, with the help of series screenwriter Bob Gale, and a smattering of the original cast in tow, all putting in work. The first two episodes are a little on the sillier side, with a jaunt to Prohibition-era Hill Valley. But once the busybody ancestor of Principal Strickland gets involved with Doc Brown, resulting in Hill Valley being turned into a techno-dystopia, things are drastically more interesting. It’s a damn shame the ending–which managed to rope in Michael J. Fox while introducing some multiverse shenanigans back when that was still cool–never went anywhere. What we’ve got instead is still the one and only time this series has ever been expanded upon in a meaningful way. </p></div><div><p>Look, I love <em>GTA V</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em>, but every damn day, I mourn that the Rockstar Games that had time to pump out games that weren’t <em>GTA</em> appears to be in a coma. Don’t even get me started on how much I miss <em>Midnight Club</em>, we’ll be here all day. But above all, we don’t talk enough about the one time Rockstar decided to play in someone else’s cinematic sandbox to give us not just one of the best takes on a 3D beat-’em-up we’d get (until the <em>Yakuza</em> games finally started to gain traction in the West), but also one of the best movie adaptations all around. <em>The Warriors</em> takes a cult classic film literally nobody was even paying attention to in 2005, and breathes new life into it. The game isn’t just an adaptation, but is an expansive prequel starring most of the same cast. This thing has been long overdue for a remaster, but alas, Rockstar would have to pull people off of lovingly modeling every strand of a meth head’s chest hair in <em>GTA Online</em> to do it. </p></div><div><p>It’s always a mistake whenever someone says <em>Bond </em>films are all just dumb action flicks, especially the Daniel Craig era. But to be fair, the Pierce Brosnan flicks weren’t shy about being exactly what they were, until they parasurfed way too close to the sun with <em>Die Another Day</em>. Quality of the films notwithstanding, it made total sense that Brosnan would end up getting the best Bond game ever made (<em>Goldeneye 007</em>’s aged, and you know it. Why are you booing me? I’m right). <em>Everything or Nothing</em> is just a wild-ass ride from beginning to end, with enormous action set pieces no film would be able to budget for without bankrupting England. It’s frankly shocking it didn’t, considering the staggering amount of star power EA managed to rope into this. The game features Brosnan himself, as well as Judi Dench, John Cleese, and even Willem Dafoe as the baddie.Shannon Elizabeth and Heidi Klum star as Bond girls, and Mya does the theme song (which is still a bop). This is just straight up, spared-no-expense AAA shit right here, a game that actually feels like a later <em>Uncharted</em> sequel long before anyone even heard the name Nathan Drake. </p></div><div><p>Ask virtually anyone about what they think a <em>John Wick</em> video game should be, chances are good the answer is something that resembles <em>Max Payne</em> or <em>Hotline Miami</em>. Nobody’s first answer would’ve been <em>John Wick Hex</em>, and yet after playing it, one will find themselves wondering “Why wasn’t it?” <em>John Wick Hex</em> is a strategy game that puts you in the head of the Baba Yaga, where every little consideration of the killzones he finds himself in must be accounted for to escape without taking a bullet, and it’s only after you’ve done the legwork that you actually get to see the dope, bone-crushing, headshotting glory. It’s also working with a really cool cel-shaded art style, and really, though, it’s just cool to see John <em>as</em> the Baba Yaga, the guy still building his legend instead of the legend. </p></div><div><p>Out of everything else in this list, <em>Terminator: Resistance</em> is shocking in the fact that nothing about its pedigree gives the indication that it might be playable let alone often good. Look at developer Teyon’s resume prior to this, and it is a long, depressing list of straight up shovelware for the Wii and 3DS. Hell, their last licensed game is the dreadful PS3 <em>Rambo</em> rail shooter I mentioned at the start. Somehow, those guys managed to pull off <em>Fallout</em>-but-with-<em>Terminators</em>, and did it in a way that doesn’t outstay its welcome the way too many of the <em>Fallout </em>games do. We used to get stuff like this all the time in the PS2 era. Now, a AA game taking a road-less-traveled with a big property is one of those swings nobody makes. But when they do, it often winds up being a delightfully wonky treat. </p></div><div><p>It’s not exactly a surprise when WayForward manages to make a pretty passable game out of a tie-in property nobody cares about, let alone a legitimately fun, cool Metroidvania, but in <em>The Mummy Demastered</em>’s case, the team found themselves in the wild position of crafting the only shining positive about an absolute shitshow of a project. <em>The Dark Universe</em> is still a punchline in the annals of recent film history (though we did get that great Elisabeth Moss <em>Invisible Man</em> out of it), but the game is surprisingly pretty forward thinking in a few ways. Specifically, it’s got more of a <em>Souls</em>-like approach to the way it handles death, in that, as a nameless grunt, completing the mission means heading into darkened tombs, having to take down your predecessor if you want any of your inventory back. All it really needed was a trailer with a pixel-art Tom Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/imax-the-mummy-trailer-sound-effects-missing-youtube-1201761023/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/imax-the-mummy-trailer-sound-effects-missing-youtube-1201761023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screaming in the center sound channel of your TV</a></span>. </p><hr></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, <em>Sonic 3</em>’s isn’t quite as self-explanatory as those in the first two movies if you’re not already familiar with the blue blur and all his friends (and enemies). The first two movies’ post-credits scenes felt like natural extensions of the movies they came from, but <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s is a bit more disorienting and might have left new fans a bit confused. Fear not, because we’re here to fill in the gaps and speculate on what it all means.

It starts with Sonic running around, seemingly racing against Tails and Knuckles as seen earlier in the movie. However, in his haste, the hedgehog takes a wrong turn or two and ends up in a New York state park. A bit far from your home in Green HIlls, Montana, my guy. Once there, he’s greeted by none other than Metal Sonic, an evil synthetic recreation of our hero who Doctor Eggman creates in the games to try and match Sonic’s speed and power. At first, Sonic outmaneuvers Metal as his attacker attempts to obliterate him with an energy blast from a cannon in his arm, but is then suddenly surrounded by a squad of his robotic doppelgangers. Just as they all jump in to take him out, they’re struck by a flying hammer covered in pink chaos energy similar to Sonic’s blue and Shadow’s red. It returns to its wielder: a hooded figure who reveals herself to be a pink hedgehog before the movie cuts to black.</p><figure id="" data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not one of the long-time fans who likely was popping off at this point in the theater, this hammer-using vigilante is Amy Rose. She originally debuted alongside Metal Sonic in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog CD </em>back in 1993. For most of her early appearances, Amy was defined as Sonic’s one-sided love interest—she was infatuated with the hero, but he was too busy being the fastest hedgehog alive to consider something as trivial as romance. However, as the years have gone on, Amy has become a much more well-rounded character and a team leader in her own right. Historically, she’s added some girlypop spunk to the <em>Sonic </em>cast, and after being a boys club for three movies, the live-action universe is in dire need of that.</p><p>But what are she and Metal Sonic doing in the live-action movies? Again, this scene feels pretty disconnected from the rest of the film, so there’s only so much we can pull from in this short exchange. Given that Sonic has traveled to a different part of the country than we’ve seen in the movies thus far, it’s entirely possible Amy has already been on Earth by herself for some time and decided to be a vigilante in New York. How she got here, where she comes from, and just how she’ll feel about more alien animals in her space remains to be seen, but seeing as <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>doubles down on the idea of Sonic and his kind being aliens from different places, it stands to reason that Amy is not from Earth, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The bigger question mark in this scene is Metal Sonic. Eggman builds the robot hedgehog in the games, but as we saw not 10 minutes prior, Jim Carrey’s version of the mad scientist has seemingly kicked the bucket in a final moment of heroism. Granted, they also pretended to kill him off at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>, but there were more explicit teases to his survival than anything in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Agent Stone, Eggman’s loyal henchman, has seemingly turned a new leaf at the end of the movie as well, so he’s probably off the table. In theory, anyone could have seen all the events of the first three movies and decided to create a robot version of Sonic, but there’s still the question of why. That’s the major difference between this post-credits scene and previous ones; this one feels almost abstract, introducing new ideas and characters who have no clear, direct connection to what happened in the movie it bookends. I wouldn’t be surprised if this scene is featured in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em>, maybe 10 to 15 minutes into the film with more context to fill in these gaps. But for now, the only thing we really know as a result of this scene is who the new players will be in the next film.</p><p>The second post-credits scene is much shorter and more straightforward. We see that one of Shadow’s inhibitor rings has made a small crater on Earth after it fell to the planet during the final battle in space. The shot lingers briefly before we see Shadow walk into the frame and pick it up. It’s not much, but it confirms that Shadow survived the destruction of the Eclipse Cannon and will be around for the next movie. That’s not too surprising. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is heavily based on <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, in which Shadow is presumed dead after the final battle, only to return in <em>Sonic Heroes</em> after being rescued by Eggman. There are reports of plans for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow-centric spin-off</a></span>, too, so of course they didn’t kill him off for good.</p><p>Overall, I’m starting to wonder if <em>Sonic 4</em> could be a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. Metal Sonic is the primary antagonist of that game, and if Shadow’s reported spin-off introduces the rest of his team, treasure-hunting spy Rouge the Bat and decommissioned Eggman robot E-123 Omega, they’re already halfway to having most of <em>Heroes</em>’ cast accounted for. Whatever the fourth movie ends up being, <em>Sonic </em>fans have a lot to chew on after the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>.

But if you’re on an extended trip somewhere with no ability to charge it, you may want to try extending that life even further. Here are some tips for extending the battery life on your PlayStation Portal.</p><h2 id="h64226"><a id="brightness"></a>Reduce screen brightness</h2><p>This one is a no-brainer. The brighter you keep your screen, the faster your battery will drain. If you’re in a dark room, you should be able to keep the brightness close to its lowest setting, but you may need to increase it again to see the screen in well-lit locations.</p><p>The brightness setting can be accessed on your quick settings tabs, or you can go into Settings &gt; Display and Brightness. You’ll want to do that anyway for the next trick.</p><h2 id="h64227"><a id="light"></a>Turn off the light bar</h2><p>The light bar around the rim of the PlayStation Portal controller looks cool, but it can drain your battery a bit. Since the light doesn’t serve any purpose beyond proof that your device is on, it may be worth disabling altogether.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness to turn this feature off. While you’re there, you can also disable the mute button light, though I doubt that tiny light affects the battery much, if at all.</p><h2 id="h64228"><a id="haptics"></a>Turn off the haptics and trigger effects</h2><p>It goes without saying that the PlayStation Portal’s haptic feedback and trigger effects are awesome, but they can also contribute to battery drain in games that frequently use it (this is also true of the PS5’s DualSense controllers). </p><p>If you head to Settings &gt; Controller, you adjust the intensity of these features. I’d recommend turning them all the way off if your goal is to save as much battery as possible, but even just reducing their intensity will help a little.</p><h2 id="h64229"><a id="restmode"></a>Set a reasonable time for entering Rest Mode</h2><p>Lastly, make sure you set a reasonable time for the PlayStation Portal to enter Rest Mode, which will turn the screen off and reduce the amount of power it’s using when you’re not actively using it.</p><p>To adjust this feature, head into Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery. The best time setting would be 30 seconds, but even somewhere around 1-2 minutes should help you reduce battery drain when you’re away from the handheld. </p><p>With all of these settings changed, you should save some battery life on your PlayStation Portal. That means more time to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615"><em>Astro Bot</em>’s new Christmas level</a></span>!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
