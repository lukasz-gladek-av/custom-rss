              <p><span>Video games rule. Sometimes. They </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> be really cool. It can be tough, though. Finding them. The games are good, but the discoverability? Miserable. Storefronts prioritize what’s already selling in a frenzy despite an intimate record of your playing habits. If your tastes generally lie outside of <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-steam-deck-games-ever-megabonk-balatro-vampire-survivors-2000667367">roguelikes or survival games</a>, you’ve noticed you’re not always being served to your palette. That’s why I love Steam Next Fest. A publicity window, sure, but an easy opportunity to dredge the trenches of the video world.</span></p> <p><span>Steam, for all of its resources and data, never seems to match my freak. In my experience, the moment I buy Capcom’s </span><i><span>Pocket Fighter</span></i><span> on sale my discovery queue gets force-fed every </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><i><span>Monster Hunter</span></i></a><span> under the sun. I think of my poor YouTube algorithm, so confused, so eager to please me, that the moment I watch an old Gordon Ramsay clip the whole feed switches to </span><i><span>Kitchen Nightmare</span></i><span> reruns and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgqudioHmTE"><span>Raj clips</span></a><span>. As if to say, “Now </span><i><span>this</span></i><span> I can work with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Three times a year, Steam puts on Next Fest. A digital alternative to the E3 trade-shows of old, the event prioritizes demos for up-and-coming works. It’s a great, zero-investment opportunity to not just check out the biggest and most curious hits on the horizon, but to flesh out a sense of what games excite you, specifically. Because gaming doesn’t have common third spaces like rep theatres or record shops, this is as good as it’ll get for most.</span></p> <p><span>Surprisingly, it’s on that note that Steam runs especially flat. The games that make Next Fest’s front page are just as traffic-oriented as what the store calls attention to every other day of the year. If you’re like me, you keep tabs on interesting curators and creators, squirrelling games away into your wishlist. But even if you </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> proactive, Steam doesn’t offer a function to see if anything you’ve earmarked has joined in the festivities (</span><a href="https://steam-wishlist-demos.fly.dev/"><span>you’re welcome, by the way</span></a><span>).</span></p>   <p><span>No one knows you as well as you do. So unfortunately it’s on you to try to shape an environment by following developers, creators, critics, curators and feeds that seem to gel. Like an esoteric game? Check out its </span><a href="https://backloggd.com/"><span>Backlogged page</span></a><span>, peek into its lists to see what company it keeps. Hit the wishlist button on Steam as if that rainy day is going to be a biblical flood. You should probably hit up some </span><a href="http://itch.io/"><span>itch.io</span></a><span> feeds, too, where creators you’ve purchased from eagerly share what they find exciting. And if you aren’t in the habit yet, here’s a little tour through some of what I’ve hit up so far, speaking as </span><a href="http://funland.land/"><span>someone extra invested in the outer orbits</span></a><span> than most.</span></p>

 <p><span>When I first played </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2575900/Corn_Kidz_64/"><i><span>Corn Kidz 64</span></i></a><span>, it dawned on me that not only can indie devs pursue the games they’ve always wanted to make, they can make the exact game they </span><i><span>would</span></i><span> have made if they could have made one back when they were a brooding adolescent mall goth. That thread has beautifully blossomed. There’s a slate of games I’ve mentally categorized as “self-medicating interplay,” games in love with the magic-hat nature of what can be rendered on a computer and intense, uncontrollable energies taking the first multimedia shape they can.</span></p>

 <p><span>One of those is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4133290/DownSouth/"><i><span>Downsouth</span></i></a><span>, a manic and lurid platformer from Troopsushi about a grinning purple bean descending into an urban underworld, its brisk pace distracted only by the fidelity of detail. Each environment is stuffed with more loaded imagery than a ‘90s MTV bumper. In a similar class is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244030/RUBATO/"><i><span>RUBATO</span></i></a><span>, a fun, physics-based, frog-based platformer with visual tonal shifts rapid enough to make you feel like a sleeper cell agent being shown their trigger code.</span></p>   <p><span>Reemerging after some time is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007430/Blast_Cats/"><i><span>Blast Cats</span></i></a><span>, an eclectic, explosive 3D platformer reared on all the PlayStation games you saw ads for but never saved up the allowance to play. Another long-awaited bit of goodness is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4175410/PSI_Demo/"><i><span>PSI</span></i></a><span>, a first-person adventure about cults, plumbing, and frogs. And if you’re snowed in this week, may as well force the chill deeper with </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3635740/Subjectivation/"><span><em>Subjectivation</em></span></a><span>, an off-kilter horror game about a bitter frozen world. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Mommy’s Best, who have long made games from a world where the Amiga beat the Super Nintendo, have a demo up for their latest, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3463500/ChainStaff_Demo/"><i><span>ChainStaff</span></i></a><span>, a pulpy, <em>Metal Hurlant</em>-flavored run-and-gun. Another retro-inspired game that would make more sense in another dimension is </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/952100/Bad_Pixels/"><i><span>Bad Pixels</span></i></a><span>, a 3D western shooter rendered to resemble something you might find on a floppy disc the size of your outstretched hand. And if you miss light rail shooters and adore names that would make an arcade operator scrunch their nose, you owe it to yourself to check out </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4353960/___a_Demo/"><i><span>ᴛᴜᴍᴏʀ ɴᴇᴄʀᴏꜱɪꜱ ꜰᴀᴄᴛᴏʀ:// αᴍᴇɴ</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Again, just a vertical slice of what’s out there for those who have hit a wall. Find the routine that works for you, keep tabs and broaden your video game world. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-generational-divide-roblox-nintendo-2000672648"><span>The major industry won’t</span></a><span>. If you do it for anything, do it out of spite.</span></p>

            <guid>1443199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>30 years ago </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span> chronicled a generational conflict between an old-timey pull-string doll and a fancy new one with buttons. The two toys learned to get along. This week a trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/toy-story-5-trailer-woody-tablet-buzz-jesse-bonnie-cast-2000671373"><i><span>Toy Story 5</span></i><span> arrived</span></a><span> showing both toys enacting a </span><a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad"><span>Butlerian Jihad</span></a><span> against tablets. While I agree on the potential detriments of excessive screen-time, it is telling how the creators and intended audience of&nbsp;<em>Toy Story&nbsp;</em>films now identify less with the kid playing with toys and more with the adult who just spent all of dinner hearing about “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/style/clavicular-looksmaxxing-braden-peters.html">looksmaxxing</a>.”</span></p> <p><span>If you’re a child who wants to watch a movie for children, or an adult who wants to watch a movie for adults, you thankfully have options beyond </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span>. Disrupted as it is, the Hollywood entertainment industry has a built-in ecosystem to provide for demographics across all ages. Gaming still doesn’t.</span></p>

 <p><span>It has been an ominous month for the video gaming industry. AI infrastructure is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ram-shortage-ai-pc-gaming-china-cxmt-2000670712"><span>bodying the consumer technology world</span></a><span>. Another </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734"><span>multi-million-dollar live-service game</span></a><span> failed to meet its mark while Sony appears to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404"><span>rebuilding themselves</span></a><span> entirely in that image. Not only is Microsoft singularly focused on AI integration, but as I wrote this, the heads of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084"><span>Xbox abruptly announced their departure</span></a><span> and replacement with reps from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087"><span>AI wing of the company</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>All of these dramatic pivots occur in the shadow of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338"><span>inconvenient player trends</span></a><span>. More players are playing fewer games. The games they do play </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/most-playstation-5-owners-have-been-playing-the-same-games-since-2022-2000672009"><span>are years old</span></a><span>. Landing a “forever game” is obviously lucrative to the company behind it, and why Sony is wagering they’ll nail at least one for themselves, but it’s a formula that can only shrink the industry.</span></p>

 <p><span>So why, when the population has never been more immersed in gaming, with even</span> <a href="https://www.theesa.com/annual-esa-study-reveals-video-games-universal-appeal-across-generations/"><span>a third of octogenarians</span></a><span> hitting </span><i><span>Candy Crush</span></i><span>, is success so sluggish? Taste and preferences differ across demographics and geographies. Impassioned fans from European rail-sim lovers to Latin fighting game communities make do even when the larger industry doesn’t provide. Those hungry for more deck builders, 4X games and turn-based RPGs will find something to eat.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>But the biggest gap between cultures is time, not space. There we see devastating stagnation. The youngest players are burning unsupervised hours on </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span>. The oldest are in Odinsleep until a single-player blockbuster catches their eye. The middle of the pack, getting the hang of disposable income, are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338"><span>discovering other ways to spend</span></a><span>. The biggest players in the industry are still waiting for this entire bloc to gravitate toward the next </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>, but year after year this just looks more like wishful, harmful thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span>Through the ‘90s, the video game industry very intentionally tried to narrow its players down to adolescent males, a controlled demographic that </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/console-wars-nintendo-sega-ad-research/"><span>made marketing much easier</span></a><span>. Movies, music and television did not do this beyond specific programs, because they knew their business relied on having something to sell to everyone. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It’s no coincidence that the video game industry found its biggest successes when the facade slipped. </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,</span><span> and the DVD capabilities of the PlayStation 2 were boomtowns, made up of people who did not previously see themselves as the primary audience for games and gaming hardware. The biggest disruptors of the last decade weren’t fantasy RPGs or open-world shooters but </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Gaming started to broaden its horizons, even if the dude-focused marketing divisions remained entrenched for years. If there is a crash on the horizon, it’s likely Nintendo will be the ones walking away from it the least scathed (</span><i><span>again)</span></i><span>. Games like </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> and <em>Mario </em></span><i><span>Kart</span></i><span> truly are widely beloved across generations, demographically pliable. The company has long understood the importance of trying to redefine what the experience of playing a game can be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“If we continue to coalesce around the four or five genres, then we won’t get the new players because those people have already said we’re not interested in your genres,” former Sony Interactive Entertainment Chairman Shawn Layden </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069"><span>said back in 2023</span></a><span>. “Don’t kid yourself that someone who’s said ‘no’ to</span><i><span> Call of Duty</span></i><span> for the last 15 years is going to start suddenly saying ‘yes’ to </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It is worth mentioning that sales for </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>, one of gaming’s evergreen cash cows, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"><span>slipped last year</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The current youth, opting for </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s</span></i><span> lore, are agnostic to the graphics-pushing that once defined industry progress. The people going to concerts, exhausted of being online but still enjoying posting, are compromising with the cruddiest flashcard digicams the 2000s had to offer. The fans who once reliably showed up for every new salvo in the AAA console war are now busy booking colonoscopies.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As gaming rigs return to the $6,000 range, the island of high-performance players will recede to the peninsula of 30,000 or so people who unironically have “XxX” in their username. The biggest gaming companies are placing unsustainable bets that rely on each one of these kinds of players showing up and subscribing to a singular vision of gaming. These are growing pains maturing at the worst possible time. But it’s the result of intentional decisions, not inevitable fate. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If this industry wants a future for itself, it needs an ecosystem that everyone can participate in for the long haul, from first steps to one foot in the grave. That requires an inclusive approach that is very alien to its foundations. Those players will need a way to discover more than the next live-service game, finding the gaming equivalent to </span><i><span>Sesame Street</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Smiling Friends</span></i><span>,</span><span> and </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span> all on the same idiot box. Edutainment and courtroom dramas alike. The player base is huge. Bigger than ever. Ever growing. They won’t all fit into the next </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790">Tencent-backed</a> TiMi Montreal is shutting down less than five years after opening and without ever shipping a game. It appears to be the latest casualty of Chinese publishers pulling back on investment in North American studios.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">first reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, news of the closure began to trickle out on LinkedIn late last week. “I am genuinely heartbroken that the public will never get to experience what this team was capable of producing,” one laid-off programmer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">wrote</a>. “TiMi Montreal was made up of really talented people and working with them was a privilege, the level of skill and dedication on this team was something special.”</p> <p>The studio was founded back in 2021 and was pitched as working on “AAA open world multi-platform games.” It joined TiMi Los Angeles and TiMi Seattle as the third office of TiMi Studio Group in North America. The company behind mobile hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and <em>Arena of Valor</em> was trying to branch out into bigger-budget blockbusters.</p>

 <p>A studio in Montreal seemed to outsiders like the perfect way to scoop up talent from open-world adventure factory Ubisoft. That included <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> creative director Ashraf Ismail, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/28/ashraf-ismail-tencent-ubisoft">who joined TiMi in 2022</a> after being fired from Ubisoft following allegations <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-creative-director-fired-from-ubisoft-f-1844724819">around some of his personal romantic relationships</a>.</p> <p>But TiMi Montreal never announced a game it was making, or disclosed any co-development support it was providing on any recently shipped projects. TiMi’s L.A.-based studio Team Kaiju, which attracted former leads from <em>Halo</em> and<em> Battlefield</em>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-closes-shop-on-team-kaiju">ended up shutting down back in 2023</a>. The retreat follows concerns about pricey development costs in the U.S. and competitors like NetEase cutting investment in <a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-scifi-bioware-1851707754">a bunch of recent studio startups</a> over the past couple of years.</p>

              <p>Every game in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series is defined, in part, by its aesthetics, the visual design choices coalescing every element into one cohesive vision. Even during the Hylian hero’s original 8-bit journey, strong art direction transformed simple sprites into sprawling labyrinths, mysterious woods, and terrible foes in the player’s imagination. While the core of <em>Zelda</em>’s story and gameplay has remained (until recently) mostly the same, the series reinvents itself artistically with nearly every entry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on June 27, 2023. It’s been republished today following the 40th anniversary of </em>Zelda<em>‘s launch in Japan.</em></p> <p>Looking back on the 40 year history of the franchise, one thing is clear: Link has had a lot of looks.</p>

 <p>Cel-shaded oceans, lonely ranches, and apocalyptic moon landings all paint the diverse canvas that is <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, but which entries truly <em>look</em> the best? There’s no bad-looking <em>Zelda</em> game—<a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon-the-kotaku-review-1818811388">not from Nintendo, anyway</a>—but today we want to rank the most aesthetically inspired, from least inspired to most. We’ll be considering all the mainline <em>Zelda</em> entries, and please keep in mind that this isn’t a ranking of the best games in the series, but rather the best-looking.</p> <p>Let’s step into the art gallery that is <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and take a look around.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-baldurs-gate-3-grok-xai-2000672632</link>
            <guid>1443139</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Elon Musk, currently on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, is apparently obsessed with <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">teaching Grok about video games</a>. The xAI-powered chatbot was reportedly so bad at answering questions about <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> last year that Musk actually delayed a major update to its model so the problem could be rectified.</p> <p>That bizarre anecdote comes from a recent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">deep-dive investigation into xAI by <em>Business Insider</em></a>. Musk’s penchant for chaos and micromanagement was apparently so bad that when confronted with Grok’s inability to correctly parse details about Larian Studios’ hit 2023 RPG based on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, he pulled top engineers off other projects to get the chatbot sorted.</p>

 <p>“In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game ‘Baldur’s Gate,’ according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said,” <em>Business Insider</em> writes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can I have just one normal week <a href="https://t.co/bip2afWQLe">pic.twitter.com/bip2afWQLe</a></p> <p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2025332627645808932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Lest you think this episode was a one-off, Musk was also apparently obsessed with teaching Grok how to play <em>League of Legends</em>. Some former xAI employees reportedly compare how the company is run to a never-ending fire drill. There are multiple “war rooms” running at the Palo Alto headquarters to tackle urgent issues, including getting Grok to Challenger rank in Riot Games’ popular MOBA.</p>

 <p>“At the end of 2025, at least five war rooms were running simultaneously, according to three people,” writes <em>Business Insider</em>. “One, they said, was dedicated to teaching Grok how to play one of Musk’s favorite video games, ‘League of Legends.'”</p>

 <p>That definitely sounds like the unparalleled, no-drugs grindset of someone worth a trillion dollars. It’s worth noting that all of this was happening the year following Musk exposing himself as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">a massive cheater</a> in games like<em> Diablo 4</em> and <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>‘s own publishing head was busy calling out Musk’s promises of AI-generated video games <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-elon-musk-ai-xai-douse-2000632638">for missing the point</a>.</p>

              <p><span>Ever see those Facebook reels where </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat 1</span></i><span> modders try to dupe strangers into thinking NetherRealm Studios added Shrek and Captain Jack Sparrow to their fighting game to decapitate one another? Something along those lines capped off this year’s figure skating competition at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan as Sub-Zero, Deadpool and Kung Fu Panda squared off on the global stage.</span></p> <p><span>Kazakhstan skater Mikhail Shaidorov won the gold in men’s figure skating this year, the first from his country to land that prize. He’s also the first Olympic figure skater, ever, to best the Lin Kuei. During the Exhibition Gala, the closing, non-competitive, often silly segment, Shaidorov came out on the ice dressed like Jack Black’s famed Dreamworks cartoon martial artist. There he danced to Carl Douglas’s “Kung Fu Fighting,” doing some friendly sparring with Deadpool and Sub-Zero before farting on them, the sound effect echoing in the arena of champions.</span></p>

Earlier pairs skated to “Cotton Eyed Joe” and “Macarena.” Georgia’s Luka Berulava, who was the one dressed like Sub-Zero, joined partner Anastasiia Metelkina (dressed like Kitana) for a routine to The Immortals’ famed </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat</span></i><span> theme. The two ended with the warbled, dazed stance Mortal Kombatants do ahead of having their intestines ripped out.</span></p> <p><span>Needless to say I have never been more confused about IP rights at the Olympic games. Earlier in the week, during competitive performances, chaos brewed as several figure skaters, such as American gold medalist Amber Glenn, </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/why-olympic-figure-skaters-struggle-with-music-licensing/"><span>struggled to secure licensing</span></a> <span>to the music used for their performances.
