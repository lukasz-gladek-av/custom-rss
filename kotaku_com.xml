              <p><span>The ongoing battle between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-cory-in-the-house-ds-went-from-bad-forgotten-game-1842525482"><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> to decide which will ultimately be crowned the top user-rated game on Metacritic rages on, but an unforeseen consequence of the conflict has resulted in second-hand copies of the Nintendo DS Disney game skyrocketing in price in online marketplaces.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-metacritic-cory-in-the-house-ds-game-2000659380"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> first reported on Tuesday</span></a><span>, something strange was brewing over on Reddit: a seemingly organic campaign to get the long-memed 2008 Nintendo DS game </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> to the top of Metacritic’s user-rated rankings and beat 2025’s GOTY. </span><span>When I originally reported on the story, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, the current top-ranked user-rated game on the platform, had just dipped from a 9.6 to a 9.5. </span><i><span>Cory in the House </span></i><span>had just risen from 9.3 to 9.4. The meme was about to become a reality.</span></p>

 <p><span>Since then, things have simultaneously changed drastically and also somehow stayed exactly the same. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> is still clinging on to a 9.5 rating, but </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> is back down to a 9.3. </span><span>The big change is in the number of ratings on Metacritic. I made a note on the 13th that the PS5 version of</span><i><span> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> had roughly 23,351 ratings. Now it has 23,654 user ratings. On the other hand, </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> had roughly 2,400 ratings on the same date. Now that’s climbed up to whopping </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/disney-cory-in-the-house/"><span>4,666 user ratings</span></a><span>. Actually, nevermind, I typed that and then immediately refreshed the page. Now it’s up to 4,684.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a result of users flooding metacritic &amp; pushing the game to the #2 spot of all time, sealed copies of Cory In The House have skyrocketed by more than 3000% in the past 2 weeks. <a href="https://t.co/nlVkLGWP0V">pic.twitter.com/nlVkLGWP0V</a></p> <p>— Resell News 💸 (@resellnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/resellnews/status/2011945080198930695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The point is, the focus is less on review-bombing </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, as some had assumed, and more on reverse review-bombing </span><i><span>Cory in the House. </span></i><span>That also probably goes some way toward explaining the recent meme-fueled price increases for physical copies of the Nintendo DS game on eBay. </span><span>The first writer to spot this story seems to have been </span><a href="https://www.cllct.com/sports-collectibles/auctions/cory-in-the-house-meme-makes-video-game-flop-a-collectible-hit"><span>Cllct’s Will Stern</span></a><span>.

              <p>The<em> Inverse</em> gaming section is dead. Four staff, including Deputy Editor Shannon Liao, were laid off from the website on Friday as it reportedly “divests from gaming.” It’s a shift that comes as owner Bustle Digital Group pivots to being an “influencer company,” whatever that is.</p> <p>Launched in 2015 by Dave Nemetz, who previously co-founded <em>Bleacher Report</em>,<em> Inverse</em> began life primarily as a tech and science website before later pivoting to entertainment and gaming. It will seemingly now only cover movies and TV as the gaming side of its masthead has been wiped out. Several staff, including Liao, shared the news on Bluesky.</p>

 <p>“After flying back from Vegas last week, I was just laid off from <em>Inverse</em> today,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shannonliao.bsky.social/post/3mcki3gpiy22o">wrote</a>. “<em>Inverse</em>‘s gaming section is being shut down as the company ‘divests’ from gaming content.

Last February, it was being <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/bryan-goldberg-bustle-digital-media-back-rent-lawsuit.html">sued for $3 million</a> it allegedly owed in back rent.&nbsp;CEO Bryan Goldberg, who also co-founded <em>Bleacher Report</em>, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/bdg-targeting-record-profits/">then announced in May</a> that profits were soaring and the company’s cost-cutting era was behind it.</p>

 <p>By the fall, however, he was pitching the investor world on a new pivot. “We are the next generation influence company,” Goldberg <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/bdg-media-bustle-scary-mommy-nylon">told<em> Axios</em></a> last October. The idea was to turn style and clothing audience members into cash-generating influencers by giving them special access to brands. The whole thing still sounds really weird, but apparently 12,000 people applied. It’s basically the unpaid blogger network that <em>Bleacher Report</em> pioneered, but for Instagram.</p>

              <p><span>Deadpool, Marvel’s merc with a mouth who loves to spout off meta jokes and wink at the camera, is the kind of gimmick character that can come together like a spectacular, fourth-wall-breaking fireworks show or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><span>be so grating and obnoxious</span></a><span> that he can push you away from a project entirely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>, Wade Wilson can’t just hijack the whole game with his antics; he has to synergize with the established dynamics of other heroes’ tool kits and banter. As such, developer NetEase has found a ton of really smart and funny ways to slot Deadpool into the game that are additive, rather than disruptive. And yes, he drops a fair amount of fun pop culture references to media both in and out of the Marvel universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>Deadpool’s in-game abilities and behavior </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>include numerous nods to his tendency to break the fourth wall</span></a><span>, with comic-book-style panels and pop-ups often appearing around him, </span><a href="https://x.com/HoshizoraTTV/status/2012008202855203157"><span>in-character ability descriptions</span></a><span> that you can swap to the straightforward, “emotionless” descriptions written by the NetEase team for clarity’s sake if you prefer, and even the ability to have conversations with announcer Galacta.</span></p>

    <p><span>His banter with </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>’ other heroes is full of nods to pretty much every facet of the Marvel multimedia franchise. He makes references to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8EaW9rnSJNc"><i><span>Rivals</span></i><span> community leakers</span></a><span> and memes as well as to the MCU’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>fumbling multiverse saga</span></a><span>, and there’s also an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/waHFQEfGY-c"><span>“It’s Morbin’ Time!” line</span></a><span> referencing the notorious Sony</span> <span>flop </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-twitch-movie-morbing-time-nintendo-switch-1848987370"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-is-desperate-to-make-avengers-doomsday-the-biggest-event-of-2026-2000659295"><span>pretentious and self-important as Marvel has become</span></a><span> in the past 20 years as its movies have shifted pop culture, Deadpool does usually act as a reminder that someone in the writing room is paying attention to the criticism people have been levying at the franchise for years now. Even </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>taking shots at the MCU from the inside</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>But it’s not all Marvel references. It’s fitting that in a video game Deadpool would borrow lines from series like </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Super Mario</span></i><span>. There’s some stuff from other media as well, like </span><i><span>Spongebob Squarepants</span></i><span>. From the looks of it, voice actor Alejandro Saab ad-libbed several of these lines and “can’t believe” that NetEase kept them in the game. Oh, and you’ll also find some memes like “67” and “Hawk Tuah” in the mix. The “67” one is </span><a href="https://x.com/nerdyomniman/status/2011606344210792595"><span>pretty clever, at least</span></a><span>, and can’t be spammed like the one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-soldier-76-6-7-emote-season-20-release-date-2000651668"><span>another hero shooter</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY KEPT ALL OF THIS!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kathleen-kennedy-leaving-ben-solo-new-trilogy-2000660587</link>
            <guid>1408375</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kathleen Kennedy, who helped produce and create films like <em>Jurassic Park, E.T., </em>and <em>Indiana Jones,</em> is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dave-filoni-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy-2000706230">officially stepping down</a> from her role as Lucasfilm president after holding the position since George Lucas left following the Disney deal in 2012. And in a new interview with Kennedy, the longtime producer and filmmaker shared some updates on various<em> Star Wars</em> projects, and the one <em>Star Wars</em> project that left her with regrets.</p> <p>On January 15, after announcing her departure from Lucasfilm, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/kathleen-kennedy-exit-interview-1236665253/"><em>Deadline</em> posted a lengthy interview</a> with the outgoing producer and president covering a whole lot of ground. Depressingly, Kennedy seems to be excited about AI and wants to work with the tech to make new stuff. She also told the outlet that she’s been planning this exit for a few years now and hand-picked her successors, <em>Clone Wars</em> creator Dave Filoni and veteran ILM manager Lynwen Brennan. And while she’ll still be around producing future <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, including Ryan Gosling’s <em>Starfight</em>er and the upcoming <em>Mandalorian and Grogu</em> flick, it’s clear from this interview that Kennedy was tired of Disney not wanting to take more risks on projects like <em>Andor</em>.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy and an update on the Ben Solo movie</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest news to come out of this interview is Kennedy sharing the status of various<em> Star Wars</em> movie projects and<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/kathleen-kennedy-clarifies-lucasfilm-exit-star-wars-future-1236304421/"> confirming that the previously announced <em>Star Wars </em>trilogy</a> being led by screenwriter Simon Kinberg is still happening, at least for now.</p>

 <p>“<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-celebration-ashoka-trailer-rey-new-jedi-order-1850313084#:~:text=Plus%20two%20more,%2C%20%5Band%5D%20Ashoka.%E2%80%9D">[James] Mangold’s is really on the back burner</a>, as is Soderbergh’s [Ben Solo film],” Kennedy told the outlet. “I think the ones by Taika and Donald [Glover] are still somewhat alive. That’s going to really be up to the new team to figure out. Dave, I know that Dave [Filoni] and Lynwen [Brennan] are very much on board with what Simon [Kinnberg]’s doing, and that would be a new trilogy. In the timeline of things, that takes you well into 2030 plus. So that’s really what’s up next.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-trilogy-skywalker-saga-episode-10-11-12-kinbe-1851692144">It was previously reported that this new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy</a> wouldn’t be connected to the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, but it is also possible that things have changed. Kennedy makes it clear in this interview that putting together <em>Star Wars</em> movies takes many years of dedication, and a lot of directors and filmmakers aren’t willing to commit to such an undertaking. That likely explains the large number of canceled and delayed <em>Star Wars</em> movies over the last seven years or so. As for the status of Kinberg’s first film in this new trilogy, it doesn’t sound close to filming at all.</p>

 <p>“[Kinberg is] working right now.,” said Kennedy. “He wrote something that we read in August, and it was very good, but not there. We’ve pretty much upended the story, and then spent a great deal of time on the treatment, which he finished literally about four weeks ago. And it’s a very detailed treatment, like 70 pages. And so he is expected to give us something in March.”</p>

 <p>I wouldn’t get too excited about this trilogy yet. Remember that Rian Johnson, who directed <em>The Last Jedi,</em> was tapped to direct a new trilogy of films after his 2017 <em>Star Wars</em> movie was a big hit. But according to Kennedy, the negative firestorm online scared him away, and he got distracted with <em>Knives Out</em> and its sequels. So who knows if this new trilogy will happen anytime soon or ever.</p>

 <h2>Regrets and concerns about studios being too afraid of risk</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kennedy called the script for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-killed-adam-drivers-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason-2000637628">Ben Solo movie</a>, whose existence was leaked publicly by Adam Driver last year and got fans very excited, “great.” And it could still happen, according to her. “Anything’s a possibility if somebody’s willing to take a risk.” However, that seems unlikely as the longtime Lucasfilm boss explained that, at the moment, Disney and other big studios aren’t interested in taking bold swings and big risks.</p> <p>“Right now we’re in an era where companies are so risk-averse, and I get it,” said Kennedy. “I hear all the conversations. They’ve got Wall Street to please, and I get it, but I also believe that that’s what contributes to things disappearing, ultimately. I just think you have to take those chances. Everything I just reeled off to you is taking a bit of a chance because none of those filmmakers are just walking in trying to do the same old, same old. I’m excited by that, but the studio’s nervous about that, and that’s kind of where it sits at the moment.”</p> <p>And as for whether she has any regrets from her time as president of Lucasfilm, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-solo-1826489974">Kennedy listed the 2018 <em>Solo</em> spin-off movie</a> as the only one because, according to her, they tried to replace Harrison Ford, and that was always going to be a nearly impossible challenge.</p> <p>“We were so excited about that idea,” said Kennedy. “And then when you’re into something, and you realize fundamentally, conceptually, you cannot replace Han Solo, at least right now. As wonderful as Alden Ehrenreich was, and he really was good, and is a wonderful actor, we put him in an impossible situation. And once you’re in it and once you’re committed, you’ve got to carry on. I think I have a bit of regret about that, but not about the moviemaking and filmmaking. I don’t have regrets about that. I just think that conceptually, we did it too soon.”</p>
