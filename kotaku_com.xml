              <p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-show-ubisoft-plot-date-1851786489">isn’t the only hit Ubisoft blockbuster</a> getting a TV series spin-off. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-6-the-kotaku-review-1847830444"><em>Far Cry</em></a> will be adapted as well, according to a recent leak on the publisher’s website. But the psychological horror series for FX will be helmed by an unlikely individual: Rob Mac of <a href="https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540"><em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em></a> fame.</p> <p>A news post that seemingly went up early <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2YgRby0tgbIWL7K03LKN4t/far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx">on Ubisoft’s news site over the weekend</a> before being quickly deleted indicated (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">according to Reddit</a>) that a <em>Far Cry</em> show will be coming from <em>It’s Always Sunny</em>‘s home network, FX, with Mac joined by <em>Fargo</em> TV creator Noah Hawley, who also recently launched <em>Alien: Earth</em>. Hawley will be showrunner, while Mac reportedly stars in the “anthology” style<em> Far Cry</em> show.</p> <p>The FX house style is probably a good fit for the franchise, though it remains to be seen what a TV version of sneaking through outposts and blowing them up with gas tanks and RPG launchers ends up looking like. Mac isn’t a completely left-field pick either. Ubisoft has been working with him up through the cancellation of <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-mythic-quest-rob-mcelhenney-season-4-date-1851698983">Apple’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, the workplace comedy about game development created with Megan Ganz and Charlie Day.</p> <p>Ubisoft has a new <em>Far Cr</em>y sequel currently in the works, and with previous entries being best-sellers, the open-world FPS franchise is an obvious candidate for the current video game-to-TV pipeline gold rush. And unlike <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, each <em>Far Cry</em> game features completely different characters and scenarios, giving the show’s writers and producers lots of creative flexibility with how to present the loose franchise’s pillars of carving up animals for inventory upgrades and cult-leader villains.</p>

              <p>Are video game discs popping free of their spindles more often than ever before? That seems to be what some users believe. And what does Samoa Joe think about the recent<em> Battlefied 6</em> open beta? Did he like it? Oh, and everyone loves that new horror movie <em>Weapons</em>, so it’s interesting to hear that the director’s next project might be a really weird and totally fresh take on<em> Resident Evil</em>. All this news and more is featured in today’s hot and ready Morning Checkpoint!</p> <h2>What’s Up With Loose Discs In Video Game Cases?</h2> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/app.bsky.feed.post/3lvvy4i6q5226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigpnazgvm6tzssz5gsjj4yfkqgu7i2qk77wmr56nvaj5oms5lr5yi"> <p lang="en">I would love for someone to do an Investigative Journalism into why most disc-based games are just rattling around loose in their case when purchased brand new vs affixed to the spindle. This never happened until toward the end of the PS4 era, and now it's basically every game I feel?</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532?ref_src=embed">Brandon Sheffield (@brandon.insertcredit.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3lvvy4i6q5226?ref_src=embed">2025-08-08T19:24:13.437Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Have you bought a new physical video game in the last few years and noticed that the disc was rattlin’ around inside the plastic case? If so, you aren’t alone. Other people have been commenting on this phenomenon, which was brought to my attention via a BlueSky post by Necrosoft Games Director Brandon Sheffield. According to Sheffield, this has been a growing problem since around the final years of the PS4. Others chimed in, sharing that they too had bought a game and found it loose in the case. Many theories have been provided, including changes in plastic, cheaper plastics being used, and less human involvement in packing physical media. Personally, I’d say all of those play a part in games being loose in the case.</p> <p>Oddly, I’ve mostly avoided this problem when buying new movies and games, but I will admit that when pulling out a new game in 2025, those suckers just pop right out with no force. Meanwhile, I needed to use the jaws of life to pry out PS2 games back when I was younger. So something has seemingly changed, that’s for sure.</p>

 <h2>Look At These New <em>Sonic</em>-Themed Shoes</h2>  <p>These upcoming <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>-themed Puma sneakers were announced <a href="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-puma-collection-release-date/">earlier this month</a>, but somehow I didn’t see them until now via social media posts about the cool shoes. These are honestly some rad-looking sneakers, with one big exception: The face bits on each shoe representing the character the shoe is based on. I get it, Sega wants some more branding on the sneakers, but it turns these shoes into cheap-looking things you’d buy on Amazon for $10 a day before your nephew’s 12th birthday party. Anyway, these new sneakers are arriving on October 30.</p> <h2>Samoa Joe Shares His Thoughts On The<em> Battlefield 6</em> Beta</h2> <p>All of my friends played the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta over the weekend. And a lot of people I know online played, too. It seemed like everyone was playing it, including Samoa Joe. Yes, the famous wrestler and actor apparently played a lot of EA’s upcoming FPS over its open beta weekend and <a href="https://x.com/SamoaJoe/status/1954544594483318926">shared his thoughts on social media</a>, saying: “Is the new <em>Battlefield</em> kinda hitting for anyone else, or was the bar so low I’m just grateful? I’m really rooting for the former over the latter.” You are correct, Mr. Joe, the new <em>BF6</em> indeed hits.</p> <h2>Indie <em>Persona</em>-Like RPG Finally Has A Release Date</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/demonschool-launches-september-3">Necrosoft Games recently announced</a> that its upcoming game, <em>Demonschool</em>, finally has a release date. The “school life strategy RPG” arrives September 3. <em>Demonschool</em>, which looks a lot like a never-before-released Game Boy Advance port of a <em>Persona</em> game (in a good way), will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>

 <h2><em>Weapons</em> Director Says His <em>Resident Evil</em> Movie Will Be Weird</h2> <p>The biggest movie in America right now is <em>Weapons</em>, a strange horror film from writer and director Zach Cregger. And it just so happens that Cregger’s next project is likely a <em>Resident Evil</em> movie. Cregger, who also created the hit horror flick <em>Barbarian</em>, recently spoke to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/weapons-director-zach-cregger-movie-1236340007/"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em> about his video game adaptation</a> and had this to say: “[<em>Resident Evil</em> is] an original screenplay. It’s a weird story. I wrote it and I love the story. It has nothing to do with any of the other <em>Resident Evil</em> movies. If I do my job, it will feel fresh and edgy and weird.” As someone who finds all the past <em>Resident Evil</em> movies to be dumb, mostly bad action flicks, I’m totally fine with someone coming in to make an actual horror movie based on the franchise. Let’s hope Cregger nails it.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">People used cheats and wallhacks in the <em>BF6</em> beta (Don’t tell Samoa Joe)&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680"><em>Diablo IV</em> boss Rod Fergusson is leaving Blizzard and Microsoft</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633">Don’t worry, we ranked every song from Netflix’s massive hit movie <em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em></a></li> </ul>  <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>The new <em>Spider-Man</em> movie has been filming for only a few days, but Sony and Marvel already have a trailer.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY - Day One on Set" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ymmwq55sHY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

              <p>Let’s be honest, how many play a real-time strategy game for its campaign? Me. I do. It’s like a practice mode before you head into a pub stomp or, in my case, face off against the AI because I’m getting old and I can’t click nearly as fast as my <i>StarCraft 2</i> days. Thankfully, <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a bit more tactical, and it’s less about the clicks-per-second and more about overarching strategy. You’ll have plenty of time to practice said strategy, with an extensive campaign and multiple game modes on the side!</p> <h2>How long does it take to finish <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s singleplayer campaign?</h2> <p>If you’re committed to tackling the main campaign in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, which for most players will serve as an introduction to the game’s units and mechanics, like a tutorial for multiplayer and AI opponents, then expect to spend approximately 20 to 25 hours across its 19 main missions:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Showtime</li> <li aria-level="1">Peacekeeper</li> <li aria-level="1">Airbase Heist</li> <li aria-level="1">The Big Wave</li> <li aria-level="1">Tracked and Furious</li> <li aria-level="1">Blackout</li> <li aria-level="1">Papers Please</li> <li aria-level="1">We Own the Night</li> <li aria-level="1">Self Service</li> <li aria-level="1">Operation Cold Harbour</li> <li aria-level="1">Vampires!</li> <li aria-level="1">Heavy Rain</li> <li aria-level="1">Search &amp; Rescue</li> <li aria-level="1">Forbidden Waters</li> <li aria-level="1">Hunting Season</li> <li aria-level="1">With a Little Help From My Friends</li> <li aria-level="1">The Ride of the VDV</li> <li aria-level="1">Road to The Fiddler’s Green</li> <li aria-level="1">Broken Arrow</li> </ul> <h2>What to do after finishing <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s campaign</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616869" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616869"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616869">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>On top of the lengthy campaign, which we’ll consider the game’s warm up, you’ll have access to a skirmish mode against AI, a full multiplayer mode against human opponents, a scenario editor that you may craft and share…scenarios, and a lot of us will likely spend hours upon hours perfecting our units in the army customization suite.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Skirmish Mode</b>: The game’s skirmish mode pits you against AI opponents on 19 maps, with varying difficulty levels for high replayability.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Multiplayer</b>: If you’re feeling antsy and want to test your abilities online against real-life players, multiplayer matches featuring 5×5 gameplay allow your competitive side to shine through as you vie for dominance of the leaderboards.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Scenario Editor</b>: The scenario editor in <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a comprehensive toolset, identical to the mission editor used by the development team, allowing you to craft custom scenarios complete with visual scripting, cutscenes, and dialogue.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Army Customization</b>: There are currently more than 300 units in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, and over 1,500 combinations, allowing you to tailor your entire army to suit your playstyle and needs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><span>got a remastered trilogy collection in 2021</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans have been hoping and praying BioWare’s fantasy RPGs might get the same treatment. If there were ever a time to put one out, it would have been before </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>launched in 2024 and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>seemingly wrapped up</span></a><span> most of the universe’s ongoing story threads. According to ex-BioWare boss Mark Darrah, the studio was more than up for remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age: Origins</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span> in one collection and told Electronic Arts as much, but the publisher turned down the pitch.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0"><span>YouTuber MrMattyPlays sat down with Darrah</span></a><span>, who worked as executive producer on the </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> series and the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>troubled loot shooter </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i></a><span>. During the conversation, Darrah reveals that BioWare “soft-pitched” a remaster of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> games but EA turned it down, partially due to its noted dislike of remasters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“EA’s historically been—and I don’t really know why, but they’ve even said this publicly—they’re kind of against remasters,” he said. “I don’t really know why. It’s strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. So that’s part of it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, one of the bigger issues in remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> compared to </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> was that the resources to zhuzh up those games is that they’re on different engines The first two </span><i><span>DA </span></i><span>games were made on BioWare’s internal Eclipse Engine before the team transitioned to Frostbite for </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span>, whereas the first three sci-fi games are all on Unreal Engine. This meant that the technical lift would have been significantly higher for a </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>remaster than it was for </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</span></i><span>. Darrah says the project would have either required hiring a new team to work full-time learning how to use the games’ old tech, or that existing staff at BioWare would have to handle the entire thing on their own. He also says that an internal remaster within BioWare would have been the ideal scenario, but that didn’t pan out.</span></p> <p><span>The soft-pitch Darrah talks about included a sort of “rebrand” of the original games as a trilogy called </span><i><span>The Champions Trilogy</span></i><span>, referencing the three protagonists of each game. If that had come to pass, I would have written you a novel on my feelings about it, considering I think continuity is one of </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>‘s weakest aspects, and branding those games as a trilogy when it decidedly doesn’t follow through on a lot of its connective tissue would be an odd Hail Mary. But since that isn’t happening, I will bite my tongue.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, Darrah doesn’t know what the future holds for </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. He </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-studio-head-dragon-age-producer-both-leave-stu-1845802859"><span>left the company in 2020</span></a><span>, but returned as a consultant to help get </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>past the finish line. Since leaving the company, Darrah </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>has been pretty candid</span></a><span> about what he and his colleagues felt was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-development-mark-darrah-live-service-2000615972"><span>unfair treatment of the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> by management.</span></p>
