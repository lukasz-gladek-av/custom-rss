            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last night, as I browsed the Xbox Store on my Series X, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-october-2025-ninja-gaiden-grinch-price-2000633269">I spotted the newly released Grinch game, which is now available on Game Pass</a>. Curious how players were receiving the not-so-great-looking family-friendly Christmas platformer, I decided to check out the user reviews. What I stumbled into was a warzone filled with shots at Xbox‚Äôs recent price hikes and way too many people wanting to fuck the Grinch.</p> <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures</em> was a sloppy co-op platformer that had few fans and was promptly forgotten after it launched. But now it‚Äôs back and updated and is being sold as a new game with a new subtitle: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-grinch-christmas-adventures-merry-mischievous-edition/9ppjp7x77nnb"><em>Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em></a>. I‚Äôm not sure how many people were clamoring for a new version of this bleh Grinch game, but it‚Äôs here just in time for Halloween. It is also one of the first games to be added to Game Pass after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">massive price increase earlier this month</a>, which explains why so <em>many</em> user reviews for <em>TGCAM&amp;ME</em> (as the kids call it) are dunking on the subscription service.</p> <hr> <blockquote><p>‚Äú$30 A MONTH FOR THIS???? A GAME THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AWFUL 360 MOVIE TIE IN GAME?? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£‚Äù</p>  <p>‚ÄúBE ACTUALLY REAL XBOX. Awful clunky game about the grinch in the middle of october????? I AM THE SECOND REVIEW?????? 50% PRICE INCREASE. UBISOFT COLLECTION WITH 50% BOARD GAMES. I AM LEAVING THE SERVICE. THERE ARE FISH HOOKED UP TO WIRES RUNNING EVERYTHING AT THE XBOX H.Q. APPARENTLY IM SUBSCRIBED TO XBOX GAME PASS BABIES WITH DAY ONE DROPS OF THE GRINCH. UNACCEPTABLE . P.S if you dislike this review i‚Äôm automatically assuming ur a dev. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for kids‚Äù argument DOES NOT WORK AS IT IS SLOP AND WHAT PARENT IS GONNA SPEND 30 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THIS‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúBruh. You‚Äôre telling me for 30 dollars a month? I get this?‚Ä¶. Yeah, I‚Äôm glad my ultimate ends the 23rd. I got BF6 and multiplayer access all i need.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLolz. Ms wants $30 a month for this clunky ****?üëÄ‚Äù</p> <p>‚Äú$30 4 this?? Cancel Gamepass.‚Äù</p> <p>‚Äú50% price hike for the Grinch is CRAZY. If xbox is raising the prices they better start putting out games that aren‚Äôt this‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <p>While these reviews make some sense‚Äìpeople are mad about the price increase and are lashing out at being given a bad shovelware game right in the wake of it‚ÄìI can‚Äôt as easily explain why there are also so many horny reviews for this updated Grinch platformer. Seriously, what the heck is going on? Here‚Äôs just some of what I found. Be warned, a lot of this is NSFW. Oh, and the first two reviews below are the very first two reviews you‚Äôll see on Xbox and the website as of this story‚Äôs publication. Merry Christmas, kids!</p> <hr> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúGrinch took my v card. He sat me down and bounced that grussy on it.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúMy Parents Love the Grinch. My parents had a little too much egg nog and stayed up ALL night with Mr. Grinch. They said his heart grew 3 sizes! I woke up once and heard my mom yelling, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre a mean one, you‚Äôre a mean one!‚Äô They must‚Äôve had a good time, though, because I‚Äôve never seen my parents smile so much!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThe Grinch. The Grinch assaulted me in a bad area‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúGOATED. Watched this green ahh hunk o‚Äô junk bounce that mcboy grus ALL OVER max‚Äôs red rocket. Best 30 a month‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúGrinch grew 3 sizes alright. 3 sizes in my Christmas stocking stuffer if you know what im sayin 10/10 would Grinch again‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHorny. He made me wet‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI stole lakes v card. The Grinch stole Lake v card‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThis game gave me hard b0ner. The Grinch turned me on‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSomething in my pants keeps moving. While I was playing as the Grinch, a snake kept growing in my pants. I decided to put it in my mouth and it tastes like BBC!‚Äù</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, I‚Äôm not sure what else to add to all of this. I guess this is what I get for reading the user reviews on a Grinch Xbox game. My bad, everyone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-pro-plus-microsd-card-with-adapter-drops-to-just-0-07-per-gb-likely-clearing-out-stock-2000635774</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-pro-plus-microsd-card-with-adapter-drops-to-just-0-07-per-gb-likely-clearing-out-stock.1328014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of space as a creator or gamer is never ideal; it kills your momentum and affects your productivity. An easy way to make sure that never happens is to invest in a high-capacity, high-speed memory card. Right now, Amazon is offering a solid deal on one of the best in the category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD memory card plus adapter is down to $75, which is 38% off its regular price</a>. You‚Äôre saving $45 on a solution that fixes your storage problems for the long term, but the deal won‚Äôt be around for long. We suggest acting fast to grab it for less while you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Paired With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>1TB capacity is more than enough to house tons of high-resolution media content, games, important documents, programs, and so much more. You get read speeds up to 180MB/s and write speeds up to 130MB/s when used with compatible Samsung readers, meaning you won‚Äôt have to deal with frustrating wait times or an overall slow performance. If you‚Äôre using it with a GoPro or drone, these translate into smooth 4K UHD video capture and quicker burst shots. Even better, it is UHS-I, U3, V30, and A2 rated, so you can also run apps directly from the card on Android devices.</p>
<p>The included SD card plays nicely with your computer, handheld gaming console, tablet, drone, etc. Basically, if your device has a microSD or SD card slot, you‚Äôre good to go. Just note that this version isn‚Äôt compatible with the latest Nintendo Switch 2 yet.</p>



<p>The card is also built to last. It‚Äôs water, temperature, X-ray, magnet, drop, and wearout proof, so everyday wear and tear won‚Äôt affect the performance. It can handle a few splashes and drops without throwing a fit, which makes it great to take with you on the go.</p>
<p>In short, if you‚Äôre a creative, work professional, or just someone whose storage needs are growing and want a solution that won‚Äôt give up on you this is a smart pickup. The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD offers the right mix of speed, performance, and space. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">You really won‚Äôt have to deal with that ‚Äústorage full‚Äù message for a while. It is now down to $75, after a whopping $45 discount.</a> We don‚Äôt see it go for less than $100 often, so this is definitely a rare sight. Just be sure to grab it for less while you can.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Subscriptions, Microsoft Office 2021 Lifetime License (Windows and Mac) Is Almost Free With Over 80% Off]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-subscriptions-microsoft-office-2021-lifetime-license-windows-and-mac-is-almost-free-with-over-80-off-2000636222</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-subscriptions-microsoft-office-2021-lifetime-license-windows-and-mac-is-almost-free-with-over-80-off.1327951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Unless you have some crazy level of self-discipline or a truly superior bookkeeping system, you‚Äôre probably drowning in subscriptions like the rest of us. Those monthly bills are always an unpleasant surprise, so when you get a chance to ditch one for good, you take it. Here‚Äôs one to convert into a one-and-done purchase ‚Äî <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">a lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for Windows is just $40 at StackSocial.</a> You can also get the Home &amp; Business for Mac version for just $60 on the same StackSocial page.</p>
<p>Rather than deal with that monthly line in your bank statement, this one-time $40 buy gives you a lifetime license to the world‚Äôs preeminent productivity suite: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access, Publisher, and Teams. This StackSocial deal is a massive 81% markdown from the list price of $220, and more importantly, you can drop that Microsoft 365 subscription once and for all now that you own all of the apps forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Accept No Substitutes</h2>
<p>There are other apps and programs out there for all of the tasks covered by the Microsoft Office Pro 2021 suite, but if you‚Äôre looking to share important data analysis, would you even think about sending it in a format other than Excel? Or an interactive slideshow presentation in anything other than PowerPoint, or a written document that‚Äôs not in Word?</p>
<p>These Microsoft apps have been the global standard for productivity for decades now, in no small part because Microsoft is continually updating and refining them. All of those updates are included in this lifetime license deal, and they‚Äôre automatically pushed out to your computer once you‚Äôve installed and registered the suite.</p>



<h2>Easy to Install</h2>
<p>Getting your lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for WIndows or Office Home &amp; Busniness for Mac is easy. Just make the purchase on StackSocial‚Äôs site, and you‚Äôll get a download code and your license keys via email. You must redeem the code within 7 days of receiving it by downloading and installing the software and registering it using the license key. (Keep that in a safe place in case you need to reinstall the software on a new computer at some point down the road; the license is good for only 1 computer at a time.)</p>
<p>Ditching a subscription model for Microsoft Office access won‚Äôt solve all of your subscription issues, but it might be the only one you can say goodbye to with a one-time lifetime license purchase for just $40. That is, unless you wait too long and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">this sweet 81%-off deal on a lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for WIndows (or 72% off Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business for Mac) ends</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-solid-death-stranding-ai-2000636622</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-director-hideo-kojima-embraces-%E2%80%98creating-together-with-ai%E2%80%99.1327888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrated gaming auteur Hideo Kojima is making waves once again with statements about artificial intelligence. This time, sporting a bit of a new look in a recent interview, Kojima has said he sees AI as a boon that can help cut out what he describes as ‚Äútedious‚Äù tasks, helping developers to lower costs and produce games faster.</p> <p>In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/">interview with <i>Wired Japan</i></a> (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-gives-his-verdict-on-use-of-ai-in-gaming-3269428/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>), Kojima described ‚Äúa future where [he stays] one step ahead; creating together with AI,‚Äù referring to the tech as ‚Äúa friend.‚Äù Kojima presents an optimistic perspective on how the tech can be used, not necessarily to lead the creative projects, but rather to assist with mundane tasks to ‚Äúboost efficiency.‚Äù</p>

 <p>It‚Äôs not the first time Kojima has opined on AI in the industry. Previously <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-ai-important-3d-ps6-portable-space-marine-last-of-us-2000621087">he described AI</a> as potentially as significant a development for games as the shift from 2D to 3D. He also recently suggested that AI will likely be used to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/hideo-kojima-remakes-sequels-ai/">generate remakes and sequels</a>. Though the most recent statements on the potential friendliness of AI are rather optimistic, Kojima‚Äôs own creative output might have something to say about that. AI and advanced technology has often been a focal point of Kojima‚Äôs creative works, though they‚Äôve typically played an antagonistic role in his fictional worlds.</p>

 <h2>Kojima‚Äôs previous games were far from optimistic about AI</h2> <p>Kojima‚Äôs statements are disappointing for those of us concerned about the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/federal-judge-rules-copyrighted-books-are-fair-use-ai-training-rcna214766">thorny issues of copyright</a> in the context of artificial intelligence systems, the desire to <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-real-work-ai">replace human labor </a>wholesale, and the inexcusable energy consumption that‚Äôs literally setting us back in our efforts to <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">lessen the impact of climate change</a>. But they also ring dissonantly with the game developer‚Äôs own artistic output, namely <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> and <i>4</i>, which speculate not just on the dangers of artificial intelligence, but how the messiness of human history, hierarchies, and internet behavior could use (and lose control of) such highly advanced tech.</p>

  <p>Unravelling <i>MGS2</i> and other <i>MGS</i> games is messy business; like Kojima‚Äôs recent works, they‚Äôre long, dense games. But the modern embrace of AI, which is already being used to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-team-keeps-posting-ai-portraits-of-him-and-we-keep-clicking">efficiently produce propaganda</a> and which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/30/peter-thiel-palantir-threat-to-americans">folks who do not have humanity‚Äôs best interests in mind</a> are strongly encouraging, sounds a hell of a lot like what we were being warned about while the digital Colonel Campbell lost his artificial mind in <i>MGS2</i>.</p> <p>As <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-vocabulary-for-speaking-about-the-future/">Cory Doctorow once said</a>, science fiction ‚Äúis a literature that tells you how to prevent the bad tomorrows.‚Äù And while I appreciate Kojima‚Äôs optimism, I don‚Äôt think just seeing this tech ‚Äúas a friend‚Äù is going to solve the ills of the bad <i>today</i>, much less the bad tomorrow.</p>
