              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969"><i><span>Light of Motiram</span></i></a><span>, Tencent’s upcoming survival game, is the subject of a lawsuit from Sony, who calls the game a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163"><span>“slavish clone”</span></a><span> of its open-world RPG franchise </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><i><span>Horizon</span></i></a><span>. Looking at the two side-by-side, the comparison is pretty damning, it utilizes both the tribal, prehistoric aesthetic of </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>, and the roaming mechanical animals that have become synonymous with Guerrilla Games’ series. Now that Sony has served papers, Tencent is arguing that the PlayStation company is trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions, and that </span><i><span>Light of Motiram</span></i><span> looks like dozens of other games, actually.</span></p> <p><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/"><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i></a> <span>reports that Tencent has filed the motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that Sony is trying to use the power of the law to take a “well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it [the company’s] domain.”</span></p> <p><span>“Sony’s Complaint tellingly ignores these facts. Instead, it tries to transform ubiquitous genre ingredients into proprietary assets,” Tencent alleges. “By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>—like </span><i><span>Enslaved</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry: Primal</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry: New Dawn</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Outer Wilds</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Biomutant</span></i><span>, and many more—Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions.”</span></p> <p><span>You can read more about the arguments Tencent makes in </span><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i><span>’s write-up, but the summary is that the company argues that </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>isn’t as unique as Sony claims in the lawsuit. It even points to a statement made in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tLcD1r-6w"><i><span>NoClip</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>documentary</span></a><span> by Guerrilla art director Jan-Bart Van Beek indicating that the studio had its own reservations about the game’s originality, with Van Beek saying it seemed very similar in some ways to Ninja Theory’s 2010 action game </span><i><span>Enslaved</span></i><span>. Tencent also argues that the entire lawsuit is based on hypotheticals, as the game isn’t slated to launch until 2027, and thus might not look anything like </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span> by the time it launches. Tencent and </span><i><span>Light of Motiram </span></i><span>developer Polaris Quest </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tencent-sony-lawsuit-knockoff-steam-art-2000616608"><span>scrubbed the game’s Steam page</span></a><span> of images that featured a red-haired protagonist similar to Aloy from </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>last month.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-devs-difficulty-elden-ring-team-cherry-interview-2000626850</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong-devs-talk-about-why-the-game-feels-harder.1301634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> ratchets up everything from its predecessor. The world is bigger, more detailed, and more dangerous. Team Cherry co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen recently spoke about some of their thinking behind making the Metroidvania Soulslike sequel harder, and what players can do to navigate the higher difficulty.</p> <p>“Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight–so even the base level enemy had to be more complicated, more intelligent,” Gibson said during an interview at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ACMI Game Worlds</a> exhibition in Melbourne, Australia, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">according to reporting by <em>Dexerto</em></a><em>.</em> Even basic enemies in <em>Silksong</em> hit harder and can be much more aggressive. That’s because the hero Hornet is much more agile, and Team Cherry wanted to balance that out with more effective adversaries.</p> <p>“The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss,” Pellen added. “The same core set of dashing, jumping, and dashing down at you, plus we added the ability to evade and check you. In contrast to the Knight’s enemies, Hornet’s enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away.”</p>

 <h2>If you keep dying, go somewhere else</h2> <p>That was essentially what Gibson’s advice seemed to be from the interview. He argued that <em>Silksong</em> is much less controlling than its predecessor when it comes to where the player can go and explore at various points in the game.&nbsp;“The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path,” he said. “So one player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes.”</p> <p>The logic is reminiscent of <em>Elden Ring</em> which, despite its punishing enemies and brutal boss fights, was arguably more inviting than previous FromSoftware Soulslikes because the open world allowed players to approach each challenge in unique ways. In addition to being able to grind additional levels, they could also explore off the beaten path until they found a weapon or spell that would tip the balance of power in their favor.</p>

 <p>“<em>Silksong</em> has some moments of steep difficulty–but part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you’re going and what you’re doing,” Gibson said, adding that players “have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled.”</p> <h2>A clash of design philosophies</h2> <p>There was recently a mini-debate about whether <em>Silksong</em> is actually harder than<em> Elden Ring</em>. <em>The Washington Post</em>‘s Gene Park <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/1968136044471324728">came down on the side that it is</a>. I would agree, though I think that’s in part because <em>Elden Ring</em> isn’t necessarily one of the harder games out there. <em>Elden Ring</em> is just a hard game that happened to sell over 30 million copies, meaning that its reputation is partly derived from tons of people who wouldn’t normally play a Soulslike actually giving it a try.</p>

 <p>Ryan Thompson, an assistant media studies professor at Michigan State, teased out <a href="https://x.com/BardicKnowledge/status/1968171985768460778?t=q0BLt1rfRLvioKYTgAnLMg&amp;s=19">what I thought was an interesting observation</a> about one of the core differences between<em> Silksong</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. It’s not just that one is a 2D side-scroller and the other is a 3D open-world RPG; it’s also the way the roots of those genres diverge. “3D games are designed for you to win eventually,” he argues. “2D platformers are originally designed to take your quarter and tell you to piss off.”</p> <p>That’s an oversimplification, but a helpful one when it comes to a Metroidvania Soulslike like <em>Silksong</em>. As the genre name denotes, it has its feet in two related but distinct traditions. One is 8-bit action platformers of the NES era that seemed to be perfectly content if the kid they were sold to was never able to beat them. The other is a baroque RPG adventure in which the expectation is you’ll be able to level up or learn your way out of any challenge.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> is as much a 2D bullet hell game as a Metroidvania, maybe even more so. The margin for error on screen is more circumscribed than in its 3D counterparts, and its arsenal is more streamlined. It’s borrowing from <em>Castlevania III: Dracula</em>‘s<em> Curse</em> more than <em>Dark Souls</em>, and the result can be more uncompromising. That might be easier to accept if <em>Silksong</em> didn’t also tell an evocative and whimsical story that’s constantly dropping devilish obstacles in your path. But I’ll take that challenge over the original <em>Mega Man</em> any day.</p>

              <p>Our lives are dominated by long cables and fat adapters, invading our spaces creating unwanted clutter. Just about everything has a battery in it these days and requires daily charging. Your phone? Gotta plug it in. Your headphones? They used to just work, but now they’re Bluetooth so plug it in. Your watch? My old watch that just told time didn’t need it’s battery replaced for years. Now my Apple Watch needs to sit back in it’s wireless charger before I go to bed every night. Too many things need charging which means our desktops and nightstands are a tangled nightmare. Thankfully, that clutter can be reduced with a solid charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charger that right now is marked down 40%. Normally priced at $50, that $20 savings means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>This power strip combines 10 different ports all together, meaning you can charge up to 10 devices at once. You get a mix of six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. With a wide range of compatibility, you won’t have to use different charging blocks all assembled together. Just plug your devices cables directly to whichever port works. In case you do still need to use one on account of having to charge several USB devices, the power station itself is designed to allow for easy access to the AC outlets. With each facing a different direction, you won’t end up dealing with losing more than one outlet due to an extra chunky adapter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. It’s Friday Eve, also known as Thursday. The weekend is almost here. I can feel it in my bones. While we wait, here’s today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we have news about a Treyarch co-founder, a leaked <em>Yakuza</em> remake appears, Nvidia is making a big investment, and more <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> is on the way in the near future.</p> <h2>Treyarch Co-Founder Peter Tripp Akemann Sentenced To Prison And House Arrest</h2> <p>In January, Peter Tripp Akemann flew a drone into a large firefighting aircraft that was helping to stop the horrible Palisades fire in the area around Los Angeles. The damage took the aircraft out of commission for a period of time. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-piloting-drone-during-la-fires">In February, Akemann pleaded guilty</a> to the crime. <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/southern-california/public-safety/2025/09/15/culver-city-man-sentencing-crashed-drone-into-super-scooper">And on Monday, Akemann was sentenced</a> by U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald to serve 14 days in federal prison, followed by 30 days of home arrest. Akemann, who helped create the studio that is now part of Activision’s massive <em>Call of Duty</em> machine, will also have to pay around $156,000 in various fines.</p> <p>As part of a previous plea agreement, Akemann will also complete 150 hours of community service. His lawyers shared a message from the Treyarch co-founder earlier this year stating he was “deeply sorry” about damaging the aircraft and that he “accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment, and is cooperating with the government in effort to make amends.”</p>

 <h2><em>Yakuza 3</em> Remake Accidentally Leaks Online</h2> <p>It looks like<em> Yakuza 3,</em> originally released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, is getting a big ol’ remake. That’s according to a leak fans spotted earlier this week on the <em>Yakuza</em> developer’s very own website. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rgg-accidentally-leaked-that-its-working-on-yakuza-kiwami-3-211036458.html">As reported by <em>Engadget</em></a>, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios briefly listed<em> Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> alongside two previously released remakes, <em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> and <em>Yakuza Kiwami 2.</em> However,<em> Kiwami 3</em> has yet to be officially announced. Oops!</p> <p>The listing has since been scrubbed from the site, but not before fans could document it via screenshots and social media posts. Many expect this new remake to be announced at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show later this month.</p>

 <h2><em>Microsoft Flight Sim 2024</em> Reportedly The Next Xbox Game Leaping To PS5</h2> <p>If you thought Xbox was done bringing more games to PlayStation 5, well, then you probably haven’t been paying attention to the company’s activity over the last year or so. Anyway, Xbox is, <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/383315/wiemy-jaki-kolejny-ex-microsoftu-trafi-na-ps5-co-z-pudelkami-oblivion-remastered.html">according to a new report from Polish news site <em>PPE</em>,</a> porting <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> to the PS5. It’s claimed that this new port will be arriving in November of this year and will get a limited physical release. Xbox has yet to confirm, but this seems pretty likely to happen, and I expect an announcement soon.</p> <h2>Nvidia Investing $5 Billion Into Struggling Intel As Part Of Larger Partnership</h2> <p>Well, here’s something unexpected. Nvidia, one of the richest companies on the planet, is partnering with Intel, which has been struggling in recent years, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nvidia-bets-big-intel-with-5-billion-stake-chip-partnership-2025-09-18/">as part of a large deal that involves the GPU giant investing $5 billion</a>. The two companies issued a joint press release confirming the news and announced plans to work together to create “Intel x86 RTX SOCs” that will likely be used in devices like handheld PCs, laptops, and other portable electronics.</p> <p>As you might expect, this deal also includes a lot of talk about how this will help boost AI performance and move the technology forward. With this investment, Nvidia is now one of Intel’s largest shareholders. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-holds-high-stakes-meeting-with-intel-ceo-after-calling-his-resignation-2025-08-11/">Weirdly, the U.S. government is an even bigger shareholder</a> after a wild deal was struck last month, giving the United States 10 percent ownership of the chip maker.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/henry-halfhead-review-cozy-sandbox-sim-switch-2000626517"><em>Henry Halfhead</em> is a short game worth playing</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-james-channel-halo-dangerous-steel-battalion-modder-2000626530">The most dangerous Xbox has been created</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-debut-short-film-rating-netflix-2000626490"><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> is getting a new short film soon</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Hall-Of-Famer Hades Is Currently Cheaper Than A Big Mac]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hades-2-sale-disccount-cheap-switch-2-2000626832</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hades 2</em> has its long-awaited 1.0 release later this month, but if you haven’t played the first game yet, you should really start warming up with that first. Supergiant Games’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803">2020 GOTY contender</a> is currently on sale to celebrate its five-year anniversary. You can grab <em>Hades 1</em> for less than most meals on the McDonald’s menu. Your heart will be better off, too.</p> <p>The action-RPG roguelike is about the son of Hades trying to escape the underworld and reach Mount Olympus. Players have to choose between competing upgrades and survive isometric bullet-hell battles to do so. A range of weapons and buildcrafting options, combined with incredible art and rich worldbuilding, make it an all-around exceptional game. Part classic arcade beat ’em up, part engrossing visual novel, <em>Hades</em> has something for everyone. Maybe that’s why it inspired Supergiant to make its first sequel.</p> <p><em>Hades</em> is normally $25, but right now it’s 75 percent off until September 30 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hades-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOorNEZO4qZlxH5rvIgBR45p8YVScR59SD9KL2Tl8FfcUrFXtCTbS">the Switch eShop</a>. At just $6.24, it’s a steal. If you don’t already own it on Switch 2, now’s the time.</p>

 <p>Now I know what you’re thinking. Why buy<em> Hades 1</em> when <em>Hades 2</em> is just around the corner? <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-release-date-1-0-patch-switch-2-pc-early-access-2000625272">The sequel launches September 25</a> after years in Early Access and is, on the surface at least, simply more <em>Hades</em>. But it tells a completely different story, stars a hero that’s more ranged-centric than the first game’s Zagreus, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575">definitely harder overall</a>.</p> <p>Is this a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> situation? Based on my time with the Early Access version I’m not ready to say, but new players will definitely benefit from warming up in the first game and getting a feel for the flow and decision-making that comes with selecting between all of the different upgrade paths. And hell, by the time you actually finish <em>Hades 1</em>, maybe the second game will be on sale for $6.29 too.</p>
