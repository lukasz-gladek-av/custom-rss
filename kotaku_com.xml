            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is Saudi Arabia’s takeover of EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">another big-brain play</a> or a sign of desperation? Can a more generous <em>Black Ops 7</em> battle pass convince players to keep playing? What does James Cameron&nbsp;<em>really</em> think about Netflix? It’s another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>As we skid into the long holiday weekend, I’m trying to decide exactly how many <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday</a> discounted game controllers I should buy to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. Or maybe I should just stop paying my electricity bill and force them all to take up knitting instead.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia is having an Embracer moment</h2> <p>The country’s Public Investment Fund has made a bunch of bad bets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html">according to <em>The New York Times</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-savvy-games-group-s-saudi-owned-parent-fund-is-running-low-on-investable-cash"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). It reports that the sovereign wealth fund is running low on cash for new investments. You might remember one of them being a&nbsp;<a href="https://ig.ft.com/saudi-neom-line/">concept for a futuristic city</a> in the desert in the shape of one long line.</p>

 <p>This makes the fund’s massive bid to take EA private seem somewhat more desperate and precarious, given that much of it will be debt-financed at high interest rates. Embracer itself <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-saudi-arabia-dead-island-2-borderlands-deal-1850475619">once looked to the PIF to save it</a>, rapidly unraveling once a multi-billion dollar deal failed to materialize. It never recovered. We’ll see how long Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman can continue flooding the zone with oil money to whitewash the country’s human rights record.</p>

 <p>Notably, the EA Saudi deal was reportedly facilitated by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law. MBS recently visited the White House <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl">in exchange for</a> fighter jets, advanced AI chips, and god knows what else. Trump brushed off MBS’s alleged role in having a Washington Post journalist murdered a few years back as “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-asked-about-khashoggi-murder-trump-says-things-happen-and-mbs-knew-nothing-about-it">things happen</a>” and claimed his family has done “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5613866/fact-checking-trumps-claim-his-family-has-done-little-business-with-saudi-arabia">little</a>” business with the Kingdom. I guess the largest leveraged buyout of an American firm by a foreign entity is just table stakes these days.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Black Ops 7</em> battle pass will be more generous than the <em>Black Ops 6</em> one</h2> <p>You’ll still have to battle FOMO, but unlocks will come more easily. “The team has taken learnings from <i>Black Ops 6</i>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey,” the devs <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Battle-Pass">wrote in a new blog post</a>. “The result: each season’s Battle Pass in <i>Black Ops 7</i> will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.”</p>

 <p>Initial pages will be shorter, and players can earn Battle Pass Tokens from Daily Challenges including in the co-op campaign, in case you’re a <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">glutton for punishment</a>.</p> <h2>Palmer Luckey’s N64 clone is getting revealed soon</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The ModRetro M64 hardware is getting a full reveal on Black Friday – features, colors, our incredible new controller, cutting-edge <a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AMD</a> hardware, etc.</p> <p>Much has changed since we launched early bird pricing at $199 earlier this year, things like inflation, component shortages,… <a href="https://t.co/T8MLilyweh">pic.twitter.com/T8MLilyweh</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1993115525153436057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The ModRetro M64 is the arms dealer’s latest side project: an FPGA machine that plays old N64 cartridges on modern displays. Despite things like “inflation, component shortages, tariffs, and more,” the price will remain $200, which is 20 percent less than the recently launched Analogue 3D. The devil will be in the details, however. Luckey says all will be revealed on Black Friday, though a holiday 2025 release seems like a long-shot at this point.</p>

 <h2><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> gets a free update this week</h2> <p>The November 27 patch will <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1993318901262823923">add more</a> weapons, enemies, and other small features, like some fresh team-up attacks for the musou fighter’s characters.</p> <h2>Helldivers 2 is getting jungle armor and giant chainsaws</h2> <p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos Warbond</a> will go live for players on December 2. In addition to the new Contra-style kits, players will get the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool which looks like a long buzz-saw that will slice through enemies and trees alike.</p> <h2>Big Jim hates Netflix</h2> <p>The <em>Avatar 3</em> director and box office giant James Cameron had some harsh words for the streamer’s Oscar strategy <a href="https://t.co/U5tk94vdNU">in a recent interview</a>. “We’ll put the movie out for a week, we’ll put it out for 10 days; we’ll qualify for Academy Awards consideration,” he said, critiquing the company’s free-loading strategy. “See, I think that’s fundamentally rotten at the core. The Academy Awards, to me, mean nothing if they don’t mean theatrical.”</p> <p>Basically, he’s accusing Netflix of trying to draft off of the prestige of awards nominations without actually investing in theaters, all while its platform is directly undercutting the broader movie-going experience. Personally, I think Cameron could do a lot more to help theaters by releasing good movies instead of more <em>Avatar </em>sequels, but his underlying logic is unimpeachable.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-gta-5-roleplay-ice-raid-new-save-collective-2000646967">People are training for ICE raids inside <em>Fortnite</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-multiplayer-metagross-xerneas-garchomp-2000646988"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> online battles are already super boring</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/dan-houser-ai-rockstar-gtav-rdr2-absurd-ventures-2000646935">Dan Houser is not buying all of the AI hype</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/early-black-friday-deal-drops-the-seagate-4tb-external-hard-drive-by-20-but-not-for-long-2000645507</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of the year again. Early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are rolling in hot, which means you don’t really have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of top-rated items across all categories (TVs, laptops, smartphones, kitchen appliances, games) have already dropped to their lowest prices ever. Finding the right discounts that are worth your hard-earned money, however, can be a little overwhelming during such times, but that’s where we come in to help. Our shopping team is keeping an eye on the best deals around, so you don’t have to!</p>
<p>Those looking for a reliable storage solution — we have good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">Seagate just dropped its massive 4TB external hard drive by 20%, which means you can bring it home for just $100 today.</a> The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase, too. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. The deal, however, wraps up soon. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for it, but we’re not expecting it to last more than a couple of days. If you have been wanting to expand the storage of your computer or gaming console without spending a ton, now is the time to act. Grab it before the price shoots back up to $125.</p>

<h2>Stores All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>Running out of storage is never fun, and this drive is sure to take care of that issue for years to come. The storage capacity it offers is truly massive. 4TB storage means you will have space to house all your old and new data, which can include thousands of photos, hundreds of movies, years of backup, tons of research papers, an unusual number of work documents, plus all your favorite titles. And even after all of this, you will still have plenty of space left for future downloads. If you have ever been in a situation where you had to delete some of your old files to make room for new ones (like all of us), you’re going to greatly appreciate the peace of mind this brings.</p>
<p>It’s designed to work with Windows or Mac computers and select gaming consoles, with the setup being fairly straightforward. If you’re planning to use it with a Windows-based computer, you just need to plug in the power and then plug in the included USB cable. The drive should now appear in the (My) Computer/This PC and Windows Explorer/File Explorer. Using it with a Mac requires you to reformat the drive. Once that’s done, the system will detect the drive, and you can start using it.</p>



<p>This drive, despite the massive capacity it packs, is quite minimal and lightweight. It easily slides into a laptop bag without bulking things up, which makes it easier to take with you on the go when working remotely. You also don’t have to worry about losing your important data, as your purchase will include a year-long access to Seagate’s Rescue Data Recovery Services. The service connects you to a team of world-class data recovery experts, offers one in-lab data recovery attempt, and gets you an encrypted storage device containing your recovered data if recovery is successful.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">In short, if you’ve been after a reliable storage solution for your important files, the Seagate 4TB external hard drive is a great option to consider, especially now that it’s available for just $100.</a> It not only offers a massive capacity, but is compatible with a range of devices and is easy to use, as well.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/galaxy-z-flip-7-makes-zero-profit-play-samsung-sells-foldable-cheaper-than-its-own-galaxy-s25-2000647217</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-z-flip-7-makes-zero-profit-play-samsung-sells-foldable-cheaper-than-its-own-galaxy-s25.1364320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 has become the phone that style enthusiasts actively desire and creates excitement in ways that standard flagship phones simply cannot match. The <strong>compact clamshell form factor</strong> when folded delivers visual impact that surpasses even iPhone’s polished design language, and transforms phones from utilitarian tools into fashion statements.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/">$899 for the 256GB model, down from $1,099</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/">$1,019 for the 512GB version, down from $1,219</a>, both configurations have hit record-low prices on Amazon for Black Friday that undercut traditional premium flagships. This seventh-generation foldable now costs less than many conventional flagship phones and delivers Samsung’s most refined folding experience yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dual Display System</h2>
<p>The<strong> large 6.9-inch internal Dynamic AMOLED 2X display</strong> unfolds to reveal a proper smartphone screen running at 2520 x 1080 resolution with 120Hz adaptive refresh that shifts smoothly between 1Hz and 120Hz depending on the content. This primary display boasts HDR10+ for vibrant colors, going up to a peak brightness of 2600 nits that ensures perfect readability even in direct sunlight when its competitors all wash out completely. The<strong> external 4.1-inch Super AMOLED cover screen</strong> is a significant evolution from earlier tiny external screens, offering real utility for notification checking, music control, taking selfies, and running widgets without opening the phone. This cover display <strong>boasts a 1048 x 948 resolution and a matching 120Hz refresh</strong> for smooth interactions that make quick tasks possible without the unfolding ritual that earlier Flips required for everything.</p>



<p>The<strong> Samsung Exynos 2500 processor is built on an advanced 3nm manufacturing process</strong> and brings flagship performance with 10 cores that include high-performance Cortex-X5 cores reaching 3.3GHz. In practice, this processing power takes on-demand games, 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without experiencing the thermal throttling or battery drain seen by earlier foldables that tried to pack flagship specs into severely constrained thermal envelopes.</p>
<p>This <strong>includes a dual-camera system with a 50MP main sensor featuring optical stabilization and 12MP ultra-wide</strong> captures for stunning photos that easily rival traditional flagship cameras, notwithstanding the engineering constraints of fitting quality optics into a folding form factor. Meanwhile, the f/1.8 aperture lets in substantial light for excellent performance in low light, while optical stabilization ensures sharp handheld shots even in challenging conditions. The ultra-wide lens captures expansive landscapes and group photos without the distortion that ruins cheaper implementations. <strong>Video recording tops out at 4K at 60fps</strong>, with enhanced stabilization for smooth footage when walking or shooting actively.</p>



<p>A <strong>4300mAh battery capacity represents an upgrade over past generations</strong> while an efficient 3nm processor and adaptive display refresh come together to deliver all-day battery life through typical usage patterns. The 25W wired charging replenishes the battery relatively fast, though it lags some competitors that offer 65W or faster. The 15W wireless charging offers cable-free convenience, and the reverse wireless charging lets you top up the Galaxy Buds or another Qi-compatible device just by placing it on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>For less than the traditional premium phone price, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 manages to deliver unique folding design, dual 120Hz displays, flagship Exynos 2500 performance, capable cameras and all-day battery life at this record Black Friday price on Amazon. Samsung’s seventh-generation refinement eliminates the compromises that made earlier foldables feel experimental rather than practical daily drivers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-liquidates-ugreen-nexode-65w-4-port-fast-charger-almost-free-now-2000647211</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-liquidates-ugreen-nexode-65w-4-port-fast-charger-almost-free-now.1364251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modern life requires charging multiple devices at once and most homes and offices don’t have anywhere near enough outlets or good-quality chargers to keep phones, laptops, tablets, and accessories all charged up simultaneously. A compact multi-port charger consolidates the charging infrastructure into a single hub that eradicates adapter juggling and outlet competition and offers fast charging across all connected devices.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">$24, down from $39, Ugreen’s four-port Nexode 65W charger has reached a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday that suggests a zero-margin pricing that’s purely aimed at driving volume sales during the critical shopping period. This aggressive discount makes <strong>premium GaN charging technology accessible to everyone</strong> rather than remaining a luxury for tech enthusiasts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Power for Laptops</h2>
<p>The maximum <strong>65W output provides enough power to charge MacBook Air</strong>, MacBook Pro, Dell and other USB-C laptops at full speed rather than the trickle charging that lower-wattage adapters deliver. A MacBook Air reaches 51% battery in just 30 minutes when using the full 65W through a compatible cable: this makes quick charging practical during brief work breaks or morning routines.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-port configuration, including three USB-C outputs and one USB-A input</strong>, covers every device type you’re likely to carry daily without requiring multiple chargers or adapters. You can charge your laptop off one USB-C port while simultaneously powering your phone off another USB-C port, your tablet off the third USB-C port, and older accessories such as wireless earbuds or fitness trackers off the USB-A port<strong>. Intelligent power distribution</strong> automatically adjusts wattage allocation based on the requirements of the devices connected to ensure optimal charging speeds, rather than equally splitting power without regard for actual needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact dimensions of just 2.64 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches</strong> make for a charger small enough to slip into jacket pockets or laptop bag compartments without the bulk that makes larger chargers a pain to transport. This size reduction compared to traditional laptop chargers comes courtesy of GaN technology that allows higher power density in smaller packages thanks to running cooler and more efficiently than silicon-based designs. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body to avoid snagging on bag contents or causing damage to other items during transport.</p>
<p>Besides size reduction,<strong> GaN technology provides safety due to better thermal management</strong> and prevents dangerous overheating that has plagued cheap chargers with outdated component designs. Improved efficiency means less energy is converted to waste heat during operation, keeping the charger cooler during extended use while reducing fire risk. Built-in protections against overcurrent that could damage sensitive device circuits, overvoltage spikes resulting from unstable power grids, and short circuits from cable damage or debris in the ports are included.</p>



<p>This covers universal compatibility with MacBook Pro and Air, iPhone 15/16/17 series, Samsung Galaxy S24/S25, Google Pixel 9/10, iPad Pro, Steam Deck, and virtually any USB-C device compatible with Power Delivery fast charging standards. That cross-compatibility breaks the iOS versus Android divide in which you’d have to use different chargers for different ecosystems.</p>
