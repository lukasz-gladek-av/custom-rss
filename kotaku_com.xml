Let me take that back: it wasn’t <em>the </em>original version of the first <em>Star Wars </em>film to crash land in theaters in 1977. But after over more than 46 years of being locked away in a temperature-controlled tomb in England, the public will get to see the first cut, a special, extra-colorful and well-preserved “dye-transfer imbibition” print of the movie, and George Lucas likely won’t be too happy about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,194499,196842" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/star-wars-original-print-george-lucas-bfi/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/star-wars-original-print-george-lucas-bfi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British Film Institute’s Film on Film Festival</a></span> will open in June with a screening of a rare Technicolor film print of the original <em>Star Wars</em> film that was released during its initial run in Britain. While it has been released on home video, this will be the first time the public will be able to watch it in theaters since December 1978. If Lucas had it his way, the world would probably have never seen it.<br></p><p>George Lucas has been tinkering with <em>Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope </em>for years, attempting to revamp the film with additional scenes here, a new opening sequence there, and a slew of special effects changes. The first changes happened in 1981, when a new cut with the subtitle added replaced the 1977 original print. Since then, Lucas has spent decades avoiding being beholden to his first attempt at his magnum opus. Since 1997, theaters have only been permitted to screen the rejigged, updated version. To Lucas, the version the British Film Institute will be screening “is not very good,” and he won’t acknowledge its existence.</p><p>“The Special Edition, that’s the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it’s on VHS, if anybody wants it. I’m not going to spend the—we’re talking millions of dollars here—the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn’t really exist anymore,” Lucas told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-original-cut-edit-screening-george-lucas-1236191847/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-original-cut-edit-screening-george-lucas-1236191847/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>Associated Press</em></a></span> in 2004. “It’s like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I’m sorry you saw a half-completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.”</p><p>Unfortunately for him, Lucasfilm and Disney gave permission to the BFI to screen the original print of the <em>Star Wars</em> film. He may believe “a film belongs to its creator,” according to what he told the audience during his masterclass seminar at last year’s Cannes Film Festival. But, when you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-to-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-to-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sell your company</a></span> for $4 billion, you quickly learn it does not. After the two screenings at the BFI Film on Film Festival, the movie is “going straight back to the Master Film Store and those sub-zero conditions” which maintained the film’s pristine quality over the decades, according to BFI National Archive’s Senior Curator of Fiction and Programme Director of the festival James Bell.</p><p>The festival will open on June 12 in London.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And honestly, I find that even more enticing that shaving microseconds off of my best times on my favorite tracks. (OK, admittedly, I’ve not actually lost too many hours in that particular pursuit since an obsession with the N64's Koopa Troopa Beach level.) It reminds me of another gaming obsession: smashing every barrier and smashable billboard in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>.</p><p>Not playing driving games properly is a bit of a habit. And the best driving games are the ones that positively encourage it, like <em>BP</em>, and also the wonderful <em>Forza Horizon</em> games. Sure, there are races and cups and what-have-you, but what if I just drive over there? There might be a windmill! There might be yellow fencing I’ve yet to knock over.</p><p>I return to <em>Burnout Paradise</em> with a concerning frequency, almost never replaying all the races, my enthusiasm focused on smashing my way around Paradise City. It’s a passion strong enough to get past the game’s interminable opening screens and the contemptible babble of Worst Character In All Of Fiction, DJ Atomika. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, albeit without all the barriers to break, is giving me that same drive (sorry) to aimlessly explore.</p><p>The footage shows <em>so</em> much stuff to find out there! All those pads to jump off, blocks to bop, blue P switches to trigger, and then coins and who knows what else. It’s going to be just so much fun to veer away from the races and uncover the secrets. Or just pootle about, nudging at the edges, seeing if I can break the boundaries, and approach the kart racer like a third-person action game.</p><p>It’d be nice if it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">didn’t cost such an absurd amount of money</a></span>, although I’ve been fortunate enough to pre-order the bundled version (the magic of being a foreigner to your shores). I really hate that. I don’t care for any of the half-assed arguments about “worth” and “value”—I just hate that it means the game and all the joy it looks like it could offer will be cut off from so many more people.</p><p>Privileged as I am, I’m now far more hyped for this than I was before, my hopes of an open-world game beyond the racing seemingly validated. And then the racing on top of that, too! It’s fun to be <em>this</em> pumped for the ninth entry in an ongoing franchise.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s unclear if Norrin will show up in <em>First Steps</em>, or if the Marvel Cinematic Universe is playing with the character’s backstory. Either way, the Silver Surfer is the “herald” of Galactus, who marks Earth for destruction before the big guy shows up to do his thing. We see her confronting the Fantastic Four, and her arrival sends the public into a frenzy. Everyone is looking to the heroes for answers and reassurance, and Mister Fantastic straight-up tells them that shit looks bleak. All of this is happening as the Fantastic Four is expecting a new addition, as Sue Storm is pregnant, and an incoming apocalypse is not an ideal situation to bring a baby into.</p><p>Check out the trailer below:</p><p>All four members of the Fantastic Four are confirmed to star in the upcoming <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, as each actor was featured in Marvel’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474">obnoxiously long casting reveal last month</a></span>.
