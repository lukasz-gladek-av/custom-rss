              <p><em>Puzzle Quest</em>, the match-3 RPG that invented the genre and arguably defines it to this day, is finally receiving the love and care it deserves. For the first time, the game—along with its many additions—is getting a remaster, boosted to HD, and released to run properly on your personal favorite gaming platform. Even better, it’s out as soon as September 18!</p> <p>In 2007, when Steam was just a tiny baby, a match-3 RPG sprang out of nowhere.&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, by developers Infinite Interactive, casually invented an entire new genre, and immediately did it better than anyone else ever would. It was an early smash hit on Steam, walking through the door PopCap had opened just months earlier with&nbsp;<em>Peggle</em>. And wow, it was great.</p> <p>Of course match-3 games were already a big deal. PopCap’s&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em> had taken care of that years earlier, following the path from <em>Tetris</em> to&nbsp;<em>Dr. Mario</em> to&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Bobble</em>. 1994 Russian DOS game <em>Shariki</em> takes the title of the first true match-3 game, but it was 2001’s&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em> that brought the concept into the mainstream, followed by the likes of the blissfully wonderful&nbsp;<em>Zoo Keeper</em> on DS in 2003. So by 2007, still long before King’s <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-to-play-instead-of-candy-crush-saga">would ruin&nbsp;everything</a> with its free-to-play shenanigans, a billion&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled&nbsp;</em>clones meant match-3 was everywhere. It only took a genius to say, “Yes, but what if it were an RPG?”</p>

 <p>That’s&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, where the matching of the three becomes an aggressive act, used to attack your computer opponent with spells and wallops, while collecting treasure and just generally feeling a zen marvelousness. In between each match, you moved around a properly RPG-like map, talked to <em>D&amp;D</em>-like characters, and were told a story that gave meaning and purpose to your puzzling. This was largely thanks to the <em>Warlords</em> setting, introduced in 1989 with the eponymous <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6845/warlords/"><em>Warlords</em></a> which was created by <em>Puzzle Quest </em>lead Steve Fawkner. These elements together made <em>Puzzle Quest </em>something splendid, and best of all, it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12500/PuzzleQuest_Challenge_of_the_Warlords/">can still be bought and played today</a>. (Should Steam ever recover from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, anyway.) But man, it looks like a stray dog some 18 years later, which is why I’m so damned delighted about the reveal of&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Immortal Edition</em>.</p>  <p>This new revision includes the game’s 2008 expansion <em>Revenge of the Plague Lords</em>, as well as the new content that was created for the 2019 Switch port,&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: The Legend Returns</em>. On top of that, there’s a new class being added, and the mysterious addition of “much more.” And gosh, it looks so shiny and new, and yet as wonderfully cluttered as it always was. This is being developed by Infinity Plus Two, the rebrand of the original Infinity Interactive that appeared in 2019, presumably with Steve Fawkner still at the helm.</p>

 <p>Best of all, this is proper old-fashioned match-3 gaming, without all the microtransaction bullshit and ad-fueled misery that dominates the genre today. Infinity also created the extraordinary&nbsp;<em>Gems of War</em>, a live-service re-imagining of the same format that’s still receiving huge updates and new content ten years after its launch. My 10-year-old recently became astonishingly obsessed with it, and plays at a level I cannot fathom, but that comes with the constant disappointment of my refusing to pay for all three of its simultaneous battle passes every month, let alone the eight trillion “offers” it pops up with as you’re playing. (I do pay for one battle pass, I’m not a monster.)</p> <p>Of course&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em> went on to receive its own sequels, including numbered follow-ups&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3 </em>and&nbsp;a sci-fi version called <em>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</em>, as well as the F2P-riddled <em>Marvel Puzzle Quest</em> developed by Demiurge Studios. There was even a&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering – Puzzle Quest</em>, although I admit I’d never heard of that one until researching for this article. It’d be lovely to see&nbsp;<em>PQ 2 </em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, and perhaps even&nbsp;<em>Galactrix</em> getting the same treatment soon. Let’s hope this first game’s rebirth is enough of a success. It’s coming out on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and X/S, Switch and PC (no word on a mobile version yet), so there are plenty of ways to play it come September 18.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-star-lego-set-big-1000-expensive-leak-images-star-wars-2000616943">After rumors and leaks</a>, Lego has officially released all the information on its upcoming Death Star diorama set. And yes, the rumors are true, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Lego’s next big<em> Star Wars</em></a> set will cost an eye-watering $1,000, making it the most expensive set in the company’s history when it goes on sale in October.</p> <p>Officially known as (<em>deep breath</em>)&nbsp;the<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/death-star-75419?cmp=REF-202509-Death_Star_Laun"> LEGO® <em>Star Wars</em>™ Death Star™ – Ultimate Collector Series (75419)</a>, this new Death Star set is nearly 2 feet tall and over a foot wide. The big diorama contains over 9,000 Lego pieces and an astonishing 38 <em>Star Wars</em> minifigs. Yowza, that’s a lot of characters! Lego even tossed in a Stormtrooper wearing swimtrunks <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2025/september/lego-star-wars-unveils-the-ultimate-death-star-set#:~:text=As%20a%20playful%20nod%20to%20the%20LEGO%20Star%20Wars%20video%20games%2C%20the%20set%20also%20includes%20a%20stormtrooper%20minifigure%20in%20a%20hot%20tub.">as a nod to the <em>Lego Star Wars</em> games</a> and the famous hot tub Easter Egg. Other characters include Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Wulf Yularen, The Emperor, and various versions of Luke Skywalker.</p> <figure><figcaption>Lego / Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p>The large set contains multiple rooms that are each based on moments from the movies. It is a bit weird to see the famous trash compactor scene from <em>A New Hope</em> recreated in the same Death Star build that features Luke and Darth Vader fighting in the throne room from<em> Return of the Jedi</em>. I’ll just ignore these discrepancies and enjoy the massive set for what it is: A cool assortment of famous <em>Star Wars</em> moments contained inside a very expensive collection of plastic bricks.</p>

 <p>If you want to buy the Lego Death Star set, well first off, you’ll need $1,000. Once you have that, congrats. If you are a Lego Insider member, you’ll be able to order the Death Star set starting on October 1. Everyone else has to wait until October 4. And if you buy the set before October 8, you’ll get a Lego <em>Star Wars</em> TIE Fighter set as an additional gift with purchase. The TIE Fighter can be built and slotted into the Death Star set.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-tie-bomber-2023-review-75347-minifigs-1849950293">I’m a big<em> Star Wars</em> nerd and Lego sicko</a>, but I won’t be buying the Death Star set because I can’t in good conscience spend that much money on a single Lego set. I have too many other problems and things in my life that I could use that money on instead. Still, I’ll be curious to see how well this Death Star set sells in October. $1,000 is a hefty price tag and this set seems like Lego testing just how much money they can squeeze from collectors and fans using the power of nostalgia and exclusive minifigs. If it succeeds, I expect a few more $1,000 sets in the future.</p>
